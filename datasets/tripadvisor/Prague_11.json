There is plenty to do and see - not just animals, there are cool playgrounds and attractions to take a break. Regarding food - there is a lot of typical junk food as is usual at places like this (hot dogs, fries, sausage etc.) but at the observation tower there is a fast food restaurant where the food was actually really tasty, at least for a ZOO fast food. There were even some (almost) healthy, or at least healthier choices. Don't miss the seal show. it was very nice, kids loved it. Take cash, there is ATM at the main entrance and most of the attractions (cable car, pony riding, restaurants... etc.) do not accept credit cards."

My 3 year old son absolutely loved the place. The zoo is divided into multiple pavilions - one for penguins, one for African animals, one for Indonesian animals, one for reptiles and so on. Ask for a map when you buy the ticket. And decide beforehand what you want to cover - this will save a lot of time. We did everything and took us 6 hours (including lunch and cafe breaks). Kids have a 50% discount on Monday so that might be a good option if you have kids. If you don't, may be you can avoid Mondays as the zoo will be full of kids from multiple school trips. Also there is lot of walking involved, sometimes uphill - so be prepared for it. There is also a cable car that lets you get to the other side of the zoo quickly (but you will miss few pavilions along way). It was not functional when we visited."

Some of them you can meet at the alleys, others are freely inhabiting spacious open areas. This time we saw the baby elephant (just 3 days old) and the diving hippo. The jungle exhibition is also quite attractive. If you have one day - surely spend it there! Even if you do not have kids - you will not regret time spent at the Prague zoo."

One pavillion had fruit bats flying freely around the visitors heads including my own. An asian baby Elephant was born at the Zoo yesterday and we got to see it. The animals all looked healthy and had impressive habitats and space. Good visitor facilities with plenty of rest rooms and places to grab snacks or meals. Reasonably priced entrance fee of 200 Cz Kc = to $8 US per adult plus 100 Cz Kc parking. We will be back again."

We felt the signage was a little difficult as it wasn't in English, but they had corresponding pictures so you could work it out. It's s great zoo for kids with plenty for them to do and plenty of restaurants and bathrooms along the way. It's about a 20-30 minute drive from the town centre so we caught a taxi. You can't hail a taxi in Prague so you have to ask the information people to call one for you to get back or you can catch a bus if you're game.My only concert with the zoo were a number of larger animals did not have enough room and were clearly bored. One elephant spent eight hours swaying back and forward in the one spot alone on concrete surrounded by steel bars which I found very sad. However, they do have a number of breeding programs and they release back into the wild. All in all a great day."

If you can definetly avoid sathurday as the amount of people going there is incredible - in any kind of inside terarium or passage you ll have to wait for a while. As well small toddlers can not see most animals at all from the pushchair or even standing around since the fences are too high in many places and people who also have small kids in many cases are not taking care to remove the pushcair, and often for quite long blocking the view so the small ones can not see anything. Apart from that amazing experience- amount of animals is really impressive and also their living space is very nicely decorated. You can really have a beautiful walk there and see a lot."

Had a good long dayout at the zoo.Metro and then tranferred to zoo bus to/from the zoo which was pretty unpleasant as it was SO crammed on the bus but as its only 15mins (ish) so you can live with it. Wish id opted for the zoo boatride as it turned out they picked up right near my hotel. The zoo itself is HUGE (arguably too big) with alot of walking to do between some enclosures, feels more like a big woodland park full of dog walkers in places. The signage/directions are pretty basic and its easy to miss things (we didnt buy a map) but overall it has everything you could wish to see (aslong as you can find it). We spent about 5/6 hours exploring all of it on a sunny day and it was tiring but overall rewarding. The elephants, polar bears and the gorillas were real highlights. Would recommend anyone visiting Prague visits the zoo!"

The zoo is also reasonable at 200ck for an adult. We didn't have much of a wait to get in and the zoo grounds are lovely. All the animals were out and about and easy too see, especially with many enclosures having glass walls - the tigers and polar bears are a must see!There could be more food oulets throughout the zoo. All were very busy and we waited around 20-30 minutes at a kiosk for a hotdog! Overall, a great zoo and I would definitely recommend."

Drink vending machines everywhere which is great on a hot day. Well priced for an attraction. Great seating areas to eat. It is set on a hillside so be prepared to walk. Only problem I had was seeing one particular segregated elephant swaying which I know is their way of conveying distress, whether current or past leading to this learnt behaviour.

We were a family group including our two young grandchildren and their parents who reside in Prague. It was a fun family day out but also of great interest to the wildlife enthusiast. They specialize in keeping the rarer species and contributing to international conservation efforts. In particular they have had a significant role in the conservation of Przwalki's horse, the last remaining species of truly wild horse.Each exhibit is designed foremost for the welfare of the inmates but also to facilitate the viewer. The landscaping is superb and makes creative use of the natural topography of the 60 hectare site. The catering facilities are numerous and of a high standard. Coming from the euro zone admission charges were really reasonable. Don't miss this world class attraction if you live in or are visiting Prague!"

Contrary to views that animals suffer there, most Zoos I have visited work really hard towards protecting endangered species and are caring for the animals with love and passion. And by all means Prague Zoo is in that aspect the best I have ever seen!Apart from that it's really cheap - accessible to locals and a treat to tourists. Souvenirs, food, buggy rides - all very good value (ice cream about 50p a scoop!)There are LOTS of animal species, the whole zoo is clean, enclosures are spacious and well maintained and the animals do not appear stressed. Years ago I once visited in the winter (and I believe it was also after the huge floods that destroyed the zoo) and we have seen elephants in small indoor enclosures which was not pretty - I am glad it was obviously a temporary measure!So much to do for kids of all ages - numerous playgrounds, climbing frames, chair lift, paddling pool...you can even take a boat trip from town centre straight to the zoo.I would advise to arrive asap in the morning - especially during weekends and school holidays it gets pretty busy! And plan to stay the whole day - you won't want to leave."

I have to say though, with this zoo trying it's best to recreate the conditions of an animal's choice of habitat, I find myself thinking that for the preservation of certain species this kind of healthy eco-system created by Zoo Praha is necessary. The animals are given good amounts of space to roam around. The Billy goats have a whole cliff face to themselves and much more. I did however dislike the use of electric fencing. Which is present in most enclosures."

Nice day out and a huge place, easy to find take the number 12 tram, then change after about 10 stops onto the number 112 bus for about 7 stops, drops you right outside the entrance. 600 czk to enter pp and 5czk for a map. We covered all of the zoo in 6 hours and was a nice day out. Most of the animals are kept in reasonable enclosures except some of the cat family and the polar bears who do not have a large area to swim in. It was a hot day so some of the animals were not active but we did see them all, alot of the animals had just recently given birth so all the new arrrivals were cute to look at especially the baby elephant and the baby giraffe. There are plenty of cafes and vending machines around the zoo but not all the vending machines work properly. There is a chair lift in the middle of the zoo to transport you from the high level to the lower level or vice versa which Is quirky but we walked around the whole zoo on foot. Most of the animals have information boards and feeding times outside their enclosures and information on the new arrivals. Some of the exhibits are also indoors so a relief to get in out of the sun and heat. Well worth a visit especially if you have young children."

More importantly all animals seen to be subject to the highest level of care as evidenced by there healthy and happy look. Most animals were actively playing, in their topically very large, enclosures. Every effort seems to have been made to ensure an enclosure as close to the natural habitat as possible is provided. Standouts being the african Savanah animals having around 3 acres of space with all the herbivores in there together. Secondly, the mountain goats had a 50 meter high rocky cliff face that was approximately one hundred meters long allowing them to climb up and down a they pleased.

Even though the summer weather was quite warm, that did not stop my lover and I from visiting the \"jungle!\" I was really looking forward to seeing the lions and tigers, but during this visit I was captivated by the monkeys and apes. The zoo has enough attractions to keep a family occupied all day and even has a lift to take people to the \"higher\" part of the zoo. If you get there at the right time, you can watch how the animals are fed. The only downside for this last trip was the polar bear; who was sleeping lazily and looked mightily uncomfortable. His cage also looked like it could use a good \"cleaning.\" However, everything else was perfect. As a photographer, I love the chance to take my camera and practice my skill. The only major challenge are the fingerprints on the glass, but with the right patience and angle, even those can be avoided."

Beautiful landscapes and from the top you get a glorious view of Prague landscape. Great selection of animals, we especially loved the giraffe/Sahara exhibit. Good prices for food and great ice cream. Definitely bring good walking shoes and pace yourself. We spent close to 7 hours here (we walked pretty slow and took our time) and there was still a few exhibits we didn't catch. Definitely good for a day trip. Hope to go back again sometime."

It's a good sized zoo that's very well planned so that you can meander your way through the zoo and see everything without having to spend too much time looking at the map. My personal favorite is the penguins, but there are amazing animals for all types of animal lovers! Plus, they have good food stands, plenty of pivo and it's quite easy to get to from wherever you are in Prague! I'd recommend spending at least 3-4 hours here if you want to see everything, especially during the non-summer months when it closes relatively early. Getting to the zoo is really easy as well. You can take the metro and then a bus directly to the entrance, or you can take a nice bike ride or walk across the river from Stromovka Park, through a beautiful estate right to the park as well!"

Very reasonable entry prices, probably one-third the price of London Zoo for example. A few pence extra for a map, which - like every other zoo I've ever been to! - is rather vague.The animals are in superb enclosures, very large with a lot of variety. This means the whole zoo covers a large area and there's a fair bit of walking involved. Loved seeing the baby elephant, the spoonbills, the tapirs, the spider monkeys. But the polar bears... they have a pool separated only by 1cm of perspex from the visitors, and they swim right up to it - a real thrill!Lots of zoos and tourist attractions have extortionate prices for food and drink ... but not so, in Prague. Lots of cafes and kiosks, tasty foods and inexpensive drinks.Prague Zoo claims it's \"the fourth best zoo in the world\" - I haven't been to every zoo in the world, but this one is excellent. Got there early in the day, stayed seven hours, will quite happily go back again soon."

I would recommend buying a map once you're in the zoo, as it is massive and has lots and lots of animals to see. Which brings me to my next point. The shear number of animals and species there is incredible , all the animals have good viewing places and the zoo also holds feeding sessions throughout the day, I am unsure on the exact animal or if they change day to day. Some exhibits have English information to read however not all. However this is not a complaint at all as we are in Czech. There are lots of places to buy food and drink throughout the day, the places we went was all reasonably priced and not over priced at all. We didn't actually have time to see all the animals in one day due to the size and quantity of animals. Overall loved the day out would definitely recommend"

There is an incredible range of animals, from old favourites to rarer species, all of which are well looked after with naturally assimilated habitats.My favourite animals were the honey badger, bats and gharials, which I could have watched for hours. The feline house and gorilla enclosures were very busy however, so I'd recommend checking these out early or late in the day. All talks and shows are conducted in Czech, so unless you speak the language, it's best to discover the zoo for yourself.Do bring comfortable clothing however, as due to the size and multiple levels of the zoo, you will have plenty of walking to do you plan on seeing it all. At a medium pace, my partner and I managed to do so in about 8 hours and came away with loads of amazing photos and memories.The admission, shops and restaurants are all cheap, however make sure you purchase one of the maps when getting tickets, as they are not included in the entrance fee. The zoo is based out of the city centre as well, but easily accessible using a combination of public transport, notably trams and buses. The best thing to do is pay for 90 minute ticket each way, which covers all transfers and leaves you plenty of time to make connections.If you're in the city for a week and are looking to take a break from all the history and architecture, then I could not recommend a visit to Prague Zoo enough!"

You can also visit the place in the evening. Some of the houses won't be open then, but otherwise the place is open until 21.00.Something that I always wish at the zoo, that people wouldn't use flashlight when photographing and the workers would tell people not to do that more often."

Ok, I'm a huge fan of Zoo Opole (Poland), but this zoo just knocked me to my knees, especially Max the cutest baby elephant ever.First of all, the original ZOO PRICE FOR ADULT IS 200 CZK = \u20ac 7.3 = \u00a3 6.4 = $ 8.4, so please be careful with offers that ask for 4x this price. To get to the zoo (outskirts of Prague) you can go by taxi, metro + bus or use steamer boat (all infos on zoo website in Czech, English, Russian, Chinese).The zoo is huge (good for a whole day trip), very well kept, unusually clean and what's most important, you don't have to imagine natural environments of animals you see. The zoo stays as true as possible to the original habitats of its animals (Valley of Elephants, huge Giraffes enclosure with binoculars installed, or nearly vertical rocky wall inhabited by \"goats\"). The best thing is, that I don't remember any fence, wall or glass that limited the visibility. The other thing that I love about this zoo, is that it cares for animals' privacy. If they have enough noisy people or flashes from the cameras, they can just leave and not be bothered in other parts of their home. This zoo is about animals' well-being and not tourists' whims. There are restaurants and food-kiosks. You can have a beer or ten, seating on a picnic table, watching you kids playing in a sandbox. There are few gift shops with stuffed animals, clothes and other souvenirs.For those with sense of adventure or not so kin on walking, the zoo provided a chair-line to the higher part of the object.Personally I advise to visit elephants at 10am (not in the pavilion but next to Gulab Restaurant) and have fun watching their youngest Max playing with hay and his \"cousin\" Sita. To see what I mean, you can check them on 8 livestream cameras on zoo website.So while visiting wonders of Prague, don't forget to plan one day trip to this amazing zoo, you won't regret it. Have fun (I know you will). ;-)"

The enclosures were a good size and with plenty of natural features. We stayed for five hours and would've stayed longer but for my knee giving out due to all the hills. Speaking of which, the paths are good quality and there are plenty of sitting areas, kids play areas and cafes to stop at, but there are still a lot of hills to walk. The cafes are low priced and the food's fine; we paid around \u00a34 each for a drink and a panini. There's also lots of drinks machines around where you can pick up a bottle of water for about 70p. And we enjoyed the cable cars, though the guys managing it are a little brusque. I believe what I'm trying to say is: if you're going to Prague, the zoo is a must!"

Like many things in Prague it is exceptional value - only 200 CZK (\u00a36) for adult entry. Built on a series of terraces there is a lot of ground to cover so pace yourself. The views over the city from the upper levels are amazing. Far too many highlights in the animal kingdom to name them all but a few stand outs were the elephants, gorillas and penguins. There is a chair lift to the upper heights if you wish to save your legs or a little paddy train. There are plenty of places for refreshment breaks and again prices are very good. We took our own food and there are many areas where you can sit for your picnic.It is very easy to spend upwards of 4 hours here to do the place justice.

Per day) but with urban bus lines. The garden is not very common, distances between cages are large animals such generous and tourists must travel long distances to see them. Classical approach has not been respected in the sense that animals are not organized by species but after the place of origin. You will find it in more places tigers, lions, snakes, lizards, because exposure areas are arranged according to the ecosystems in which they arise. One day in August 2016 an electronic billboard to announce that that day had been registered almost 6000 visitors. I highly recommend this aim especially for families with children."

A long queue which moved quickly and we were in. Work out at only \u00a36 each! Top tip: purchase a map! The place is huge!!! Beautiful animals in amazing enclosures. Wonderfully set out, just incredible. They even have polar bears!!!We spent a good 4 hours there and could have spent even more time. Lots of reasonably priced food and drinks available throughout the zoo which was very convenient on a hot day. Just go and see for yourselves! Well done Prague Zoo."

            "review": "Excellent and improving, worth to visit. And do not forget Botanical garden few steps away.. The Prague Zoo is almost one hundred years old and profits of excellent selection of place,at Troja, off the center, on the border of the river and with a good possibility to grow. It is evaluated as one of the 5 best in the world with almost 1,5 million visitors a year. It is large \u2013 takes a minimum of 4-5 hours to walk through. There are almost 5000 animals of almost 700 species, 58 hectars - I recommend good tourist shoes, you will walk a lot. You can come with your pets on a leash (and a lot of bowls with water are ready for them). Playing activities for children are ruch, offers also contests for kids, a speciality are night visits with a guide. Use google streetview for visiting online. Children love it as the animals are in good condition (often breeding here, incl. elephants and gorillas) and you can observe them the whole year round (mostly outside, giraffes sometimes run in snow) or inside in pavillons. I still remember how much less developed it was when I was a boy, animals mostly in cages, no open space like now, but who cares. Zoo offers reasonable prices for food and drinks of OK quality. And be aware, that few steps from this place is a Botanical Garden with more than 20 hectars and thousands of plants worth to visit - I like the japan garden inside and wineries on the slope of the hill (tasting possible with a nice view of Prague). Part of it is a large greenhouse (1750 square m). of tropic flora and some fauna. Altogether a whole day, but worth to visit. Use public transport, car parking, or walking cross the bridge (my favorite way and recommendation). During the summer it is better to book onlne in advance."

Never mind if you are young or old, traveling with kids or with your second half, Prague Zoo is a place to go, and when you go, plan to stay at least 5 hours. Its not only about animals, and trust me, there are great number of them. Its also about how people of Prague made their Zoo. It great and beautiful, large if I may add, place. Me and my girl were walking and after 90 minutes we looked at a map to see where we are within the ZOO, only to find out we walked 1/4 of entire place. Also a lot of places to refresh and eat, a lot of toilets, so no worries there. What you can to before you go is to try and find out at what time there are special shows. When I say special show I mean with animals performing. They said its for kinds, but at my 33 years I had a great time also :) If you can manage to see them, than organize it. Reaching ZOO is also easy. One metro line and a bus from city center. Metro line C and bus 112, maybe even with tram number 17. Never the less you have a lot of tourist info, were we got a free map and they explained how to reach it. When you get there also buy a ticket that costs 300 or 350 CZK (cant remember how much). With that you can enter the ZOO, Botanical garden and one...well they call it castle I would say villa. And yes, one more thing. Don t go on Mondays. Fata Morgana (part of botanical garden) does not work on Mondays (at least it did not work in August) and not seeing it would be a big mistake. Also, since ZOO and Troya castle work until 19:00 I suggest you go in the morning, first see the ZOO, then Botanical Garden and then the castle."

The only reason I gave it a 3 star is because some animals are not meant to be kept in this weather in Prague! I am referring to polar bears!! They are not meant to live in the weather here or to be caged the way they are. They have a small-time pool where 1 of the polar bears kept swimming back and forth cz of the heat. The other polar bear tried to snuggle next to a chunk of ice to keep itself cool in this heat."

Zoo path goes up the hill but as an alternative there is also a small cable car (however, you pay for it, 25 CZK). Entrance to the Zoo is 200 CZK for adults, you can pay by card. The feel you have is that animals are well cared of and have sufficient space to live. Several cafes serve hungry and thirsty visitors and toilets are in sufficient number and clean. You can come by bus 112, at peak hours on weekend they are as frequent as every 5 minutes!

Theres so many animals there i didnt even get to see them all and i was there for a good few hours. Staff were friendly and helpful.As we were there in January not all animals where on show, but whats great is that even though we couldn't see some of the animals outside you were still able to see some inside, like the elephants and giraffes.What i cant get over is how cheap it is to get in! cost us the equivalent of about \u00a35 each so 11/10 for price. We didnt eat there, but its a zoo so dont expect any Gordon Ramsey style cuisine. The layout of the zoo is great and theres always something new and different about each section. Only downside was that the viewing tower at the end of the zoo was closed due to it being winter, but thats completely understandable.

Was a busy day (especially by the gorillas, may be best to try and get a glimpse at a quieter time) lots of souvenir stops and toilet stops, also plenty of drinks and food places. Taxis wait outside but do charge more than you'd think so perhaps look into alternate transport back to the centre. The giraffes and elephants were beautiful, really fun day out!"

There is a difference in height where a fun factor was added: the chairlift! For only 50 cr or 1 euro u can go up and down.Many lovely animals with good facilities for animals and visitors as well. You can see they are taking care of everything. The Giraffes and elephants have beautiful places but the tigers 'home' is a bit small. According to me today they were nervous walking back and forth.Entrance is only 200 CR which makes it a great place to go when in Prague. Its easy to get here via subway and bus but also taking a walk from the subway is very nice to see a different part of Prague."

The themed areas like the rain forest are spectacular.Information is in many languages. Animal welfare and conservation is clearly important. (Though the polar bears and tigers looked bored) Admission is reasonable as is food and drink (unlike British zoos) Words of warning-the place is huge and on many levels. Get to the top and work down. Paths are sometimes not level, especially in the darker indoor areas, so may not be wheelchair friendly."

So my husband and I gave it a go. Was happily surprised. Very big zoo. Plenty of room for the animals. Good variation of them as well. Good enclosures that were spacious. You can even pay an extra admission to bring your dog along. We had a very nice afternoon. Would recommend going if you have a free afternoon on your visit to Prague."

He was hilarious and played us some crazy 80s music. Do recommend!"

While they have fantastic large enclosures for vultures, elephants, giraffes, zebra, wolves; they also have a lemur exhibit where you can be with the lemurs in their exhibit - this is the first impression - awesome. The true highlight of this zoo is 3 Amur Leopards. The rarest cat in the world had 2 Cubs. For sure a do not miss. This is the model that all zoos should follow. TONs of play areas for kids that need to blow off energy, tram rides around the zoo, a chairlift to get from one end to the other, workers constantly cleaning, almost no zoo smell. Simply amazingAll of the animals looked very well cared for and happy. Two polar bears playing and smiling in their large exhibit. A baby elephant playing with the herd. List amazing. Great job!"

The zoo is set in a hill so be prepared for plenty of hills. There is a fun chairlift and a tree top viewpoint. Great selection of animals in a well maintained zoo. Gorillas a highlight for us. Polar bear enclosure was only one I thought should have been bigger for these magnificent animals. Walked back into town through a lively park before picking up the tram back into town."

I have been in different zoos in Europe with my Family (in Finland, Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Holland etc) and I wasn't expecting that much from this zoo. But it was more than I or anybody in my family expected.The overall area of the zoo is very large and even if we spent more than three hours at the zoo we didn't have the time to explore it completely. There is much to see at the zoo and also playing grounds for the children, pony rides and other activities. We were expecting that the animal enclosures would be smaller than in the other European zoos but we were wrong. For the most part the enclosures were comparable to other European zoos. The animals were also quite active.The one place where we especially spent some time was the elephant area and the giraffe area next to it. Both of them had a large number of animals and also good places to photograph them.If you're visiting the zoo then you should also visit the wooden observation tower at the hill. But not that the tower is closed for safety reasons during the winter time.The only challenge that we had in the zoo was that in the cafeterias the menus were only in Czech and not in English. This made the ordering of the food somewhat challenging but we still succeeded.. :)"

My 4 years old son was also impressed! And - price is much more affordable than in Berlin's Zoo. In Berlin we left about 50 Eur for 2 tickets for adults an 1 ticket for child (with Aquarium).

I could list all the reasons why I love Prague Zoo, but that would take far too long, so I'll just describe a few of my favourite exhibits.Near the entrance of the zoo we saw polar bears that were enjoying a nice swim on a hot day (so hot in fact that I suffered from heat stroke that evening). The more energetic of the two was swimming right up to the glass and showing off for all the tourists. Best bear ever. Later in the day we returned to see how they were doing and they were having a dander around their enclosure. Seems like a good life.My next favourite exhibit was the elephant enclosure. This featured a whole family of elephants of all ages. You could see the different personalities coming out as the littlest one was chasing around its older brother, while the adults were gracefully cooling off from the afternoon heat in the shade. There were various elephant related activities on offer including a elephant riding simulator. The highlight of the elephant enclosure for me was the raised bridge section which allowed for a better view of their habitat and also doubled as access to the giraffe, ostrich and antelope enclosure.Finally, I saw my favourite animal in the flesh for the first time ever, the cassowary. These dangerous birds are the closest experience I've had to coming face to face with a dinosaur, they really are seriously scary. I was afraid to turn my back to them to take a picture.On the whole, the zoo offers a surprising amount of variety and quality in its selection of animals. I'd recommend taking a whole morning and half an afternoon at least to see it, probably more if with small children. Don't miss out on this, it was my favourite tourist attraction in Prague!"

We then moved down the hill to the bottom part (you can use chair-lift, but I can\u00b4t with 2 years old and buggy...).Bottom part has not only animals (gorillas, felidae, pinguins, birds, dif. monkeys,...), but also entertainment for kids - playgrounds, small pool to paddle with todlers, little tram or you can ride a little train again around this part (for 30CZK/1\u20ac). There are planty of species on short-haul, so you can walk easily. You may catch feeding times, kids can try the speed of run compared to animals (there is a special trail with measurement, it\u00b4s a fun). To mention (slight) negatives - the bus No.112 going to the Zoo from metro station Nadrazi Holesovice is usually overcrowded, although it goes often. It\u00b4s unpleasant to be in with buggy or pram.

Unsure how this is the 4th best zoo in the world as majority of the enclosures I saw were tiny and a lot of the animals looked depressed, especially the polar bear and the Asian Elephant. Went on a very hot day so didn't actually see too many animals but that's not the zoos fault.A few positives though, the space in total is huge and they do have a large variety of animals. Also a lot of play areas for children. Nice to see the Gorillas getting a larger living space.Definitely keep the day free for getting there as its huge and takes a long while. Not the worst all in all!"

On arrival we had a short queue for tickets and were provided with an info leaflet (in Czech but you can see the pictures!) The zoo is very large and I'm sure we missed some small parts of it. We spent 7 hours there and started from the bottom so that we could get the chair lift up to the top this is an extra charge of 25kc but as the zoo itself was only 200kc (\u00a36) it's worth it for a rest! They had so many animals lions, tigers, unusual leopards, birds, hippo, elephant and many more but by far the most amazing are the polar bears we did have to wait for them to come out as it was a very hot day but eventually they came outside we were so excited! There are lots of different stalls and kiosks to buy ice creams, snacks and drinks with different choices throughout. There are loads of toilet stop areas too. We had lunch in the gulab by the elephants...Thai curry and rice was delicious freshly cooked and surprisingly good. The food here was great value for a zoo too. All in all we had a lovely day it was so worth the visit. Definitely recommend for adults..children...everyone!"

You get so much for your money we got student discount by just taking our normal uni cards and it cost us 150 czk which I think works out as around \u00a35 which is an absolute bargain! I'd recommend comfy shoes as its a long way round and also up a steep hill at one point if you take it slow and look at the animals on the way up its not too bad. You can get a cable car up the hill but not great for those that don't like heights ! It's has such a wide range of animals including polar bears! The enclosures are also very big which impressed us. We spent around 5 1/2 hours here and didn't even see every animal. Only thing I would say is there's not many signs in English and when there was there was obviously and understandably not as much information as there was in Czech but some times we were left wondering what the animal was. Overall a great day and I would highly recommend a visit here !"

Came here on a lovely sunny day and spent almost the whole day making our way round all the exhibits (took about 6 hours in total to get around and look at everything) there were so many different animals to see it was great! I would recommend getting there as soon as it opens as there were big queues when we arrive at 9.30am (think it opened at 9am) ticket prices are very reasonable at 200 czk per adult and only 5czk for a map to guide you round. I wouldn't recommend not getting a map as you would get lost without it! I was a big hep to us to make sure we saw everything they had to offer. There are a number of cafes and restaurants along the way at very reasonable prices with the ocean restaurant being the biggest which is right by the entrance of the zoo. We got a taxi to the zoo as we were unsure of the bus routes at the time which cost 175 czk each way from our hotel which was about 5 mins from old town but you can get a day pass which allows you on all public transport for 110 czk (we found this out after our visit) and you can get bus number 115 from the centre to the zoo. Overall a really good day out , probably my highlight of our holiday!"

Located in a hill, gives you a nice view of Prague especially when you go to the second level, even the route to go there gives an excellent idea of how beautiful Prague is even outside the center. It was so big not sure if we missed some animals because we got confused or there were not there at that period. You will need almost a whole day but if you love Zoo's then you will love this one."

What a pleasant surprise it was - wide open spaces for the animals and so clean and well organised. A little 3 month old baby elephant was the highlight for me I must admit!!The cost to get in was about \u00a36 pp was was excellent. Returning to the city was easy too, a bus to metro and then metro for 2 stops and a short walk back to our hotel.Would recommend this attraction to all but get there early as very busy!"

Food at African restaurant was OK, but note that the menu was not translated, making for an interesting order."

Unless you want a 1/2 hour non-signposted walk for the Zoo take the tram and bus from the city centre which drops you off at the front door. The zoo is on a hill and may not suit you if you have walking difficulties. You can get either a chairlift or a train to the top of the zoo. We spend 5 hours in the zoo and still did not see everything. Price for food was very reasonable and lots of options where to stop. If you have the time don't miss a trip to the zoo when in Prague."

IT is huge the zoo, you can even see the lions, tigers just within inches in front of you. Amazing experience. Theres variety of species and animals and places you can visit and see within the zoo. IT will be your loss if you dont visit here. You can spend a whole day here. Luckily, on the week we visited, cable car was free where Me and my gf rode on it for more than four times."

However, this was not the case. As it is so big the crowds soon dispersed and at no point did it feel too crowdedThe animals all had really big enclosures, particularly loved the mountain goats enclosure, very clever and never seen anything like itSaw alot of animals I have never seen before and also lots of babies. The baby elephant (only a few months old) was so cute!!There is also a chairlift which was particularly welcome as it was sooooooo hot and we couldn't face walking up the hill!There are lolvey views of Prague at the top and also a lookout towerThe food was lolvey and not to expensive at all. We went to the place selling hot food, the butter chicken was amazingAnd all for just over \u00a36 (200 crowns) to get in... absolute bargainIf your in prague this is defentely worth the trip (we had to get 3 buses but it was very easy) there is also a boat that goes thereWonderful day out, highly recommended "

All the animals had plenty of space (especially the giraffes and elephants) The only thing I would change would be the polar bears. Although their space was big, they didn't seem too happy (stereotypical stress movements) Think it might just be a too hot environment to keep them in. Apart from that it was really good and price is cheap. Easy to get to also (bus straight from metro station)"

But thankfully there is a handy and inexpensive chair lift to help (bit different for a zoo, but good all the same). I would 100% recommend going if you have the chance. A huge range of animals, all of which looked well cared for and had plenty of space. We also had some nice food at a small restaurant which was located at the top of the chair lift.

The bus fare is included in the travelcards you buy in Prague. The zoo is not the biggest I've been to, but they've squeezed a lot in. This does mean that some of the enclosures are smaller than you would hope, but they have made real efforts to provide the animals with the correct environment and stimulation. Most of the animals looked relaxed and well cared for - the only sad sight was a tiger who was just pacing up and down in his enclosure. The zoo is split level, but a free chair lift means you don't have to climb up and down. All in all, it's one of the better zoos I've seen - opinion will always be divided on these - and they were building some new improved enclosures while I was there. Definitely a good day out if you have children with you, plus there are lots of kiosks as you walk round to get food, drinks, ice creams etc."

Good variety of animals; you will have the basics you are looking for at a zoo plus some other less common ones like Cassowaries, lemurs or bats. At the moment, you will also see a little elephant or a gorilla baby. Cute. There are attractions organised (feeding or shows) every day at different places in the zoo. The zoo has a kids playground with water games or a lift for going up the hill. There are some renovations currently happening but they won't prevent you to seeing enough animals. Go see the Gavials..."

There are trains that goes up the hill and around the zoo and then visitors could stroll down for less strenuous walk. The zoo could easily be reached by public transportation.

Actually I think the title is very well deserved. The zoo is extremely well maintained and the animals appear to be in good condition and happy. they are kept in compounds as near to their natural environment as possible in captivity. The toilets are all spotless and smell fresh. They put the facilities at some (most) of the British parks to shame with touch free taps, Dyson Airblade hand dryers and automatic doors. The restaurants and cafes are equally clean, and cheap by UK standards.The ski lift was an added bonus and was an opportunity for a few Kodak moments. The views from the top are quite spectacular and if you want more there is a wooden lookout tower which you can climb for free. It is well worth the effort. One small niggle for me was that the layout is a little random so you have to double back and cover a lot of mileage to see everything. We clocked up almost 17000 steps and 7.4 miles! Having said that, the weather was perfect and we really enjoyed our day. It seemed odd to be going without our kids (who are now grown up) but there is plenty to keep the adults engaged anyway.Highly recommended but wear good shoes!"

I wouldn't have classed myself as a zoo person however Prauge Zoo is absolutely wonderful .The amount of animals there is vast and they are clearly happy and fantastically well cared for.The big animals are in large open areas and the smaller ones are in places appropriate to their size. In this shrinking world we need Zoos to keep endangered animals safe and this place is amazing. My favourite was the jungle enclosure with the most beautiful Orangutans , monkeys have always been my thing and I couldn't stop laughing having seen one of the cheeky Barbery Apes punch a goat for daring to nibble at the same bit of hay.You need 6 hrs to do the place justice in one hit and some comfortable shoes as its vast.It is so reasonably priced at 200kr per adult and you don't get ripped off inside either unlike Prauge Castle , the facilities are great and affordable .Use public transport if you can it's only 24 kr each back to town via the bus and metro as apposed to 500 kr in a taxi."

This zoo has all manners of creatures, great and small, some of which I had never seen before in real life (as a biologist I was extremely excited). Just some of the highlights are the Cheetahs, the Polar Bears, Elephants (one of which is a tiny baby!), the Gorillas (which also have a newborn) and the twilight zone, where bats are allowed to roam freely within the room. For costing the equivalent of about \u00a35 to get in the entrance fee is more than worth it. The food and drink within is also very reasonably priced (we paid \u00a31.50 for two hotdogs) and there are plenty of stalls, cafes, restaurants and vending machines throughout the zoo to keep you stocked up. The funicular railway between the lower and upper areas of the zoo is a particular highlight as you can get a fantastic view as you ascend or descend. One thing I would advise is to set aside a full day for this; I visited for 6 and a half hours and could have easily spent a few more there. Also, make sure to wear comfortable shoes that are suitable for walking because there is a lot to see which means a lot of walking! Despite this Prague zoo definitely lived up to its title of Europe's best continental zoo."

We went to this one as its website gave the impression the animals had large areas in which to roam freely. This was true for some for the animals (Giraffes and Elephants), but the lions and Polar bears were in a very small enclosure and the other wild cats where in cages, apparently on their own. I saw too many animals just pacing backwards and forwards along the same route. The wild life programmes I have watched on TV suggest this they do this when they are stressed.The trip there was excellent using the river boat which was a relaxing way to travel and see something of the outskirts of Prague. The return journey was very crowded through so we could only sit inside, rather than in the sun.An interesting trip and upsetting at times. Not one I would repeat."

The best attractions are the baby Gorilla, hippos, penguins, and the fun loving polar bears! I don't know if they're trained to do some of the tricks and things but some of the penguins and polar bears will swim up to the glass, dance a little for you and then swim back over and over.

Lots to see, extremely cheap to get in (special offer on the door meant our children only cost 1 krona each (basically a few pence!). There are lots of toilets around the place (important with a 3 year old!) and the enclosures are all very smart and well looked after. We ate in one of the restaurants (more like a cafeteria) and the food wasn't bad and was reasonably priced. We took the metro and then the bus which was very easy and quick although the area outside the metro station (while we were waiting for the bus) was pretty dodgy. We had a great day overall, would highly recommend!"

Used the tractor train to get to the top as on a hillside. Lots of refreshments available and lovely draught beer to wander around with! Locals could bring their dogs which we found amazing....in fact dogs are welcome everywhere in the czech republic...even the shopping centres and food shops! Had a lovely experience on lemur island getting up close to them. Only small negative is all menus totally in czech which not the easiest language to understand but most staff speak basic English so you just about manage to order the right food which always seems to taste better than uk especially salad. They do like spicy herby everything so don't expect anything bland or plain! Also, lovely huge bbq serving fresh chicken, pork, sausages, herby potatoes and sauerkraut. We caught the number 17 tram in Prague to an out of town bus station then bus just to the zoo which took about 15 mins. Very enjoyable day. Animals looked well cared for and clean."

It's on 2 levels - the lower part and then you can either walk to the higher part of get a type of ski-lift-chair up to the top which is fun.

Being form Omaha I can say that I know what it's like to visit a great Zoo and the Prague Zoo is very good. The first thing I notice is that it is extremely affordable, 200 Czech Koruna. $8 dollars US. for Adults and cheaper for kids of course. I liked not only the variety of animals but the amount of green space in the park. Plenty of trees, shrubs, flowers and shade. Among my favorite exhibits were the Elephant, Hippo Polar Bear, and Seal exhibits. They had a Chair lift to help with those who preferred not to walk up the hill to the animals up there. Overall the walking distance wasn't to bad. A lot of the benches were being redone so not a over abundance of places along the trails to rest but lots of food stations and picnic tables at those locations. I spent a good 3 hours there. My only complaint is that they do not have a aquarium. I had a great time, I'm glad I finally made the time for something other than Pivo and Sausages ;)"

Getting to and back from the zoo was surprisingly fast and easy with a combination of metro and bus. The zoo is vast and beautiful, like walking in an old magical garden. There is a large variety of animals, most of them in spacious exhibitions. The zoo is so large that we decided to skip some of it. There is a cable taking the visitors to the hilltop (otherwise a tedious climb). We were very impressed with the proximity of the animals to the visitors. Most of the exhibitions allow you to see the animals through a glass within a touching distance. I've never seen a lion or gorilla so close. I also liked that most of the animals can choose not to be seen, and hide or go to another cage. It seems respectful. The only downside was the map and signs. We found it vey hard to know where we are and how to get to a specific place. This part definitely needs improvement. If you have the time, I highly recommend visiting this beautiful place."

Some of the 'displays' did seem a little small or inappropriate for the animals they housed, whilst the majority gave the animals plenty of space and facilities to play and roam around freely. Overall definitely worth a visit of you have a free few hours on your trip."

Most people go there for the tigers and polar bears and elephants, but there are two species that are I think way more fascinating. (I mean all the animals are fascinating, some are just better known than others.) Firstly, they have an exhibit of Chinese giant salamanders and it rocks (if you're into amphibians, that is). They look like creatures from a different planet, all weird and blob-like. There's a little indoor pool with glass under the water surface and sometimes the salamanders swim under there making you feel like you could touch them ... if you wanted to. But not many people would want to I think. Even weirder than the salamander is a bird though, hiding all the way in the back of the zoo area. It's the Shoebil. When I first saw it live, it really gave me the creeps. It has the most evil and intelligent look ever. Chris Pratt's private army of raptors is nothing compared to one vicious looking shoebill. I'm not afraid of birds, but this one is ... different. Just go check it out :)"

Transport is easy from metro C, Nadrazi Holesovice get a bus 112. You can easily spent most of the day there and see some interesting animals like the Przewalski horses which are the world's only true wild horses. Entry is 200Kc for adults and 150Kc for kids 3-15.

The place is very nice, mostly in May with all the lush vegetation and flowers. The exhibit is comprehensive and there are lots of animals to see. Not a big fan of Zoos, mostly due to the idea of animal cruelty, but this place is worth. Pros: nice surroundings, not all the animals are in cages, most have `open space`.Lots of species and space for them. Cons: the explanation in English is not very long and always present. Large animals like giraffes and elephantes have very poor cages and were still inside. Tips:1. Try to plan more than 2 h. 4 h should be enough, 5 if you want to enjoy a bit of relax time. 2. The place is very tricky to handle, buy a map (10 czh) and find the funicular first. Then descend on your own. It is more likely to visit all the animals like this. 3. Come in May, the flowers are in full bloom, everything is green and the smell of the lilliac is great. Also, there is a warm light and it is not so hot, so many animals won't be hiding from heat."

We went on a warm spring day and was a great outing for the family, we heard there were carts to pull children in but I couldn't see any. Don't worry too much about packing foods and drink as there are places to eat and very reasonable prices. 25CZK for a hot dog and about 30CZK for a bottle of water. The Zoo is very big and located on a hilly area so be prepared to walk up and down. We didn't have time to see the entire zoo as we spent an hour in a queue to see the newborn Gorrila, they were restricting the access to a few people at a time , the lady from the zoo came to thank us for our patience in Czech and English. We enjoyed the Indonesian exhibition and got ot see a Komodo Dragon for the first time. Was very hot in the dome. All in all it was very good, only thing I didn't like was the Tiger in the cage looked quite stressed as he walked up and down. I think they get turns inside the cage and outside.

It is recommended to visit the zoo on Saturday as there are some activities with animals like big cats feeding, Seals show and more. There are locker services in the zoo and also a lot of snack points where you can get hot dogs, local sausage, beer, coffee, ice cream for relatively low prices. In the bottom line the kids and us had a huge fun. One disadvantage that needs to be pointed out is that the arrival and departure from the zoo is made by busses which are getting crowded and this felt like being inside a sardine box."

I live in Prague and am quite a frequent visitor and every time, there is something new, the setting is also beautiful and there are nice views of Prague. The Zoo is extremely successful in breeding, and is participating in several programs that re-introduce animals into their original habitats, and it has been voted the 4th best Zoo in the world. Recently, in April 2016, a baby elephant was born, in March there was a baby anteater and hippo.. and the list goes on and on. It is quite big, so I really recommend good walking shoes, and kids always love to take the funicular. There is also a new huge playground, thankfully there is a caf\u00e9/bar adjacent as well, so grownups can have a coffee or beer while waiting for the kids. There is good public transport going to the zoo, you go to Nadrazi Holesovice, on C line of metro, and catch the Zoo bus. For the great walkers, I recommend a walk through Prague\u00b4s biggest park, Stromovka, it is about 3 Km but a really nice walk. There are several places where you can eat and small kiosks where you can buy beverages all over the place- in the summer there is a little pool for kids as well by the Children\u00b4s zoo. The biggest restaurant is by the main entrance, but there are at least four other restaurants scattered around the Zoo. The Zoo is extremely popular, so go early in the morning, or on a regular work day- or prepare for crowds. Even then, it is worth it."

A big plus is the main cafeteria where there is typical Czech food with many areas to stop for coffee tea or snacks at a very reasonable price. Just compare to the Milwaukee Zoo or Bronx Zoo in the US where the food is uber expensive and well, I won't mention the quality. If you are visiting from out of town it is easily accessible by public transport (tram and then bus). On warmer days they have upwards of 15,000 visitors so go early. Winter months are less crowded. They rent big wagons to haul kids and gear around if you like. Dogs are allowed but must pay entry also. Plan on 4-6 hours to see the entire zoo. Enjoy!"

Great selection of animals, who all look well cared for, and are living in a great space. It's very big so lots of walking, some of it uphill. You will spend a lot of time here so I'd advise you to brings snacks and a bottle of water - even though these are available to buy. Very affordable tickets, and easy to get too by bus or taxi. I particularly enjoyed the polar bears, tigers, penguins, elephants and giraffe's - however, my boyfriend was disappointed there were no sharks (he likes dangerous animals)! The majority of it is outside, so it might not be pleasant on a rainy day - it snowed when we went and some of the animals were inside, however there were still so many too see so it didn't impact us too much at all."

I could not agree more this Zoo has some awesome animals and is worth a day trip as there is so much to see and do. The polar bears are a must see they are so active and are so cute to watch. The Tigers are incredible and are very active. As a zoo lover all the animals look very happy and well looked after. I would love to revisit this Zoo when I am next in Prague. It is a must see if you visit Prague and love animals. I previously went to Berlin Zoo and was not impressed half the animals were not present and look unhappy. All the animals were out playing and seemed much happier in Prague Zoo. Overall a great day spent at the Zoo!"

First of all, as I am a baby boom fan, I have to mention that there are many new animal babies. Not just the small elephant, which is the only one from the elephants who is walking around, the others rather remaining at one place. There is also a small hippopotamus, which I find the cutest of all the babies. It is swimming in water with its parent, sometimes using it as a means of transportation and if you watch it in a friendly way through the glass, it will peep out from water with its big beautiful curious childish eyes. There are also very cute and gentile babies of Surikata, which resemble small mice.But it is not only the plentiful of babies which improved. Also, there are more specialised pavillions, all perfectly equipped according to the given theme, so you can explore the Indonesian jungle, the Bororo pavillion, the palace of the beasts, the big room of the amphibians, where you can also listen to the audio story about it by our most favourite writer Karel Capek, narrated by the experienced Czech actor Jiri Labus.As I am a great Africa lover, I have to mention the palace called The Wonders of Africa.Another improvement I observed is that even in the rooms with monkeys or other huge mammals, the air does not stink like before.The park is an exquisite place for a beautiful walk, too, whereas educational, with children or a romantic one for couples.You can try the cabin which goes from the bottom to the top and back again.Overall, I was extremely satisfied and I am absolutely sure that you must visit this beautifully amazing place."

The fact that they have so many new born animals, show that the animals have very good conditions. I went to the zoo by boat which might have been a bit more expensive but it took me very conveniently straight from my hotel to the zoo and back. Return trip with the boat cost 290 czk.

It's quite far out from the city centre, but easily accessible by public transport (we took an uber for about 260kc). Entry is 200kc for adults, and family and discounted tickets are available for families and children. This place is HUGE! every time we thought we'd seen everything, we'd find another building or enclosure we hadn't even noticed yet. Some enclosures such as the bird ones were accessible to walk through, and it was almost like being in a real forest. There was a dark area where fruit bats fly freely over your head, which was cool, but pretty terrifying as they can get quite close!There are so many animals to see! including animals I had never seen up close before, including hippos, and alligators. These enclosures had large glass windows next to the water so you could see them swimming! Managed to get up close to the tigers and lions because they were so close to the glass, surreal experience. There are plenty of resturants (cannot comment on these as we didnt use them and all menus were in Czech) and plenty of toilet facilities. This is a FULL day out, we were there around 5 hours and didnt make it all the way round before closing time! Your legs are definitely gonna hurt after walking round this!Only complaint is that the polar bear enclosure is FAR too small for 3 polar bears, they looked SO bored and it was quite distressing to see them just pacing up and down. This definitely needs to be addressed."

I\u2019m a regular visitor to the wonderful ZOO Praha and I\u2019m glad to see so many visitor\u2019s reviews enthusiastic about it. I can see that even many of the mentioned negatives are only misunderstandings caused by the particular impression of only one visit, or by judging animal\u2018s conditions superficially not aware they are different from humans and have different needs. There\u2019s no doubt the zoo is on the highest professional level; the proof is number of newly born animals, of both common and very rare species, some of them only few institutions in the world are able to breed. This is possible only grace to perfect care and know-how and ardour from the breeders. The visitors can notice that almost every species lives in group or a pair or the male and female live separatedly and are put together in time of making and breeding babies, according to their nature. Several months ago there were in the reviews some displeasure about the anteaters being \u201eevidently\u201c stressed and thus poorly cared about. But in fact they were the young pair expecting their first baby, so they really were rather nervous and irritated about this; nevertheless the baby was born and his mother, although unexperieced, cares well about him. The animals live their real lives in the zoo, they are not perfect pictures from National Geographic; one of the polar bears is mother bear Bora, who doesn\u2019t like water \u2013 really! That\u2019s why her fur is so shabby (the keepers wash her with hose every now and then). One of the tigers is elderly lady with occasional health inconveniences, so she has right to look not perfectly animated and rather sad. There is much speaking about tiger\u2018s enclosures being very small \u2013 but you should noticed that every cell has open doors to two neigbouring cells and also to inner, not visible utility rooms; and the tigers have their turn in outer enclosure, alone or in groups according to their relations. The big cats house is comparatively new and convenient enough to make home for first group of indian lions brought directly from India to the european zoo after decades; this could never be possible if people from India were not sure about high level of care and conditions in the Prague zoo. By the way, tigers and other species pacing to and fro is not necessarily mark of their stress \u2013 it\u2019s natural for them to walk a lot, for in wild they go every day some distance round the borders of their hunting areal. Also the real biotop-like design of the inner enclosures, even though it makes great impression on us people, is not so important for the animals as the way they can profit from its arrangement \u2013 animal used to sleep or relax at elevated place just need the place and don\u2019t care so much about if it\u2019s made of concrete and has grey or whatever colour; the species differs in specific needs of temperature, hideaway, way of obtaining food, care about paws or hoofs and many, many other things which we visitor cannot know. A good exemple is old row of bird cages mentioned in some older reviews as the negative point \u2013 yes, they were squares with dark bares and this evoked a prison in human mind; but grace to their favourable position on the sunny southern slope there were very good conditions for exotic birds which were flourishing there; that\u2019s why one of the cages will be preserved for remembrance although the completely new bird house is being built. The animal behaviour is different than human \u2013 some people thing gorillas being very bored and badly cared for they lie about a lot; but they really are very lazy \u2013 its natural for them to sleep or relax most of the day, for their strategy of earning food is only eat everything around them without waste lot of energy, in contrast to chimpanzees who work hard to earn energetically rich food. Also gorillas sometimes eat their own excrements for there are still quite a lot of undigested leaves - and its near. They can do it in zoo as well and it\u2019s no mark of their hunger. I wish every visitor of the Prague Zoo were sure that the animals are on the first place there and enjoy his/her visit maximally :-) And don\u2019t let yourself worry about the closing hour \u2013 it is possible to linger much longer only the inner houses are closing. I stay often half hour or more after the closing and it\u2019s no problem, the exit is still open. And if you are still hesitate about visiting zoo, be sure that there are several days old elephant baby, some weeks old hippo baby, anteater baby, tapir babies, aardvark baby and much much more babies, eggs and adults waiting for you! :-)"

Only around \u00a35!!We went to the restaurant first and the prices in there were also very reasonable.The Zoo itself is very big and there are a lot of animals, we found that if you didn't see an animal outside then you would most likely see it if you went to the indoor enclosures.All in all a very good Zoo."

We paid less than \u00a320 for entry of a family of four- if this attraction was in the UK, you would pay upwards of \u00a360. Although we didn't eat there, we bought a double-scoop ice-cream for just over \u00a31. Similarly, in the UK this would likely cost over \u00a33. Once in, enclosures for animals were spacious and animals seemed well cared for - very few moral dilemmas to be had. The quantity of animals is vast, and includes tigers, elephants, giraffes, penguins etc. You can also get very close to the animals- a handspan from a (behind glass!) tiger or a half-foot from a penguin. In part, this is because the zoo is not overcrowded (our visit was over the Easter holidays). All in all, this is the best zoo we've been to."

It was clear to see that these animals had gone insane through sheer boredom and awful treatment, this is shown by the animals constantly swaying their heads and carrying out repetitive movements over and over again in their tiny enclosure. This is just another example of human greed, and I'm so disappointed that I have contributed to this behaviour continuing."

We got there by taking an Uber cab, as the public transport route didn't seem very straightforward. First thing that amazed us was the cost of the tickets - equivalent of about \u00a36 for me and \u00a34.50 for my daughter using her student card. The zoo is very well laid out although some steep hills which could be a bit of a problem for anyone with mobility difficulties. All of the animals had good enclosures and plenty of space. We did notice one of the polar bears seemed to be doing quite a bit of pacing about which I suppose could have meant s/he wasn't happy - but the other one seemed contented and they had plenty of space, so not really sure. All of the other animals seemed very happy and active. We especially loved the gorillas and felt privileged to see a baby very close up with its mother. We only ate chips and had drinks in the cafe so can't comment really on food quality but again it was very reasonably priced. The zoo isn't massive but we spent about 4 hours there before we'd seen everything and thoroughly enjoyed it. There were a couple of large school groups (teenagers) and a smaller group of younger children. All of them were impeccably behaved - no pushing and shoving as we're used to at London Zoo - a credit to their schools actually."

As London Zoo members we were intrigued to find what the zoo would be like as it was widely trailed as the 4th best in the world...Well the answer was it is superb. To start with it is huge and you have to be prepared to do a good deal of walking and cope with plenty of hills as it must rise up the valley side by 300 feet. I think it had disabled access but how good and how universal I couldn't swear to. So, it's big and you will fully fill 6 hours - well we did. It has a vast array of animals - all the usual suspects and many we hadn't come across before (an Ocelot springs to mind). But the facts that it was diverse wasn't the most impressive thing to me. What was impressive was that the animals, by and large, were very well housed with many obvious opportunities for enrichment. The highlight for me was the Orangutan exhibit, large, lots for the animals to do and in the appropriate climate. Just brilliant. Elephant enclosure also springs to mind as being very good. The vast majority were excellent - the only exception to me being the Polar Bear, but beyond the needs for conservation you have to question whether these animals should be in Zoos at all. However I digress, this is a a Must Visit IMO if you visit Prague. Getting there can be a bit tricky re public transport as you need a combination of trams and buses to be there. As we wanted to see animals not public transport we went for a cab from city center at 420 crowns each way. Easier and takes just 25 mins or so. The zoo are in the process of upgrading the Red Panda enclosure (my personal favorite) and look forward to seeing them the next time we visit Prague. Also don't be put off by the Zoo web site, it's very basic and in no sense does the Zoo justice, just get there and you won't regret it."

When we were there, he was doing the same thing, but with another member of the herd - they were standing together and rocking like they were dancing. All 7 of them were outside together and we watched them go from one side to the other as a herd, then train the young one to use the trunk and we've also seen the baby play with the hanging ball."

The biggest difference was that the Prague Zoo had little to few barriers between you and the animals. In Australia all the exhibits are super safety conscious and it takes away from the up close and personal experience with the animals. It blows my mind that dogs are welcome in the Zoo, but owners are asked to not have them up against the glass of the Lions and polar bear exhibit as to not incite these carnivors. The giraffes were beautiful, the leopard youngsters play fighting with each other on a grassy hill and the sheer size of the polar bears where mind blowing. Food and drinks are very cheap at the zoo restaurants, service is fast. The gorillas were very entertaining, we even saw one eat her own faeces, this is common apparently"

Some of the animals were inside or sleeping so was difficult to see them and I have to say some of the enclosures really should be bigger. However we spent several hours here today and really enjoyed our visit."

They have free pullcarts for families at the entrance. It has been modernized a lot since our first visit some 9 years ago. It is very children friendly and accessible. The place is ENORMOUS and it will require a full day to enjoy all the different animals and kids activites. There are also many good playgrounds and eateries. For families with younger children this is a must."

It was an extremely hot day but we loved it. People were friendly and spoke some English. Lots of attractions to see. There was even an area that had water misters which was refreshing. Great place to spend the day or just change things up for some of the younger kids. We spent a little more than half the day here. Lots of space to walk, a place for kids to play, along with plenty and affordable places to grab snacks. This zoo had some of the cleaner bathrooms that I have seen at any zoo. One highlight is the star walk with animal track/print of different animals. (Like the Walk of Fame in Hollywood)."

Weather was nice with plenty of sunshine, we were up and about early enough to explore the whole zoo. Our hotel was in Mala Strana, and thanks to the great public transport system we got to the zoo in no time. On a Thursday morning around 10am we didn't have to queue at all. There was some kind of storage boxes and carts for those with more bags, we had no need for those so no idea if those were free of charge.The Zoo is divided in upper and lower part and we had just enough time (7 hours) to walk through both parts, have some coffee and snacks and even sit down and watch some animals minding their daily business. There is a lot of hills to climb, and we didn't find any simple route to walk, bearing in mind that we wanted to see everything.At some point it felt like we had seen some animals at least three times, just because we tried to find certain spots.All animals seemed healthy. The only thing that caught my eye was their only male elephant, he was separated from other elephants and he had some OCD-like behaviour e.g. he was rocking himself from side to side. As far as I'm aware of elephants as species, they are social animals and they need physical contact to other elephants. That is not possible there, as the male is separated from others with electrical fences and a massive gate.Also bats flying free in the Indonesian Jungle exhibit are something I don't approve - one bat got himself hit by a fellow visitor, as it is human instinct to hit something flying towards you in darkness. Just for the bats' sake, please give them a terrarium!Otherwise the Zoo is a really nice place with staff members making sure some animals with babies were given the peace they needed. Some signs about animals were only in Czech, some had a few words in English too. A little more information in English would'e been great. I don't know if they had some guidebooks in English available, as I didn't expect to need one in one of the most popular tourist attraction in Prague.Families with children seemed to enjoy their time too. There is some picnic areas, a few restaurants, vending machines, a lot of benches to sit back and relax, at least one caf\u00e9 etc, so you won't be hungry or thirsty. Prices were reasonable, which was surprising as usually that kind of attractions try to make as much money as possible since there is no options to go and buy food and drinks outside the Zoo and come then back. There are toilets and baby changing facilities too, and no matter where in the area you are, you'll find a toilet sooner than later. All restaurant and caf\u00e9 toilet facilities are also available free of charge."

We're not suggesting it's cruel or anything though. Maybe due to the time of year, but I don't think there were any feeding shows - certainly nothing scheduled anyway.

We had a long walk throughout the zoo and ended up having our lunch in the restaurant. Yes there's a restaurant in the zoo , many souvenir shops ... The place is clean and nice with lots of animals . We took tons of photos and had a really lovely time there. Highly recommended!"

Mind us being ove 70 helped as we only had to pay 1.ooCZK. for a wonderful day out. The Zoo is massive so you have to pace yourself. It is very well sign posted so no fear of getting lost. It was hard to know where to begin but we started with the polar bears which are beautiful. There is every type of animal and you can see they are very well cared for. What we did love was the giraffes they are such pretty animals and so graceful, Then there was the cheeky meercats one in particular was a right poser. We had coffee then started again. first stop was the tigers who are magnificent, there are two many animals to list but I think if you visit prague it should be on your list as what to see. We had lunch which was very reasonably priced and very tasty. there are plenty of facilities which are spotlessly clean. All in all we as two pensioners had a brilliant day out very tired but well worth it."

Prague Zoo is large and you can easily spend the best part of the day there, (apparently Brad Pitt and Angelina were visitors here) we didn't see everything but still spent from 1.00pm to 5 there (it closes at 5pm). There are a couple of cafe's which serve hearty meals at very reasonable prices-( the hot stew was welcome on a cold day!)The tigers, monkey's and Polar bears are really impressive and the elephants but it was a bit sad to see them showing signs of major boredom and pacing around irritably. I think these magnificent beasts should been engaged more and have more stuff to do and interact with.We saw the otters being fed which made them active and entertaining. We missed the tigers and lions being fed so they were all asleep but we did see them close up indoors as well as outdoors. The elephants too didn't seem that happy but that might have been to do with some necessary segregation the zoo were implementing. Prague zoo is definitely worth visiting and making a day of it with the whole family, you can see all the major animals well and it is a pleasant location although a involves taking a 20 min bus from the centre of Prague."

We just had a couple of days in this beautiful city so we went by bus, metro and then another bus directly from the airport. After not much more than half an hour we arrived at the Zoo. Because of the snow and the cold weather lots of the animals were kept indoors. Still the gepards, the penguins, the flamingoes and lots of other majestic birds were out in the open. The absolute high point of our visit was the pavillion of the gorillas. There are not many humans that can visit the gorillas in the wild, so it is a blessing even to meet such characters in Prague Zoo. A very nice and informative young woman offered a lot of information about the different gorillas, especially about the silverback, - now aged around 28, he`d been a perfect father for a lot of gorilla babies. If you have the chance do visit this zoo."

The zoo was ok though it appeared a lot of the animals had gone into hiding with the cold weather as a lot of the enclosures were empty! Would probably come back in summer to see if it is more enjoyable. Easy to get there & back from the main tourist area. We got the metro from the Muzeum stop & then caught the 112 bus from outside the metro station at Nazdrazi Holesovice. Just buy a 32czk ticket each way (about \u00a31) (coming back there is a bus ticket machine at the bus stop) & it's really easy. Just be careful of dodgy looking ppl on the metro & don't travel when it's dark."

The ZOO is situated in a hilly and wooded Prague's Troja district, near the banks of the River Vltava - more than 50 hectares large (opened in 1931) and has almost 5000 animals. Very interesting are the Indonesian Jungle Pavilion where they behave Komodo dragons, sea lions pavilion, Monkey Island, as well as the hugely popular gorillas. For the second half of the zoo which is located on a hill above the river you can take the cable car, and there are, among others, runs the famous breeding of Przewalski's horses. Further I recommend to visit the area of elephants - almost safari and unique pavilion \u010cambal for gavials (or gharials) - one of the largest of all crocodilian species. Keep in mind that this is usually a day trip (zoo has several snacks) - the environment is very nice, especially the kids will surely love this trip (there are also several game sites for kids). Forbes magazine this zoo evaluated in 2008 as the 7th best zoo in the world (TripAdvisor in 2015, at the 4th place :-) !)."

Prague ZOO offers not only interesting meetings with animals, which are kept in as much natural conditions as possible, but also a beautiful walk. The area is quite large, allow yourself at least 3 hours. There are many special attractions for children, which they will love (children \u00b4 s corner, animal \u00b4 s feeding times, lift from lower to upper part of the ZOO, interactive programs etc.). But even the adults will be satisfied. After the ZOO, you can also visit botanical garden, which is very close and in summer season Troja Castle and Santa Klara vineyard."

Be sure to check out the cliffside enclosures. Food is a bit over priced but hey, it's a tourist attraction what do you expect? I've been most zoos in the UK.

There are loads of little cafes dotted about and coffee stops which are cheap and the toilets are free! The park is easy to visit you just get on the metro and then on the bus using the same ticket and bobs your uncle.

By far the polar bears were our favourite animals there, watching them so closely you are literally a pane of glass away from them! We also got the opportunity to watch the lions and tigers being fed, with the feeding times signposted close to all enclosures it's an amazing sight to see.The only thing you should be prepared for is occasionally getting lost if you can't easily follow a map, and there is a lot of walking involved... and some steep inclines too!

You can rent little box buggies for the day but securing them if you eat or go into the buildings can be a challenge. If you have small kids then when you come in through the entry turn left to go to the lower part of the zoo first as that has the petting area, playgrounds and bigger restaurants. If you go up there is one small takeaway by the polar bear and the bigger places are towards the giraffes. You can easily spend 5 or 6 hours here.

The day we went, it snowed quite a lot and the zoo was practically empty which actually made the visit not as fun or energetic. Even though it snowed we was able to still see every animal they had to offer because of their indoor pavilions for them which is a plus, but it was also what made me upset as some animals like the Tigers, lions and elephants seemed to be loosing their minds. Pacing with Boredom in their very small enclosures which was unsettling to see. Tigers want to roam and hunt, not be locked in a room no bigger than my bedroom. I'm sure when it's warm and they're in their very large suitable outdoor areas they are very happy but this zoo has made me dislike the concept of keeping wild animals locked up very wrong. "

Lots of indoors and warmed up glass walled houses for the animals, even the elephants and giraffes were there.Prague zoo means lots of walking and the elevator's not working during winter so you have to hike up the hill to see all the animals. We were ok with that and carried our 3-year old some of the time. We ate on the top at some restaurant most of the employees seemed to eat at as well - reasonably priced basic good tasting food.I would recommend the zoo as a winter activity as well if you're not too afraid of long walks and elevation."

Of course, you may come by metro line C and then bus number 112, but spend 250 kc for a taxi from city center (order it by phone, It is chipper. Google in advance you will find some English or Russian speaking taxi). And your way back you may go by bus and metro.Third, When to go? Any season but in early spring or winter take a Caban/raincoat to your bag and a hat or a baseball cap depending on your style :). In case of raining it will be more comfortable than with umbrella in your right hand and wet zoo map in left. You may spend 3-4 hours there, so take comfy shoes as there hills and long distances. Come in the morning, you may see how they feed animals, sometimes there breakfast shows. Finally, What to do there 3-4hours?Learn the map on Zoo web site in advance. Print it out and mark animals you wanna visit. Upper side of the map you should go up a hill, but instead you may use a funicular. Near the elephants area there is a big food court with hot dishes, you may comfy seat there and eat, drink bear etc, but don't feed the enimals.And if you are without kuds don't miss a chance to visit Troja chateau just across the street from Zoo main entrance.

The animals have pretty big cages, and you can walk for kilometres in this zoo. Very easy reachable by public transport too."

Many of the animals were in there inside enclosures which you can go into and view them inside a pavilion or they are visible from the outside through glass. Also many of the pavilions you can walk though such as 'the jungle' are fully subversive so you feel you are walking through the jungle. One of the best experiences was walking into the twilight cave with free flying Fruit Bats! Despite the snow we saw many animals out playing in it or eating it. There were animals at the zoo that neither I or my partner had ever seen which was brilliant.Several places to purchase hot drinks and snacks (much needed in the cold) and four (maybe more) restaurants to choose from. Easily accessible via Tram 17 and Bus 112, with entry to the zoo equalling about \u00a37!! Spent 4 hours here and still felt there was more to see, fantastic day out."

We went down the cable car which was short and sweet but fun although a bit scary the way you were just left to it belting yourself in. The only negative was on entrance hen an older woman on the tills totally ripped us off and overcharged us! My girlfriend wanted to rope her head off! Other than that all good and recommend!"

People take their dogs, which I found a little strange but seems to be the norm there. The elephants, apes and polar bears were my favs.If you visit in high season take your own food. I found many of the restaurants ran out of a lot of things. If you are veggie or fussy about food taking your own is a must. There is a lot of walking to do and some of the pathways lead you to a bit of a dead end so try plan out your route.You will need a good half day to get the most from your day"

The only animals outside were different kinds of deer, wolves and polar bears. The only animals that were to be viewed from inside were the giraffes, elephants, gorillas nd felines. Next to that they do have some buildings where you can view smaller animals, reptiles and fish. All of the restaurants were closed as well, except one.

It was also really cold so we wanted to go inside for a bit, but there's barely anywhere to go but outside. The pavillions are really hot inside and the contrast hot-cold is quite annoying. A few of the exhibits looked really small (too small...) and the Zoo is on a hill so there's a lot of climbing.

There's an aviary, a walk through rain forest exhibit, and even a chairlift up the mountain! The side of the mountain is where they have found a great deal of fossils...at least I think they did. See, I really had to use every bit my deductive skills to try and figure out what the placards and signs were saying, because I don't thin one single sign, anywhere in the park, had a lick of English on them. And I'm not one of those folks who thinks that everyone in the world should speak English because I do, but a lot of the world does, and a lot of travelers do as well. And a LOT of them go to visit Prague. So I was a bit disappointed when a place, to attract the tourists no less, has brochures at every hotel lobby in the city, doesn't cater at all to said tourists.But other then that, it really was a neat place!

I have a keen interest in zoology and conservation and the variety of animals on display was genuinely surprising, with so many exotic animals on display that I have never seen in other zoos. Enclosures are well designed to be both aesthetically pleasing for humans, whilst also providing excellent habitats for all the animals. We were particularly impressed by the Indonesian Jungle section and the Africa section. Unfortunately, as we visited in Winter we didn't get to see many animals outsides but for the most part, they are all easily accessible through indoor viewing areas. Prague Zoo also seems to have some excellent breeding programmes with a lot of juvenile/baby animals around, for those looking for a cute factor. For those looking to take photographs, we thought opportunities were reasonably good (considering the time of year) and got some excellent close ups.In summary, this zoo was great and so much cheaper than so many of its European counterparts (especially compared to the UK!).

I sent an email to them requesting information well over a month before our visit today and they still haven't replied.On to the zoo itself, from various brochures and publications, this is supposed to be one of the best zoos in Europe however it failed to deliver. This place should either be closed during winter or they should not charge the full admission cost. The majority of animals were either hiding from the cold weather, sleeping or in their respective cages. Hippo was in the indoor enclosure so you only saw it from the murky water when it decided to come up for air. I say hippo and not hippos because only saw one.Elephants had a huge outdoor area for them to roam, however they were also indoors and could only be seen from the glass. Giraffes are the same. Not sure if they have lions but didn't see any. Didn't see penguins but I think they're supposed to have.Two tigers were seen and they were both asleep.The only animals which enjoy the winter weather were the main ones to be see, polar bears, fox, reindeer etc. They were also quite a bit of flamingos and pelicans all huddled together. Spiders were unseen, snakes were few or also somewhere seeking warmth. I'm sure this place could be better and more active but not worth visiting or worth the full price in winter. Lastly, they close promptly at 4:00PM (Jan / Feb). At 4 they have announcements on the loudspeaker in Czech and English letting you know the zoo is closed! Staff actually then go through each indoor pavilion to send visitors out. Total time spent: 4 !/2 hrsAdmission cost: 200CZK / $8 USD appx (Adults)"

This is a big zoo and I was there frim about 0945 until 1600 (closing time for January).I didn't see everything eg lions but I saw more than I expected to considering that it was about freezing when I was there.I don't know if the lions were hiding inside because they didn't appreciate the cold or if they had been moved but there were none in the lion enclosure.I found that the aviary was quite small though there are various separate enclosures with owls, vultures and Australian birds.Though there are a lot of animal areas where there is an uninterrupted view of the creatures on display, there are many where glass (including dirty glass) or thick wire mesh get in the way. It would be better if natural barriers were utilised to keep the likes of tigers segregated from visitors and mesh with bigger gaps for the owls and vultures (since surely they would not be able to squeeze through 2\" square holes).I walked to the zoo from my hotel near Prague Castle. It took about an hour and was a fairly straightforward route: a handful of turns and long straight stretches. I was able to make the return trip without reference to Google maps so, in a city I don't know, that suggests an easy route.Overall the zoo has a lot of animals over an area that is a day trip to get around. Admission is not expensive so it is a value for money day out. It just makes 4 out of 5 from me."

You can walk with bats, see the polar bear and see tigers and lions.. everythings even in the winter. The zoo has inside and outside spots for animals which allows the public to see every one.You need to prepare your body, because it is a long walk to visit all places in the zoo. They also have a cable car to go from the bottom to the top, because the zoo is in a hill.It is magnificent and very nice to visit if you have time and like animals. It is about 15 euros the ticket for adults and it is very easy to go there. One metro and a bus for the zoo in the metro train station. Easy and fast.So, do not miss this opportunity! ;)"

We walked for 4 hours but still didn't get to see everything so i think a 6 hour visit is needed.

You can also come by bike on foot through Stromovka park or by car through the tunnel. The Prague zoo is on a hill, so there is a chair-lift that you can go on to get to the top. An alternative is to walk, which takes 30 minutes, but you will see many animals along the way. Go see the whole zoo or at least the highlights, you should plan on staying for about 4-7 hours. There are many indoor pavilions with insects or tigers or turtles and huge play areas for the kids. There is also a goat feeding area, which is very funny. One thing I dislike is that the train that can transport you from one place to another costs extra money and doesn't go very often. I really like the African part and also the viewing tower (free). You have a view of all of Prague. Also if you have heard of geocaching, there are many of them in the zoo. I think it is better than Berlin or any other zoo in Europe."

We love to visit zoos and try to do so every time we visit somewhere new, Prague zoo did not disappoint.We got there very early which was a good thing as the zoo is so large that you really do need to spend the whole day here to get to see everything and to not rush around. The zoo is spacious, very clean and different languages are catered for. There are a huge array of species to see and each pavilion is well thought out and planned.We loved the Gharials as this is the first zoo we've been to which had this animal and the pavilion was amazing getting you so close to them. The enclosure for the Barbary sheep and macaques was just amazing as you could see these animals climbing the sheer cliff face just as they do in the wild.All of the animals appeared happy and this is more than evident in the about of baby animals around the zoo, rare babies too (aardvark and tapir and the przewalski's horse).There are many places to eat around the zoo, (although one of the restaurants had no signs in English) and all appeared good value. We found the whole experience great value for money and had a great day.Be prepared to walk quite a distance and to climb the very large hill if the chair lift is off (as it was when we were there) but the views from the top are worth the climb alone. The viewing tower was closed when we were there too.We got a taxi there to be more efficient but did use public transport to get back into town. The bus and the metro were both very easy to use and very fast and great value."

They definitely have families in mind with many picnic areas available throughout and they keep great care of their animals as well with indoor and outdoor availability for viewers to see the wildlife. We were amazed by the mountain goats as we strolled one of the walkways, they were literally climbing right above us on a steep cliff in their enclosure. The polar bears, seals and hippos were all swimming happily, they penguins were being fed and the gray wolves paced the front of their enclosure licking their chops as some of the dogs who were in the park with their owners must have looked like a tasty treat. We would highly recommend those with little ones taking the trip out to the Prague zoo, it's a bit out of the way and we felt hard to get to via public transport (we opted to take a taxi to maximize our time at the zoo) but well worth the time and effort to get there, you will not be disappointed!"

I would not visit again as the Polar Bears are still playing on my mind as I write this note.On the plus side the restaurant food was very reasonably priced and very good. Portions were huge."

Be prepared to do some walking, which is a good thing as it means the enclosures are of a good size. It was nice to see a lot of the animals active which I hope means they are quite happy. Highlights are the monkeys, polar bears, and the seals. Lots of playing going on, and very reasonably priced too."

It made so nice, that some animals are divided from a viewer just with some plants and a trench, which is partly hidden because of plants. Good, that zoo has many toilets around the area and there is a restaurant. Although restaurant is more like a canteen. The only way to get to the zoo with a public transport is to take 112 bus from metro station N\u00e1dra\u017e\u00ed Hole\u0161ovice."

The park is located in a hilly terrain which invites varied and great outdoor areas for both animals and visitors.The area was adapted for families with great play areas and free lending of strollers. There were also several kid-friendly eateries.I visited the park in winter and it was more of the animals that were not present. I would therefore recommend to visit the park during the summer."

A really well kept zoo, with plenty of space and environmental consideration. You felt as though the animals were put first. It was wonderful to see the polar bears swimming and playing, (had never seen before) and the kids loved the orang-utans. The chair lift down the cliff was novel, and we enjoyed seeing the penguins and baboons. The zoo is spread out over a large area, is very reasonable (CZK 600 for a family pass), with plenty of food/drink stations dotted around. This attraction works on a dull/drizzly day too, with plenty of indoor exhibits. Easy to get there and back - you can get the bus from directly outside to the metro station, which takes you in to the city centre in minutes. Alternatively, a taxi costs around CZK, but you'll need to arrange a pick-up if you need one."

Tickets are very cheap and good value and there is a regular bus route to get her easily. Wide variety of animals to see, our favourites were the penguins and monkeys. However, I was quite upset to see the lions and tigers in such small indoor spaces, they did have access to go outside but these doors were closed during our visit. One tiger seemed very distressed and was pacing back and fourth, this was quite upsetting to see and there were no staff about to inquire as to whether they were locked in due to it being feeding time soon or if they were locked in all day for visitors to see. I do not feel the treatment of animals here is as high of a standard compared to zoo's in the U.K. Despite this, majority of the other animals appeared to be content and had good living environments."

Wishing for a break from all the culture of Prague, we decided to spend a peaceful day at the zoo.The zoo was easy to access, taking the metro and then a special \"zoo bus\" (121), it was possible to get there on a 24kr ticket from the Florenc station.The entrance cost 200kr.We spent the next 5-5 hours looking at a wide array of animals, including some \"theme\" exhibitions, such as the Indonesia display (Komodo dragons) and the Elephant section (which includes an exhibition of the living quarters and about how the animals are kept).Apparently this is one of the top seven zoos in the world. Well worth a visit."

I mean c'mon they have a tropical environment created by them inside of a big sphere and you feel like your inside of a jungle. They have a lot of animals, it's no point to name them because the list will be too long. You can even rent minicars . They have machines where you can buy soda or water like ever 50 meters. It's really good, and it's worthing the money. Definitely"

The polar bears were my favourite; you can get so close, but not so close as to feel uncomfortable. The animals all have huge enclosures, and look really happy and well cared for.... An absolute must see!!! Please allow yourself plenty of time to look around, it is massive. The cable cars are also a must do."

You can get extremely close to a lot of the animals which allows for brilliant pictures, and at the time of year we visited the zoo was not busy at all which can be a bonus as you will not have to battle through crowds to see anything. To get around the entire site is roughly 10km and at a leisurely pace it took 6 hours to complete. Extremely accessible via public transport from the centre of Prague (we took the easy to navigate metro and then took a connecting bus service). We did not try any of the food facilities that were available but they seem like they might be an acquired taste; there are food and drink kiosks all around the site for a quick pit stop. Cannot recommend this place more highly, it is a must visit if you are a fan of zoos and animals."

At 0900 hrs purchased a ticket costing 200 czk and entered the zoological park.Forbes traveler magazine had listed the Prague zoo as the seventh best zoo in the World in 2015 and hence i travelled this distance far out of Prague City.Excellent beyond description and Prague zoo is reputed for breeding endangered species.Saw a group of Gorilla's along with a baby being carried on its back by its mother.A handsome male silver-back was the breeding stud male. Prague zoo is also successful in captive breeding of Cheetahs and akin to the \"Gorilla family\" came across a Cheetah family in the zoo.Saw the \"Sumatran\" and \"Malayan\" tigers which could soon become extinct in the wild as well as captivity.I was lucky to view the last specimen of these species and hope that other tiger species like the Bengal and Siberian tigers from India and Russia don't face the same future decades from today.Viewed the giant ant-eater for the second time in my life the first being just a few days ago at the Schoenbrunn zoo in Vienna.Had to undergo another small hill trek as the zoo enclosures are situated on the slopes of a hill.Some of the prominent and endangered species enclosures have the animal name tag and description in English language while most other species are only in Czech language.Saw beautiful Gharials and Anaconda's.For the first time in my life saw the \"Giant Chinese Salamander\" which akin to the Panda is facing extinction in its natural habitat.Viewed the\"King Vulture\"and \"Bearded vulture\" as also many rare bird species.The view of Prague from the top of the hill is awesome and there is a rope - way for visitors not wanting to trek back to the base of the zoo. Finally after three hours of zoo viewing made me way to the exit and boarded the\"112\" bus back to the station."

Allow yourself more than 3 hours to get around as the zoo is huge! The hill in the middle of the zoo makes the layout slightly awkward as the middle route (straight up the hill) has a lot to offer but entirely cuts out some of the best parts of the zoo. The middle route in itself is probably not worth a second climb once you have seen the park (once you finish a single loop of around 60% of the park you'll have been there at least 3 hours). The highlight of the trip for me was the more than incredible hippo enclosure which allows you see the near comic fashion in which hippos traverse the ground underwater. Hopefully I'll get to go again someday as after spending almost 5 hours there, I feel like I've still only seen 60-70% of what the zoo has to offer."

The site is hilly so be prepared for a lot of walking; there are plenty of places to get snacks and drinks but all quite low key - we found it very refreshing that there was not an attempt to fleece you at every turn with photographs, face painting, balloons etc. The admission fee is very reasonable too, so a great value for money day out. There are great views from the top of the hill, and the chairlift is good fun if you don't mind a relaxed attitude to health and safety!

The zoo is beautiful without any doubt, the animals are located in green, wide open areas which is great to see. When we got to the elephants area we just Couldn't find them,it was sad to realize that they were in a small pavilion while they're beautiful closure was left empty. Be prepared for lots of walking, up and down the hills. The place is not really friendly for tourists cause all of the animal information is in Czech, nothing in English. Prices aren't expensive."

They seemed distressed, bored and lonely. Two elephants were stood in the same spot, swaying from side to side for over 90 minutes. There was also a loud clicking sign that was annoying us for the time we visited, so no wonder how these animals must have felt. Also, over half their closure was closed, and there was no sign of a reason.Overall, taken the elephant enclosure out of the equatin, it his rouhly \u00a36 to enter which is incredible when the animals, look extremely well cared for and the enclosure seem spacious and well thought out and especially when you compare that with UK prices.Gorillas, seals, giraffes and tigers all had lots of spaces inside and out to roam, it was just the poor elephants, that you can't shake out of your mind.Be prepared for lots of walking and not many food stalls."

It lies in a very nice and big green area with hills at the side and is wonderful to walk through. There are so many different animals, for me there were a lot that I've seen for the first time in real. The prices are moderate and there are often places to sit, have a coffee or go to toilet. It was also very good to come by Metro and Bus. It was very fast and it seemed that there are driving buses all the time, we didn't have to wait for the bus on both ways. We had a great time there!"

Using the natural bluffs in the zoo (built on two levels) it can provide large flee flight cage and nesting areas for large European vultures, for example. The cheetahs have a hilly enclosure (family of five-mother and 4 daughters)-allowing the cheetah to sit on a slope and stare intently at the human staring back from the other side of the fence.Lots of interior habitats and animal groupings. For example- a small Sonoran Desert habitat with sand and native vegetation features four lizard varieties and a small land tortoise-all from the region.Extensive exhibits of breeding and rescue programs like the indoor/outdoor giant Galapagos tortoise exhibit.Well worth a day-good and reasonable restaurants/cafeterias. Easy public transportation access-Metro C to Nadrazi Holesovice and bus 112(?) direct to the Zoo. ( A special Zoobus runs in the summer).Best of all-reasonable entrance fares. In fact, if you are over 70 you get in for 1 Koruna-it pays to get old, sometimes."

Its on a hill and is filled with trees and other green plants. There are plenty of toilets and lots of little places to eat. I ate at Oceans restaurant which I thought was okay but not great food.I was happy with how easy it was to get to by public transport. I took Line C metro to stop Nadrazi Holesovice stop and got the 112 bus straight away. All up it took me 30 minutes to get there.The zoo is very big. A few animals were not out when I visited like the lions so be prepared for this. If you have young children it would be difficult to get through the whole zoo in one day. Also about 60% of the zoo is on an upward steep slope that is tiring to walk but wow, the views are impressive. I took 3 hours to get through about 40% of the zoo. I would suggest you pick what you want to see and head for that. Anything else you get to see would be a bonus.I am glad that they are building a new area for the gorillas because the glass enclosure they are in is small. I hope they build something better for the cats in the glass enclosures."

            "review": "We had a fantastic time.. A friend and I had a very fun, fulfilled time at the zoo. It is excellent! It was a public holiday so the zoo was a busy place, but the busy state of the place didn't cause a problem as it was still chaos-free. It is nice and reassuring to see that sections of the zoo have really been conditioned to suit the needs of the animals so that the animals can thrive and be as they are as much as possible. The animals that need ropes get ropes, the animals that need really hilly uneven terrain get really hilly uneven terrain, it is evident that the animals are given the food that's the most suitable for them, and that, despite their relative lack of freedom, the animals are left to do the things that they naturally really want to do. It is uplifting to see the animals thriving in their high levels of welfare and so my friend and I were able to see the bright, cheeky eyes of parrots, the hilarious polar bear, the remarkable bloodthirsty vultures, the really beautiful and serene deer, and so on. We were able to enjoy lots of richly interesting sounds made by lots of different interesting animals. It has been very educational for us, adults. Very often, you are able to get as close to the animals as you want to - being in that cage of parrots or parrot-like birds was amazing, it seemed like the brightly beautifully coloured parrots felt at ease, cheerful, and relaxed, enjoying us in the cage and they didn't feel distressed by us humans. The lemurs were very entertaining and fun, being so close to the children and adults, they've been very charming and active, and not at all aggressive - there was no problem on the Island of lemurs. Before we visited the zoo we already had lots of friends telling us what a great time they've had there and it's excellent. The zoo is a big place so if you'd like to take it easy, be relaxed and not watch animals too hard, there's plenty of opportunity to do that too. It is a very clean, orderly and hygienic public place but I found it annoying that people were smoking cigarettes a number of times during my half-day visit to the zoo. It would be nice if the zoo sets aside only several smoking areas inside the zoo and ban smoking everywhere else so that I don't have to suffer from other people's smoke while enjoying the sight of very beautiful animals.Go there!"

We reached the zoo at 10 AM through quite an enjoyable Tram and Bus journey, bought our tickets and entered a magical world! Abhay was most excited seeing all those animals, greenery and birds right from the start. We saw so many birds, reptiles, insects and animals for the first time; it was one amazing experience!From the polar bears to the giraffes to all those wild cats to the penguins, every experience was a special one! Another special part of that day was the awesome lunch we had at the Go\u010d\u00e1ry Restaurant which serves Czech Cuisine. We ordered slowly baked duck thigh served with 2 types of steamed cabbage and Czech dumplings which was simply fabulous. The Grilled chicken Breast served with potato puree, mushrooms sauce, cauliflower puree and caramelised pickled onions was also very impressive. The perfect weather and all that greenery around us made our meal further spectacular!Our 18 months old son had a ball looking at all those animals, birds and reptiles! This one is a not to be missed experience in Prague!"

Even in rainy or cold days. The Zoo is spread on the hillside bank of the Vltava River, so You have to count with walking uphill or downhill (depends which parking place You will choose). Of course Yu can use public transport and pass the main gate. In the Zoo You can take a ride on cable train too. On both levels rides trains for tired visitors (payed extra). On the highest point of the Zoo is 18,5 m high tower (free). I recomend to climb, because the look on Prague surroundings is great. Many of the spots with animals are new (the best is with elephant, hippos and giraffes) on the upper level of the Zoo. In the lower part of the Zoo are the best spots: gorillas, lemurs and penguins. Don\u00b4t be affraid to get hungry or thirsty- there are many places to rest and take some food or drinks. For children is in the lover part of Zoo a small village Zoo with goats, rabbits and other animals and the children can go inside to the animals. And for kids activities is in the lover part a Bororo vilage with bridges, swings, nets etc.Best way to spend some time in Prague is to visit this Zoo."

It's hard to even know where to begin writing a review, but since a zoo is about animals first and foremost, I'll start there. The zoo has an amazing variety of animals - some of which I've never seen (the gharials/\"chambral\" were the highlight for me). The enclosures for the most part were large and well thought out. If you had to be an animal in a zoo, this would definitely be the one to be in. There were outdoor areas, shelter, room to climb, water features, etc. That said, the animals were still very accessible to visitors. I was especially impressed with the mountain goat area, which was a rock cut on the side the hill that was at the centre of the zoo. Information about each animal was available in Czech and English. The layout of the zoo was great as well. I enjoyed the fact that it was built on a hill, which the planners have used to create diverse habitats, but which also made it interesting enough just for the walk. At the top of the hill there's a free tower you can climb for a photo-worthy view of Prague. If you don't feel like walking or if you have a disability, you can take a chair lift up or down the hill (which I didn't do, but appreciated the option). There's also a neat geological trail, with some impressive fossils on display and a shop at the end with some excellent specimens for sale. As the zoo is easily a full day activity (a day is a must if you want to try to see it all), it was good to find out that there were lots of opportunities to purchase food and water on site, with several seating areas. Bathrooms are available throughout, with no fee. One thing I really liked is that the vending machines (for pop and water) took credit cards, so you didn't have to have change on hand. Getting there was easy via transit - from the subway, there's a direct bus from the N\u00e1dra\u017e\u00ed Hole\u0161ovice station (making travel to and from approx. $3 CAD total). The cost of the zoo itself was minimal - they could increase the cost 3x what it currently is and it would still be acceptable for the quality of the attraction. The only \"negative\" is that there was no real gift shop at the exit (just a small shop with stuffed animal toys). There are small gift shops throughout, all with a different selection. Keep in mind that if you see something you like in one of them, you should probably buy it then. One other thing to mention is that though I was not travelling with kids, I could see that there were lots of different play areas that looked really cool. There's a whole \"Children's Zoo\" section, and there looked to be a neat play structure at the Bororo Reserve area. Even though there were areas with stairs, as the zoo is on a hill, there were ramps on the side where strollers could be pushed up and down. It seemed very family-friendly. All in all, I highly recommend this zoo, both from the perspective of a visitor and for consideration of the animals housed within. I would say it's a must-do on any trip to Prague. I wouldn't hesitate to go back, and if I lived there, I would definitely get an annual pass. Protip: Before I went, I read online that there were no English maps available on site (I cannot verify if this is true). It was recommended to download a high-res version (easy to find via Google) of the English map in advance and keep it on your phone, which I did and I found to be very convenient. There are pictures on the map to help identify which animal is which, but it was better to be able to read it as well."

The range of animals that were there was great-animals that I have never seen before. What put me off was the way everything was set up. Some of the animals you could only see through a tiny crack in the wall. Also, I wasn't too happy about the size of the closures, many of them seemed too small for the animals that were in there. Also, I don't mean to sound like an ignorant American, but there was hardly any English on any of the descriptions of the animals. For such a high of travel and quite an interesting zoo, to only have things in Czech was not a smart move on their part. I think they should at least have a guide you can buy or rent to hear about things in different languages. On another note, I really did enjoy seeing their variety of animals. Also, they did a tiger feeding, and that was also very interesting to watch."

Unfortunately it was overcrowded with people which made it a real chore trying to see some of the animals in the indoor areas due to pushing and shoving. It was a very hot day, and walking around on the steep terrain can become tiring, so make sure you come early as it will take a long time to get round and see everything. My favourite area was the alligators which is easily missedThe animals all seem to be well treated although in some places it seemed they lacked any sort of privacy (Good for visitors, but not for the animals). There are a variety of restaurants around and free Wifi (for people who feel the need to post everything on Facebook immediately). One of the highlights of the zoo is the view from the top which gives a great panorama of Prague. It was nice to sit here in the restaurant and cool down and relax tired legs.Getting to the Zoo is really easy using the metro and bus. The zoo is the last stop on the bus route so you won't get lost. There is also paid car parking if you come by car.This zoo is definitely worth a visit, but make sure you come early and give yourself plenty of time."

And there is a brilliant wooden tower which you can climb via steps. Which overlooks Prague and the zoo!! Not for the faint hearted but perfect for high up selfies! :)The zoo has lots of food outlets and toilets but be prepared to Que if your a lady. Only downside was access by public transport. As you have to get the metro and then a free bus from the train station. Which during school holidays was a nightmare. Hundreds of people trying to push onto buses every 15 mins. If you not keen on this use the metro and then get a taxi to take you there. It's a 5-10 min journey from the station.The cost of entrance was about \u00a36 each. Which compared to UK zoo's it is an absolute bargain.This was the highlight of our Prague long weekend. And we will be definitely be doing it again if we revisit."

But there is no children train to get from one to other and back. There is one children train in old one, and different in new one. And both paid. Separately. If you want use cableway, you are quite limited, small children are not allowed because cableway is very old and is not prepared for this. Food is quite overpriced, and not well quality. And...and...and...So make a long story short, animals are great, new expositions are great and all is falling down by bad services.

We did this on our final day in prague and it was a lovely way to end the trip. Entrance fees are also comparably very cheap which was good.Allow a whole day to see the zoo - there were so many animals here which I had never seen before in my life, and they all had large enclosures and looked very content. They even had polar bears with an artificial snow machine. The zoo is very well laid out and as another reviewer said, they have made excellent use of the natural terrain. For those wanting something more exciting, there is a cable car which takes people from the top point to the bottom of the zoo (with no safety harness). So if you're tired of the health and safety laws in the UK, come and do this for some rebellious fun and think 'Look at me! This is actually pretty dangerous but I am being allowed to think for myself and take risks! Thank you Prague!'The food however is pretty poor at the zoo. But there's not much choice as anything you pack yourself will likely taste terrible after you've carried it in a bag for hours in the scorching sun (if you come in winter however this may be possible). Overall, definitely come here. It's probably one of the best zoos in Europe and it costs literally a fraction of the price that any other zoo would cost."

Cable cars to take you to the top part of the zoo- went up and down these numerous times simply for the views over Prague- absolutely amazing.

We could have spent more than just one day in this place, we were there for a good 8 hours and still didn't see everything. There is rest stops not so far from each other. Really entertaining day, and really worth the money. Would most definitely recommend going here."

Short trip on the metro and bus to get to the zoo which was really easy and I didn't speak the language and I still found it straight away :) The price to get in was great and defo value for money as there is sooooo much inside to do. They have amazing views from the top of the zoo that you can see right to the river and get some great pictures or brave the chair lift and relax with a view. The animals enclosures were immaculate and perfect for every animal, I was so impressed with the size of the cages and the enrichment for the animals were fab. Check out the polar bears swimming or watch the apes swing thro there vast enclosures or watch the mountain goats climb to the very top. the restaurant was amazing and the dishes we tried were fab and great value for money, The zoo is very, very steep in parts so if you are taking anyone that does not do well with hills be aware as its very steep!!!"

The zoo was pretty empty and at times we thought we were the only ones visiting it. Most of the enclosures had ample space for animals and the zoo is clean, has plenty of bathrooms and food stands, at reasonable prices too. However, most of the descriptions of animals don't have an English translation. We particularly enjoyed watching elephants and tigers. The zoo has many animals and species, but not a huge amount. It also has a cable car that takes you to the top of the zoo, from which a panorama of Prague can be observed. It was good day, from morning to afternoon, in a nice weather. However, I am surprised that this zoo is ranked 4th best in the world. Maybe top 10 in Europe, but 4th in the world seems overrated. Nevertheless, it's a good zoo, and worth a few hours visit. It's also comparatively very cheap. If you are in Prague for anymore than 2 days, visit the zoo - you'll enjoy it."

Yes, there was a great array of animals, nearly any animal you could think of was there. However, the cramped and small outside quarters for the animals such as the leopard and the cheetah left a very bad taste in my mouth. I was very uncomfortable with the small inside area where the tigers ate. It was tiny and people were taking pictures with the flash on but there was no personnel from the zoo enforcing this. The honey badger round around in circles on the same piece of track repeatedly in his cell, it was if he had lost his mind completely. It was terrible to see. One of the large cats were limping around and was clearing injured but was still on show for the public. My experience there was not good and I will not be recommending anyone to go here."

With every animal needing careful inspection by our Granddaughter, we really needed 2 days at least! The animals do look happy and some are in huge enclosures.

Word of warning: The zoo is half placed on a large hill, so bare that in mind if you struggle with inclines. There are ways around this, for example there is a chair lift that takes you up and down, But to be honest we didn't see it until we were already at the top, and if your afraid of heights then your out of luck. The only thing I will say is that It would be nice if there were easier means to get up the hilly parts.As for price... \u00a36 roughly for an adult, for a full day out. We went through the majority with young legs in around 5 hours. But you could easily spend more time."

The day we came was so quiet, maybe because of the weather but it was great we had the whole zoo practically to ourselves!There are so many animals and the zoo is split up into different continents which I thought was a good idea. The only negative thing I would say is that some of the signposts seemed a little confusing and we weren't given a map which made it slightly confusing when trying to find certain animals - but I think we found them all in the end :)My favorite of course were the Polar Bears - I have never come face to face with them before and they are extraordinary, I've never seen such a huge animal!Definitely worth a visit if you're in Prague, I think we read somewhere that it's the 4th best zoo in the world so I'm definitely glad we went :D and well worth the money!"

The polar bear habitat was incredible with three bears. Stunning snow blowers churning out a cold environment for these amazing creatures even in the 30 degree plus weather! Very impressed.It is very child friendly with great viewing opportunities as well as play areas and refreshment stops. My 3 year old loved it. Only warning for those considering a visit is, have a good night sleep before hand and get there early. We rushed round and it still took 7 hours and we missed things.

I think you can catch a bus though. The range of animals is amazing, there was so many there that I had never seen before and animals I never thought I would see in real life. My absolutely favourite was the slow loris and the whole exhibit of nocturnal and very exotic creatures that I didn't know existed, all with bats flying around in this dark room - I was a little bit scared.

I would particularly note the shoebills; Sichuan bird house; African & Indonesian exhibits and the large African Savannah enclosures as outstanding. The bird collection is one of the best I have seen with many large aviaries with plenty that are also walk through. There were also plentiful small mammals.

We had lunch in one of the zoo food kiosks, and the food was delicious. It was one of the most positive experiences during our holiday in Prague. John Spiteri, Malta."

Spread out on hilly terrain with many spacious natural habitats and animals not commonly seen in smaller zoos, this is a top-notch zoo. It's hard to see everything on one visit. Particularly noteworthy are the cultural aspects devoted to the reverence for the Asian elephants--a small Hindu temple and sculptures of the Hindu deities Shiva, Parvati, and Ganesh (the elephant-headed god)--at the entrance to the elephant viewing area. We enjoyed watching two elephants playing in the water and then dusting themselves with red dirt. WCs and places to eat with appealing food are scattered throughout the zoo. We visited on a very hot, sunny August day, and zoo personnel gave each person a bottle of water at the entrance. One more plus for this fine zoo: seniors (over 70) pay only one Czech Koruna, about 4 cents each. It's not hard to get to the zoo by Metro and bus (112). Seniors over 70 also ride public transportation free!"

Its sprawling, has lot of exotic species, well maintained and relatively clean than lot of zoos you will see. Its worth a full day visit if you are with family. Although it was pretty sunny when we visited, there is plenty of shade inside the zoo. Must see are the penguins, giraffes and zebras. The African species collection & Indonesian jungle is also pretty good. Make sure you dedicate a minimum of 5 hours if you plan to visit. Also, make sure you carry a map which you get near the entrance. You should also carry little good as the option inside isn't much."

The enclosures for all the animals seem to be so much more free than back in the UK they use the most of the space they've got and great to see animals in the habitats they would be in the wild. From the mountain goats on cliffs to the African Savannah they all seem to be very happy and there is such vast variety of all animals there was nothing there I disappointed not to see. Conservation also seems to be very important to the zoo and saw plenty of new baby animals and boards up to advise they are breeding animals to actually release them back into the wild. Safe to say I will find it difficult to see such a great zoo and such happy animals over here. Definitely worth a visit"

Very easy to get to by public transport, and only costs about a fiver to get in, which is cheap compared to a lot of zoos elsewhere. The zoo itself is huge, and took us a good 3/4 hours to get around. There are maps all round the park, but I'm led to believe you can also buy maps at the entrance very cheap.Plenty to see and do for animal lovers, familys, couples and small children, we went early on but as it was well above 30 degrees most of the animals were sleeping or trying to get some shade so if you visit in the summer perhaps leave it til a bit later on in the day. Food places around the zoo are very cheap, especially compared to the city centre and portions looked to be very good values.The zoo is very clean, has plenty of toilets and is a lovely day out."

The animals are spread over a large area and the zoo seemed very steep indeed. If like me you find walking uphill difficult, or you have a pram or push chair, then seeing the African animals is really hard work. The only other way to get to the top of the zoo is via a ski lift. This is not possible if you have boisterous two year olds! They are too small to go on their own and unsafe and too big to go with an adult. The animals were in pleasant surroundinngs, there are good, reasonably priced restaurants and you need at least a whole day to get around. Not as enjoyable as most zoos I have been to."

Nicely recovered after the 2002 horrible flooding and thanks to its decicated staff the Prague Zoo with its marvellous setting in a rich natural scenery, carefully designed and watchfully maintained facilities and paramount all miraculously happy, healthy and beautiful animals is an island of rich and enjoyable fauna. The neighbouring Fata Morgana Botanical Garden with its rich green-houses is also worth to be visited - better separately not to overdo the mixture of fauna with flora."

The African enclosure was lovely to see a variety of animals in one large(ish) place. The maps are 5kc to buy which you really do need to walk around with since the park is so huge! There are lots of places to eat. We chose a restaurant by the elephant pavilion and had two meals and two drinks for 377kc (around \u20ac15) so pretty good value for money.Taxis outside the place try to rip off people exiting the park so definitely worth calling one before to get back to old town square.

This was on our itinerary because our teenage grandson is active in world organizations that protect wildlife and wanted to visit. We were not disappointed. The variety and quantity of animals was surprising, especially those considered endangered. I was impressed by the size of the habitats provided for the animals and the use of natural materials throughout the zoo to create a pleasant environment for visitors. If you are over 70 the entrance fee is 1 crown, about 5 cents \u2013 a nice perk for \u201cpensioners.\u201d"

Your metro ticket covers the bus fare too. Huge hilly area, so take all day. Plenty of rest spots, toilets and eateries. All on a steep hill, but there is a cable car up to the top if needed. I had not been keen to see animals in captivity, but it was a so nice to see rare animals treated so well. The elephants have their own pool to swim in as well as a vast area. Our favourite area was the tropical jungle. Marvellous, family day out, or leave them and go by yourself !! Would recommend to all."

For instance, you can find a giant frog that looked like something that would have roamed the world seas before dinosaurs ruled the world. Another enclosure held some exotic gambials, which are a apparently a crossing of ant eaters and crocodiles. There is tons to do for the whole family. You can tire out your kids on a playground and a little racing track with a speed meter. However, some of the older visitor take this very competitively and will often cheat by starting to far behind the starting line. Unfortunately, many of the animals seemed to be in a rather distressed state. A giant male giraffe was confined to a pen in which he could barely turn. But worst of all was the state of the king of the animal kingdom. Probably the number one attraction of the zoo, maybe in the whole of Prague, and definitely the reason I went to this zoo, the honey badger. I cannot comprehend how one can put an animal as majestic and intelligent as the honey badger in an 8 m^2 terrarium. There was nothing for it to do. It was just constantly banging his head against the window and walking up and down is prison. In fact, there was a larger areal attached but the door was closed for the honey badger. I guess it would have been too easy for him to escape. But if a zoo can't properly contain a honey badger, they shouldn't keep one. There is a reason very few zoos have honey badgers."

The facilities at the park for the animals and for us were very good, with regular toilet stops and food huts around, and also the animal enclosers were nice and big for them, which is always a bonus. The only thing I would say is we went at the wrong time of the year and it would of been a lot better if we went in the summertime.

Even the landscape is diversified and interesting. The elephant part and the birds are my favourite. There are food stalls everywhere, clean WC, affordable tickets, great playground area for small kids. The cable car is great, only not suitable for small children. This ZOO is actually not only a mere animal exhibit but a real scientific and conservatory enterprise as it managed to save numerous types of animals. Most notably the \"Horse Prevalskeho\". They really do care.I strongly recommend getting there by boat from the city centre. The boarding is close to Palacke namesti (Karlovo namesti metro station line B). Easy to find. The trip takes about one hour and half and after it is 10 minutes at most walk to the entrance."

It was quite hard to ask for informations, and i was a little worry of who taking care of these lovely animals, if the number of staffs is that little.

The zoo is much more extensive than the London Zoo (sorry, I have nothing else to compare it too) and at just a fraction of the price. There is a chair lift which I assume is supposed to be used as just a means of travel up the hill to where half the other enclosures are but it can be seen as an attraction in itself at only 20czk. As a student I got a discounted price to the zoo itself but it is still ridiculously cheap for how big it is (and in comparison to the London Zoo).Food is available too of average quality, as expected from such a venue but at a super low price (once again, in comparison to food in attractions such as London Zoo or any other museum). My only complaint is probably that there are a load of flying insects in the zoo (probably expected in a zoo but still something that seemed worth mentioning as it seemed more than other places in the city and also in other zoos and animal farms). Another reviewer mentioned that the larger mammals seemed a bit stressed and I have to agree.tl;dr: extensive zoo, cheap food, insects, not a must-see but still a pretty good place to visit."

The zoo is not laid out on the level and so you'll have to be prepared to walk up and down some gentle slopes. A lot of the animals are in the open and so you can get quite close (if they're awake as many are more active at night). It's great to see the bears/penguins/crocs from underwater viewing stations. I particularly enjoyed the indoor bat experience - be warned as they are free flying and may make you jump as they buzz past! As with all attractions in Prague we were surprised at the reasonable price of food etc.The one aspect I had a bit of concern over is the the chairlift. A great idea for getting from up and down to the higher/lower level but not only is it a bit rickety, safety is obviously not a major concern as there's only a loose chain to keep you in and I had to secure it myself as the chair left the station and the girls at the bottom were more interrested in their own conversation than making sure I left my seat. However, the ride is almost free at 20kr per trip (there's coin paystations for tickets).Just up from the top chairlift station is a viewing platform with good views over the zoo and surrounding area.I've been to many zoos and this is right at the top - especially when compared to the likes of London zoo which is not only expensive by comparison but also in need of a serious revamp. It is well laid out and feels spacious (which it is).You won't regret making the effort to visit."

As we were staying near to St Charles bridge, we walked to the top of Wenceslas square and caught the metro (museum to Nadrazi Holesovice) which is the Red line, then straight out of the station onto the 112 zoo bus. It was an easy journey once explained to us. Both the metro and bus run very frequently. We made the mistake of not eating breakfast before going, as we thought we would save time and eat there, but soon realised the type of food was not really aimed towards breakfast and ended up eating something similar to kebab meat and chips lol. I'd certainly say get a map and roughly plan a route, as the park is quite confusing and spaced out. We had a lovely day there and really enjoyed being so close to the polar bears swimming, they were mesmerising to watch. It was nice to be able to buy a few beers whilst walking around to, which were very cheap, roughly \u00a31.75 a pint and entrance was \u00a36.00 per adult, so a cheap day trip. The zoo itself seemed very nice, with decent sized enclosures, apart from the lions, which could have done with being bigger in my opinion. Animal feeding times are clearly marked in each area and there is a sky lift which takes you up the hill, with another part of the park and some great views. There is never to far to walk to either a toilet, seating area for a rest or somewhere to eat. All in all a nice day out."

I'm always in two minds about zoos - respecting them for their educational value and railing against them for keeping animals in captivity - so I was pleased to find that on the whole the animals at Prague Zoo are given plenty of space and seem quite content. (Some of the interior spaces were cramped, but hopefully this will be addressed in time; it seems as though the place is expanding and improving.)As an Australian I was also impressed by the comparatively large and representative array of fauna from my own country: grey and red kangaroos, wallabies and wallaroos, as well as emus and cassowaries and an enclosure with free-flying rainbow lorikeets.We didn't eat or drink or at the zoo, but if admission prices are anything to go by I imagine it's a fairly wallet-friendly day out whatever your age and whoever you go with."

Sharing one cage was 3 leopards and a black panther, far too small for all 4 of them. One of the Tigers is rather skinny also. The raven cage is also far too small and they cannot fly properly. Also the polar bears are in small enclosures.There are many positives about the zoo though. It's very cheap. Me and my partner spent around \u00a330 for entry and food and drinks. The zoo is very well kept and most of the animals have lovely enclosures and look very content. Definitely take the cable car seats to the top of the zoo for 20 crowns, it's a lot of fun and you get some awesome views!"

It seems that all the Zoo inhabitants are comfortaby livng there. You will not see any cages as in prison.The most interesting for us was the place where a lot of lemurs live. You can make a photo sitting with a lemur (or 2, 3 lemurs..) on one bench! You can practically touch a lemur (but this is not allowed, unfortunately). A lot of positive emotions!Wear comfortable shoes as it will take all day to walk through the whole territory, which is well-cared-for.The Prague Zoo is an interesting place both for children and grown-ups."

You might want to eat during this time, but bring your own food. The cafeteria was terrible. Food was dry, tasteless and actually kinda pricy for prague and what you got for your money. Altso it was really loud in there. Wouldn't recommend it. Think some of the animals seemed lonely and stressed as they walked back and forth a lot. Pack animals shouldn't be alone. The stress part might be a bit the tourists fault as there signs showing when you should be a bit quieter. Also the area for the polar bears was small. Can't imagine that's a good habitat even though they seemed to just be sleeping for the most part. Lots of rest rooms. Lots of places to get something to drink. Couldn't get into the WiFi spots, but there seemed to be quite a few around the park. There aren't signs in English, so study the map beyond the entrance. Overall a fun experience."

A lot of info was in czech we paid for a map on entrance. We arrived on a river boat when u got there you had like a ten min walk past a lovely chatau which was good. Got there about 11 am and left around 4 45 a big zoo so be prepared to walk.I always think a good zoo always have young and they had plenty here lots if different animals in good enclosures. The only one that hugely disappointed me was the polar bears oh dear that enclosure the size of a postage stamp way way too small for three polar bears they were pacing and doing the same over and over obviously bored. The enclosure about the same size as mandy the polar bear at flamingoland and there was one if her. Something needs to be done about it.The food outlets fine we ate by the one by the giraffes n elephants was pretty good actually. Had a lovely day and would recommend only about 6 quid to get in was lovely going and coming back on the riverboat. Hope they give the polar bears a bigger home like at least ten times its current size x"

We arrived early - 9.30am and the place was already busy. There is just so much to see - its just wonderful. Saw animals here I didn't even know existed - and I'm an animal lover. My suggestions would be to buy a map though - think its like 15 Krone or something. Almost all of the attractions have English translations - there are interactive items on some of the pens (wolf howling beside wolfs etc etc). I think the best part of the zoo was the \"free flying fruit bats\" section. That is one of the coolest things I've ever seen. You walk through their enclosure and they fly around you head (or at least that's what it feels like!!!). They have put huge effort into making this suitable for all ages - which I think it does exceptionally well. My only issue was that one of the Sumatran Tigers was very very thin. This may be in their make up and how they are in the wild but when you can see the top of hip bones - it made me feel a little uncomfortable. But other than that - I would go back again tomorrow if I lived in Prague. Well done - excellent!!!"

We went there when it was sunny and almost 30\u00b0C warm, so we didn't have enough energy to see all the animals and the animals didn't have much energy either, so they just slept. So if you want to see them do something else than sleeping, pick a cooler day. Also, demand a map, because we didn't get one when we bought our tickets and no one offered it to us. Don't know if they forgot or if my face didn't please them enough.

I recommend downloading or buying a map (its 5 ck) especially if you want to make sure you didn't miss anything.In the afternoon most of the animals got lazy and sleepy, especially the felines (surprise surprise) so I'm guessing that going earlier would be better especially if you would like to snap some pictures."

Some of the enclosures were terrible though with poor research. The entire Indonesian enclosure was pretty off, at least 4 different animals were named sugar gliders when they definitely weren't, one was a possum if I remember correctly and the other ones weren't even marsupials I don't think. Very poor English translations. The most interesting translation was a 'baboon' in a 6\" x 4\". I assume it was a baboon spider but I didn't see it so it could have been a miniature baboon... They also mixed a lot of lizards into one enclosure, they weren't labelled and they were put in with mammals. There was a fair bit of overcrowding in this section. Strangely, they couldn't even correctly identify people, there were pictures of Australian Aboriginals representing Indonesia.The polar bear enclosure was awful, they had no toys the entertain them at all so the polar bears were distressed. One had a cut paw and was walking up and down a ledge licking the ledge at the same point each time it turned around... urgh, it was depressing.Moving on from this section though there were some great exhibits, the bird sections were amazing, a lot of the birds could fly free, they seemed quite happy and they somehow stuck to their enclosures. The pelicans were hilarious, you could get quite close to them (keep small children away, they like to attack people) and the flamingos looked pretty happy about their enclosure.The wild cat section was brilliant, the cats seemed very happy, they were kept entertained and the enclosures were clean and nice. The cats were happy enough to breed which says something.The elephants were very happy, also breeding which was a good sign. This area was great, the maned wolf enclosure was beautiful, the antelope although incorrectly signed at times I'm pretty sure looked happy.Food wise the zoo is brilliant, there is a lot of choice, there's lots of beer, vegetarian food. There's a great cable seat that takes you up to the top of the hill.I wouldn't recommend this zoo to a friend, I feel that the enclosures are too hit and miss.

It was similar to Edinburgh Zoo in that a lot of the walking is uphill and it can be tiring. We had prepared ourselves sandwiches that morning because we didn't want to spend any more money than necessary (although we came home with a lot of travel money left over) so there wasn't the chance to experience any of the food available. But we aren't going for food anywhere - I want to see the animals! There is a whole list of animals you'd expect to see at the zoo. The highlights of Prague Zoo were:- The elephants: there were so many of them and there was the cutest baby elephant ever in such a playful mood. I think it was only 2 years old. It was playing on the rocks, climbing up them only to get stuck and try and maneuver down (and got a stern look from an older elephant like it had just been in trouble!) and it also ran around and made a cute little noise, like a squeaky trumpet. Adorable!- The owls: I don't know if I've ever seen an owl in the zoo - I don't recall it - but Prague Zoo had a few and we saw up close THE sassiest owl. It was a funny little bird.- The polar bear: the bear only had a small (ish) enclosure, or at least a small amount of water so was doing laps. It came right up to the glass several times.- The bats: as with most zoos there is a nocturnal enclosure and it was dark in there. The weirdest thing about this bit was that there was no glass screen or metal caging around the bats so they flew right above us and past us!All in all, the animals were not shy when we visited! We were up close to a lot of them and it was such a fun day out. The zoo was easy to figure out, although large, so we made a neat enough route around to see most of the animals (definitely all the ones we had wanted to see). It was a full day (or close enough) affair but definitely worth a visit for animal lovers."

The ZOO is pretty accessible. The parking lot is few metres from the entrance or you can go by bus. There are so many types of animals, lots of places to sit down, to eat, several toilets just everything you need. When you go down the hill there's a beautiful view of Prague. You can also use a cableway to go up the hill, it's good when you're tired or your feet are sore. I like that you can see all the animals very close and love the new pavilions for elephants and hippos. The only thing that's driving me mad is that I've never seen a porcupine because he was holed up every time I've been there."

There are some kiosks and smaller restaurants. We can recommend the Pizzeria place located on the top, got some nice views. Regarding the animals they range from small little spiders to polar bears. Something for everyone and definetly worth a visit especially with the very cheap entrance fee!"

            "review": "Great day at Prague Zoo!!. This is a great place to go if you are visiting Prague with kids. The ticket price is 200 CZK for adult and 150 CZK for child over 3 years. Check zoo website for the family and group discounts.Prague Zoo is located in the Praha Troja municipal district. To get to the zoo you need to catch the red line metro and get off at Nadrazi Holesovice metro station. Walk outside the station building and get on bus number 112. The last stop of this bus is zoo! The first stop being Nadrazi Holesovice. Also the metro station has mcdonald and other kebab shops if you want to grab breakfast or lunch before boarding on the bus. The bus takes appx 20 minutes to reach the zoo. The bus will leave you just outside the ticket office and on a work day there was no queue before us. It's highly recommended to have a map of zoo before you enter. You can buy one at the same time as buying ticket for less than 10 pence or can download one for free for your smart phone or tablet from here:http://www.zoopraha.cz/images/default/MAPA_ENG%202013V02.jpgThe zoo is very well laid out and have directions and maps available at many places but in local language. This is not a big problem and carrying a map will help in case you are looking for direction and is not available nearby. The zoo has abundant toilets, places to sit, food and other facilities. We were surprised to find the free wifi near elephants and kids play area.The animals are very well kept and on a relatively modest walk we could cover 80% of the zoo in one day after reaching zoo at 11.47 am. The zoo also runs a railway, paid separately, if you are tired and want to be carried. We suggest to cover the zoo in anti clock wise direction from main entrance because it was easier to walk steeper uphill pathway with a buggy in the morning. So from the map above starting at main entrance go to Polar bear > hippo house > African house > Elephant valley. From there you can go for a chair lift ride which we found a bit adventurous so did not attempt. Then we headed downward hill and mid alleys for tortoises and lion. In summary we tried to cover all animals marked with dark black colour :)The kids were amazed and wanted to go to zoo the next day as well but this place is highly rerecorded. The zoo is clean, food options are not expensive and majority of them being under \u00a35. On a hot day in May, do not carry any extra weight that needed, bringing a large bottle of water and camera. We loved Great Aviary and Chambal as per map.We left zoo at 6.30 pm and the exit doors are spacious enough for buggies for self check out. Please note that exit is different from main entrance and located next to fur seals. The bus stop for 112 return journey is just outside the door.Highly recommended zoo for a brilliant day!!"

If you are travelling by car, there is plenty of parking spaces (chargeable) at each entrance. Also prepare for al lot of walking up/down hill.. really! :) As for the zoo itself it's excellent - the enclosures are big and well maintained but at the same time easily accessible. Animals are versatile and looking great - never have I seen so many gorillas playing on the grass; tapirs, ant eaters, monkeys... looking so good as opposed to many other zoos. The Ocean Restaurant serves decent food at very good price - you will find there both Czech specialities and standard fried chicken breast + fries options. Scattered around the zoo there are also many booths with drinks, as well as one or two smaller restaurants. After the lunch, when you are exhausted but your children still have a lot of energy, go to 'Bororo Reserve' - a massive playground for children in the southern part of the zoo, near the main entrance. A huge construction of tree houses, rope bridges, slides, very well designed and suitable for children of all ages. In a word, a must see when in Prague."

The animals enclosures are beautifully maintained and are good decent sizes! 2. The sheer number of animals here is amazing. I've always loved chester zoo, however this has a number of the same species, meaning that animals are not alone! 3. The animals are really close up, and everything is a photo opportunity as they are so close. 4. The environment is beautiful. There is large spaces between each section of animals, but this is filled with flowers and statues which make it amazing. 5. Transport to the zoo is very reliable6. During our visit, the elephant enclosure was being cleaned. During this there were two men who had obviously trained the elephants and we're doing tricks and riding them. One of the elephants appeared to have some scrapes on it, 4 of the zoo keepers were checking this and looked genuinely concerned. The showed compassion to these animals. Tips....1. Wear comfortable shoes, there is a lot of uphill walking (if you are like me and are petrified of the cable carts you'll be walking ALOT) 2. Take a packed lunch and drinks. The food in the park isn't great, and the drinks are quite bland.3. Don't expect too much from signs, there is not much Czech to English translation (nor did we have access to an English map) 4. Some of the workers there don't have great English skills either (but then again, us English can be quite ignorant to the fact that not everyone speaks English when we feel they should) 5. Take a camera.....you'll be disappointed to not be able to see this again afterwardsBest bits....1. Polar bears2. Penguins3. Elephants4. Giraffes5. Gorillas"

It is one thing to see a tiger from 10 metres distance behind bars and another to be able to witness how the big cat is eating its food just a glass width away. You should save a whole day for the zoo. It is a great escape from the busy Prague streets and the entrance fee is relatively lower to most zoos in Europe. :)"

There is also a chairlift that takes you up the hillside or back down for only 20ck each way, which is convenient and fun too.

To get to the zoo take the Metro Line 'C' from anywhere in the centre to Nadrazi Holesovice (direction of Letnany) and then take the number 112 bus (runs about every five minutes). You can get various timed tickets from the Tourist Information office in the Old Square - 30 minutes, 90 minutes etc, but we found a 24-hour do-what-you-like ticket was the least stressful way of doing it. The zoo covers a large area on a steepish hillside running down to the river Vltava, and I would advise strong comfortable shoes. You will find yourself covering a fair distance. Having said all that, this is a cracking zoo! There is so much to see, and all the animals look well cared for and generally happy. In fact we were there in Springtime and we observed quite a number of very happy animals indeed! The Humboldt Penguins and the Big Eared Dogs were especially energetic.Probably best to allow a whole day in order to see everything. There are little restaurants dotted around here and there, and there are cold drinks machines (Coke etc.) all over the place. Highlights for us were the big cats (they have so many!) and the giraffes, but it's probably unfair to single any of them out."

The elephant valley is amazing! I also love the Indonesian Jungle and the Archaeologic walk. The best cooked food is in Gocarovy Domy, yes a little walk away from the main animal area but worth it!

All I can think of is that we went in the off season as almost all the animals were locked inside tiny cages. Their outside space is massive so it was heartbreaking seeing them clearly distressed, pacing back and forth in the smallest spaces i've seen in a zoo.If you're an animal lover you will not enjoy this zoo - at this time of year at least. The tigers were pacing back and forth, the elephants were confined to a horrible concrete cage all together barely having the room to move. The giraffes were the same. Their inside spaces were dirty. There were also orangutans advertised everywhere and when we got to their section there was a tiny sign saying there was nothing here.I understand that a lot of the animals will not be used to such a cold climate but in that case they SHOULD NOT be in such awful small spaces!! Something really needs to be done about this. The park is massive (we spent a whole day walking around) so they have the room to extend the indoor space.There was also lots of signs about how the zoo is prone to flooding, in their first flood almost all the animals died.. in the latest flood they said they had managed to save almost all the animals but it's still not good enough. There shouldn't even be a zoo where it can flood where there is endangered species. I would tell people not to go but at the end of the day if they don't, the park has no money to look after the animals. something needs to change in the off-season of this park. I'm sure in the summer it will be a lot better for the animals welfare."

I suppose and I hope, many people will donate like other animals.We go to Prague zoo every week. I must give it now five stars, but you must bring us pandas!!!What else? Red pandas usually sleep in the tree, polar bears sometimes swim and play. Cute are small leopards - three babys, now teenagers.

All in all, excellent facilities, and a fabulous zoo, easy to get to from Prague centre using public transport. Even though it's laid out very well, expect to walk a few miles in order to see it all!"

I always look at this as I am not really one to advocate zoo's but you should visit to see what great things they are doing at the zoo. We had a fantastic 4-5hrs here, we caught the metro which is very simple and then the bus to the zoo. The bus was 112 and as you come out of the station turn right!! We walked around like numpties for a while. Defo worth doing for something different in Prague and unbelievably inexpensive."

The location spreads over flat land that borders the river, a large hill that provides prespective over the city and other higher elevation levels. It seems well maintained and it has an organic, easy feel. Some large zoos (particularly in the US) feel more like extreme commercial amusement parks - not here. Of course there are ethical quesitons about having a zoo at all, but if you're going to visit one, I'd recommend this one."

You'll have a great day and suitable for all the family. From the old town area of Prague you will need to take tram 17 and then bus 112 this will cost about 70p for the 30min trip. One of the biggest surprises was the pizza restaurant at the main gates to the zoo. We decided to stop their for tea and the pizza chips & beer was amazing! Good food, great service and cheap :-) I would 100% recommend a visit yo Prague Zoo for both couples and families of all ages!"

The animals are quite clearly very well looked after and the enclosures give them plenty of room.

Also, we had food in a lodge and it was of outstanding value, amazingly presented - far more than you'd expect from a zoo! Perfect day!

The observation points for visitors were well planned to enable maximum viewing.Our only dislike was that having walked the 7 kms to the zoo, the bus and tram ride back (choice to save time and weary feet) required purchasing tickets with coins through a machine at the entrance. As we only had notes and cards these were unacceptable.We have since learnt that tickets could be purchased in Prague 1 prior to visit. Still the walk did us good and we were able to pass through the former Royal Hunting Grounds (Year 1265)."

The bears and the cheetah are the only animals that I feel could have larger areas. I've been coming to this zoo for many years and compared to zoos in other countries (Germany, Croatia, several in the U.S.) this is by far my favorite. The fee is reasonable and there are many educational areas and play areas for children. Be prepared to walk uphill as this zoo is built on 2 levels. There is a chair lift that will take you up to the 2nd level but that won't help you if you have a stroller."

However this is still ranked right up there, and if not Europe's number 1 zoo its well in the top handful.The zoo has plenty of signs with text in Czech, French, German and English and some really nice interact bits, as well as brilliant facilities for children. It must be awkward to work with the space they have but their use of the cliff (especially with macaques and ibex) is astonishingly good! There are a huge number of birds in old style enclosures but there were some exhibits which really stood out:The giant salamander house is amazing with it being lit in blue so that you can actually see it. However even without flash they were very protective about the use of cameras.The carnivore house was a real treat. Very clean (if a little too clinical) with some unexpected surprises in the form of reptiles.The seal enclosure is the nicest I have ever seen.The elephant paddock is not huge but makes great use of the area and is themed exquisitely well.It is a huge collection so make a full day of it."

There is such a wide range of animals and the polar bears are the most lively I have ever seen!

Services like restaurants, souvenir shops and others are really good and not expensive. Staff is friendly and ready to advice you. Animals look content in this zoo and have big space to live in. Theres also lot of animal species that are not anywhere else, just in Prague! I recommend all day to visit and enjoy this zoo because its quite big. We visited this zoo in Janurary so weather was cold, but there are many pavilions (such as terrarium, Indonesia pavilion, penguin pavilion etc..) where is warm, so all time here was pleasant. You can also take your dog to this zoo, what is restricted in many other zoological gardens over Europe. If going from city centre by public transportation, take metro to station Nadrazi Holesovice, then take the bus which terminates in the ZOO. Its about half an hour from city centre to get here."

I /wonder how it looks like in summer, yesterday (it is January) quite a few of the outer spaces were deserted, so one had to look for the exotical beasts in the inner premises. The location of the whole ZOO is soooo beautiful - it sits right on a hill / rock so you can see the river Vltava and its valley."

We had a long walk uphill to the Gulap restaurant and the food was basic but nice. Many of the animals were inside as it is winter. However there was still some good attractions. The polar bears were having fun although one seemed agitated. The giraffes were spectacular. The tigers seemed very distressed and you could hear their roar from far away.

There is one exhibit that is a must-see, and which we have never seen in any other zoo. It is the Hippo Exhibit. The hippos have a pool in which they can frolic, and one side of the pool is enclosed in glass, giving viewers a wonderful sight of what hippos do under water. We have seen hippos in rivers and pools in Africa, but never under water. It was fantastic."

Also, it seemed like the tigers are permanently kept inside behind plexi-glass? I *could* be wrong about this. I'm not an animal behavior expert, but it seemed like the large cats were exhibiting repetitive, neurotic behaviors... Such as nervously pacing back-and-forth in the little space allotted. One of the tigers was making a sound that can be best described as a \"horse sneeze.\" The highlight of my visit was seeing electric fences surrounding various animal enclosures. Thankfully I didn't witness any children being electrocuted. The yellow and black signs everywhere warn english speaking visitors of the \"electric sense.\" Yes, 'sense.' In America we would refer to this as a law suit. Heads up: if you decide to visit, be careful of the automated doors. They will automatically close after a short period of time (regardless of whether someone is still standing there). I had a couple slam into me. Protect your children."

Admission was very reasonable, I think maps cost 2-5 czk, not entirely sure. We didn't have one but the zoo is very well sign posted and there's large maps all around the place. It was pretty cold and damp when we were there so some of the animals were inside, but you still had the option to see them, ie giraffes and elephants. All animals look to have plenty of space in each enclosure and looked to be happy. There are plenty of buildings to go into and see various animals/insects that aren't outside in the open. It's a lot bigger than I thought and we dedicated 3 hours to walking around, but we were all in agreement that we could have stayed for another hour, at least. It's a very well kept zoo and it was probably the time of year, but it was pretty quiet and we had no problem seeing anything or waiting to look at the animals. Overall, I can safely say it was one of the best zoos I have been to."

There were animals we were not able to see before (communism has forbided citizens to travel to any other countries but communistic), but what job has been done during last two decades, i always find myself amazed. Its location behind the river has some advantages (like beautiful view on Prague and possibility to travel there by steamboat from City center), but also some disadvantages (like floods - especialy the one in 2002 was devastating)...so it has been rebuilt several times, using modern methods like natural paddocks for animals, new pavilons and visitors friendly environment. You can find there hundreds of animals, rated as one of the best around the Globe, good services and friendly staff, always trying to talk about animals they are responsible for, public feeding, stories about different behaving of there animals they are naming and even possibility to adopt some animals (donate money directly to animal you choose, etc.) If you want to spend a family afternoon there, you find yourself walking around without realizing, how much time you spent there. Worthful to go there, is one of the best attractions in Prague. You can go there by steamboat, by Bus (special line from Nadrazi Holesovice subway stop) or by car. You can buy drinks and food there and in the end nice merchandizing also. We go there at least twice a year and we always look forward to go there...Good TIP - close by is a huge Fata Morgana - huge greenhouse with beautiful park surrounded."

So despite the snow and coldness (-5C) we caught Metro then bus (112) to the Zoo (look for the 'Zoo' signs from the Metro platform to get to the 112 bus stop). For us this was 30 min journey and hence the cheaper travel ticket, The entrance prize was reasonable (350 Ck =\u00a310; 1 adult plus 1 child). The zoo map was in Czech - but easy enough to follow. The zoo is large but we covered it from 10:45am to 3:45pm (it closed at 4pm) with a lunch stop. The restaurant served hot meals, and again these were reasonably priced and good meal portions. There is a wide variety of animals, birds, insects, amphibians, and fish to see. Lots of information boards - but virtually everything in Czech (except the bat house where there is a warning about free flying bats). We enjoyed it. Clearly the zoo caters for larger numbers of visitors than Winter. The animal enclosures were well designed, clean etc. Catching the 112 bus back to Metro was easy as the zoo is the end of the line. To then get to the Red line Metro station you walk between the small shops to the right when you get off the bus."

Every hour there are exhibitions of the animals with a trainer who provides information about the animals. I especially liked the lemur talk. As the zoo employee talked and fed the lemurs, they often scampered above our heads on tree branches and vines. The elephant world was especially nice because there is a baby elephant now. He scampered about and convinced two other elephants to join him in the large pond. It was amazing to watch these creatures playing in the water. I would recommend taking at least two days to see the zoo because there are so many exhibits. I look forward to going many times in the future so that I can see everything."

Easy to get there (metro C Nadrazi Holesovice + bus 112 signposted ZOO and the line finishes there) It is a big zoo and a really good one, there are a lot of animals to see with very open enclosures - even when the animals are in their pens, the majority of them have a way to see them inside - We saw almost all the animals but did not walk around the whole zoo. There is also a 4 story high jungle gym type park inside for children aged 6+ which is rally good. There is also free WiFi so if you are taking your children there, you can catch up and plan from there. I took my 6 year old with me and we enjoyed 5+ hours there. Cable car was closed (winter) but that was not a hindrance as we could walk everywhere. Map has to be bought at the entrance (there are maps inside like in every zoo but the signage is not that clear - at 5 Kc it is also not expensive. There are vending machines all over (20 Kc for water) and kiosk with hot drinks.Overall, this was a very good experience and well worth the time and money."

We knew the weather wasn't going to be great so visited the zoo on the day the weather looked the best, unfortunately that turned out to be on a Czech bank holiday (17th November) so it was very busy. The animals had very big enclosures. I was a bit worried visiting a zoo abroad as you do hear horror stories It's a very big zoo and needs the whole day to look around. My only criticism was how busy it was but we didn't realise it was a bank holiday so that's our fault! It also would have been nice to read some of the signs around the zoo but only a couple of them were in English. There's a huge number of animals and my personal favourites were the elephants and polar bears. I've never seen a polar bear up close before (I imagine many people haven't) and the bear was swimming towards the glass where I was standing and so I was literally nose to nose with him at one point.Would definitely recommend the zoo for people coming to Prague. Also it worked out at about \u00a35-6. Which is the price of a guide in places like London and Whipsnade so it's very good value for money.."

The zoo has a lot of hills, even with our jogging stroller it was a bit strenuous, up the first few hills. It's a huge place, it took us 5 hours to complete including a 45 minute lunch. Our favorite was the polar bear, he swam right up to the glass and we got some great pics. Second were the Tigers, we got there at feeding time and that great to see. The exhibits are awesome, very close but safe. We ate Lunch at a pizzeria, had delicious lentil soups, hot chocolates, 2 coffees, and a pizza to share for under 75 CZ AND HAD AN AMAZING VIEW OF THE CITY. we have been to a lot of zoos and this is one of the best so far.

It really is a fantastic zoo - my nine year-old old daughter absolutely loved it. In particular there is a real sense of being close to the animals. Watching the hippos swimming underwater was a real highlight. Most of the enclosures are modern and spacious, there is loads of information about the animals and so much to see - there is definitely more than you can fit into one day. Catering is fine with outlets well spread over the site - standard (Czech) fast food I think but on a warm day there are lots of spots where you could picnic.Admission is excellent value especially compared to UK animal attractions and the prices in the small shops are reasonable too.We drove there - it's not on the tram or metro but there is a bus and I think in the summer you can take a boat trip there which we'll definitely do another time."

The zoo was huge, the enclosures were beautiful, there was such diversity of animals and it was very walkable! I would highly recommend this during your visit to Prague, even if you're not with children it's a blast. It breaks up the constant sight-seeing that a Euro-trip tends to have. Clean, fun, interesting, and beautiful."

Although it was nearly completely devastated by the floods in 2002, it rose from it's ashes in order to surpass it's former glory. All exhibits are modern, allowing the visitors truly appreciate the animals in their habitats with as little distractions as possible. Trust me that the visit of this ZOO will make a great memory for the whole family. The entire ZOO is practically a huge park covering almost 60 hectares (150 acres), adjacent is also very beautiful Botanical garden you may want to visit while in the area. As you'll see for yourself while visiting, it is not popular only by families with kids, but you'll see many young couples holding hands, as it is a popular place for early dates... :) Don't miss the Indonesian jungle and the new (2014) Giant Salamander exhibit."

But tripadvisor is used to compare various activities. In comparison to many, many other zoos, I found the enclosures to be large, very few animals are kept alone and generally they seems in good health etc.So, it's a zoo, if you don't want to see animals in cages obviously don't go.

Though we had an umbrella- we were soaked through, socks wet walking through puddles. Getting lost and not knowing how to get out.....wish i'd got a map, better still not go today. What can you do with the weather? Assuming the weather is good this zoo would of been fun and is a great zoo- just don't go on a monsoon. There are indoor areas to rest us from the rain but still it was a complete waste of time. Next time need to at least learn the word exit in czech so to not get lost. Another is is animal's are not described in english so peculiar animals were of an unknown to us."

Most of them were on display though I wasn't able to find an English version of things which meant we might have missed some special hours when certain animals did something in particular.It's easy to get to since it's at the end of bus line number 112 Zooligicka zahrada stop. Prices are reasonable (250 CZK per person for an adult if I remember correctly) and don't let the long line fool you, it goes fast so you won't be wasting time. I recommend having a map of the zoo since the maps around the facility are a bit hard to find when needed and/or are a bit ripped.It is fairly easy to go around and there's lots of things to see. For example we spent around 7 hours there....but don't worry there are small cottages where you can get something to chow down and some refreshments."

It ia only about 30 minutes to get here from the apartment we rented in Chotcovy Sady area. Expect to spend around 5-6 hours here as there are really attractive things to do and see here...Our children really loved the Gorilla cage and also the Polar bear. in summer it will be very cooling if you just sit in the Penguin area and watch their antics. The best thing was we get to view 'Kawi' the tiger who was transported all the way from malaysia to Prague. We felt really proud to visit him there."

We spent 5 hours in this place and enjoyed every minute! Also- and this is important- according to their website: \"Prague Zoo is engaged both in ex-situ and in-situ conservation. It coordinates the breeding of selected species as part of conservation programs and keeps studbooks, but it also takes part in activities aimed at helping species survive in the wild, sometimes even running these activities. In many conservation projects, both approaches combine, with animals born in Prague Zoo returning to their ancestral homeland to be released into the wild.\" So... THUMBS UP for Prague zoo!"

It's a great day out for adults and children alike. There are play areas for the kiddies, but it's much more interesting to look at the animals.You could spend the whole day there, and certainly need 4 hours to visit all the enclosures, so don't leave it too late to turn up.. There is a general sense of space, and the animals look in good condition. One highlight for me was a herd of giraffe, including little ones, being driven towards a savannah area, where ostrich zebra and antelope were already roaming. Food for visitors is a bit mundane, (unless you fancy yet another sausage!) but you can always take a picnic, and not everything is translated into English. All part of the fun!"

We went in the restaurant that is in the bottom left corner of the site map next to Gocars Houses and had a really good tasty meal at a very reasonable price!!! Location - We got a boat from Czech Bridge near the town centre in Prague which cost around \u00a36 return per person, it took 50mins and was a lovely way to travel to and from the Zoo.Negatives - The hippo enclosure was the only let down for us as it was small and the water was not clear so we only saw their nostrils. It would be nice if they could put a path around the Sahara plains area as we were only able to stand at one end and look at the animals from a fair distance.

At the Nadrazi Holosevice we took a bus 112 towards Zoologiska zahrada. Entrance fee is 200 konunas and a map is 5 korunas. Unfortunately, they didn't have a map in English, so we bought in Czech. The map is not very accurate, we could not find Gorillas. And we think, we were not alone. The Zoo itself is well-maintained, spacious, very clean. Lots of animals, some of them I've seen first time; even I consider myself a big Zoo fan. We, especiailly, enjoyed the enclosures with polo bears, penguins and elephants. Polo bears were swimming back and forth, even on the back. It was a lot of fun. Penguins were performing a little show. You could touch a glass in the pool and they would swim a wig their tails and little wings for you. Very cute. There are plenty of restaurants and food places in the Zoo.

It was on a very big hill, so be prepared for alot of walking, although there is a cable car up to the top. Lots of nice places to stop and rest/ get a bite to eat. The zoo was really easy to get to by Metro and bus. Would recommend to all visiting Prague!"

A large selection of birds, which might surprise you, and they've also been heavily advertising the giant chinese salamanders they've got (spoiler: they tend to sit in their pools and face the wall under moving water -- you can't see them hardly at all).They also have a very good selection of big cats and elephants and even some fun hippos. They've got wolves and kangaroos and lots of stuff you might not see in quite that number in a zoo in the US. I was also impressed by how much room they give some of the animals.It's a little intimidating to get to if you don't do much traveling around Prague, but it's really just a subway trip and a 10 minute bus to the zoo itself. There's also vineyards and other parks nearby."

The chairlift was scary and i wouldn't allow small children take the chairlift alone.There is only single seats and the security chain is not so secure, because it is manually put in place after take off. I don't like hights but i don't panic easily so i survived the trip but didn't enjoy at all that. Also the food and drink selection was awful. There was only water sold suitable for me. The bier selection was also bad on my husbands taste, so we left there very hungry and thirsty after spending 5 hours on the area."

It is absolutely massive, we spent from 12pm-7pm there and still didn't get to see everything (sorry Bisons, maybe next time). Fee to get in is reasonable, if you are a student take your ID with you! It worked out to be \u00a35 each with out student cards, I think without them it worked out around \u00a37-\u00a38 each. However here are a few things we found about going on a trip to the zoo: very easy to get to, metro (red line) then the bus 112 (I think) or Zoo bus takes you there. We took the advice of others on here and went on a week day, however we didn't go early (due to over-sleeping oops!) and arrived at the zoo around 12 pm, and by golly the queue was large, out the zoo and round the corner. I regretted those extra hours in bed immediately, however, in reality the queue went down very quickly, we were probably waiting for 25 minutes max. So if you aren't the waiting type then I would suggest getting there early. The beer is around \u00a31 there, really not expensive at all and the food wasn't badly priced either, we brought a packed lunch yet looking back, for the 2 of us we probably didn't need it, if there's a large group of you though I can imagine it getting pricey pretty quickly. We also bought a zoo map, others say there is no need but for 5 crowns (which is like 6 pence) I believed it was fully worth it for the moments where there wasn't a large map near us and we required knowledge of where to go. The chair lift is definitely worth doing, its 20 crowns a journey but it was nice to get an overall view of the zoo (better on the way down than the way up). Overall it was a great day out, I would recommend this to anyone who loves the zoo/animals/doesn't mind walking a lot. Just an awesome day out!"

The Prague zoo that I visited with my family on Wednesday is clearly the best I have visited. (The ranking of the rest is: Taronga (Sydney), Taman Safari (Bogor), Helsinki, Canberra.The Prague zoo covers a large land area around a scenic hill close to the center of the city, next to some vineyards and the Vltava river (which has sometimes flooded the zoo, e.g. in 2013 and 2002). The elephants, giraffes, zebras and ostriches have their very large enclosures in pleasant looking semi-natural setting. The big cats (tigers, lions etc.) have largish well-kept enclosures, with animals clearly visible, and it seemed that they could also been seen indoors in winter when Prague is too cold for them to go out. I liked the hippos! The area is quite large, and we strolled through most of it in 3 hours with our 3-year old, but did skip part of the area in the middle, including the moose/elk and some others. Reserving 4 hours for the visit would have been better. Tip: go early in the morning, starting at 9am, to avoid the crowds. This worked in late August. I wonder if crowds are bigger in July."

At entrance you can buy a zoo map for 5 czk but there is no need for it as the maps are all over the zoo. There are places to eat but also a relaxation/resting points at which you can eat your own food if you brought it. Great number of the animals and one of the best in the europe."

It is a good place for kids, they get excited seeing the animals, it could be on your list if you are traveling with kids.We got to the zoo with the 112 bus, the subway (I think C line) gets you to the end of the line of this bus. The price of a ticket for an adult is 200 czk. Be careful to buy also a map of the zoo, is not included(!) and it costs 5 czk.On the side you get cheap food, fast food.It is a nice, animal rich, place, but what we didn't like is the fact that cages looked all the same."

The walk up to the zoo along the river was very enjoyable, and you do get some good views of the city in the zoo.It is a very big zoo with lots of animals, but I would say that they have too many...I don't want to say boring animals...but similar 4 legged mammals in large spaces whereas the tigers we saw were in very small rooms & inside. Yes, it was amazing to see a tiger that close-up but you can't help wonder how unhappy the lad must have been in there.The highlight was definitely the polar bear, had never seen one before and there were two of them that we got quite close to. They also have a nice open area filled with giraffes, zebras and ostriches together.My favourite animal is the lion and we didn't get to see one except in the little room above the enclosures, that was a shame. In fact, there were quite a few animals that were just nowhere to be seen as we went through, but I guess it depends when you go.I wouldn't say it's the best zoo in Europe - I preferred Artis Zoo in Amsterdam personally, the animals had more space and it was easier to get around; you'll definitely need a whole day here if you want to see everything.It was very cheap to get in, especially as we managed to get a student discount. In terms of food, there wasn't too much choice but we ended up having a nice baguette + beer for a decent price, so it is an affordable day out. I'd say it's worth a look but I probably wouldn't go back."

Our journey begins with the happy promise of a wonderful zoo but don't be fooled by the wonderful scenery, this place has crippling flaws that will ruin your day fairly quickly, lets set aside the crying children that slowly pry at your sanity and begin with the walk ways, you must keep in mind that you will walk for a good long time on pathways that will wear you down very very fast, and don't think that happy looking train will save you because it is a anthropometric nightmare with seats clearly designed to fit children and not the adults accompanying them. but surely the animals are fun right? i mean they must have good enclosures right ? WRONG!! some animals are given enclosures that are akin to animal cruelty, the iguanas barely have enough water and we cant forget the cougars separated from their mothers and siblings, certain creatures are also under considerable stress such as certain lizards being harmed and chased by other larger lizards, and species of birds that are put next to other species that harass them and clearly terrify them. OK, so maybe you don't care, maybe you just want to point and laugh at the animals like most humans do, well then ill have something to concern you a tad bit more, and that is the security, i found it difficult to forget the terror i felt as i saw a cheetah pacing back and forth eyeing a crowd of people, this ofcourse wouldn't have been scary in normal circumstances but the thing is the fence was very low for a cheetah, easily jump-able in one try, have we so easily forgotten the San Francisco zoo incident ? overall if you don't get lost because of the terrible directions, and if you are oblivious to obvious security issues and animal rights violations like most idiots are then i suppose you could have a wonderful time pointing at that silly bird screaming in terror because of the intimidation from its neighbor."

We had to take the Metro followed by a busy bus to get there, but the services are regular and not too difficult to figure out for foreign tourists. The zoo is huge and you can easily spend many hours wandering around. Most importantly, the animals have plenty of space and look well-cared for. An adult ticket was only 200 crowns, which is great value for money. Overall I would definitely recommend a trip to the zoo: it makes a really nice change from the other attractions in Prague. Some of my personal favourites were the tigers, the penguins, flamingos and ducks (with incredibly tiny and fast ducklings) and monkeys."

Really enjoyed the lemur exhibit and were glad we went there in the morning when the lemurs were active and mingling with zoo goers. We went back before we left and the were all in the shade. Great walking paths and wonderful exhibits for the animals. We enjoyed seeing the polar bears swimming. It was hot but the shady paths and breeze kept us cool between exhibits. Lots of areas for kids to play and we enjoyed being able to get a Cider to drink while we walked around. Also enjoyed the restaurant out side the entrance before we took the bus back to the metro.

It's a huge place so be prepared for lots of walking, though to save those with tired legs they have a chair lift between the lower and upper level. The main attractions of course are the animals. They are housed in lovely large enclosures simulating their natural habitat. The outside sections are designed so that there are no need for ugly fences. They have also opened up the inside sections and have large glass windows which gives you a wonderful view as they relax. The information boards have lots of info about the animals, obviously the majority of text is in Czech however they have shorter summaries in English which tells you the basic info. My favourite animals to watch were the apes, expecially the gorillas. Had the pleasure of watching Richard the dominant male silverback eating leaves by picking them off the branches as he sat barely 1m from me - simply amazing"

Maybe it would be worth to repeat a few recommendation which I read here and for what I\u2019m thankful to Tripadvisor.First of all, put on comfortable shoes, take a bottle of water if sun is shining and temperature is high \u2013 the path will be long.Second, I confirm that it will be better to start your hike from upper part of the zoo. Otherwise after exploring lower part of the zoo you won\u2019t have vigor to climb to the hill. Alternatively there is a chairlift.Personally I was fascinated by a polar bear swimming in its pool. Only thick glass of the pool separates you from this wild animal and you can nearly touch its nose when it swims by you. Children adored that. I had never imagined I could be so close to that dangerous creature. The zoo has huge amount of various animals. Another exhibit in the zoo was mountain goats. Actually I was amazed by not the goats themselves, but rather a way they were presented. They were leaping and cavorting up and down on a steep rocky wall between higher and lower levels of the zoo. Descriptions existed for all animals and were written in English and Russian. But the most interesting text still existed only in Czech language, e.g. it gives interesting facts like a difference between dogs and wolves, home and wild cats.I was slightly disappointed that many wild cats like Fishing cat (Prionailurus viverrinus) were hiding somewhere and were not found in their cages and enclosures. But nevertheless the zoo was very impressive indeed."

Polar bear swimming face-to-face with you (separated by a transparent window), gorillas, tigers etc. leave an outstanding impression for the kids. A must-see is the seal show - all are cute and great performers. Although the show is conducted in Czech, the gestures are quite understandable.A visit to the Zoo can be combined with the nearly located Troja Castle with a nice garden, and/or the Botanical Garden.The Zoo is well equipped with WC's and cafe's."

The only thing to be aware of is that it is a bit hilly and so can be very tiring walking round. There is a chair lift to get up to the higher sections. Plenty of animals, although most of them seemed to want to hide when we were looking at them."

Visitors to Prague would naturally not normally schedule a zoo visit. But I advise if you're there for more than the weekend go!It's a little bit out of town, but a Taxi is simple (Zoo is pronounced 'Zo') and there used to be a passenger boat that you could take there and I'm sure still is.You get up close to the animals in a mixture of large outside enclosures and inside pens depending on the weather and animal preference. Sometimes the zoo guides will be holding animals for you to touch where this is safe and not distressing to the animals.It's a big zoo, spread over a wide walkable area - you can hire a hand drawn buggy for kids - get up close to Otters, Penguins, Giraffe's, Camels (sometimes fed by hand apples from outside the enclosure), Meerkats and hundreds more - the bat pen has bats flying free around you. I once got to see Elephants play football there with a very large soft football.There's also a ski-lift to get to the upper section if you don't want to walk.Google it and go."

Had explored the lovely buildings and the castles of Prague on the previous days and wanted a change of scenery to keep the children happy! Took a Taxi from the hotel in Prague due to convenience as the other options involved a metro and a bus or a steamboat. Cost of taxi 400 CSK one way.Entry to the zoo cost 200 csk per adult or 6 pounds!! So cheap and worth each penny and more, Recommend buying a map at the entrance as the zoo is massive and no real signs in the Zoo. The enclosures for the animals are spacious and well laid out. The zoo is based on two levels and we managed to do both despite having two strollers with us. The hill is steep but doable in 5-7 minutes. Highlights of the day were seeing the Gorillas, Indonesian jungle, Elephants area, Lion and Tiger Area. The view from the top-tower is good but avoidable if travelling with kids. Plenty of open areas for the kids to play in. We found the food disappointing probably because we chose the wrong restaurant and due to dietary restrictions (vegetarian). Overall we spent 8 hours in the zoo and thoroughly enjoyed it. Will rank it as one of the best zoo we have visited."

The enclosures were well laid out and spacious. The types of animals here are very diverse and some we hadn't seen in other zoos we have visited such as the extremely rare Przewalski\u2019s Horse. There were numerous baby animals and we even saw several animals trying to make babies!!! The only part of the zoo that we were not happy was was the Feline Pavilion home to various wild cats, although we did have the amazing experience of being right next to a sleeping tiger only separate from it by glass. Food and drink prices were very reasonable - lunch for three which consisted of pasta, tandoori chicken with rice and sausage and chips with two Kozel lagers and a coke came to only 389 crowns."

It is more of a huge park with animals than a standard zoo so you will have to walk quite a lot to see everything, but it is very lovely and has very nice views. We spent around 6 hours in the zoo (including a break for lunch) and we probably saw most of the animals. We were there during and after lunchtime (11 am - 5 pm) so a lot of animals were sleeping after being fed and weren't too active so I would suggest going there earlier. It was a very nice day and we had a great time and enjoyed ourselves. A nice change from the busy Prague streets.On the way back we couldn't find the metro so I would just suggest taking the steamboat back if you are not sure on how to get back, we on the other hand walked very very far (we got lost) until we found another metro station."

(60 hectares)I was really impressed with the zoo's range of animals and their impeccable living conditions. The habitats are cleverly landscaped so you can come really close to animals without any risk to them or yourself. The enclosed Indonesian jungle was a highlight: it looks and feels like you're in an actual jungle! I loved the reptiles, the giraffes and the herd of elephants. The gorilla family is just hilarious, especially their rowdy 'teenage' son.This zoo is a must-visit for any animal lover and families.

Beer is everywhere. Lots of kids play areas. Even fun trolleys for kids are being available if you come early.The main reason why we decided to give this review though is that if you plan your trip to Prague within next 2 or 3 months, please keep in mind that most roads in a neighbouring area are under reconstruction now and it could be difficult to get there by car at least (I am not positive about public transport).

Must say that the Prague Zoo is the best -its location is superb -on hills and in the valley of Vltava River. We loved the African exhibit, the tower on the top of the hill, many children playgrounds, unique Przewalski horses. It is a great feat to renovate after two floods but they did it like the Phoenix bird, every time better and bigger. And their efforts pa back. Congratulations Zoo Praha!!!!"

The history of Prague Zoo goes all the way back to the year 1881, when, on the occasion of the wedding of Crown Prince Rudolf and Princess Stephanie of Belgium, Count Sweerts-Sporck published an open letter in the newspapers calling for the establishment of a zoological garden in Prague.Prague Zoo offers you exciting things to do all day. As you observe our animals, you may grow hungry, or you may perhaps wish to buy a souvenir featuring your favorite animal. Thanks to the excellent services offered by our zoo, you can enjoy your visit to the full. Provided for visitors are parking lots, a number of restaurants, a children\u2019s play area and many other smaller playgrounds, as well as an observation tower. The wide array of services we offer also include an electronic information system, available free of charge at several sites with free Wi-Fi connection."

There are even cable charis if you don't want to walk as the zoo is built on two levels on a hill."

There is the always the feeling that the zoo is designed for the animals and not for the humans. It is not a big zoo, but has plenty of animals and an amazing range of activities for children. The animals are not really caged, for example the monkeys have their own island surrounded by a moat, large trees and very natural environment. Humans can brings their dogs too, and there was plenty of well behaved dogs and families. Lots of refreshment areas, toilets etc. highly recommend a visit, transport links, tram and bus from Central Prague are excellent."

Take advantage of the wonderful restaurants that have gardens and great views! Beer is also available at the Zoo for adults that crave to quench their thirst."

There is a big focus on conservation and helping to breed endangered animals and introducing them back into their natural environments. There are two levels to the zoo, you reach the top level by walking or getting the chair lift (which is really scary!!!). We saw loads of animals (for example: gorilla's, polar bears, elephants, tigers, seals, penguins, bison etc). Most of the info is written in Czech but there is a little bit in English. The restaurant near the top of the chair life is amazing! Really lovely pasta and pizza, much better than the food you usually get at these kind of tourist attractions. There is a lot of walking involved. If you have children, they provide cool little trucks that you can pull them around in!There are a few shops but they are tiny and they don't seem to sell anything that advertises the zoo which seemed odd? But overall we really recommend the zoo! Oh, and the views from the top level are amazing!"

The tigers were pretty amazing too because we were only a pane of glass aware from them - particular when one stopped by my side and began to roar.

We werent sure what to expect from the zoo as we had heard different views.We were very suprised at the size of the zoo and it was bigger than what we thought. The cost of entry to the zoo was by far alot cheaper than what we would pay at home. When we got to the zoo we heard the awful story about the zoo being flooded a few years ago and alot of animals were drowned. The zoo was a mess and recieved donations from people to get itself back on its feet. Knowing this did make us appreciate the zoo more and the effort that the zoo has gone to.Being tortoise lovers we were a little disappointed that the tortoise area was closed due to being refurbed but there was enough animals there to see. The penguins were great and the monkeys were also good to watch. Theres alot of walking in the zoo and some up hill so make sure you have good shoes on.We spent 3-4Hrs in the zoo and saw nearly everywhere apart from some of the birds as we werent bothered about that.The eating places are an experience!!! We ate in the restaurant/cafe near the entrance which was like a school canteen. We couldnt really understand the menus as they werent in english but we pointed at the chicken and chips as we werent sure what the other food was. Very cheap food so we werent bothered, just dont expect anything flash.We would return to the zoo in the future, would be great to see how they improve even more areas after the flood. The animals looked well and being an animal lover i wasnt upset about how any of the animals were kept. Overall def worth a visit."

It's very nice long walk, I personally always spend more then 4 hours there.The tickets are really cheap (200 Czech crowns - ca 7 EUR), there are lots of restaurants (reasonable prices, the staff is unfortunately sometimes not so kind,...) and kiosks, souvenir shops and playgrounds. There is around 5000 animals of 700 kinds.Animals have large compounds and there are not \"behind bars\", only windows, with lots of thematic pavilions, educational programs, etc. I would mostly recommend to visit the polar bears, hippo house, indonesian jungle, chambal pavilion, lemur island, giraffes, fur seals and penguin pavilions. It's a very good place not only for families with kids! Even dogs are allowed here, there is also a bike parking lot, etc. etc.One big disadvantage, no credit cards accepted here! (There is ATM though, at the entrance, so don't forget to get a cash).And ask for a map at the entrance, it's very useful :)"

I especially like their concept which enables to observe animals in their \"natural\" habitat (behind windows, not bars, or even walking among some of them). It is also baby friendly (there is a couple of playgrounds,mini zoo where kids can touch and feed some domestic animals, changing tables in public bathrooms, possibility to borrow a stroller, etc.). Good website too. The only con is food in the zoo, you are either stuck with fast food (bratwurst, hot dog and such) or you can eat at \"Gocarovy domy\" which offers good variety of restuarant-style food for reasonable prices but is - strangely enough - rather baby-unfriendly (no changing table, limited number of child stools, uncooperative waiters etc.). A good way how to solve this dilemma is to bring your own food in and have a picnic in designated areas :)"

Then we took the little ferry boat across the river from V Podbab\u011b to Podho\u0159\u00ed, using Google Maps all the way. This boat cost the same as the buses and trams using the same ticket wtihin the time restriction.The entrance to the zoo was on the opposite to where the ferry drops you and so had to walk all the way around. When we got inside we found it to be a huge well laid out site. There's a lot of walking involved but it is well worth it. We particularly enjoyed the playing Polar Bears. They did seem to keep the tigers shut into a visitors viewing area rather then let them roam throughout the enclosure, not sure for how long.This place really is an all day thing, if you want to see everything."

The enclosures are vast and have been amazingly designed and planned out which really gives you a snapshot of the real-life habitats of the animals - this in turn enables the animals to truly behave in the way that they instinctively should! I have read some reviews from small-minded, selfish and heartless people on here actually complaining that the enclosures are 'too big!' and as a result they couldn't see the animals - quite the opposite actually, i saw every one of them up-close and behaving in a happy and natural way. The animals just looked 'happy and contented' - something i can't really explain but compared to London Zoo which is diabolical, it was amazing and the way a zoo should be. the zoo is full of long, winding hilly walks with AMAZING views of Prague city, excellently clean and tidy with flawlessly clean amenities. There were people constantly cleaning and sweeping. The food and drink is also cheap - as is the actual entrance fee - 200kc (about \u00a35)! Compare this to \u00a318 for london zoo where bottles of coke there are no less than \u00a33. The indoor enclosures and walk-throughs were excellent too. I would Highly recommend the visit - don't be put off by journey either - its cheap and easy to get to and from. From the old town its 2 stops on the red metro line then a short bus ride (every 10 mins), clearly marked 'zoo' outside the station."

The zoo did not give us free maps (minimal cost, but still a first) and the zoo is not language friendly outside of native tongue. Two of the elephants look very old and both just kept wobbling their heads back and forth. I'm not a veternarian or elephant whisperer, but this behavior seems to indicate they were either not happy or had pachyderm onset dementia.

A lot of animals were not visible as it's cold but that's not the zoo's fault. On the downside I didn't think the enclosures were that great and I felt so sorry for those poor Australian birds, especially the magpie who was clearly distressed - on the other hand the emu looked quite happy. Our big mistake on the day was having lunch afterwards at one of the restaurants at the entrance, it was the one that was not accessible by steps at the front.

We visit this ZOO every year in December and this year we were lucky to get there on Monday before Christmas Eve when the entrance fee was just CZK 1 - so it was quite crowded. Some animals are moved to a safer place, away from the river due to floods. Comparing ZOO Gardens in other large cities (Vienna, Munich), Prague ZOO is situated in quite a hilly area, you have to go up and down quite often, quite demanding in terms of physical condition."

The animals we saw all seemed to be content. The site is hilly and there is a lot of walking, but there were great panoramic views of Prague from the top! We were not too impressed with the food, which was inexpensive, but just not to our taste, so if we went again, would either take food with us, or wait and eat once back in town. We only tried one restaurant though, so we may have just been unlucky. It was very easy to get to the zoo using the metro and then a bus (well signposted and easy to navigate). We would definitely visit again."

A trip we expected would take a few hours took the whole day and I still don't think we quite saw it all. Also, (from my experience of zoo ticket prices in England) \u00a38 entry?! How do they manage that? Incredible value for money!!The zoo is built into the side of a mountain so the gradient of the whole zoo is quite extreme, this is not a zoo for the less physically able. But they do have a really cool chairlift to get you from the bottom to the top (or vice versa) in the centre of the park. I have never seen such a wide variety of animals in one place before. The polar bears took my breathe away. The tropical world, African world, bird world, night-creatures world etc etc.. all were fantastic and in winter, a nice break from walking around in the cold. However, most of the eating places we discovered were outdoors (apart from the big restaurant at the entrance) so bring your hats and gloves!! I have never seen these animals so close-up either. We got very near to some amazing crocodiles, hippos & gorillas. There were some gorilla babies on display and they were so cute & easy to watch from multiple viewing platforms! The zoo was also a fantastic example of how to give animals the space and habitat they require without compromising the experience for tourists. You felt the animals came first in this zoo, which was most pleasing, yet we still saw everything. Incredibly well thought out.I have read some people didn't see the polar bears- we went round to that enclosure three times and only one time they were not available for viewings. I think you've got to be lucky there, but two out of three times was good.DEFINITELY go to the zoo in Prague on your visit, whether you have kids or not! It also offers fantastic views over Prague from high vantage points, if the animals aren't enough to tickle your fancy!"

Good maps for English speakers and most displays have at least some English explaining the animals. It was so good, I went there two days.

Also the elephants have blood marks on the ears probably from electro shocks and many animals show similiar behaviour to people locked up in isolation cells for months.

            "review": "Made the mistake of visiting with a zoologist!. So I visited Prague with an old drinking buddy, forgetting that he had a degree in natural history. Whoops. So off to the Zoo we go... It's also worth noting that another friend came with us who had previously said that he hates zoos as he doesn't like seeing animals cooped up, and he specifically said that if he felt uncomfortable he'd leave.Ok, so we enter, realise we don't have a map, then have to go and buy one for 5kr. Then we hand everything over to Greg and follow him around.I don't think that a blow-by-blow account is perhaps useful, but let's try some highlights and lowlights.Highlights:The bird enclosures which visitors can actually enter through a double-door. They're massive and even my mother - who hated seeing caged birds - wouldn't mind them.Plenty of places to have real refreshments. I think I counted five real restaurants/cafes. Not like in the UK where this stuff would be an afterthought or a ripoff.The two-level hippopotamus enclosure was great - basically one wall is glass so the hippos can be observed underwater as well as over water.The whole environment was open, airy, large and pleasant.LowlightsNot many really but it would have been nice for the chairlifts to be open. I suspect it was too windy for them on the day we visited.This is actually my second visit to Prague Zoo - the first was aborted about three years ago as I had a twisted knee and painful walking finally got the better of me. This time, we walked and walked and walked - there must be several miles of walking tracks here - and I'm very glad we did.The verdict from my zoologist friend? \"Excellent\". We concur."

In one the tiger paced back and forth at the back wall constantly between two gates. (Must be where he's fed or when he gets to go inside) I came back 2 hours later and he was doing the exact same thing... Over and over again. The polar bears kept doing repetitive things for ages too. It was very sad. The flood happened not long ago so some animal areas were empty. Still a great zoo to go to none the less.

Even if the animals in are in cages, they are so big you feel no pity for the poor things. You can tell that the animals are well looked after and fed. For children it is amazing - they have lots of teaching sessions there, descriptions etc. And many many various spieces from all over the world.

We made sure we got there early and at 9.45 we just beat the crowds and were immediately amazed by how extremely cheap it was to go in. By 3.30 we were very tired with aching feet ! The zoo covers a very big area over and around a small but steep hill with many animals having big enclosures - especially the Elephants. The animal environments are made to be totally natural for each occupant - so much so that this can be to the detriment to visitors trying to spot a small animal in its natural habitat ! The animals are also very healthy and happy - especially when we were there the mating elephants and the toddler gorilla and mother playing together !!!!!!. When we reached a caf\u00e9 we were again amazed by the low prices of food and drink - not the rip-off prices we get charged at British top visitor attractions.Go early by bus or tram + bus - get a rest and a drink at noon - carry on and rest in the main refreshment area by the entrance/exit at the end and return by boat"

            "review": "Nice zoo but has a few drawbacks. Before I start the review, I will add that the zoo is still recovering from some flooding in June which caused a lot of damage and has led to some of the attractions and pens being closed. Before even entering the zoo I found the parking very difficult to find and we were 'wafted' by a staff member up a very steep slope which dismayed us as we had a disabled passenger. We eventually found another car park (by driving past the wafting man) which was on the level. The entry prices were excellent value, far cheaper than most zoo's in the UK. We paid 600kc (about \u00a320) for a family ticket which covered 2 adults and 2 children. The car park cost an additional 100Kc.Now, for a word of warning! This zoo is built on the side of a very steep hill. Yes, there are little road trains which whizz around (be careful of wandering in front of them as they are pretty speedy) but I don't think they cover the whole area. I did see some parents with little wooden garden type trollies they must have hired to pull their offspring along - it was quite funny watching them hauling them up the hill. But if you are elderly, infirm or have a heavy pram or pushchair this may be a real problem. Oh, yes, there is a kind of chair lift which wasn't working but again this may only appeal to certain people.The other thing I think the zoo lacks is enough toilet blocks, we did see a couple of porta loos, but this may because some facilities were knocked out by the flood.We toiled up the hill with the prospect of having lunch providing us with the necessary energy. The restaurants were very small, very full and seemed quite understaffed. The menu was fairly limited but we managed to find something for each of us. What a surprise when the meal arrived! It was really restaurant style food, really tasty and good portions. The price was excellent, only \u00a33-\u00a34 for each main meal! Now for the main reason we were there. The animals! Some of the pens were quite small, especially for the bigger birds. They reminded me of Paignton Zoo many years ago when I was a child. But I think the work is ongoing in Prague to build better facilities for the animals. The elephant enclosure was wonderful and we enjoyed watching the hippo from under the water as it has glass walls in it's pond. One of the attractions is a nocturnal animal display which was dark to the point of actually being a little dangerous and may also scare small children. The mountain goats live happily on the side of the very steep slope and it was fun seeing them in the sort of environment which they obviously enjoy, but looks so precarious.The zoo was very crowded and at times it was very difficult making your way around the various displays but this was to be expected as the visit was in the high season.All in all, this is a good attraction and I think the zoo has an excellent reputation for it's breeding programme. I hope they overcome their difficulties post flood, hopefully the income from visitors will allow for a quick recovery."

Have got there by a short ferry and a short walk to the south entrance. Entrance fee seemed quite high for the three of us (500 CZK), but was definitely worth it. We were enjoying the walk among numerous dormitories and expositions, marveling at the awesome seal and lemur show, having fun watching ground squirrels and penguins or admiring the majestic giraffes, elephants and hippos. Except for the poor ponies and donkies having to carry one child after another, the animals were apparently happy in their environment. Unfortunately, girls have been quite tired after a few-hours-walk, so we left without visiting the whole south-western part of the garden. Next time we\u2019ll definitely use the child cart available for borrowing near entrance.

The animals looked tired and bored which I guess would be normal compared to their natural habitat, but there are ways of livening up the exhibits that were not employed. The arrangement of the animals was disorganized and the zoo sprawling so that we were forever walking back and forth trying to find something on a map, and the signs were sparse.

The variety of healthy looking and happy animals is astounding! One of the best zoo's I've ever been to. The zoo makes you feel as though you are having an adventure and exploring the wild yourself with all the different themed areas!A few tips: I recommend spending a full day here.Make sure you wear comfortable footwear as the zoo is very big and a lot of it is an uphill climb, so your feet will be aching!"

Very good Zoo, scenery is fantastic and its in what seems a very nice part of Prague.Only disappointment was some animals were nowhere to be seen. On the day we went, the Komodo Dragons were missing, as we're some other animals.Our biggest gripe was why they keep the giraffes in a very small indoor enclosure when there is a mass of green fields near their exhibition.

You can see the animals also outside where they play but also at their \u201chomes\u201d. For example we got so close to the tigers that only a glass window separated us. We watched them while they were eating and it was just\u2026wow! I intended to write a large review of the zoo but now I realize that I have not enough words to describe how I felt by visiting the zoo so I will stop here and I\u2019ll invite you to go there\u2026just two more tips. The ticket for the zoos has the lowest price compared to the others zoo we visited but it offers you a great experience.

The zoo is well laid out but spread over a large area so anyone with children should take a stoller with them as it is a lot of walking for children. The zoo is exceptional value to get in and all of the money helps the zoo. The food and drink inside is also reasonable and there are plenty of places to eat around the zoo offering various kinds of refreshment.There are children's play areas around the zoo and they are all really good. The designated children's play area is fantastic offering train rides, water fun and climbing frames.The information is in both Czech and English and there are educational resources around the zoo.The zoo is very open to the elements so wrap up warm if you visit in winter and there are not many shady places during Summer so ensure you have good sun protection and take a fan.We have used the zoo boat to return to Prague. This was a fantastic way to end the day but the directions to the boat is not well signposted from the zoo and the staff were not particularly helpful with this. We nearly missed the boat as we walked in the wrong direction.The zoo is easy to find using public transport - we caught a tram to Nadrazi Holsovice and there is a bus stop outside which says ZOO. You do not need to pay extra for the zoo bus."

Unfortunately in the last 10 years they were hit by bad floods twice as the lower part of the zoo is right next to the river Vltava. First time I visited was not long after the first flood in 2002 and most of the enclosures and pavilions still weren\u2019t open. Our next visit was in May 2013 (only a week before the most recent flood) and we had a lovely day out! First you walk around the lower level part than you can take the seat lift up (or walk up and take the lift down \u2013 up to you) which is quite a fun experience and gives you lovely views over the zoo and Prague. The higher level is home to the larger animals and to the recently opened \u201celephant house\u201d (which was moved up there after the last flood) and the \u201cAfrica house\u201d. There is also a viewing tower which gives you great views of Prague (great for pictures). Our highlights were: baby gorilla, baby elephant and baby giraffe :-) I hope they manage to rebuild everything again the same way they did after the last flood and I hope that they don\u2019t have to go through the same thing again! If you have a spare day whilst visiting Prague & if you are a zoo lover you should definitely go and visit! By going and buying a ticket you will also help to rebuild this fantastic zoo!!!!"

There are also a few species here I have never seen before in zoos over Europe.Only thing I would warn is the Zoo is very spacious and this leads to a lot of walking including some very steep hill sections so people who are unable to walk far for whatever reason may want to do further research.Also the cheapest zoo I think I have ever been to.Wonderful day out and a must visit for Zoo lovers visiting Prague."

As the day went on we began realising that we were constantly climbing a hill of some sort and in one section of the zoo the views were absolutely breathtaking. After sitting down enjoying the views, we decided to make our way back to the exit, after about 2 minutes of walking this was the big surprise of the day, we see a hut and cables leading downwards, and as you got closer to the hut you were then able to see a chair lift!!!!!!! Obviously we went down via the chair lift, even though it is pretty short, the views are worth it.This is a very different zoo, the landscape, the views and the amount there is to see make this zoo so much more than just a place to see animals.

They've got lots of animals I haven't seen anywhere else (polar bears, hippos etc) and I believe they were happy.There seemed to be a few animals that were a little bit stir-crazy - we guess they lived alone and were a bit lonely.We also thought some of the birds were too confined and didn't have much space to fly around - this was the only negative really.The animals did look well looked after.Sections of the zoo were still closed due to the flood earlier in June but it was still impressive for such a cheap price!:-)"

Another plus: Prague Zoo is still improving - they constructed a new pavilion for elephants and hippos. Moreover, every pavilion is themed of the place where the animals come from. The only problem is the car park. It is not well organized and you have to pay additional 100,-K\u010d, which seems a little exaggerated."

I really enjoyed it. My boyfriend and I spent well over 5 hours there, only stopping for a hot dog and a beer. When we went a few of the habitats were closed due to the recent flooding in Prague but there was still plenty to see.It was easy to get to even though it is out of the city, just get the red line to Nadrazi Holesovice and then the 112 bus to the zoo.

The transfer location is obviously marked and the subway even has a little graphic of a zoo next to the stop where you make the transfer.It was both inexpensive and well maintained and I remember spending upwards of 10 or 15 minutes looking at just this one monkey enclosure with lots of trees and swings as well as an indoor area for the monkeys. We also really enjoyed the tigers and the red panda. The animals seem to be very well cared for and fed.The zoo isn't huge, so you should be able to finish seeing everything in about 3 hours but it's definitely worth your time and money.Highly recommend!"

Entry is very cheap in comparison to the zoos we have in the UK and came in at around \u00a36. We had lunch in the Asia section beside the elephants which was affordable and enjoyable.

There are cafes and facilities dotted around the place and all offer food and drinks at a good price. We sat and enjoyed ice creams overlooking nice views of Pragues old town near the Bison during our visit.My only recommendation would be that the Zoo could have included more English signs.

For such a small city - we were surprised at how nice this zoo was. We had just been to barcelona's zoo and was not impressed. So we were expecting something similar and was surprised at the quality of this zoo. Since I see so many zoos, I wasn't expecting to enjoy this zoo - but I did. And of course my husband loved it also.So if you are in prague for 3-5 days - take a bus trip to this zoo."

The collection is huge and animals seem to be happy there :) You can easily spend half of the day there. Getting to the zoo is a bit tricky, and would probably require changing of a couple of buses/trams. I would suggest to plan the roat ahead, you can get a map of their transport system at any station.It is strange to see however that Prague Zoo is not featured in the mobile version of trip advisor..."

I had never been in such a huge zoo before and first 20 minutes were pleasantly shocking for me. It's very important to buy a map not to get lost in the zoo. I would recommend to visit Zoo Praha in summer, because when I was there it was still cold and some of the aviaries didn't work. I spent there the whole day, but managed to see only one second part of the zoo. I fell in love with all the animals which I have seen there."

As controversial zoos might be, this one has a number of enclosures that are very well laid out and the animals seem to behave like in their natural environment. For example, one enclosure contained 3 different species (Mouse, Tortoise and small Lizard) and it seems to work. The indoor \"Theme Park\" Indonesia is fantastic, with tropical birds whizzing around your head and the smell of rainforest.Having said that, some animals in this zoos exhibit the usual behaviour issues that is common place in most zoos. I was particularly sad to see my favourite animal, the Wolf, trudging around in circles for hours.The Zoo is quite large compared to Zoos I have visited and has plenty of other things of interested, like exposed rockfaces where one can study the geology of this place. Great views to the river and beyond and (most) information boards were also in English.The caf\u00e9 is good but the shop is terrible."

In fact, we make a point of always visiting the local zoo when we visit a new place and this has to be the best one we've ever been to. Firstly, it's huge and pretty spread out, so it never feels too busy. One half is on a cliff / hilltop where you can get a chairlift (or climb if you prefer - actually you can walk along the Eastern without too much effort if you don't want a steep climb but the chairlift is fun) and there's a great sense of space. It really feels like they've done a considered job in recreating each animal's habitat. Also, everyone is walking around drinking beer. Beer, animals... what's not to like?! We also had amazing luck with the animals. It must have been a coincidence that they were all up and about and ' performing' to the onlookers. We got really close to the cheetahs (which they have incorrectly labelled at the Javan Leopards), tigers and hippos. Far closer than we have ever before.We had not properly investigated how to get there and thought we could walk up through Stromovka Park but unfortunately there are very few signposts, plus a lake and railway in the way, as well as a very steep climb, which together make for a very long, tiring journey. So probably best if you work out some public transport in advance. Either way, I would highly recommend this fantastic zoo. A brilliant day out for adults (not just kids), especially if it's sunny!"

To begin, a new director brought with him some much needed, and critical changes. The first thing that Mr. Fajt did, taking over an institution mired in the past, and severely damaged by flood waters, was to clean house. Old vendors which had enjoyed their monopolies for decades, now were faced with a process of selection that was both competitive and transparent. This had the immediate effect of improving food services and facilities. Then he traveled to Asia, Africa, and the Americas, where he found a number of new partners who were willing to help the city of Prague rebuild it's zoo. A new Indonesian Pavilion was added, and a large track of land was added, along with a new home for the Giraffes. These changes were slow in coming, but were greeted by general enthusiasm and appreciation. News of the birth of new Gorillas and architectural improvements were welcome, despite occasional closures for construction.The final result, however, is a Zoo which is in league with some of the finest in the world. It is not an inexpensive day outing, but the experience is well worth the price of admission. The areas where you can walk into the cage with the Gabon, or the Petting Zoo, take full advantage of new concepts in keeping animals in captivity. More than anything else, it is now one of the primary destinations for families with children or teens. Coupled with the Botanical Gardens, and the Troja Chateau, this is must see, and one of the penultimate day trips in the city."

At the time of our visit many of the enclosures were under construction and they were building new large spaces for the elephants. Polar bears and tigers seemed to be just as anxious and sad as always, pacing obsessively, but many other animals seemed content with their surroundings. They should work more on giving the animals stimulae, for example not just giving tigers meat but making them chase it first.The facilities were good, lots of clean, free (no charge) toilets and little cafeterias (staff didn't speak English very well).In many enclosures there was only one animal (like one wolf), which was a bit odd."

There was no leaflet for it in my hotel and no advertising in the papers. The trams dont go there, the metro doesnt go there, and its a complex job finding it. However when you get there is is absolutely massive, with a great collection of animals at a very reasonable price. I cannot remember the last zoo where I saw a polar bear, ok there was only 1 which was sad, but nevertheless a lively healthy looking specimen. Komodo dragons were also a recent addition and were very popular with the visitors, The gorilla pan was fantastic and they had several young of different ages, as had the orang-u-tans. It was a cold day and many of the animals were inside like elephant, giraffe, red panda, etc, but there was plenty to see. It was possible to go into the vulture/red kite enclosure without wire between us. The cheetahs were very active, but the lions and the tigers were inside. The zoo closes at 6pm in April. It also has a chairlift which was quite a novelty and the usual feeding displays/talks/shows including the usually amusing sealions. I also really liked the crocodile enclosure."

The zoo it well advertised and reasonably easy to travel to on the metro and then onto a bus which terminates at the zoo itself. The prices are very good for a zoo and excellent compared to prices i've payed for entrance to other attractions in Prague!Its a big attraction and has two levels, the level where you enter and then a second half on the hillside accessible by a cable car or a steep walk up the hillside. Unfortunetly I visited in mid February so a large ammount of the enclosures weren't open as obviously the African/Asian animals have to be kept warm. Also didn't help as we'd had a big covering of snow the night before so additional attractions were closed! Beautiful blanket of snow though!!Reccomend this 100%Easily a whole day out!!animals sizeprice"

The animal enclosures were lovely and the animals were very active and seemed to be having a great time. Our highlights were the polar bears, honey badger, armadillos, and not to forget the baby gorillas and giraffe. The zoo is in development but we appreciated that they are making great improvements for the animals that do not disrupt your visit and we will go back on our return visit. In all, a lovely day out if you're lucky enough to have good weather with a good walk around and great view of the city. Food is reasonably priced too in comparison to city centre venues."

The animals look comfortable and happy, and there is a great variety, especially in Spring when all of the babies are born! The PERFECT place to take kids- there are play areas, a petting zoo, and lots of plexiglass to allow little ones to be able to see too (the penguins frequently play with young visitors through the glass- its darling). The information in English ranges from pretty decent to almost none, depending on the exhibit, but things are steadily improving. The zoo has recently built huge new areas for Elephants and other African animals, so you can see that they really care about the health and welfare of the animals."

We visited the zoo upon reading good reviews from TripAdvisor, and we were not disappointed!The zoo is quite large and has plenty of exhibits. For some reason all their animals are active; we watched the polar bears for at least 15 minutes and they were just playing and running around.The zoo is built next to a hill, some paths are gentle slopes but they are not demanding at all. The view from the top of the hill has great views of the area, including the Vltava. There is an outdoor mountain goat exhibit that masterfully uses the landscape of the area.The animals rarely hide or shy away from people. In fact, we had a camel, an emu, an otter, a penguin, and various monkeys that walk up to us in their respective exhibits.However, all the placards are written in Czech (with some English in certain exhibits), so it isn't as educational in that respect.The restaurants and vending machines in the zoo are quite reasonable. I wouldn't consider them cheap, but they are definitely not Old Prague prices either.We went in winter during a snow day, so we didn't sit out much. But we saw plenty of family friendly picnic areas, sensibly designed and common throughout the zoo."

Very compact yet totally amazing the way they accomodated the needs of each of the animals. Great way to spend the afternoon. Reasonable price and food as well. Friendly, lots of families and dogs. Took the ferry back along the river to downtown Prague. Great way to end the day with a boat cruise - you get to see a different view of Prague. Reasonably priced as well. Definitely worth seeing if you are in Prague."

The zoo, as a main attraction of Prague, was easy to find and well sign posted. The zoo itself is amazing. We spent over four hours in it and only managed to visit two thirds of the enclosures. There is a large variety of animals in spacious and very well designed enclosures. Highlights included the gorillas, seals and the various large birds of prey. Do not miss the Indonesian Jungle if possible,It is worth the trip if you can spare the time."

I found the zoo very accessible to reach, it is served by a bus which departs from a train station regularly. On arrival to the zoo I noticed that the prices were very reasonable, 200 CZK which is roughly 8 euro which is very cheap for a zoo! On entering the zoo I was admiring the lovely surroundings, the zoo appeared to located on a hill but alot of it was downhill. There was a wide variety of animals and I was impressed that most animals had an adequate sized enclosure. There were various indoor displays such as the African house, rainforest and tigers. I was pleasantly surprised that the gifts in the gift shops were decently priced unlike other zoos I visited and there were alot of things to choose from. If visiting Prague this is a definite place you should visit."

As zoo's go, Prague's is definitely up there with the best, a grand selection of exotic animals, and their enclosures are a lot larger and better equipped than some other zoo's that I've visited previously. The layout is fine, it's easy to find via public transport, and the entry fee is very reasonable. We visited the zoo mid-winter, so a lot of the larger enclosures appeared empty, most large animals were instead kept inside smaller rooms, and appeared bored and lethargic. It hit home that animals such as tigers and gorillas do not belong in the kind of cold climate which Prague offers for much of the year."

The zoo is very big and has a huge amount of animals. I was disappointed because we did not see any elephants due to them building the new enclosure. My partner was excited to see the orangutans and we did not see them either. Being a rainy January day a lot of the animals were not out so we missed out on a few things. It made us feel sad because some animals only had a small space and seemed distressed or depressed! There was a tiger pacing and kept headbutting the gate to be let out. The polar bear and cheetahs also paced. The gorillas laid around and looked very sad.There were large parts of the zoo seemingly unused, and I feel that it could have been used for the larger animals to be housed in, instead of locked up in small tanks with children banging on the glass and taking pictures with the flash on!Most of the staff seemed young, and we approached some to ask where to find a map. Three of them all walked past us as if we weren't there. Someone eventually pointed us to the information centre for a map, when we got there a young woman was just locking the door, we asked her if we could get a map there, she rolled her eyes, tutted, sighed and unlocked the door. She then had an attitude when we bought it, huffing as we looked through our money. Nice customer service!Good value for money and you could spend a day here, just wish the animals had more space."

It is a very large zoo so there is plenty to see and the price of admission is very decent.This zoo also allows you to bring your dog as long as they are kept on a leash. You will find water bowls around to accommodate your pets thirst.

Me and my girlfriend arrived to the ZOO at 12:00 PM, was a bit snowy outside so we had a clear idea that some of the animals will not be in their areas. The surrounding area inside and outside the ZOO was beautiful !! Especially inside the ZOO. The guy in the entrance told us \"Today is a special day, price for 2 people is only 2 CZK\", we were very surprised by the cheap ticket pricing, we asked again, and he replied the same.. I think it was due to the fact that it was very cold and had only a few visitors but we didn't ask too many questions, he's English was very basic and even if we would asked to pay 200 CZK (which is the price at winter according to their website) we would happily pay. The ZOO is huge, at least for us....(comparing to Amsterdam ZOO) we had a great time, next time we will come back in the summer...Amazing at winter but still would be more reasonable to visit at hotter seasons. After a few minutes we started to feel a bit cheer by the fact that a few animals were \"missing\" from their areas since it was way too cold for some animals to just wonder around in their areas, for us it felt like a long walk in an amazing park with a few animals, so although some of the animals were \"missing\" we had a great time."

I enjoyed it but found it a bit disappointing.To get there by public transport, take a Metro (red) to Nadrazi Holesovice, which is a Metro/Bus station, and take the Bus #112 to the end.The grounds of the zoo are very nice, although it is rather confusing to walk around and there are several areas under construction. There are supposed to be some trams for internal transport, but they were not operation while we were there.Most of the exhibit areas are reasonably spacious, but it was difficult to see some of the animals and it appeared that a number were empty. There were some indoor areas with fruit bats, etc. One of the indoor areas appeared to have mice in several of the glass enclosed cages that were eating the food left for the exhibited animals. These mice were multiplying and one hopes that they will be removed before the animals become overrun.If you have extra time and enjoy zoos it is worth a visit, but I would not put this on the list of my top zoos. It might be somewhat better in the summer when more animals are out and more things are open."

To get there from the centre of Prague means travelling on two tubes lines and a bus, however thanks to clear instructions from our apartment landlord and a very easy to use system we arrived there very quickly ( tip on the metro when you buy your ticket don't forget to validate it in the yellow machine before you board) . The zoo has a pretty non descript entrance and although the ticket desk did not speak much English we purchased our entry tickets and an English guide and map quite easily. Entrance cost about \u00a38 an adult. The zoo is well laid out and easy to follow on the map, beware though there are a lot of uneven surfaces and some steep hills. There are parts of the zoo that are very dated, very old enclosures and yet huge investment is being made in other areas. The new elephant and hippo enclosure that is still being built looked amazing. What didn't I like about the zoo: some of the bird aviaries were very dirty with lots of excrement, some had tonnes of leaves on the roof which left the birds in darkness, and a lot of the animals were showing stereotypic behaviour ( some of which could have been avoided with better management of their enclosures). The other thing that was missing was any interaction with the public, keepers were nowhere to be seen , there were no keepers talks or feeds , would have made visit so much more enjoyable if we had been told why things were happening. What I did like : the grounds were very well laid out, the Indonesian pavilion was amazing!! Lots of animals I had not seen before and to have bats flying around you in daylight was an incredible experience. The gorilla enclosure was great and got you right up close to the animals,and we were lucky enough to get there as the gorillas were let back into their enclosure for feeding. We spent a good 4 hours there and probably a visit could take longer but in November it is very very cold and a lot of the animals were tucked up inside ( who could blame them!) Catering is limited, big restaurant at the entrance and then lots of smaller eateries around the grounds serving snacks and fast food, first time I have ever had a deep fried burger!! Would have been nice if they had the menu translated into a few languages, we had no idea what they were serving, staff could not speak English so we just pointed to something someone else had. Very small shop selling limited gifts. A nice afternoon out, some unusual animals but need to work to bring it up to the standards expected from a modern zoo."

Well laid out with planty of walking to be done, there was a pleasant display of inclosures. I was relieved to see that most inclosures had doors with an exit to natural outdoor space. Even more pleasing was the new inclosure for the elephants currently under construction. They are in for a treat.Loved the Bat Eared Fox and the Polar Bears were totally at home in the 3 degree day we had for our visit. Good enough for a swimm and frolic in the water for one bear. It was a joy to watch.Even enjoyed a meal in the restaurant after the geological trail. A very nice plate of potato gnocchi with fine bacon and sour cabbage hit the spot for a hungry-for-czech-food appetite. Reasonably priced too. Most impressed with the catering in this zoo after my familiarity with the crap found in hometown Sydney's Taronga Zoo. That goes the same for the zoo entry price. While the average Sydney family might need to save for a couple of weeks for a zoo entry ticket at Taronga, Prague's zoo cost myself and 4 year old just 300k ($15).Also entertaining were Australia's own sugar gliders who were having a riot of a time and giving a hysterical display if antics in their nocturne house.It is a good and worthwhile day out especially with children."

I challenged him and demanded that he slowed down, only to be subjected to a string of abuse in Cz - rather disappointing from a middle aged man with a grey beard and cowboy type hat !!

We actually took the boat from Prague rather than a tram. The river journey is pleasant without being spectacular. However, if you time it right you can travel from a further quay and include a boat trip through Prague as part of your day out (do be very careful when you examine the timetables as you need to be sure which boats leave from which quay). There was a 10 minute walk at the far end, but easy to follow and easy terrain. The zoo itself is quite varied to walk around. They have made an attempt to give character to each area (Africa here, rain forest there, etc.). There was a lot of development going on for the elephants when we were there, so I expect that to be significantly improved by 2013. There were times where we weren\u2019t sure the animals were completely OK. The three polar bears were simple parading back and forth in a very repetitive behaviour manner that was something you used to see in old zoos. However, this could simply have been because of the heat. Most of the animals looked content enough. One word of warning for the bat-phobic: don\u2019t go into the rain forest exhibit. Towards the end you have to go through a dark tunnel where the bats are free to fly around. There are half height glass panels, but if you get some complete imbeciles who insist on shaking the branches then you get a large number of bats flying out over your head. They are harmless, but large fruit bats. My wife doesn\u2019t like anything flying around her head, let alone bats, but you are not allowed to back out. Staff insist you walk (or run!) through the enclosure. We had a bite to eat at the small restaurant outside the zoo, which was OK. We didn\u2019t see anything inside that looked particularly better, but we probably didn\u2019t cover everything (it is quite large). If you plan your walk right you can travel from the upper to lower sections via a chair lift. Looked fun, but we didn\u2019t plan our walk right. All in all, if you enjoy zoos, you should enjoy this one too, and it does offer a change of pace from the crowded tourist areas in Prague itself"

And its so reasonable in terms of entry and food and rides (especially compared to for example London Zoo!). Recommended if you have a day to spare and are history saturated"

Needless to say, I was very impressed with this zoo.The zoo is located to the north of Prague in some hills near the river. The zoo itself is very modern (tragically, a flood in 2002 devistated the zoo, and killed many animals) and well landscaped. We went on a boiling hot day, but there was plenty of shade, the whole zoo being covered in trees. The majority of animal enclosures are very modern, being spacious and clean, and attempting to recreate natural habitats as well as any other zoo I have been to.There are various different themed areas, such as a Jungle area (in a large green house area, housing monkeys etc.), and more traditional insect areas or snake areas. The zoo is hilly, and there is a chair lift that can take you to the top of the zoo for a small additional price.The zoo has plenty of eating places, which are reasonably priced considering the touristic nature of the place.To get to the zoo, we took a metro to N\u00e1dra\u017e\u00ed Hole\u0161ovice followed by a bus (using a 32kc 90 minute ticket), and to get back to Prague, we took a boat, which was a very pleasant way to return."

There are many ways to get to the zoo, I went by bus 112 from the side of Prague`s `Holesovice` train station, you can also get a bus from near the tram stop at `Troja` or there is a ferry across the water from the left bank of the Vltava near Dejvice, I haven`t used this ferry myself, it is small but frequent. Personally I loved the Giraffes, (especially when you see them outside in the open) the wonderful Tigers and other exotic `big cats` and the wolves, this was the first time I remember seeing wolves in the wild, they are amazing. The Polar bears must be seen and if you like insects and small reptiles etc then there is plenty of opportunity to see these in the special indoor viewing areas. When I was there the food and beer eating areas were doing good business and it also seems like many tours visit here during their stay in Prague. There is also one other way of visiting the zoo and that is to catch a special `zoo` boat which leaves from one of the wharves on the river near `Charles bridge` ,not too sure when this service runs but it would be a wonderful way to get to the zoo. All in all a wonderful place to visit, families love it and the variety is excellent."

Since 1997 the zoo has undergone huge investments and is turning itself in a very modern zoo with beautiful pavillions with a lot of respect for animals. With the exception of the leopard and cheetahs who looked too confined all animals looked beautiful and well taken care of. We were especially impressed by the alligator pavillion and the tigres enclisure, seeing those during feeding time was a treat. We ended up spending most of our day in the zoo and as A little extra we also got a great view on Prague castle from one of the zoos viewpoints.

The enclosures are very well set out and there is a huge variety of animals, from goats to elephants and tigers.There were a number of places to grab a bite to each, all at reasonable prices.I\u2019d recommend the ski lift for some amazing views across Prague."

Visited with my partner who is not normally that keen, but really enjoyed Prague Zoo.A flood in 2002 swept away many buildings and this led to very good redevelopments since. Imaginative enclosures and a focus on endangered animals incuding Malayan tigers, Komodo dragons. Mountain sheep and goats clamber over a real mountain side. Giraffes, zebras, ostriches and antelopes have a large paddock. Elephants getting a new large enclosure curently under construction.Lots of educational displays, though mostly in Czech.The site is very steep and there is no obvious route aroud the zoo. Well worth getting a map - available in several languages.Food is feshly prepared and good and much better than fast food often available.If you think zoos are dismal places, try this one. It may change your mind."

            "review": "Day at the Zoo. We are Americans living in Prague and decided to visit the zoo for the morning. We got there at about 10 A. M. and left about 2 P.M. Our visit was on a Saturday and we parked within a couple of minutes walk from the entrance which cost us about 5 US dollars. We paid and were inside the zoo in about 5 minutes. I was surprised at how empty the zoo was on a weekend. I have been to the Denver Zoo and the San Diego Zoo and the lines are long and the parking is not close. The cost was 10 US for each and 5 US for our dogs,yes they could be in the zoo. I was very impressed with the zoo layout and the way they have kept it natural for the visitor. Not a lot of large signs and some of the paths are still dirt. The zoo is set up much as the zoos I have visited in the states except that here it seems that the animals are more accessible to the public. I enjoy photographing the animals and I was surprised how close the animals were. Even though I don't have any small children the interactive parts of the zoo was very good for the younger people, with lots of hands on things to touch and experience. They are in the process of building a new area for the African planes animals which looks like it will be quite nice. We ate at a small place on the east side on the way up to the top of the zoo property and the food was quite good and very reasonable. If you don't want to walk to the top of the hill there is a tram that will take you up to the top. There are plenty of places to rest and lots of shade on a hot day. We spent only 4 hours and did not see but maybe half of the exhibits, so it is easily a full day excursion. We drove but the public transportation makes getting to the zoo very easy from anywhere in the city. It is well worth the visit, and I it would be a great break from the tourist areas in the city and enjoy a quite afternoon walk."

Good variety of animals, stunning views and some great play areas for the children which were lovely for having little breaks throughout the day. The snacks and drinks were relatively cheap however the souvenir shops are small and limited in stock.

There are two main tiers with the larger enclosures at the top (giraffes, wolves, zebra, etc). If these animals interest you more, there is an entrance closer to the top so you don't have to walk all the way up or risk the perilous cable cars (health and safety, what?) The annual family pass is good value if you plan to visit more than once. There aren't many restaurants, so a picnic is a good option. Go early at the weekend as it gets VERY busy."

We looked for to visit Zoo in Prague for a long time, however our visit was spoiled immediately after we arrived. We bought one student and one 'retiree' tickets. After me got confused, I returned and claimed in my best belief that we supposed to pay a little bit less then we actually did. Lady behind the desk started to shout at me that she already told me how is it and what I want now. This really turned me off and so I complained about this attitude. Today I received general apologise from head office which didn't concerned any of the issues I did have. I am considering this as a very low standard of customer service.On the other side, the Zoo is amazing with a lots of places, where you can have close contact with animals, is perfect for kids and everything seemed to be cleaned to a very high standard. They are also building a new walk path which is promising a lot of beautiful views of Prague and Zoo itself, so something to look forward to. In general the place was enjoyable to be in, however building of new enclosures and lack of quality and healthy food in the area was a bit downside."

There are a lot of different animals to see, including some awesome snakes, gorillas, tigers, Galapagos tortoises, bizarre birds, and all kinds of others. But the best part of this zoo is how easy it is to get right up close to the animals. Many are behind full glass of course, but the displays allow you to see a lot of amazing creatures without craning your neck to try and find them camouflaged in some far-off corner. In a lot of cases, the animals will come right up to where you're standing, and most of them aren't shy at all. If you go, be sure not to miss the lemurs (you'll see what I mean).Overall, a great value and well worth the time to get out there. If you're in Prague, go to this zoo."

For just 200 CZK entrance we were not able to see all of the major attractions in an afternoon - a vast choice of different animals to see. I will go back on my next visit to Prague. i particularly liked the Polar Bears and the large cats"

When you get out of the metro station, look for a bus stop for bus 112. It will take you straight to the ZOO (the ZOO is it's last station). Ticket for the ZOO is about 150 krona's (for adults). And you can stay there all day if you want...Unfortunately, my friend and I didn't have much time since it was our last day in Prague, but we spend about 3 hours at the ZOO and we saw about 60% of it. It's a pretty big ZOO, most of the animals have good habitations, they look pretty much like their natural habitats. The diversity of animals is wide, if you have a favorite animal, you will most likely find it there.Maps and directions are everywhere (it's a big ZOO, after all), bathrooms if you need one, and there is a restaurant and some fast food stands at the ZOO entrance in case you get hungry.I liked it really much and I would be happy to visit it again, just this time to see all of the ZOO."

Lots of pretty shaded areas/walkways, plenty of seating and facilities to get drinks or snacks from machines & snack bars dotted about.Small children seemed well catered for with little wooden pull along carts for them to sit in. A small train went round the zoo which we didn't use neither did we go on the chair lifts up to the higher level.Should imagine they would be fun for some. Enjoyed the variety of animals there and particularly liked the orang-utans and the reptile house where we saw the keeper placing dead rodents for the snakes to eat..then watched a massive anaconda devour one! Well worth the very reasonable entrance fee of approx \u00a36."

I don't really like birds and fish in general, but enthusiasts of that will find it there too. It's cheap to enter, just 150kc per student, you get the whole day ticket. There are facilities to eat and to rest, there's great children area with a train, small swimming-pool and a play ground. ZOO is filled with funny sculptures of animals you can take pics with. It's a big ground, so get ready for a lot of walking, we spent there 6hrs at medium pace and still didn't manage to see everything. It's brilliant for friends, couples, families. Some animals were lazy, but it was feeding time so it's quite normal I guess. They are currently renovating some parts, so some animals are moved from their usual places. The only drawback that day was that the chair lift was not opened. During some days, at certain times there's a feeding show for particular animals, which I think might be interesting. Don't miss out on turtles, penguins and giraffes. They are adorable. there's some information in english, but not all."

We love city breaks and make a habit of visiting the zoo wherever possible, so we were looking forward to this and we weren't disappointed! It edges Amsterdam and is now our favourite so far.Easy to get to from the city - take the Metro to Nadrazi Holesovice, turn left outside and there's a bus stand at the side of the station with a sign for the zoo - bus number 112 which just goes backwards and forwards between the station and the zoo. Entrance fee is only 200kc for adults, which is half what you'd pay in the UK.The zoo is in two distinct parts - the older part is on the lower ground nearest to the main entrance, then there is the newer part up the sloping paths to the right as you go in, which utilises the natural woodland terrain and which they are further developing with a new enclosure for the elephants and hippos. If you don't want to walk up and down the sloping paths that link the two levels, there's a chairlift for only 20kc which gives you spectacular views right down to the city.A great feature is the indoor pavilions such as the Indonesian Jungle and the Terrarium where they have two huge anacondas. Far too many things to mention, but the silverback gorilla has pride of place!What impressed us most was the number of kiosks for food, drink and WCs dotted about the zoo. It was quite busy with school trips etc. the day we went, but we never had to queue for anything, and prices were cheaper than cafes etc. outside: rip-off UK please take note! Example in the main restaurant (very clean and modern with a lovely outside terrace) was a plated hot meal (not fast food) for 69kc - go figure!This is a great day out and is probably the best value for money you'll get in Prague. As you can probably tell, we were very impressed!"

As we departed the boat there was some confusion as to which way to go to get to the zoo but just follow everyone else! There were not any queues for entry to the zoo so there was no hanging around. Its a big zoo so we went to the building named \"information\" to ask for a map - we were then directed to a souvenier shop to pick one up! All the animals seemed pretty well looked after and had plenty of space in each enclosure. There is some construction going on as it looks as if the zoo is expanding but that didnt hinder our time there. There were lots of varieties of animals and birds to see - there were lots of species that i had never seen before. It threatened to rain a few times but there are lots of areas inside buildings where you can see the animals.We initally thought we would only spend 2 hours there but it ended up being 4 as there is so much to see. Returning to the centre of prague was pretty easy - we got on the 112 bus (we bought a transport ticket at the metro station the day before and got it validated the day we went to the zoo) right outside the exit then walked back into town via the Technical museum and through the park. It was a great day out and very reasonbly priced."

Prague has one of the best big cat exhibits I've seen (we hit it at feeding time and I cannot wait to get home to print out my pictures).

One thing that some people might not like is that you cannot see all the animals always...They have the opportunity to choose whether or not to show themselves... For instance, in the morning the polar bears were outside their 'stone lodging' but in the afternoon when we went to see them again, they were inside because it was too hot for them...The entrance fee is very reasonable!

We didn't see much of the upper part as our daughter was getting very tired after we'd been around the lower part, and the path up to the polar bears is still fairly steep. There is the option of using the chairlift between the 2 sections as well. There is a good variety of animals to view and getting there from the centre of Prague is very straightforward using the metro and bus network."

I really enjoyed being able to walk inside an aviary and look around to realise that the carcass on the floor was for the vultures that I was so very close to. The only downside for me of being so close to the animals is when children inevitably try and disturb the animals to try and get them to do something and for me I found it quite upsetting to see a couple of sleeping cheetahs disturbed like that. Prices were very reasonable (150 CVK for an adult) and the zoo does take a long while to walk around, so plan a few hours in to see everything. I am pretty sure that we missed a number of enclosures as it was rapidly approaching closing timeThe absolute highlight for me was seeing two of the polar bears in the water play fighting with each other - when one pushed off the tank I just managed to put my hand on the glass right next to its giant paw (I certainly wouldn't want to be in a fight with that)Two things I would say would stop me from marking this as being \"excellent\": one would be that the weather on the day was miserable with a constant drizzle, so a number of animals remained indoors or looked despondent. The other aspect keeping my mark lower is that there were clearly a number of new enclosures being built that will make the zoo absolutely amazing; I know it's going to get better."

On the other hand then they could be easier to find once you get there. And it's inconsistent. The Giraffes have about 200 acres whereas the Meerkats have about 20 square feet. This isn't an exact science, but seemed odd to me. Do they allocate the space according to weight or natural habitat?It's a good zoo. Just the signposting is confusing and it's too big to see in a couple of hours, at least 25% of which you'll be trying to work out where the hell you are and how to get to the next place you want to go to.But it's worth it."

The size of the zoo will require some time and energy, you may want to plan for that to be the big event and schedule some rest time before heading out to dinner.

Parts were under construction ad the zoo will be even more spectacular when these are finished. The entry price was reasonable (150 Kc) and its open from April to September. It's said to be in the top 10 zoos worldwide. A bad flood in 2002 badly damaged the zoo and the animals but they have bounced back and have made it a nice place for a family day out. They have a chairlift to move between the higher and lower levels of the park which seemed a little but dangerous though and I wouldn't recommend it for children."

There is a good selection of animals, some of which you don\u2019t tend to find in the UK , mainly the lovely polar bear, my main reason for wanting to visit. Most of the enclosures are a good size and well maintained but the hippo enclosure looked a bit tired due to it\u2019s age. Only 150czk entry approx \u00a35. Definitely money well spent, even Angelina Jollie and Brad Pitt have visited this zoo. Some of the animals didn\u2019t make an appearance probably because they found it a bit chilly and they were quite happy to stay indoors in the warm, we didn\u2019t see the orang-utans or lions and neither looked like they had an indoor viewing area. The gorillas do though so even though they were inside we still go to see the baby and friend getting into mischief which was funny. The zoo is fairly large, I\u2019d say around the same size as Chester (for those who have visited Chester zoo) and is a mix of gradients, there is a rather precarious looking chair lift in the middle bit it\u2019s not enclosed and there was no way my other half would have gone on it had it been running, it wasn\u2019t so that removed any option. It looked in good repair so I suspect that it was just closed due to the time of year. It would be easy to spend a full day here but because we did a walking tour in the morning we only had the afternoon. We arranged a taxi from AAA taxis (also reviewed) to take us and collect us from the zoo. The zoo closes at 5pm in the winter months so thinking that we could perhaps loiter until 5.30pm I booked the taxi to collect us at 6pm, we were actually done by 5pm and very close to the exit so we headed out, as did everyone else, it seems everyone obeys the closing time. We then had to wait for the taxi, poor planning on my part, there is a nice mansion over the road to have a nosey at over the wall but that\u2019s it so it was a case of sitting waiting in the cold for the taxi to turn up, he was 10 minutes early which was excellent ! Please read my review on AAA taxis if you\u2019re thinking of using a taxi firm yourself."

The animals are in large enclosures, some of it almost like a safari park, and they are obviously very well taken care of and happy. We went first thing in the morning and left last thing at night and still didn't get round it all, so we decided to go the next day to see the rest. The restaurant there is ok, it serves beer which is quite strange to be in a zoo drinking beer, but there are loads of picnic benches and most people seemed to bring there own food. It's very easy to get to, a bus takes you directly to the door, and I think it only worked out about the equivilant of \u00a34.50 to get in.

There was a couple of animals we had never seen before, and especiallt the tigers were a succes for my girls.The entrance fee was very reasonable, and the Zoo was easy to find with a GPS. But in the summer i suspect parking to be a challenge. The Zoo was quite empty even this lovely tusday in february with the sun shining. The park is located very nicely on af slope next to the Vlatava River with nice views over the city. Unfortunately a lot of the animals ware not out, but it beeing february this was in many places understandable. All in all a nice day out, but the park seriuosly needs better signs (in english!), and the petting zoo was totally worn down. The staff was helpfull but like many other places i Prague their knowledge of english or german is not good."

Having decided to return, I checked online before I went and was stunned to find out that every Monday in December they were only charging 1 crown for entry (about 3p!). Even the usual price of 150 crowns is incredibly cheap considering the amount of time you spend there (we were there about 6/7 hours). It is very spread out, with lots of hills, so you end up doing a lot of walking, which we liked but I understand that may not be to everyone's liking. They do, however, have carts that you can hire to put small children in and all those we saw being pulled along in one seemed as though they were having a great time. I was amazed at the size of the zoo and the amount of different animals there were to see. I particularly enjoyed being able to get so close to all of them. The highlight was seeing the elephants being taken for a walk around the zoo! I also liked the twilight cave, where the bats fly freely around you, and spent ages watching the slow loris! The only downside was that lots of the animals were inside their houses/cages, which obviously isn't as nice as seeing them moving about in their bigger enclosures (I'm assuming this was because of the low temperature).Getting there was easy. We travelled on the metro to Nadrazi Holesovice (C/red line) and then got the 112 bus from directly outside, which drops you off at the entrance gate to the zoo.I would definitely recommend a visit, even when the weather is colder in the winter."

However, my first trip to the Prague zoo shortly after the flood of 2002 I was astounded how much attention to creating spacious and wonderfully natural enclosures the Prague zoo had done. My favourite enclosure was the giraffe habitat with acres of space to roam in. The animals looked healthy and were seemingly not \"mad\" with cramped space as I had witnessed in the Berlin zoo (something unholy to behold). The zoo is so large its almost hard to see it all in a day. There are two \"levels\" one up quite high on the hill and the lower part. The crowds are quite large some days as we have tried to go during holidays and literally could not find parking (a premium). I would suggest taking public transit and avoid the misery of having to park a few kilometres from either entrance."

There is so much there & they are improving things all the time.At present they are building a new elephant enclosure, a very impressive structure which I'm sure the anilmals will benefit from.There is a wide variety of exhibits where you can view the animals outside & inside. The cafe is basic but serves a decent meal at a reasonable price. The gift shop is small & sells mainly toy animals but they do have a few books & postcards. There are small catering outlets dotted about the zoo, some have spectacular views over the valley.It not expensive to get into the zoo, we paid Ckz150 ( about \u00a36)to get in.The only down side is that it is not easy to reach on public transport so a taxi is the best bet."

The polar bears are very repetative in their behaviour but i have to say they are very close when you see them swimming. The gorillas are great. It is a zoo still being developed but well worth a visit. A good day out, enjoy the chair lift for great views of the city."

There is cost 300CZK but I got stung on they way back 480CZK.The admission was only 150CZK so that was great.The highlight for me was the polar bears. I was speechless to see them swim and play with the ball, it was an incredibly experience to get so close.I was very upset with the elephant enclosure. They seemed very unhappy and I couldn't understand why one male elephant was all alone in a seperate play, he did seem very lonely rocking back and forth.I found it interesting that they allow dogs in the zoo, some of the animals were very amusing with this.I said and had a nice hot drink in a small cafe which was well priced and pleasant to come in from the cold.Some of the indoor enclosures were very smelly which I ahven't experienced previously much at many other zoo's. Overall a lovely day out with lot's of walking."

The most enjoyable visits were to the seals in their tanks, who engaged with the public when they moved their hands around the glass. The seals followed.I was disturbed by the elephant enclosure and the large tropical birds. The birds were in such small enclosures they couldn't roost as two of the elephants seemed to be disturbed and doing distracted movements and rocking as though at the end of their sanity. The third elephant did her best to prop the other two up with calming nudges. The large black and white birds' cage was very small and they with four of them in the space of a small bathroom they were competing for a place to roost. With all that room there should be bigger spaces for the birds and the elephants should be in the countryside in a savanna enclosure like Whipsnade in England."

We however walked the distance and enjoyed the flat easy journey. The zoo itself was one of the best we've been to. Clean, well organised, easily navigated and plenty of variety to keep anyone happy for a full day. Being a hot day we used the refreshment facilities situated regularly across the park. A nice cold beer and a light meal at one of the many picnic benches was most welcome.A small point to note..we purchased tram tickets for our return journey at the zoo. But with it being so busy around the machine felt it's better if you purchase these in Prague beofre you set off."

I wouldn't bother going there if I was only on a very short stop in Prague, but if you're there longer, it's worth it. Also, you get to see some \"regular\" life, with locals and their kids. Not to worry about language issues, as all labels are in English as well. Quite impressive actually.We took a boat there (http://www.praguesteamboats.com/river-cruises-to-prague-zoo.aspx), floating down the Vltava for around an hour, including going through locks. Interesting views - pleasant way to get there. You get to see the \"other\" Prague, the part that most tourists wouldn't see. These boats leave either from Rasinovo Nabrezi or from Na Frantisku (in front of the hospital). I don't think this service is available in the winter. A quick way to get back to town is by \"ZOO bus\", a bus that takes you for a mere 1Kcz from the ZOO's entrance to Holesovice metro station. Warning about the boat option: The walk from the boat to the ZOO is quite long, so you might want to avoid this means of transportation if you're not much of a walker.On the other hand, if you have lots of time, you might want to stop at Troja Chateau, along the way. This is a beatiful site, with a lovely garden.The ZOO itself has a good collection, not as big as some, but has interesting, unique exhibits, including a night pavilion for nocturnal creatures. Watch out for the free-flying bats!The facility is on two levels, meaning parts of it are on a hill, and walking around can get tiring. There are chairlifts to take you to the top level! Also a little ZOO train for the kiddies.Toilets are abundant, as are eating places. Quite impressive, actually. Several restaurants, self-serve and otherwise. We had burritos (and beer of course!) at one place, and crepes with nutella and fresh bananas at another. Everything from burgers to Czech specialities to stir-fryes.the ZOO has a very good, informative website in English with map."

We were able to rush through without missing too much in about 2.5 hours, but we easily could have spent more time there. Like somebody else mentioned, a map is a good thing! There's no straightforward route through. If you end up in the middle, by the observation tower, get a bag of mini donuts. They were sooo good!"

We are definitely not a pair of bleeding heart liberals or we wouldn\u2019t have decided to go in the first place. What we saw shook us to the core. We walked past a lot of caged birds, and whilst it is never pleasant to see birds flying around in captivity, it did not prepare us for the horror of the elephant enclosure.The enclosure was a small circle, way, way too small for two elephants. It had a pond in the middle and a large tyre hanging from a rope at the far side. The only possible activity for the elephants was to walk around the pond or \u2018play\u2019 with the tyre. They were not able to walk more than a few paces in any other direction.One of the elephants was in obvious distress, desolately kicking the tyre before backing slowly away from it, to shrieks of laughter from the crowd watching. The other elephant remained still, its expression one of hopelessness and deep depression.Possibly the rest of the zoo was better, but my friend and I found the sickening spectacle of these two beautiful animals being tortured to the point of insanity by their cramped living conditions so hideous and traumatic that we had to leave.Prague Zoo became an ugly blot on what was otherwise a fantastic holiday."

I'm not normally a big fan of zoos but my wife and I took a trip here to escape the heat of the city (around 34 celsius when we were there) and were pleasantly surprised. It's set in very spacious and attractive grounds so, even when busy, it doesn't feel crowded. Furthermore, the animals seem to have a fair amount of space to move around in and they are building a new enclosure for the elephants to give them even more space. The entrance price was cheap by UK standards (although you had to pay a nominal amount for a map which I would strongly recommend.) The zoo is well laid out and for those who don't want to walk all the way round there is a mini train that one can take (although this is extra as is the chairlift that you can take to ascend the hillside). There's so much to see that you do need to invest the best part of a day to make the trip worthwhile. My favourite part was the Indonesian Jungle which was very well designed and the nocturnal section where the fruit bats fly over your head!. They also have a baby gorilla (at the time of writing), a baby hippo and some tiger cubs all of which are very photogenic .There are also plenty of food and drink kiosks dotted around the grounds and the prices are very reasonable. As other reviewers have said it's very easy to get to by metro to Nadrazi Holesovice station and then the 112 shuttle bus. They have a good english language website too."

When getting to the ZOO it is really easy to use public transport, bus 112 (from underground station Nadrazi Holesovice, red line) stops just in front of the main entrance. Fee 150CZK or even less if you are a student is really good value even for Czechs.Having the ZOO on our schedule for a long time we went there at the end of August on a day when thermometer showed more than 35 Celsius degrees in shadow, but just around first corner we found water disperser and there are more of them in the zoo. As soon as you turn to be hungry just find one of many stalls. For those who are tired, there are hundreds of benches and some of them offer you really amazing views. If it starts to rain just hide in some of many pavilions in between some animals (but remember, some of the animals love tropical weather conditions..). For those who would like to see the city from different point of view there is a watchtower in the upper part of zoo. Don\u2019t want to climb the hill to see what\u2019s there? Use the funicular. Have a dog and don\u2019t want to leave him for a whole day? Take him with you. Just a symbolic fee allows you to spend the day with your pet. The zoo is trying to keep it \u201cdog-friendly.\u201d so time to time you find a spot where dogs can drink. But of course, you can\u2019t take them to the pavilions. Your children got bored? There is even a \u201cchildren-zoo\u201d providing some activities.Remember to take good shoes, since you can walk up to dozen of kilometres there. A camera is a must unless you don\u2019t live in a safari.. There is one disadvantage \u2013 as a tourist who does not understand Czech language you will probably not catch all the facts which enrich your stay at the zoo (history of zoo, 2002 flood, protection of animals..), but if you spend more days in the city, just do it as an amazing relax.And for those who are interested in special experiences, every single day you can see animals being fed at announced times, time to time they offer thematic tours or just a night walk there. All you need is a few hours of your time and I can highly recommend going there.PS: In the neighbourhood there are a botanical garden and chateau, so you can buy a ticket which covers everything in this part of Prague."

There are wonderful children's areas, cool streams, even a pool where kids can play. The food stalls cater to various tastes and are not junk-food oriented. There are several means of transportation within the Zoo, but also lots of shady resting places. The Zoo itself is actually enormous.

We visited the Prague Zoo for 10 full hours - the entire opening period of the day - and it was great.Lots of exhibitions and different animals, beautiful sorroundings and very fair prices. We had a day of saying only yes to our kids, since everything was So cheap. The entrance fee for the entire family was the same as it would be for one adult in Denmark. The ice creams, slush ice, coffees and sodas were much cheaper than in the city center and the restaurants were fairly priced as well.we will surely repeat our visit, next time we visit Prague."

The animals were highly visible; due to the construction of the enclosures which dropped down towards the sides so fences weren't necessary for a lot of the animals. Also a wide range of animals including polar bears, hippos, Inidian elephants, tigers, lions. There were also some enclosures which you could go inside and get very close to the animals, such as the lemurs and some birds. A huge number of species in total. One warning though; there are some pretty steep climbs in part of the zoo which are hard work if you're pushing a baby buggy on a hot day! Highly recommended"

For a zoo that is on the edge of a city, you'd easily think you were out in the country. Built into a hillside this zoo has no 'cages' as such. Each animal has it's enclosure that is as close to their natural habitat as possible (and with plenty of opportunities to get up close) - ie the mountain goats have a mountain side to jump across, there's a stream/river that runs through the middle of the zoo and it's not uncommon for a family of ducks to waddle past you on the path. some of the enclosures have 'kissing gate' style entrances so you can enter and be inside with the creatures such as birds, there is a lima area where you can go in under the careful eye of zoo staff. Big cats etc are behind glass/plastic walls that you can get right up close to. I could go on and on but I wont. It also has marine life, nocturnal creatures a couple of kids play areas (there could be more, but we were only there about 5 hours so didn't see everything). At the top there is a food / drink area with breathtaking views over Prague, I think there is a mini train to get you around as well as a sort of ski lift if you want to get from top to bottom in a hurry otherwise everything just seems to be sloped so good for pushchairs, wheelchairs etc.. The entry fee is around \u00a35 and food / drinks are cheap which is a nice change for a tourist attraction that has you in its grasp. We travelled to the zoo on foot from the stadium through the park, it was about a 45 minute walk at a brisk pace but you can get a bus which drops you right outside (goes between the zoo and nearest metro station). If I get to go back to Prague again I will definitely be revisiting the zoo"

We were hoping to see more local animals or animals from this regions in their natural habitats. It was disappointing to discover some of the trees were made out of fiberglass and not natural wood.

We have read a lot of great reviews on this attraction and we have been told that this zoo is already 80 years old, but just after the visit of the Prague Zoo during the Easter holidays of 2011 we truly understood what a great place it is! You could spend one entire day there (I spent there 7 hours and even skipped some parts of it!) - the zoo size is amazing, everything is so well-organized (there have been some reconstructions for relocating some of the big animals but this doesn't affect so much the overall impression), there are so many animals and attractions plus places to rest for a while and eat and/or have a coffee/beer and I could say for sure is that it is a must-see attraction! The easiest way to get there is to catch the C line of the Prague Metro and at the metro station Nazdravi Holesovice to take a bus 112 that will drive you directly to the zoo. The admission fee is 150 Kc per adult (around 5.50 - 6.00 EUR) and 100 Kc (around 4 EUR) for children over 3 years (it's free for children under 3 years), retired people and students, there are also special fares for families (2 adults and 2 children) and groups above 10 people. Among the most spectacular attractions within the zoo is the Indonesian jungle pavilion with an area of 1,950 m2 that holds 160 animal (check the primates - orangutans, gibbons, macaques, leaf monkeys), Komodo dragons, turtles, fish and bird species as well as 1,600 specimens of live plants coming from Southeast Asia. Don't miss also the gorilla pavilion where there is a relatively recently born small gorilla. I would recommend you to visit this zoo during your visit to Prague, you will not regret it for sure!"

We got there just as it closed for lunch, so thought we would have a walk through the park, when we saw a sign for the Zoo and thought we would head there as a plan B.After 20 minutes of following the signs, we found the Zoo and spent the rest of the afternoon walking around. There is such a wide range of animals with a number of species that I had never even heard of before never mind seen. There was also alot of rebuilding work going on to repair the damage done during flooding, which looks a very good project.While walking round there are numerous indoor sections where you are in the enclosoure with the animals (including Bats, Birds and Monkeys). The Bat/Monkey enclosure was brilliant but nervy, we did not read the sign outside and so did not realise that we were in close contact with the animals until one flew at my head ( which was funny and brilliant to se in equal measure).The wide range of animals in this Zoo is amazing, for example there are 3 different types of tiger alone. I myself love to see different species of birds, I could have spent all day looking at the birds in this Zoo. There was one Australisian birds with huge beaks and heads that I have never seen before and would love to learn more about.All in all this is a very good Zoo with great attractions for both adults and kids. If you have a spare day in Prague I would strongly advise a trip on the red Metro line and then bus 112 to the entrance. I would definately visit the Zoo again on a trip to Prague and hope to visit again once the rebuilding work has been completed, as this looks to be a brilliant attraction once complete."

So, when I heard about Prague Zoo, I made sure we included a visit during our trip to Prague. Apparently, this Zoo was voted 7th best Zoo in the world.How surprised was I when we literally stumbled across a polar bear! Yes, they have a polar bear. I had never seen one before (only on TV).If you love animals, you\u2019ll enjoy seeing the range of different animals that we do not have at London / Whipsnade / Colchester Zoo.Some of the enclosures are much better than those I have seen at London Zoo. For example, there are Caucasian Ibex living on the side of a cliff. Watching them climbing up and down the cliff face will cause you to gasp on more than one occasion. There\u2019s also a semi-open bat enclosure that\u2019ll test your nerves \u2013 don\u2019t miss it.If you have children, there is a children\u2019s petting zoo. I think there was also Horse / Pony rides.Use can get to the Zoo easily by using public transport. Take metro line C (the red one), to N\u00e1dra\u017e\u00ed Hole\u0161ovice and then catch either a 112 bus or the designated 'Zoo bus' from outside the metro station. They both stop right outside the zoo's entrance.Entry for one adult is 150CZK (approx \u00a34.95). A child (3-15 years) or student ticket is 100CZK (approx \u00a32.30). A family ticket (2 adults and 2 children) is 450CZK (approx \u00a314.85). Under 3's are free. Grab a map on your way in. It's all written in Czech, but there are pictures to help you work out where the animals are located.Tip: If you forget to pick up a map, use your digital camera to take a photograph of one of the large zoo maps located all over the zoo, and then refer back to it if you get lost.Below, I have listed the times when you can see the animals being fed, as when you get to the zoo, it\u2019s all listed in Czech.June, July and August - every day, if the weather is nice.April, May and September - only at the weekends, if the weather is nice.10:00 - Feeding of the Aardvarks11:00 - Feeding of the Penguins12:00 - Meet the Lemurs12:00 - Feeding of the Peccaries12:30 - Feeding of the Camels13:00 - Meet the Gorillas (this also happens every hour, on the hour)13:00 - Feeding of the Otters (everyday, except Mondays as the pool gets cleaned)13:00 - Feeding of the Moose\u2019s13:30 - Feeding of the Komodo Dragon (only on Saturdays)13:30 - Training of the Southern Fur Seals (everyday, except Fridays as the pool gets cleaned)13:30 - Feeding of the Lorikeets14:00 - Feeding of the Big Cats (everyday, except Saturday)14:00 - Feeding of the Przewalski\u2019s Horses14:00 - Meeting the Iguana (only on Sunday's at the Big Cat's Pavilion)14:30 - Introducing the Giraffes15:15 - Feeding of the Wolves16:00 - Feeding of the Hippopotamuses16:30 - Feeding of the PorcupineThe feedings are good, but the animal keepers will speak only in Czech. We stayed long enough to see the animals being fed, and then left whilst many locals remained to listen to the information from the keeper \u2013 this meant we had the next enclosure pretty much to ourselves for a while.Definitely make sure you visit the Giraffes \u2013 they are amazing. Look out for Jonah, you can\u2019t miss him \u2013 he\u2019s the tallest Giraffe I have ever seen!But don\u2019t bother attending the 14:30 \u201cIntroducing the Giraffe\u201d unless you speak Czech. Basically, an animal trainer will show up and just talk about the Giraffes. The enclosure will also be quite busy during this time, so go earlier or later and have the enclosure all to yourself.We made a day of our trip and spend about 5-6 hours there. There are places to eat and the food was better than expected and reasonably priced. Near the exit there is a gift shop, but it is teeny tiny and there\u2019s not a lot on offer."

            "review": "Excellent Zoo and great value for money!. We used public transport (metro and bus) to get to the zoo, and it was so easy! I would recommend anyone to use the public transport rather than taxis.The Zoo was very cheap (approx \u00a35 per adult) and was huge - we spent about 5 hours here and we also missed some areas out. It was great for kids too, loads for them to do with the petting zoo, paddling pools and play areas. Evereywhere was clean and tidy, there were plenty of food, drink and toilet stops and loads of signs with feeding times etc, The only downside was that there wasn't many signs in English (but there were plenty of pictures so you could figure it out!)"

            "review": "Very solid zoo. Nice side trip for those with kids.. I've been to many, many zoos in the world, and I wouldn't say it's the best, but I did find it to be very enjoyable. Some things that would make it better: maybe a real train that goes around the perimeter so people can get from one side to the other faster. Another small complaint is that all of the animal \"pavilions\" allowed strollers to go inside. Great since I had strollers, but bad because there's not enough room inside of them for all the traffic. All the pavilions were extremely crowded because the lanes were just too small to accomodate gawkers and passers-by. It would be nice if there was a metro stop to the zoo, but it's easy enough to get to. Take the C line to Holesovice, and then bus 112 takes you straight to the zoo entrance. Cost to the zoo is 150 czk per adult, 100 czk for children. Food there was reasonable (I had a burrito and a coke for about 150 czk). The zoo is very good, but could use some improvements."

            "review": "Brilliant day out - even for big children :-). I thought Prague Zoo was amazing - definitely the best Ive been to. Its huge - my boyfriend and I were there for 4 hours and still didnt see everything! The enclosures are lovely - very spacious. All of the animals looked like they had loads of space (except the polar bears). The selection of animals is very broad. We were able to see most of the animals. If they werent outside you could almost always go to the indoor part of the enclosure and see them there.I will definitely go back!!"

            "review": "as some reviewers have said, the signs.... as some reviewers have said, the signs are in czech. Kinda obvious really! Animal names are in english so that's fine. We went on a freezing (-3) day in february and weren't disappointed. Getting there is easy and well signposted. We took the metro then the bus. Once inside we bought a map for 5crown, about 18p and started exploring. Snow covered everywhere so many animals were inside but had room to explore inside as well as out. The 3 polar bears were obviously loving the cold! Lunch menus were also in czech, but a simple enquiry found out the guy serving spoke perfect english. Entry, lunch, drinks, cake and travel for 2 coming in at 650 crown, about \u00a325. Well worth it. Zoos in england would charge nearly that for entry! Great day out, if a little cold, but i have photos of tigers and camels in the snow. How many people can say that?"

            "review": "Best Zoo I have even been too. We visited Prague Zoo at the suggestion of my motgher in law, who likes zoos. I dont. In the guide it looked as if getting there was going to be a bit of a trek, but it wasnt. we took the tram, and changed to a bus for the last part. nearly everyone on the bus was going to the zoo, and it stopped right outside (you ca also see the palace next door - Troja-, but the zoo will fil up your day). The paths wind quite steeply up from the entrance, and things donty look hopeful, but then we can t an inside exibit with anmals from borneo and other tropical south-east asia, the orang utans looked right at home, and you felt like you were visiting them in a real home. Over the top of the hill and down the far side you come to the africa safari exibit. The giraffes were all close to the viewing platform, so we got great views. Later we walked round the hill, back towards the riverside. The enclosures for the mountai goats are ona very steep scree slope, which seems to suit them fabulously. We were initially disappointed f to find few big cats outside, on a day which had stated warm but wet cool and damp, but once INSIDE we were able to see the tigers through the glass from a few inches away. there are als elephants, fruitbats, aardvarks, cassowaries, and everythig else you might expect. A good day out, for all children, even those in their 40's or more"

            "review": "See animals up close. I've been to many zoos due to the fact my 7 year old son loves all animals ( hint my tripadvisor handle). The kids loved the zoo but I was disappointed by the poor landscaping and some dirty and smallish enclosures. There are no maps, signs or menus in any other language other than Czech.The best part of the zoo, is due to compromised human safety and animal habitat reasons, you can get very very close to the animals.Lastly Family Travel Forum recommends you take a boat on the Charles River to the zoo. Great idea if you don't mind a visually stunning BUT 75 minute long oneway boatride."

            "review": "A pleasant surprise!. I have been to quite a few ZOOs around the world, however the Prague ZOO exceeded my expectations. Since I am Czech, I am very proud of such a ZOO. It seems animal-friendly and I did not have a sad feeling about the lives of the animals as I have for example here in China. It is located on a hilly Prague 7 area (within the ZOO there is a cable car which adds to its attraction), not far from the center. It is great for families with small children."

            "review": "The best zoo we've ever visited. We took our six year old to Prague for the February Half term (2008) and spent one of our best days at the zoo. Travel to the zoo from the centre of Prague cost 26Kc each way for the adults (about 80p) on a combination of tram (No 5) and Bus (No 112). The zoo is exceptionally well laid out in themed areas with animals that would live together in the wild sharing enclosures. The animals looked healthy and happy and there is an enormous range to see. We were there for ovver 5 hours and managed to see about 2/3 of the animals. We have visited a number of zoos in the UK and in Europe (Chester, Edinburgh, London, Copenhagen, Barcelona) and this was by far the best. Entry for two adults and a child cost a total of 400Kc (about \u00a312) - money extremely well spent."

            "review": "An uplifting experience. On a very warm day in early ctober2003, we 3 adults visitedPrague zoo. A yeaar after the devastating floods, most of the animals were back in secure housing in large runs. All looked well and contented. Polar bears swam in a pleasant pool and watched the visitors through several layers of toughenend glass. The ooters looked jolly and came up to the bars to communicate with us. The sign inside their run shwed that it was nearly lunchtime and explained their interest in people. We latwe returned to watch them being fed, not on fish as the notice said, but on white mice. Each run had a descriptionof the animals inside and a notice explaining about each of the young born in the time since the flood. A litter of 6 now adult sized wolf cubs ambled around their ample space, thebaby fur seal,the enexpected daughter of a father who swam downsteam to Germany and died after being found, played athletically in the pleasant pool with her mother and aunts, leaping out of the water. They were fed as we watched and had an obvious raport with the young woman keeper. There was a notice on the tiger's run that purported to have been written by him explaining that his slightly disabled paw didn't hurt. Each run had notices asking people not to disrupt the animals or to feed them.ther were plenty of staff in evidence. I could not help but feel that they must have been in agony as the floods arrived and they could not save all their charges. It is evident thwat this is a place of great love of htthe animals in it. The labelling of the runs is in several languages. Where in London's zoo would you find a notice in Czech? The chairlift is available for people who don't fancy the steep paths, the food in the restaurant is first class and the toilets well kept. this zoo is an altogether positive experience for visitors."
