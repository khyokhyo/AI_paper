One at 6pm daily and its surely a right time to visit the Cathedral.\nThere two desks selling souvenirs within the Cathedral and they seemed better priced than those outside."

The cathedral is situated pretty close to the Spilt Blood Church and really within walking distance of the Winter Palace and the waterway. I suggest getting up early and getting out there within an hour after sunrise. It's really worth it to capture the cathedral in all it's glory!"

After seeing the Church of our Savior on Spilled Blood, we continued up - having the canal on our right - and ended in front of the wonder. Reminds me of the Karlskirche in Vienna for it's Masonic symbols and numerous exterior and interior columns. My recommendation is to see it during day time. The entrance into the church is free of charge.If you have some interest in Masonic symbols and architecture, look above the front main entrance, and have a walk around the cathedral before going inside. The inside also hosts, apart from the eye of providence above the altar, the burial tomb of Field Marshal Kutuzov, an 18th-19th century hero for the Russian Empire - think about how Napoleon lost in Russia to get the idea.Absolutely worth a visit, inside and out."

I travelled by bus from my hotel. ON arrival there was a fascinating type of wedding ceremony with accompanying choral music. The couple being blessed seem to have three children so it was a little difficult to determine what exactly was the ceremony that was takinig place. Anyhow a memorable visit."

Kazan Cathedral alongside Nevsky Prospekt at Griboyedov Canal has several names: Kazanskiy Kafedralniy Sobor (in Russian language, \u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0301\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043a\u0430\u0444\u0435\u0434\u0440\u0430\u0301\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0301\u0440), or Cathedral of Our Lady of Kazan. A rose by any other name\u2026 This is a cathedral of the Russian Orthodox Church, meaning there are no pews. Worshipers must stand during services. Construction began in 1801 and continued for 10 years, completed just before Napoleon invaded Russia\u2019s capital at the time (St Pete). Mikhail Kutuzov was Russia\u2019s commander-in-chief and prevailed over Napoleon. Kutuzov is interred in the cathedral in 1813, two years after the cathedral\u2019s consecration. Architect Andrey Voronikhin modelled the Empire Style design after St Peter Basilica in Rome. The distinctive semicircular colonnade caught my attention when walking along Nevsky Prospekt. The interior has numerous columns, which echoes the exterior colonnade and seems inspired by a palatial hall, towering 70 meters long and 62 meters high. There are oodles of sculptures and religious icons from the early 1800s, and a gilded iron grille separating the small square behind is exquisite."

Because the altar of an orthodox church is supposed to face east, the cathedral 'entrance' from Nevsky Prospekt is actually the back of the church. As with the other churches, it is striking to me to see that there are no seats. It is considered rude to sit in the presence of God. This is particularly interesting as religion was forbidden during most of the communist years. So many generations have grown up with no religious leanings, much less teachings. With no pews however, it is easier to get a feel for the layout of the church and to appreciate the beautiful mosaic floors and the opulent frescoes on the walls and ceilings. The cathedral since 1991 is currently used for religious purposes, but in the past as with all Russian cathedrals, it was repurposed as the times were changing and there was no need for religious buildings.Women should wear a hat or a scarf over their hair."

It would be hard to miss Kazan Cathedral as it sits dramatically on Nevsky Prospect in St. Petersburg near the center of just about everything.The Cathedral itself was built at the beginning of the 1800s, but was turned into a memorial to the Russian victory over Napoleon after1812. There is a statue of Mikhail Kutuzov, the Russian general who orchestrated that victory, out front, and his remains are interred inside.The exterior is dramatic and was modelled after St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. While large, the neoclassical interior isn't quite as impressive as those in nearby St. Isaac's Cathedral or the Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood.The cathedral was closed with the Communist revolution in 1917 and later converted, oddly enough, into a \"Museum of Atheism\" that was viewed with embarassment even at the time. It has now been returned to the Russian Orthodox Church. A couple of notes: First, this is now a living church, so you'll need to respect the worshipers and many areas are inaccessible during service times. They also expect women to wear scarves over their heads, although we saw many who did not.Second, the area around the cathedral is fine, but a few blocks to the west there is an area we were warned by locals to avoid.This impressive cathedral is easy to visit and free. It's definitely worth your time to come here while in St. Petersburg."

The Kazan Cathedral looks very similar to the Basilica of St. Peter\u2019s in Rome. It was built in 1801 by the Russian architect Andrei Voronikhin. Although closed for services during most of the Soviet era, the cathedral is open today and is a wonderful example of a working Russian Orthodox Church. It has an impressive stone colonnade, encircling a small garden and central fountain. It was intended to be the country's main Orthodox Church. After the war of 1812 (during which Napoleon was defeated) the church became a monument to Russian victory. Captured enemy banners were put in the cathedral and the famous Russian Field Marshal Mikhail Kutuzov, who won the most important campaign of 1812, was buried inside the church. Open Monday-Friday: 8:30 a.m.-8:00 p.m. - Saturday & Sunday: 6:30 a.m.-8:00 p.m. Admission: Free \u2013 Women should cover their hair with a scarf, hat or hood while inside the Kazan Cathedral."

There were queues of the faithful visiting a shrine of the Holy Mother of Kazan and Russian Orthodox nuns were in evidence.

It was modelled on St Peter's in Rome.Some visitors did not seem to honour the fact that this is a living church - knees and shoulders should be covered but not everyone abided by this simple rule of respect.

It was free to enter, and is well worth a peek inside.Be respectful, this is a working cathedral and although it is not so over-the-top compared to the typical religious monuments of Russia (in fact it is comparatively dull), it has its own inner peace with queues of worshippers taking communion and lighting candles when we were there.

Beautiful building, the size is enormous, would highly recommend."

I was lucky to walk in when they were conducting mass (not sure, if it's not called mass). There were about 6 priests chanting and reading, people were praying and crossing themselves. Other people were lighting candles, kissing icons, while nuns in black habits cleaning candle stands. Very somber atmosphere. Also this is the resting place of kutzsov who led Russian army to victory against French. his resting place was surrounded by French standards and keys of the city taken from surrendering French army. kutzsov statue is outside as well. middle of the centre roof outside has Freemason symbol. Well worth a visit."

The location is great, since it is situated in the magnificent Nevsky Prospekt, and with its right wing, it is adjacent to the kanal of Griboyedov ( great russian poet and dramatist). This Cathedral is also known as the Cathedral of Our Lady of Kazan. So, it is an Orthodox Church that is dedicated to Our Lady of Kazan probably the most respected icon in Russia. And from this fact, there is an issue, that this Kazan Sobor (Cathedral) is not only one remarkable museum but also a church with full service. It consists of one main and central columned portal with the pediment on the top of it, and behind arises a colossal dome with the golden cross. To the right and left, range the curved colonnade and end with the two medium, triumphal portals as a memorial to the Russian victory against Napoleon.Here in Cathedral is interred Mikhail Kutuzov himself and Alexander Pushkin wrote some celebrated verses about him, while the poet meditated over his sepulchre.In front of this flanked portals are placed the bronze statues of Kutuzov and Barclay de Tolly ( Kutuzov's eminent general).There is a very nice lawn before the Cathedral and also a fountain and wooden benches on the tiny gravelled path. Very pleasant spot for meetings with acquaintances.We really enjoyed here, within this Kazanskaya Square, formed by the elegant design and structure of Kazansky Sobor."

If you enjoy architecture, you can easily drop 45 minutes to an hour here. As a Roman Catholic, I enjoyed comparing and contrasting the Orthodox-style architecture to that which I've seen in the hundreds of Roman-style churches I've been in. The usual rules apply for visiting a holy place: Men should be covered past the knees - preferably pants - and no hats; women should be dressed conservatively and preferably have some kind of head cover, though I don't think any of this is tightly enforced, I visited in the early Spring when it was still cool outside, so nobody was dressed in shorts etc. anyway. This is a good place to sit and silently pray if you are religious. There are also gift/merchandise stands on either exit where you can buy icons or Christian jewelry for quite a reasonable price. N.B.: The sign on the outside of the cathedral says (in Russian) to not take photos. Again, this is not enforced and architecture geeks like myself will not be able to resist the temptation to snap an occasional photo. Just be respectful and discreet and turn off your flash, and I don't think anyone will care."

The interior is relatively decorated, and there are 2 kiosks selling items. It is a working church, so you may hear a service in progress when you visit (I did)."

Whilst taking a stroll along Nevsky Prospekt, the main thoroughfare in St. Petersburg, one cannot fail to notice the impressive Cathedral of Our Lady of Kazan. The cathedral was inspired by the Basilica of St. Peter's in Rome. The cathedral was named after the \"miracle-making\" icon of Our Lady of Kazan. After the war of 1812 (during which Napoleon was defeated) the church became a monument to Russian victory. Russian Field Marshal Mikhail Kutuzov, who won the most important campaign of 1812, was buried inside the church. The cathedral's interior, with its numerous columns, echoes the exterior colonnade and is reminiscent of a palatial hall, being 69 metres in length and 62 metres in height. The interior features numerous sculptures and icons created by the best Russian artists of the day. A wrought iron grille separating the cathedral from a small square behind it is sometimes cited as one of the finest ever created."

I did not go to the interior of the church. The view from the top is pretty good though. The spiral staircase is nice, and 200 some steps). It is interesting that the stairs have such a big gap in between them, as opposed to Notre Dame in France where it al most feels claustrophobic when you go up the spiral staircase. This was not on my agenda, but I got lost and saw it in the distance so I figured I might as well stop. It was worth it, and it is obviously considered one of the big landmarks of St. Petersburg."

Discovered underground in 1579 this icon was raised to Palladian status - that is to say an icon capable of defending the country. The original was stolen from Kazan in 1904 for its gold and bejewelled frame and the icon was probably destroyed , though this is disputed. The old copies in St Petersburg and Moscow are highly venerated and you will see the continuous queue waiting patiently to kiss the icon, which it is rumoured was carried round the fortifications during the ww2 siege."

Here, the famous Russian Field Marshal Mikhail Illarionovich Kutuzov himself is interred. Built in 1801-1811 by architect A. Voronikhin, the cathedral is consecrated to the miraculous icon of Our Lady of Kazan. In 1932, the cathedral turned into a museum of the history of religion. Since 1991, services were resumed and from 2000, the cathedral returned to the Russian Orthodox church and was ascribed to the eparchy of St. Petersburg. Emperor Paul wanted the cathedral to resemble the St. Peter's cathedral basilica in Rome. To achieve the demands, a tremendous colonnade consisting of 96 columns was erected in front of the northern facade."

It is modeled on the St Peters Basilica in Rome so has a familiar look about it. It is far larger than it looks from it's exterior when viewed from Nevsky Prospekt.It is still a working church today and a focus for worship by many Russians as it is also partly seen as a memorial to the Russian victory over Napoleon.It is dedicated to Our Lady of Kazan, one of the holiest icons in Russia.Visited February 2013"

            "review": "The Roman Orthodox Church. The main entrance of this early 19th Cent. Orthodox Cathedral occupies an impressive situation in the city\u2019s main street, Nevsky Prospekt. You would be hard pressed to recognize it as an Orthodox structure, as it has only a single enormous dome without any of the traditional onion skin decorations, and is flanked on both sides by an extensive colonnade. This ambivalence stems from the curious paradox that its design was inspired by that of St. Peter\u2019s in Rome, and can be construed as an ecumenical gesture towards the Roman Catholic Church aimed at improving relations between the two great early branches of Christianity. Unlike its Roman model, the area in front is covered by a well manicured lawn that includes a single vertical fountain. Not only Rome, but Florence also managed to get involved in the complimentary plagiarism, since the large doors of the Cathedral imitate those that Ghiberti created for the Florence Baptistery. The interior has much more to tell us about Russian history, as it was completed only a year before Napoleon\u2019s invasion, and his nemesis ---- Field-Marshall Kutuzov ----- is buried within. He is reputed to have dedicated his ultimate victory to Our Lady of Kazan, a celebrated icon whose intervention he sought, and that was embedded in the iconostasis of the newly-built Cathedral. The sacristy also contains the keys of many European cities and castles that were conquered by the Russian Army prior to Napoleon\u2019s downfall at Waterloo. The height of the interior is emphasized by the immensity of the dome, and the height of the many pillars within. The church is well endowed with fine works of religious art ---- sculptures and icons ---- produced for the original by some of the greatest Russian craftsmen of the day. After the 1917 Revolution, it suffered the customary fate of conversion to a Museum of Religion and Atheism, and only in 1996 was it returned to the Orthodox Church for public worship. It is now considered to be the Mother Church of St. Petersburg\u2019s Orthodox Community, and as such is certainly well worth while getting to know."

All of it sung, when the priests aren't singing the parishioners do and when neither of them are, there is a choir in the eves singing. The Cathedral itself is great, there is a special place received fro the Romanovs and their paintings are on the walls. As the church celebrates the defeat of Napoleon at Borodino their are several French battle standards on display which would be of great interest to anyone interested in history or literature. The emphasis on the victory is heightened by the approach into the Cathedral which is flanked on either side by (I think) large statues of Kutuzov and De Tolly. Its certainly worth a pop in!"

There is a great sense of loyalty, devotion and faith which is palpable."

There are many striking buildings in this city, none more so than the cathedral, it features in the television transmissions on the Russian Christmas Eve celebrations alongside the naval cathedral on Krondstadt and has a certain noble quality that makes it good to look at.Obviously it is a venerated building with many people coming to pray and to pay respect to whichever icon they perceive to be the most holy, although can's say I would fancy kissing the same spot on a wood framed glass cabinet as the other hundreds of lips!If you want to get a clear and panoramic view then take coffee in the Singer building opposite at first floor level (that's the second in Russia) and the sweeping wings and columns will have your eyes in awe, it really does look a well balanced and cared for place. No doubt others can give you an insight as to its uses during the first stages of the \"lovely\" Soviet period, what a bunch.Inside there is peace and an air of quiet contemplation, the smell of candle wax and incense, a quietness that is the exact opposite of what is happening on Nevsky. Although, only here could you get two guys carrying a makeshift structure in wood about 20 feet long and the crowd of visitors just part as though its a portable icon.The decorations, actual bas relief and painting is very well designed and restored, not too much gold and very muted colours, many icons beautiful columns and floors.Take some time to sit and look, respect the traditions, ladies to cover their heads and legs, no hats etc. many people here appear to have genuine affinity to the Orthodox Church which is a nice counterbalance to the mayhem outside."

Even if you are tired of Russian Orthodox churches as a result of having seen so many during a trip through Russia, this one is important and should not be missed. It houses two very significant things: first, one of the most revered copies of the icon of Our Lady of Kazan; and second; the grave of the great Russian general Mikhail Kutuzhov, hero of the War of 1812 and a central figure in Tolstoy's epic War and Peace.The Icon of Our Lady of Kazan has been appealed to over and over again in Russian history, particularly in times of war. Allegedly, it was even used by Soviet authorities out of desperation, who reportedly used it in processions around Leningrad fortifications during the lengthy siege of that city. There were even rumors Stalin was so desperate during Hitler's invasion of Russia that he had it brought to Moscow, where atheist Soviet officials paraded it around the Kremlin Walls.General Kutuzhov is the man who ordered the retreat from and evacuation of Moscow in the face of Napoleon's Grand Army, with the intent to lure the French into the empty city as Winter approached \u2013\u2013 while the Russian Army recuperated and prepared to harass the French once they were forced to retreat back to France through the horrific Russian Winter. Kutuzhov was obviously successful in his gigantic gamble. His grave is not ostentatious, and even easy to miss. It's worth seeing. The captured banners of the French Army are on display, as well as the keys of the Russian Cities that Napoleon waited in vain to receive while he aimlessly waited in Moscow through the Autumn months.We enjoyed our visit to this Cathedral very much, particularly since we were unaware that either of these treasures was housed here, and were pleasantly surprised and excited to discover them."

This isn't the most showy, but it's great if you want to get a sense of the Russian Orthodox church and some of its differences from Catholicism (no statues or stained glass, just icons, no seats, etc). We were really grateful to have an excellent guide showing us round though: there is some information in English but it was so much better having someone to explain what we were seeing. And the Kazan Cathedral is nothing like as crowded as the Church on Spilled Blood, or St Isaac's or the St Peter and St Paul Cathedral, which is a big plus - few huge tour groups following their guides around. It's hard to get a good photograph of the cathedral though. The best is probably from the far side of the rose garden in front of it, facing onto Nevsky Prospekt."

So here your impression of the place will not be ruines by numerous cameras flashing, lound talking and crowds. It's decorated with different kinds of marble and granit, and all the granit is local. Last but not the least, it's the home of the miraculour icon of \"Our Lady of Kazan\".HOW TO GET THERE: it's not hard at all, as the church is located in the middle of Nevsky prospect, across the street from \"Dom Knigi\" (former Singer sawing machine store). It's walkable from most hotels in the center, but if you take the metro, the station is called \"Nevsky prospekt/ Gorstiny Dvor\" and the exit you need is \"Kanal Griboedova\".BEST TIME TO GO: Around 10AM or 6PM, which is when the mass takes place. PLEASE NOTE:- As it is a working church, be respectful. Don't talk too loud and don't take pictures inside. It's preferable that ladies cover their heads and gents take their hats off. Try not to wear really short skirts or shorts. - The church has some space closer to the altar, which is separated with a rope and a sign \"only for the prayers\". It means that it's for the people who actually want to listen to the servise and pray. It doesn't mean that tourists are not allowed in. If you really want to participate, just prepare for it. If you are a female visitor, cover your head with a scarf or something and wear pants or a long skirt. Male visitors should take off their hats. You will see that the priest sings a prayer and from time to time everybody makes some gestures with their hands. Try to repeat after them.- You don't have to stay during the mass. Everybody is always free to leave whenever they want. Try to wander around and discover all sorts of little icons hidden in the corners. If you have some rubles, you can buy candles, light them and place them in front of icons as you pray.MUST SEE:- The miraculous icon of Pur Lady of Kazan in the center of the altar wall. You'll recognise it because there will be a line of people waiting to come closer to it and kiss it.-In the corner behind the kiosk you'll see some flags and a memorial space. It's actually a burial place of a Russian field marshal from the war with Napoleon - Kutuzov. The flags you see are rwal French banners and there are also keys from different French towns conquered by Russians.- In the opposite corners look up a little bit and you will see a balcony for the quire. It's not allowed to play musical instruments in orthodox churches, so that's the only source of spiritual music."

This cathredral is unique in Russia; while it's not the only Renaissance-style cathedral (St. Issac's is further down the road) it's fairly small and intimate, looking a bit like a jewelbox version of St. Peter's in Rome. Mass is held here regularly and you needn't leave the building if it starts while you're there; in fact you should stay because it's quite a moving experience, even if you're not Orthodox. I had no idea what the ritual protocol was, and actually I felt I had no business trying to follow along, but whenever I was making a faux pas by just standing there--when I was going to be in the way of a procession--one of the elderly ladies would gently touch my arm and move me to the proper place, no scolding or anything. If you're quiet and respectful, they have no problem with you being there. As far as attire, you don't have to be dressed up, but don't look grungy. Men should not wear hats in an Orthodox cathedral, and women should cover their heads (a scarf is typical)."

I was out enjoying a tour of the city by foot when I stumbled across this gorgeous architectural maze of colonnades and was simply too dramatic in appearance to resist a visit. This turned out to be Kazan Cathedral which today still functions as an operating church in St Petersburg. Quite refreshing as compared to so many other great churches which are now museums.Great history but then is St Petersburg, a city that literally stretches back hundreds of years. The actual cathedral/church is located at the back of the colonnade so from first inspection you are absolutely unaware that this is a cathedral of any kind. It makes a very easy visit, if you are on Nevsky Prospect just checking out the neighborhood, it is also very close to the Metro which makes it easily accessible.Several viewers commented on their visit during a church service which I did not do. The time I visited was outside of their services but is absolutely worth a walk around - there is no charge to get in and it is a delightful visit.Certainly one of the most impressive architectural buildings in and around the popular tourist sites of St Petersburg.My advice is quite simple - if you are in St Petersburg this is a must visit!"

Our Lady of Kazan cathedral is one of the few major churches in central St.Petersburg which is a working cathedral rather than a state museum. Architecturally it is quite striking with its dome and huge semi-circular collonade which reaches out to Nevsky Prospect. Much work has been done on it recently and behind it it still looks like a construction site. As a working church, one needs to dress conservitively and photos are not allowed. It is however completely free rather than a couple hundred roubles. The interor is beautiful with scores of icons, mosaics, magnificent iconostases. I would urge visitors to consider comming during services (on Sunday 10 and 1800h) to truly experience it. The music supplied by male choir as well as the priests is unearthly, ancient, dark and deeply spiritual. The smell of incense, hundreds of candles also adds. Just stay quiet, reverent and do what the lady standing next to you is doing and you will have a very special experience even if you can't fully follow what is transpiring or even if you are secular."

The most impressive things here are the oversize bronze front doors (altho this is not the main entrance), which are an exact copy of Ghiberti's Baptistry doors in Florence, Italy. For those unable to travel to Russia, however, another exact replica of the doors can be seen at Grace Cathedral in San Francisco, CA (and they're better polished, too. . .) The other thing the Kazan Cathedral exemplifies is the curious linkage Russians assign to building cathedrals/churches to commemorate their battles and victories."

There was a long line of people waiting to pray to the Icon of Our Lady as well as a roped-off area where people were praying. Orthodox women were all in headscarves. I was worried about my sleeveless shirt and not having anything that I could use to cover my shoulders, but that did not seem to be a problem as many people were in tank tops, etc. There is a garden area out front with benches, and it was a nice early evening in summer, so many people were gathered there also.

From the main street of the city you can see a charming view of the Cathedral, which is very beautiful from the outside. When you get closer, you see a lot of poor people, who ask for money, some children, other people you will not want to get closer to... It's relatively safe, but better not to play with the faith. Entrance is free. The Cathedral houses of the most important icons of Russian Orthodox church. During the religious holidays, there're long queues to enter the Cathedral."

It's now restored to its role as a place of worship, and is well frequented. Women should cover the head when entering any Russian church, but it's fine to go in even during a service. There are no pews and people are just sort of standing or milling about, kissing the icons and so on. There are signs up to beware of pickpockets, however... even in church."

You don't need to be Christian or orthodox to admire an amazing building and culture! or to appreciate and respect the people praying inside. The church has seen better days but don't let this put you off, but rather let it add to the experience of realism. Not everything needs to be shiny and freshly painted to be admired.This is not meant to be a tourist attraction, it's an active church and doesn't get the tourist funding of the decommissioned churches. I recommend you go in and see the intricate details inside and if you can, get there for a service / the choir. Be sure to observe a few things: do not use your camera, be respectful, take in a scarf for your head (for the ladies).It's worth it to experience an active orthodox church."

A distant second or third in terms of attractiveness, far less impressive than the famous Church of our Lady on Spilled Blood. We visited mid afternoon and found few people inside, making the visit to the Kazan Cathedral nice. The exterior is not too attractive, looked tired and in need of a cleaning. The inside wasn't a lot better, offering some decor to admire but was very dark at the time of our visit, making photography conditions quite poor. We sat on some benches inside and admired the ceiling and wall paintings for a while, probably spent 20 minutes altogether before being on our way to the next attraction. Overall, we found it difficult to recommend the Kazan Cathedral off Nevsky Prospect unless you've significant time in St. Petersburg. Its not a highlight so make sure you see more important attractions first. If time remains, you can try to squeeze this one in."

It is located in the city\u2019s central street, Nevsky Prospect. During the Soviet era, its building was used to house the Museum of the History of Religion and Atheism, but now it is active again as a church.Try to get there around 10 o\u2019clock in the morning to listen to one of the best church choirs in the city singing at the morning liturgy. Organ music is not used in Russian churches \u2013 all services are accompanied by a capella singing.Inside, the classical d\u00e9cor of the church is quite impressive. The exquisite iconostasis used to be made of solid silver, but was melted down during the Soviet era, so its present-day replica is just covered with silver leaf. The wonder-working icon of Our Lady of Kazan, found in the city of Kazan at the time of Ivan the Terrible\u2019s rule, is to the left of the iconostasis \u2013 you will see people lining up in front of the icon to kiss it and pray to it.The cathedral, completed in 1811, became a memorial of Russia\u2019s victory over Napoleon won in 1812, and the famous Field Marshall Kutuzov was buried inside it. If you enter the cathedral from Nevsky Prospect (which is actually a side entrance - the main one is from a side street), you will see his gravestone right opposite the entrance. Besides, one of the two statues in front of the cathedral represents Kutuzov (the other one features Barclay de Tolly, the other General who commanded Russian army during the Napoleonic War).Russian Orthodox churches have rather strict rules, so make sure you do not use your camera inside and do not talk loudly. Shorts and short skirts are not recommended, and men are requested to take their hats off when they enter a church. Postcards and booklets of the church are available in the gift shop, which also has a big choice of inexpensive small-sized icons."
