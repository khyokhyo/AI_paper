It was a 10 minute uphill walk to the museum, well worth it for glorious views. We went as a family of 5 and were amazed that the 3 kids got free entry. The building itself is stunning and purpose built. The exhibits are interesting and there's plenty to do. The highlight is definitely the Amazon jungle, where you can walk through and see birds and fish in an enclosed area. The kids had a fantastic day. The only disappointment was lunch, the cafe is pretty poor given the great food you can get in Barcelona. I would thoroughly recommend a day here if the weather turns a bit cloudy and the beach isn't appealing!"

There are plenty of interactive science displays to involve visitors in which are often quite large and visual and so should be appealing to a range of ages. There are also plenty of natural history exhibits and aquatic displays. The star of the show is the Submerged Amazon Forest however, this would be worth the trip on its own. We got here by taking a train to Av. Tibidabo station from Placa de Catalunya and taking a short walk from there (its uphill all the way though)."

There is plenty to see and touch which is essential for children of that age. The amazon forest recreation caught their imagination in particular. They also liked running up and down the five floor central spiral ramp... as did every other child there. The exhibits all have explanations in English but the wording is pitched at older children so a little help is required to simplify and keep their interest. Some of the interactive stuff as well is better for teenagers or those studying science. Finally with some other children they had a fantastic game of hide and seek - ok, that's not the point of the museum but its design is absolutely perfect for it! A final word on the restaurant. Very good food - an all you can eat buffet priced quite reasonably (13\u20ac for adults and 8\u20ac for children with one drink included). The food is far superior to the average fare at most museums / attractions around Europe. All in all, a great way to wile away an afternoon (plus evening if you wish as it is open till 8pm)."

We visited as a couple and my girlfriend was afraid it was geared too much towards children. However, the displays were varied and offered extensive information, especially on fossils, geology and physics. Kids can definitely enjoy themselves with live experiments, but this is not a place that ONLY caters for kids with simple stuff."

That said the entrance into the building itself and getting tickets was somewhat bewildering. You start at the top on level 0 and work your way down to the bottom on level -5. There is lots to see, including a large patch of rainforest with sea life at the bottom. There are also lots of interactive displays and the descriptions on some of the physics are brilliant - I wish I had something like that when I was at school! There were a number of school parties there when we were. Definitely worth a visit."

So we decided to pick this museum as a place for us all to spend some time.This review is written from the perspective of someone visiting the museum on a Monday-Friday. There is a BIG difference if you go on the weekends, that is they open all the floors.Because we went on a weekday, they only open one of the four floors to the public (we didn't know this). That meant the exhibitions were open but the interactive stuff like the touch ponds, creative section, planetarium (about space) were closed.Even though that was the case, the kids still found ways to use three hours in the fifth floor.What is most amazing is the rainforest exhibit. The museum has recreated a greenhouse that has birds, fish and some animals in a replica format to a jungle. Truly amazing and was the highlight of the visit.Food in the cafeteria is very average, so don't expect much there.Getting there is easy, the suburban line to the brown line Ave Tibidabo station then a ten minute walk up the hill.I recommend it for families but try and go on the weekend."

            "review": "Hard to find, poor service, failed to impress overall. As it came free with the Barcelona Card, we decided to visit CosmoCaixa. We got started off on the wrong foot as this place is EXTREMELY difficult to find. We exited the L7 train, and down through the tunnels there were tons of signs and murals screaming to go visit CosmoCaixa. But when we got onto the street, no signage was to be seen. We walked around a bit and found a sign that pointed east for CosmoCaixa. We followed that for a block or two, only to find a sign that pointed west for CosmoCaixa. Perplexed, we backtracked and turned, only to find yet another sign, pointing south for CosmoCaixa (these were all relatively near a single roundabout by the exit of the train station). Having my Google map in hand, which indicated that CosmoCaixa was actually north of the station, we ignored that sign, and walked north. We soon found another sign insisting we were going in the wrong direction, and saying to head south. We ignored that one too. We then finally found CosmoCaixa when we crossed the street that, according to Google Maps, it was on. After about 25-30 minutes of searching. So, be warned \u2013 ignore the useless street signs, and use a map instead. This was difficult enough to find, even with a map. Our guess was that perhaps the signs were meant for drivers, not walkers, and maybe they were pointing to parking lots? Who knows?So we entered the museum, and got our tickets but were offered no map or other information. So we were wandering around blindly, clearly visiting rooms out of sequence. There were lots of rooms listed on the walls on various floors but most doors were closed. Were we supposed to go in? We didn\u2019t if the doors were closed. Again, who knows?The planetarium shows were mostly done for the day but we saw they had one at 18h, so we wandered around exploring the geology/marine/science areas until then. They were okay, nothing out of the ordinary. Some signage was available in English, while much was only in Catalan and Spanish. We then went back up to registration to inquire as to whether tickets were needed for the 18h show, and they said there was no such show. We insisted that the signage by the planetarium advertises a show for 18h, and they said that was only in August (this was 2 Sept when we were there). So that was another disappointment. They need to update their displays so people don\u2019t waste time hanging around for shows that aren\u2019t happening.As can be expected with a place like this, there were tons of kids at CosmoCaixa. No problem with that \u2013 if they are respectful. When my wife or I were at an exhibit, often a kid would run up in front of us and push buttons, while we were engaged with the exhibit. Not once was there an apology from a parent. Often we didn\u2019t see the parents around at all. The complexity of the descriptions of some of the items indicate that this is a place both for children and adults, so I really wish all parents could keep a watch on their kids and teach them to be respectful of others. This isn\u2019t the museum\u2019s fault of course, but it is a reality to be cognizant of when visiting CosmoCaixa.Relatively speaking we thought it was not crowded at all, so Friday evening would seem to be a good time to go. Definitely highly recommended for kids, as well as science-minded adults."

A little rain forest stands tall in the middle of the venue with wild birds, fish and reptiles. If you want to get away from the craziness of Barcelonetta or Gotico, this trip will sure be of good entertainment and it is always pure happiness to see children unravel mysteries of a time long long ago. Make sure to spend the extra 4 euros per person to see the 3D show inside the Planetarium. The original entry fee to the Museum is 4 euros for adults and totally free for kids under 16. They also have a Cafeteria, but I would not recommend it."

We were looking forward to this for weeks- we visit the science museum of every city we visit- but this one sadly fell a little short of expectations. It was mostly because they didn't explain at the entry that most of the cool exhibits (Toca Toca (\"touch touch\", the hands-on exhibit), and the creativity building one) need extra tickets and are only held in english once a day. By the time we found them (the museum is 5-6 floors!), we'd unfortunately missed the showing. The museum isn't at all expensive so it would have been worth paying extra for, but we just weren't told how it worked. For the first time ever, the kids complained that a science museum wasn't fun. But if you check ahead and get tickets for the fun stuff on time, I bet you'd have a great time. On the plus side- almost all the exhibits have been translated into english and I found them well-done. The best part is the gorgeous architecture of the building."

My guidebook mentioned this modern museum as a sort of offbeat aside to all the mediaeval buildings, beaches and weird architecture more typically associated with Barcelona. Because wildlife and nature are my strongest interests I thought I'd see what it's like and I'm very glad I did.This ultra modern complex is found some way out in a salubrious suburb of the city. Upon arrival, I was not sure if it reminded me most of a university campus or an airport. My next surprise was the entry fee - just \u20ac4. When I consider that I had paid approaching 5 times as much to enter the mediocre zoo and aquarium and the dismal Poble Espanol this was frankly amazing and I briefly wondered if the content was going to be as minimal as the price.Not so.CosmoCaixa is jam packed with fascinating and imaginatively presented exhibits covering all aspects of science and nature on several floors of a vast, dynamic, open-plan space. You start. Y descending to the ground in a wide and seemingly endless spiral walkway with glass sides, which is fascinating in itself. Once in the museum proper, you'll find many of the exhibits use interactive techniques to engage the viewer which, from what I saw of the many children who were present and some of us adults, seemed to be going down a treat!The biggest exhibit and, of course, my favourite, was the massive indoor rainforests which spans all floors on one side of the complex. Brilliantly imagined, it can be viewed from many angles, from below the water, where plants, fish and turtles love in the tropical soup, to the twisted treetops and everything between.Very exciting and worth at least half a day. A world class museum."

Simply the best museum / science / art experience you can have in Barcelona and at an absolute bargain price. It cost just 4 euro's for adults and is free for kids and you can comfortably spend 3 - 4 hours here and still not see everything. Don't be put off by the location! It's very easy to get here if you know how, although I couldn't find clear instructions the first time so this should help :-Go via metro on the L7 line right to the end (Av. del Tibidabo stop) - We went from Placa Catalunya and it is covered on a T10 ticket.When you come out of the metro station look across the road where the hill starts to go up. You need the 2nd bus stop up on the right. Walk past the Tram stop where there's normally a big queue, it's the next one up you need - the 196 bus, although it doesn't say that on the bus stop so don't panic)Again you can use your T10 ticket on the ticket reader on the bus and it counts as the same journey - you don't need to speak to the driver (With my terrible pronunciation he never has a clue where I say I'm going!)Stay on the bus all the way to the top where it turns round and comes back down in a loop that goes right past CosmoCaixa (It will be on your right as you go back down)If you press to stop the bus as soon as you see it there's a stop 2 mins walk past it - There's a big U-Boat in the middle of the road here too and then you're there.You can walk up the hill in about 15 mins but it's very hot and tiring for kids and you'll be doing lots of walking when you get into CosmoCaixa, so avoid if possible. If you do walk, go up the hill on the left hand side of the road and take the first left which will take you straight there.As for the place itself it is simply massive, air conditioned and never crowded - absolute bliss to escape the city crowds and loads of room for your kids to run about. I won't go through everything that's there (Check the website) but some of the highlights are a complete amazon rainforest with snakes, tropical fish and birds, loads of interactive hands on science stuff, a planetarium, art, fossils and prehistoric man, geology - something to interest everyone. It's great if you get a rare rainy day, but also great to cool down on a hot day too.There's a decent cafe there but it can get busy - we take our own picnic and there are loads of places to eat both indoor and outdoor. Be prepared for a lot of walking as there is so much to see, but having paid loads for 'family' tickets at most other museums and attractions this is superb value and thoroughly entertaining. Would recommend this place to all ages but if you have kids they'll absolutely love it while learning loads too."

I have been here several times with my son since he was about 2 with the last visit being last week (July 2016). It has something for all ages and is very interactive with lots of buttons to press. In fact my son loves it so much it is sometimes hard to keep up with him as he rushes from one display to the next. If you have time to stop and read the text next to each display you will find them also in English. Probably the most impressive part is the flooded forest, which although small does a good job of recreating a little bit of rain forest with accompanying fauna (look out for the leaf-cutter ants fascinating!). Apart from the permanent exhibition area there are usually at least 2 other temporary exhibits. At the moment one is about scientific research and the other about the evolution of hominids. You will also find a large open area (I think it is on level -2) where you can sit outside and eat a picnic or if you prefer you can go to the restaurant or cafe nearby. There are activities for children which have to be booked and paid for in advance, one is called Click and is basically an interactive playroom, and the other is called \" Toca Toca\", which gives you the opportunity to touch some animals and learn something about them. There is also a planetarium which I haven't visited yet.As fas as negatives are concerned: It can get really overcrowded on busy days which would inevitable spoil your experience, so it's best to go during the week in the afternoon with kids or during term time if you are visiting without children. The gift shop has some really nice things but unfortunately is incredibly overpriced even by normal gift shop standards. Also, the layout of the building takes a bit of getting used to as the entrance is at the top and you go down to visit the exhibitions. I would recommend using the lift and consulting the plan of the building which is next to it. Finally, the location is a bit out of the way and quite far from the centre of Barcelona. After trying various options I think the best way of getting there is to get the green metro line to Vall d'hebron, and then get the bus H4 which leaves you within a 5 minute walk of the museum."

Every display is in English also, but try get a map if you can.I will try not to repeat some of the points raised by others.Children up to age 16 are free and it is only \u20ac4 for adults. Customers of the bank La Caixa seem to get free entry also. There is a surcharge for activities but many have to be booked in advance so look up details on the website. There are 5 floors, but -5 is the main floor - huge, with fascinating science experiments what were suitable for all ages. The amazon rain forest was the highlight for us all - check out my photos. My daughter loved seeing the real animals and amazing fish.The restaurant closes around 4pm; it has an all you can eat buffet that looked good for \u20ac13.50 for adults and \u20ac8.50 for children. There is a small cafe that stays open later. On the day we were there, main museum was open till 8pm.We did not research parking, but it seemed difficult to get free on street, so we went to the designated underground which lets you access the museum directly.

CosmoCaixa is located far from the city center and thus far from most of the other major attractions (with the exception of Tibidabo), but if you are interested in science you should take your time and visit there nonetheless. Take metro line L7 from Placa Espanya to Avinguda Tibidabo (end of line). From there is only a short walk uphill to CosmoCaixa. Most of the museum is underground. The visit starts on the lower 5th floor! There you can do a lot of hands-on experiments pertaining to various fields of physics, take a look at the massive Mur Geol\u00f2gic (Geological Wall) or walk through the Bosc Inundat (Inundated Forest), a re-creation of a flooded Amazonian forest. There you can see various plant and animal species such as caimans, poisonous snakes or the huge arapaimas. From time to time, you can even experience a tropical rainshower pouring down (but its area is limited so you won't get wet)."

At the entrance there are toilets and lockers and a ticket desk. Entrance fee was 4 euros which is amazingly cheap considering.All the exhibits have been thought about and feel original. There is a mechanical device which lifts up sycamore seeds then drops them, next to some information about pollen distribution. There is a stroboscope on a water stream, next to information about surface tension. There is a tube which visibly loops around the entire building. You talk into one end then a second later hear yourself out the other. And on and on. Lots of simple scientific concepts being demonstrated in fun and entertaining ways.The floors above -5 are either function rooms or only open certain times or for special events. This wasn't made at all clear to us and so we ended up wandering for a bit, finding out for ourselves that everything was shut.This was annoying and disappointing. Surely you could have a map or quick explanation at the ticket desk? If you go be sure to ask this before going in!The shop had a lot of interesting things, though mostly it was just standard science shop stuff, \"laboratories for kids\" that kinda stuff. Well priced though.Overall I'd definitely recommend going. Adults and kids will find this fun and interesting. Try and go when there are going to be less kids running around, and remember to ask where's open at the ticket desk."

Most of the theories were interactive and that was the best part about it for him. The day we went, there was huge group of school children there, it made the place really busy and cramped. We would have enjoyed more if it was a little less busy, but nevertheless, it was a great experience. It was really reasonable to enter. \u20ac4 for adult and free for children upto16 years old. We also booked a planetarium show about the history of aviation; my son loves planes so we had to see this. It was \u20ac4 per person, including children. We were given 3D glass and headphones for translation to English. The screen was dome shaped. The show stared and we had major trouble making our headphones work. Mine did not work the whole time.

While I really think this is an awesome place for kids of all ages and adults, I felt a bit overwhelmed by its size. My piece of advise would be to get a bit informed before you go and then choose a topic you'd really like to explore a bit deeper. I think it is impossible to really look at everything in just one day. Experiments are very well done and mostly easy to understand. The place was LOADED with school groups of all ages so be prepared for some moody teens and very happy toddlers ;-) Don't miss the outdoor area.

She particularly loved the flooded rainforest fish tanks. Mesmerised by all the fish. You could easily spend 3-4 hours in here. Lots to see and learn about. Easily one of the biggest and well thought out science museums I've been to"

The place has a tropical forest with lots of life animals too. My grumpy 14 year old had a great time and so had the more cheerful 10 year old ... I think it is an all ages thing. Perfect to bridge the rainy morning or hide from the sun in summer ... You probably need more than half a day if you want to properly explore everything. Last but not least ... Kids under 16 go for free ... Adults 4 euro ( four !). One of the few occasions you do not feel robbed when entering."

This is not very clear at the entrance. But even without extra tickets you can spend a great deal of time inside, because there is just so incredibly much to do.And of course, the indoor rainforest. My favorite part of the entire place. It's hot, it has plants, birds and a lake-like aquarium, and from time to time it simulates rain...

I wish I had the same chance when I was a kid.In CosmoCaixa you can try lots of thing yourself and I do encourage you to do so. For example, you can get an answer to \"what falls first? a feather or iron bullet\" by example (in vacuum or air).There are some attractions to be pre-paid (like Toca-toca = Touch-touch) where you can touch various animals. Unfortunately we were not aware that we should pay those at the entrance so make sure to ask for those when buying tickets (btw, it's very cheap and free for kids!)Not far from CosmoCaixa, there is the track of Barcelona's only historical tram which you can take and continue further to a theme park called Tibidabo, thus finishing a day full with a lot of fun."

I allocated a bout 2 and a half hours but could have spent MUCH longer! The main attraction for me was the planetarium, but unfortunately I arrived just after one session had started, and the other session was too late for me to stay for, which was a shame. So please be wary of this. The only bad thing I could say is that, as I went on a weekday, there was an abundance of screaming children who were not interested in the science, and this distracted me a bit. But overall 10/10!"

Maybe, if you are just visiting the city there will be more places to visit before it.The worst point is its location.

FYI... If you decide to do this and Tibidabo on the same day (as we did) since they are in the same general vicinity, you'll have to get a taxi to take you to your next destination. Not a big deal just something to be aware of."

The price is just nothing (free for a child, 2 EUR for an adult).In the reality exposition takes only one floor while the rest 5 are used for lectures, planetarium and other purposes. Scientific exhibition is definitely interesting. We were amazed by the wave and light related demonstration. Tropical forest with a bunch of fish in mangra was slightly unexpected but still very beautiful. One disappointment for my child was the fact that areas for child madness were either closed or available to school groups only on the weekdays. Also the Medditerenian garden was closed. Still the place is worth visitng and is a great fun for both kids and adults"

We found the museum very easily from the Avinguda del Tibidabo Metro stop at the end of Line 7 and a 15 minute walk up the hill and left onto Carrer dels quatre Camins...unfortunately for us in the pelting rain! What a wonderful museum, best described as an aquarium, science museum and natural history, technology museum all rolled into one. We visited with our preschooler and she was enthralled with the place, so many things to see and try. The hands on exhibits were all working which makes a nice change!! We loved the flooded amazon rain forest with all the different animals, fish, habitat etc.The facilities were all clean, we made very good use of the hand dryers to try and dry off!!!Unfortunately, due to the weather we were unable to make use of the big outdoor space, which would have been nice to have our picnic, instead we were content on a bench inside. Although there looked to be very good cafe/restaurant available.Had we visited Barcelona as a couple we would never have thought to visit this attraction but us adults enjoyed the visit just as much as our little one. We have to say that this is one of the best if not THE best museum we have been to. Well worth the walk up the hill and brilliant price at 4 Euros each and free for our little one.We highly recommend this place."

The reproduction of an amazzonian forest is great and very well done. The science experiments are very clever and allow kids and grownups to understand the physics and science in a practical way.

CosmoCaixa offers you a great experience while introducing you to the basics of spices evolution, physics, botany, etc. It is an excellent place to go with children. The younger will enjoy specially the rainforest setting with exotical plants and animals.One of the most amazing activities is the Planetarium where different shows let you learn a lot about stars, galaxies and univers. You have to buy an extra ticket for it and, since there is a limited number of seats, it is better to buy them in advance or as soon as you get into the CosmoCaixa facilities."

Located up hill (which created an enjoyable long walk from Plaza Catalunya for me).The Amazon rain forest exhibition is indeed something you do not see elsewhere. Overall, around 40% of the exhibition was more fact telling about geology and history of mankind (not exactly evolution), but I enjoyed the rest (more physical phenomena) enough to fill my day.Except from the rain forest I cannot recall an exhibit that is not common to most science museums so if you already saw several of those, then probably come only if you are deeply into science museums."

Only 5-7 min walk. [Afterwards we walked up to the Funicular, another similar walk up the hill.] We arrived at 1005 and thought it was closed it was so quiet.

The automated exhibit at the base with seeds scattered is just the start of many lovely well conceived and delivered ideas. The most amazing of which is the rainforest reproduction.We did the one English language activity the Toca Toca. The guide was great knowledgeable and friendly.

You can do both trips using just one journey on the T10 card. We found it difficult to spot. if using the bus get off when you see a large submarine in the middle of the road. The entrance is just opposite this. It is a huge red brick traditional building. It's a great science museum with so much to see, lots of interactive experiments and demonstrations of physical phenomena and an amazing tropical rain forest right in the middle of the museum. It is really cheap too (4 Euros for persons over . There are loads of lockers by the information desk. It was something completely different for the children and most of it out of the sun.It's a mix of natural history and science. The entrance leads to a spiral slope. At the bottom of the slope is a little exhibit with helicopter seeds. You are now at level -5 and ready to start a journey through pre-history and evolution. Considering the low entry fee and amount of things to do, not to mention the great cafe we were shocked at how little the place was used."

Find out what a wasp and Barcelona taxi have in common, how electric fish evade and defend from predators, how aeroplanes fly (the physics of flight) and read about the story of the sly octupus. Also see the wonderful re-creation of an Amazon rainforest and learn about volcanoes and earthquakes on the Geological Wall. Arrived at around half 11 and didn't leave until closing time. Admittedly was obsessively reading the descriptions in Spanish as well in my attempts to improve my language skills (since I was in Barcelona for a month), but even so, you could easily spend the whole day here without even noticing the passing of time, since there are also a few exhibitions/ shows which you can pay extra for. You would have to enquire about these since the counter staff do not spontaneously mention them without prompted. This science museum has that rare blend of being deeply educational, interactive, fun and memorable. It is spread out 'underground' over 5 floors and the last (i.e. the bottom floor) is by far the best: a unique blend of physics, biology, chemistry and a smattering of psychology in the form of optical (and other) illusions......think a huge kids' playground yet x 100 more educational. ......not that this museum is the preserve of school-age children. I'm 22 and while reading the complementary explanations brought back memories of knowledge taxingly gleaned from college lessons, I still enjoyed operating the floating ball using the vacuum and marvelling at the massive block of ice that doesn't melt whilst trying to get it to with my hands. On one of the floors below, there is a seemingly all-day cafe and a buffet-style restaurant that opens at 1pm, priced at around 13 euros including a drink. There is a limited selection of around 6 main dishes, a salad bar and an area for desserts, which seemed almost hidden at the back. Might as well take advantage of the buffet given that dinner time might not be for a while! On the same floor, there is a very nice garden with benches in shaded parts where you can take a rest and enjoy the tranquillity. The museum is very peaceful, being away from hustle and bustle of the city centre and away from the tourist masses. Only had to queue for around 5 minutes on a Saturday morning. To get there, you can take the metro L7 from Plaza Catalunya (also stops at Gracia) until its final stop, Av. del Tibidabo. From there, it's a 10 minute uphill trek and a left turn at the top. There's also a blue tourist tram that you can take from Av. Tibidabo but it seems a bit of a rip-off at around 5.50 euros just for one-way ticket; you might as well get the taxi if you don't fancy the uphill walk.Would get there for when it opens next time but for \u20ac4, it represents the best value for money amongst all the tourist attractions and without the crowds they usually attract. I would say CosmoCaixa is a must if you have kids!"

And there is so much to see and do inside. Most things are hands on, so kids get to experience physics first hand. There is also a pretty cool Amazon forest exhibit with lots of animals. My fav Barcelona experience!"

I attended with my boyfriend (both age 21) and was amazed by the amount of things there were to do. We could have easily stayed there for over 3 hours but didn't have much time. If you go we recommend you stay for awhile and don't rush it as there's not only lots of experiments to do but also insects, fish and other small animals to look at. As well as all the wildlife in the amazing indoor rainforest. Definitely make the journey there and if you're able don't bother getting the tram up the hill, it's really not that far from the metro at all!"

What a great idea to encourage children to come. There were some very large groups of kids with one or two adults who had come to visit, I am sure the free admissions to kids had a lot to do with this. Bring your children here rather than let them sit in front of the boob tube or video game console for the day. The exhibits were very well designed and almost all working. Everything was explained in English. They had a 3D movie in English as well (extra cost). My 14 and 11 year old kids happily spent 4 to 5 hours at this museum without complaining. There is a cafeteria with sandwiches and snacks and coffee. There is also a restaurant with a buffet which cost 13.50 for adults and 8.50 for kids. Highly recommend this museum in Barcelona."

So many really interesting and first rate exhibits, hand-on science with many live animals as well in cool little habitats, even a capybara in the rainforest. Brand new and vastly engaging.

This science museum is at the base of Tibidabo so if you time the journey right it is possible to get to Av. de Tibidabo on the L7 (from Pl Catalanya) then a bus and the funicular up to look around and then back to the science museum on one T10 journey.The museum itself is a great expo of life on earth. A mix of natural history and science with a small smattering of zoo thrown in. In fact we were planning to go to the zoo but were advised that the cages are rather small and upsetting so opted for this suggestion instead. And we were very satisfied with the choice.The entrance leads to a spiral slope following the first few thousands of millions of years of Earth with only bacteria eventually turning up. At the bottom of the slope is a fun little exhibit with helicopter seeds (sorry can't remember the trees proper name). The emblematic tree you see in many of the pictures of Cosmo Caixa is also here.You are now at level -5 and ready to start a journey through pre-history and evolution or modern science. We also had the pleasure of 2 exhibitions on life in 2100 and Soyez 2. The latter was interesting though I had never heard of it so the Russian cover up obviously worked on me. The former was great for me as a sci-fi buff.Throughout the building there are exhibits with text in Catalan, Spanish and English. There are also a LOT of interactive things. We spent half a day there and could easily have gone back again. For only 4 Euros per adult you get a lot for your money and then there is the extra of the rain forest habitat with fish and animals plus rain. There are some extras including a planetarium which is a 3D cinema but as the screen covers the whole roof images of space etc are full on.The other floors above -5 are a bit sparse unless you are using the seminar rooms or other special areas (Clik, Toca Toca and Flash). There are a couple of outside spaces with a few things to do in them, I'd recommend the Archimedes one for the big toys (only 2 mind you).Considering the entry fee (almost lack of) and amount of things to do, not to mention the great restaurant we were shocked at how little the place was patronised. Maybe it gets busy in the Spanish holidays. So if you are fed up of the Barcelona history and \"culture\" then make the small effort to get to Cosmo Caixa."

It has so much to see, from experiments and demonstrations of physical phenomena to an amazing tropical rain forest right in the middle of the museum. True, it\u2019s located a bit off the center but it\u2019s really easy to get there with line 7 (brown). Just get off at Tibidabo Av. (last stop) and walk up hill. The fee is ridiculous (4 Euros for persons over 16). I recommend getting there early and having the place not as crowded. There is also a nice gift shop, a little on the expensive side. Put your bags in the lockers by the information desk. It was a good change of pace for the kids (12, 11 and 6 but really all ages will enjoy it) and the adults loved it as well."

Very impressive building, great wax work of Einstein at the ticket desk. Went down to the 5th floor, where the main body of exhibits are. We are not Spanish speaking but everything was written in English for the main part so no problems understanding instructions. The most impressive part and worth the trek here was for the Amazon experience. You walked through the doors and were hit with a blast of heat, which keeps the plants and creatures at the best temperature closest to their natural habitat. The sounds and smells were amazing and although it is a small exhibit it was great. The rest of the 5th floor was very hands on and my lads enjoyed the chance to play with the various exhibits. We looked at the other floors but they were for temporary exhibits, planetarium etc. My boys are 8, 11 and 13 and all would say they enjoyed it, and with it being free for children it is a big draw however they felt there wasn't half enough to play with there compared to our favourite so far,The W5 in Belfast, Northern Ireland."

Many of the exhibits are interactive as well as impressive in size (a must see is Foucault\u2019s pendulum). There are also live exhibits including an artificial rainforest which was stunning. We spent four hours in there and still didn\u2019t manage to get round it all. The building is well designed, on several floors and connected by lots of escalators that make it easy to get around.

It holds a Foucault pendulum, exemplifying the rotation of the Earth, various physical-mechanical exhibits allowing you to experience the laws of physics yourself, nature exhibits explaining fractals, cyanobacteria and many more. Mainly geared towards children but interesting for adults, too. The best part is the artificial rainforest set up in a portion of the floor, with live crocodiles, turtles and massive fish in the water, birds running around you, rainshowers and a real live capibara.

It is a perfect place for nature and science enthusiasts. Unfortunately we came way too late, we had just 2 hours to see it :/ I recommend arriving early, so you have enough time (I would say 4-5 hours) since its really big - it has 4 or 5 floors. It's perfect for kids, who will have lots of fun trying out the interactive tools (and additionally learn something) and watching animals.

The Museum itself is spacious, well distributed, coherent, interactive, and with good explanations about scientific phenomena, facts and laws. I highly recommend it for those interested in the subject or even for those that are absolutely bored of just wall hanging text on the museums. The cafeteria could improve though, in terms of offer, quality and pricing."

There are great and very life-like figures of early Stone Age men ( and women) .... And lots of interactive, hands-on installations to help explain science in fun, visual ways.

We were particularly impressed with the Amazon rain forest exhibit, a mini forest with live animals, birds and fish, and dwarf kaymans, with artificial rainfall and typical atmospheric environment, it would be the pride of any zoo in the world. All that for the unbeatable price of 4 euros pp, which makes any other attraction severly overpriced.

It was definitely entertaining for a while however after exploring the bottom level we quickly grew bored. The upstairs levels hold nothing except large theaters and the planetarium which run shows throughout the day. Because we were there later in the day we missed all of the planetarium shows so make sure you check the timetable before visiting. Maybe if we made it in time our experience would have been better. The layout is rather confusing and we spent a lot of time exploring the other floors and not finding anything. There were no staff members around to ask either which was frustrating. The rainforest was interesting however i don't feel it was quite large enough for the land animals that are housed there."

This attraction was a bit out of the way and a good 10 min walk from the Metro, but then that also meant it was quiet and no queue to get in. It was very cheap to get in (8 euros for adults and children free) and kept us amused for 3-4 hours. If we'd have been organised and timed our visit to catch some of the shows we would have been there even longer so excellent value for money. It has the largest amount of interactive displays I've ever seen - great fun, particularly the giant block of ice. Very informative section about the Meditarranean, plus lots of geological info etc. Great for my son who is an aspiring geologist-come-oceanographer - he was mesmerised!Definitely recommended."

I found myself enjoying and learning at the same time. The interior of the museum is lovely and also the walk through flooded rainforest was great! I would come here again and visit the planetarium, sadly the tickets were sold out for the day so you should book online if you want to see that.

I cannot describe it, it is like an architectural wonder, a museum, an art gallery, an aquarium, a playcenter, and a botanical garden all rolled into one. The ladies and gentleman at CosmoCaixa have created wonderful interactive installations that will help you refract light at the touch of a button, create waves, replicate sand dunes, operate a hot air balloon and much more.

My only regret is that we did not allow more time for this fabulous spot. It amazes me that we had to queue for hours for some cbd based gaudi spots when this was almost empty. It is a 5-6 storey building which is architecturally beautiful, being designed in a helix shape where a central ramp runs down through all five stories. There is an internal rainforest (a real one as my son kept on exclaiming) and the design, layout and information are just incredible on every level. We loved it and sincerely wished that we could spend more time there. My son is still talking about it ... it set a whole new benchmark for museums/science and technology centers anywhere.

On one of the rainy days in Barcelona, we chose to trek to Cosmocaixa which is located near the Av. de Tibidabo subway station that can be reached via L7. From the station it's a short walk to reach the place.I had seen the good reviews beforehand, but I couldn't believe what a bargain this place is. For adults it costs 4 euros for entrance, kids under 16 are free. The movies and some other things would've required separate tickets, but we arrived in the afternoon so didn't think there would be time to enjoy the extra activities.The place is bigger than expected, with different scientific contraptions to tinker with. Each section had information and guidance in Catalan, Spanish and English so I had no problem explaining each part to my kids. Suffice to say, we learned a great deal that afternoon and had a blast. Best part in my opinion was the rainforest-section, with lots of animals including fish, tortoise, snake, spider and other critters of the Amazon. After seeing this I did not feel so bad about not visiting the city zoo.If you arrive early, you might combine Cosmocaixa with a trip up the Tibidabo. But I guarantee that you will not want to just run through the place, take your time and enjoy everything it has to offer."

Paid extra \u20ac4 each for planetarium show- enjoyable 40 min show about space technology. 3-D glasses & audio headsets in English (or French?) provided. Entrance to main exhibits down long spiral walkway representing age of earth with fairly sparse exhibits en route. Finally reach main floor & any misgivings dispersed. 1st section on Mediterranean was interesting- text in Catalan, Spanish & English. Short videos also played in English. Various sections devoted to different aspects of science & technology & lots of interactive stuff most of which actually worked. Particularly good section on motion & Newton's Laws. But highlight & contrast to \"hard\" technology was the rainforest. Viewing panels allowed you to see the fish under water whilst walking underneath & around the trees and there were capybara & birds above. Rock lovers would appreciate the massive geological specimens- but we were tiring by this point.Spent about 3 hours there altogether & skipped over some sections. There were also separate temporary exhibitions- currently one on drugs- plus activities for younger children on at weekends. I don't know if they'd be accessible in English.I'd recommend to all groups although limited appeal for toddlers. My nearly 17 yr old really enjoyed it & engaged with all of it. Good for adults too."

Despite these, entry to this museum was probably the best \u20ac4 I spent in Barcelona - I highly recommend it!Tip: there isn't a huge amount on floors -4 to -2, so don't feel any need to rush level -5."

I didn't like the exhibition on the Mediterranean though, it was made up of a lot of text screens, some movies, and a few interactive things that in my opinion was a bit boring. But to each his own, I'm sure some would have loved it. When we first came past this, the rest of the museum was amazing. I loved how interactive it was throughout, they illustrated the science in a fun and easy-to-understand way. The flooded forest was also a highlight, we could see both over and under water through the glass. The ducks were showing off in the water, and were especially fun to watch :) The museum had English text throughout the exhibitions, which is a huge plus. I found the entrance to the flooded forest a bit hard to find though. The entry price is good, there's lots of seating areas. It is a bit hard to find by bus/metro. We popped by after visiting Tibidabo. The bus going from the funicular and down, goes right past this museum (there is a bus stop right outside).I would want to return if given the opportunity, it's a great museum :)"

You could spend the whole day here if you wanted to check out every display so enough to keep children amused. My boyfriend and I (aged 24) don't have any kids but we still had a great time in there!Easy to get to on the metro. Its about a 10-15 min walk uphill from the metro station so anyone who has difficultly walking may want to take the tram up the steep hill instead. Overall, great museum.

And I would suggest doing them in this order, so any walking done is downhill... It is truly amazing value for money for such a small entrance fee and the amount of fun to be had. There is so much to see and everything is well laid out. The rainforest area with the giant fish and tank is spectacular. There is a well stocked souvenir shop with interesting items at reasonable prices. We ate at the cafe, and the food was also reasonable.From Tibidabo, take the tram down. At the tram station, follow the tram line downhill until you reach an underpass. Cross over and you will see a submarine to your right, walk towards it. The CosmoCaixa will be on your left. Should take 10-15 minutes.Once you're done, take the small steps going down near the entrance, the L7 train station is about 10 minutes walk away."

First of all - easy to get to on Line 7 of the underground system - you are in Zone 1 the whole way, so just need a zone 1 ticket (the ticket machines are slightly confusing if you are used to just popping on the other metro lines) - and then a fairly short (although uphill) walk. The museum itself uses tubing to demonstrate passage of time between earth's creation out of a supernova cloud, the beginning of life, and various evolutionary milestones. Fossils are nicely added as supportive evidence. Good display on the history of the Mediterranean Sea as well as current risks from climate change and invasive species. Nice section on basic physics (one of us has a strong science background, the other is an artist - and the artist found things easy to follow and \"learned a ton\") - the amazon rainforest was interesting and impressive, but I didn't think it was really the strong suit of this museum, even though it is a selling point. The only downside was incredibly unruly adolescents who were literally running and chasing each other through the museum. I'd highly recommend this to adults, families...you could spend 2 hours there, or 5 hours there...We didn't do the planetarium, but that would add more time as well. FEE IS VERY REASONABLE!!!!"

Once at the bottom, there's a bast room of interactive and fun exhibits explaining physics, biology and chemistry in a way that is accessible to anyone, even young kids. There was a temporary exhibition on the mediteranian sea when we visited, which taught me a lot of interesting tid bits. Once you get through the exhibits and one end, there's a tropical aqauriam full of amazing fish, one of which was absolutely huge. It rains in the aquariam, despite being indoors, to keep the climate authentic.

Plenty to see and re-visit.We didn't have to pay to enter because we are members of Caixa bank but it was free the day we went for everyone, with only extra payment required for other activities such as the star viewing (sorry name escapes me).

There is even an aquarium (so you can forget the overpriced one on the water front) and a rainforest. We spent several hours in here, and only really explored the ground floor.

From there, move quickly through the ramps of dinosaur-age things down to the -5 level, where 95% of the museum's stuff is. The rainforest is awesome, and so many of the \"exhibits\" are interactive, it's impossible not to enjoy yourself. I think it'd be good for kids 6 through 60. The museum has everything from preserved artifacts (or recreations) from ages past, as well as timeless physics and biology exhibits. If you've got an afternoon free and aren't sure what to do, this won't disappoint. I'm not generally one for museums, but I'd block out 3 hours for this one."

There is no automatic ticket machine, only 4 ticket windows for hundreds of visitors. Terrible first impression when you have two small kids in tow. Considering it is a science museum, they should have done a better job managing the entrance technology!!! But your ticket in advance if you don't want to wait in line."

The museum is a little out of the way, but worth the effort to get there. The flooded forest exhibit was fantastic, and entire miniature ecosystem, complete with rainforest fish, mammals, and rain. The interactivity of many exhibits was fantastic, and the artistic quality of many of them.Due to the time we went, early afternoon, a number of areas were closed for the traditional Siesta, and as we had other things to do that day we had to leave without seeing them, but this can be avoided with a little more planning.Food was rather expensive however, best to bring a lunch as I did."

For just 4 euros you get to play with most of the exhibit's pieces, to get to understand better the principals that they are depicting for you. I was most impressed by the flooded forest ecosystem that they recreated inside the museum. It's really amazing when you enter there and the temperature instant changes, exotic birds go around you free and everything seems to be so real. it's like you are suddenly in the jungle. What I didn't enjoy was the journey to the museum. It's kind of far from the center and the touristic maps don't show you all the small streets that are in the area and it's really easy to get lost. And the people from the streets can't really help you since they don't know English and it was hard to find someone who knew where the museum was. But in the end it was definitely worth the trouble."

I have seen a few impressive aquariums in my time, including the huge display at Atlantis in Dubai, but the Amazon display is far more than a simple aquarium.There are excellent viewing areas for both above and below water level. The integration of trees and some above ground animals into the display is almost unique, plus the rain feature that simulates a downpour brings the big piracu to the surface. We were even fortunate enough to see one of the piracu slap the water fiercely during a simulated shower, and it sure gave us a start! Just brilliant and easy to get to via the metro."

The rainforest is worth a visit, or if your feet are tired after walking around you can sit down and warch the giant fish tank (with equally giant fish). We didn't have time to visit the planetarium, but I'm definitely doing that the next time I'm at CosmoCaixa!Now, some practical information.People find the museum hard to find, and I agree that there could be a sign or two pointing the way. If you're arriving by tourist bus or metro to Av. Tibidabo, all you have to do is walk up the hill from the stop until you meet a freeway. Turn left, walk alongside the freeway until you see a brick building with a pool-like fountain outside. This is the museum. (Alternate method of ascending the hill is the Tramvia Blau towncar, but if you're up to walking, it's maybe a ten-minute walk. Also, walking is free!)The planetarium (and other attractions at the museum, I think) cost extra. They informed us about this when I visited with my friend in 2010, but not this time. So if you're planning on seeing it, you'll have to let them know when you're buying your ticket! The food in the cafeteria was mediocre at best, expensive, and cold. I'd try the restaurant instead.All in all, this museum should be on your itinerary if you're into science, rain forests, or if you've got nothing to do on a rainy day. It's cheap (?3 or so without entrance to the planetarium), and you most definitely get your money's worth!"

We went to the planetarium show and listened to the commentary in English on headphones. Well worth it. There are only a few shows a day, so be sure to check out the timings as soon as you arrive or on the internet.The museum itself is on several floors and is accessed by gently sloping ramps (as opposed to stairs) and there is also a walkway at the top of the building which winds its way down.There is so much to see and experience, and all the scientific activities/experiments had English explanations. There are also fish, plants, habitats, etc to see, and the best of these is the living rainforest, complete with birds and a capybara (like a giant guinea pig! ). The indoor pond contains carnivorous fish so make sure your hands don't go in the water! (The warning sign is very small). There is a caf\u00e9, and also a restaurant with a \"buffet libre\" (all you can eat) which is much better value overall for around 12-14 euros each than bits and pieces from the caf\u00e9 which soon add up. Our meal was very good with plenty of selection and lovely desserts.Nice clean toilets on the ground floor before the help desk.Gift shop ok but quite pricey- lots of scientific books and loosely-based science souvenirs for children.Quite a few things to look at outside as well - refer to your plan.Very relaxing trip where children can run about and try \"stuff\" without being told not to touch! Allow several hours.It's easy to catch the bus forTipidabo from outside the museum - I think it's number 196 - and then the cable car."

We love to visit science museums with our kids and read the good reviews of this place before this visit to Barcelona.The museum is quite a bit out of the way and we had a little hard time finding it from the Tibidabo trainstation. I reccomend downloading a map of the route before leaving your wi-fi.We had read that the 3D show was a must. We purchased the Barcelona Card that included entrance for the museum.When we arrived 3 staff members were in the lobby. We placed our bags in the lockers and went to talk to them, showing our Barcelona Card and asking about the time when the 3D show would starf. We were obviously disturbing their private discussion (only guest in lobby at the time) and they told us to go to ticket sales further on. There wer handed in two tickets from the BCN card.This is a big place and you can wander in different directions. We found the place for the 3D show and showed up there first, we saw a sigh that seats were limited so we waited there for 20 min for it to start and us to get seats. Two attendants were there but did not adress us in any way.When the previous show ended and the theater was opened for us we found out that we should have purchased tickets for this show!Staff tried to send us away (it takes 5 min to get to lobby from there) but we refused. Afterwards we were escorted back to the service desk to pay for the 3D movie but received no apology for the lack of info and limited aknowledge of the point that you need to tell your customers when there is an extra fee! For example indicate this info on the sign outside the theatre.The kids loved this place, the 3D was fantastic (Darwin). In some areas info was only in Spanish, that is a down side. We had a really nice lunch buffet in the restaurant, there is also a cafeteria.They need to improve their info, both oral and written. This does not come close to Tom Tits in Sweden in my opinion and we enjoyed the Science museum in Halifax, NS more even as it is not as fancy as this one.More fun for children than adults here.If we had received better service from the girls in the guest services this would be a rating of 4, not 2."

Forget the Aquarium- this place is far far superior, not to mention ,nicer & much cheaper too. AND the cafe and restaurants are good too. (We ate lunch at the restaurant which was a very good buffet-type of arrangement). Alternatively there are numerous shady places to eat a picnic too.We arrived about 1.30 and there was a massive queue to get the tickets (under 16's are free but will still need a ticket and after 3pm it's free to all) - the staff were pretty unhelpful at the ticket counter though and we had to ask about the additional activities going on such as the Planetarium 3D, otherwise they wouldn't have mentioned it. The museum tickets allow you entry in/out all day. If you decide to go for the Planetarium too (I'd highly recommend it, only 4 euro each and it was awesome) do check which show you'll be seeing - we didn't even know we had a choice.We saw the spectacular Natural Selection show about Charles Darwin; we all loved it. You can get headphones for translation (free) inside the planetarium. The 3D effects were tremendous, even to my kids who watch 3D films on a frighteningly regular basis. It was great - my 10 & 7 year old kids loved it.The living rainforest is spectacular; full of fish, birds and leave-cutter ants, as well as a Capybura and amazing foliage and trees. There are also snakes, spiders and other tropical beasties to be seen - a sure-fire winner with kids & adults alike.As well as this there were loads of other exhibitions & hands-on stuff. We were there for 4 hours but could have easily stayed longer and seen even more. I can't recommend this place enough. The shop is good with lots of pocket-money priced bits for kids to buy. One word of advice though - if you are driving, the signs for the car park are pretty well-hidden but there is a car park around the back of the museum. The first two hours are free but after that the charges mount up - we paid almost 12 euros for our stay even with the 2 hours free! But oh, SO well worth it."

Small cafe on top of the museum was nice for coffee and cake. Tip for getting there by public transport - take the bus196 almost all the full circle from the metro station (so up to the funicular and then back down to the second but last stop) - takes 10 minutes and you get a view from the top and avoid the 15 minute uphill walk.

We did the obligatory trip the Camp Nou in the morning and then headed up to Cosmo Caixa (10 mins drive away and easy to find). It was the perfect anecdote to the football stadium. Firstly there was ample parking on site, unlike Camp Nou and secondly it was incredibly good value, unlike Camp Nou. Once inside there are lots of activities for your kids to do and view. My children are aged between 2-8yrs but I spotted other families with teenagers equally enjoying themselves. The restaurant was clean and the bathrooms equally so. I'd recommend the rain forest path and try to time your stroll for one of the frequent simulated rainwater downpours. The were interactive science activities in addition to the fish/turtles to view. I've never been to a place like this before. The best way I can think of describing it is a blend between the Eden Project in Cornwall and the Science Museum in London. You'd probably struggle to spend a whole day here but can certainly happily pass 4-5hrs. We took an early breakfast at our hotel, got to the Camp Nou early before it got too hot/crowded. 200 euros/3 hrs later headed up to Cosmo Caixa and then spent 50 euros/5 hrs. My four children loved the day. I would certainly recommend Cosmo Caixa."

It has a tropical rain Forrest where you can see a capybara, fish and other south American species. Great value for money. To get there you have to go by FGC to Tibidabo and take a 10 minute walk. Don't take the blue tram, it's expensive and it won't get you near the museum."

Most tourist to Barcelona focus on the Gaudi venues, old town, beaches etc, but add CosmoCaixa to the must visit list. I had a chance to spend an hour or two looking at the exhibits during a recent conference as the venue. The miniature living rainforest is worth the entry alone. The other exhibits are well laid out and engaging. They brought out the kid in me. Explanations are in English, as well as Catalan and Spanish."

The only extra we paid for was the 3D planetarium. This show was breathtaking and shouldn't be missed - truly stunning. The rest of the kid friendly stuff was on the lowest floor - including the awesome flooded rainforest. It's hard to convey how enormous this exhibit is. The rest of this floor is the most amazing exploratory with dozens and dozens of interactive exhibits - the sheer number meant there weren't really any waiting times to have a go. The lighting levels are quite low and this made some of the signs explaining the exhibits quite hard to read but that was hardly a big minus. The exploratory was also all in one huge room and it was brilliant to be able to let my daughter (age 8) explore at will while I watched the fish in the flooded rainforest. Compared to the prices for the Zoo and SeaQuarium, we thought the entry fee was a real steal. It also was free to enter after 3pm. It's not on a direct metro route but we did see the Blue Tram within a few hundred yards and we caught a taxi from Placa Catalunya and it was about \u20ac8"

The best thing about our visit included a trip to the planetarium which was one of the best experiences, and everything was in Catalan, Spanish or English. It is quite a trek from the city centre (and up a hill) so I would recommend either the metro or the bus touristique (which I cringe at the thought of, but having been on it, my mind has changed completely). Well worth the visit. Perhaps spend the morning in Parc Guell and proceed on to CosmoCaixa!"

They liked the fossils and rainforest exhibits the best, but were lost when I tried to explain some of the physics exhibits to them. We spent about 3 hours at the museum. We watched a 3D movie about Darwin and natural selection in the planetarium. I enjoyed this movie but would have liked it even more had there not been school children screaming every time a 3D creature appeared to come close..If its possible, try to go when school children aren't there. For 3/4 of the time we were there, there were also large groups of school children running around and screaming. They seemed unsupervised and swarmed all the most interesting exhibits. When they left the silence was almost deafening and the experience became far more enjoyable. Regardless, some level of chaos is to be expected in a location that primarily caters to children and we still had a good time.If you've only got a few days in Barcelona I would give this place a pass. But if you've got children and time its definitely worth checking out."

If I had paid 3 EUR for it - it would be a waste.If you go - there is a great self-service restaurant on the first floor : soup, salad, hot dishes, desert for a price of approximately 14 EUR per person."

The museum is hard to find so ask the tourist information people for directions. You can take the metro and walk about 10 minutes or take a bus right there.

There were lots of young children (school trips) running around which I thought were a bit too young for such an attraction, to fully understand and appreciate the interactive exhibits. It just got annoying when you were trying to look at something, and they were screaming over who was to 'play' with it.Though great for children, it is also a great place for adults to re-fresh their memories on how amazing the world is and how it's progressed. Lots to read, see and do that it can get a bit 'brain overload' after a while. Definitely could easily spend a whole day here.A mere entry fee at \u20ac3 (ours was free with a BCN card) it is most definitely worth the money. Also, a lovely cafe at the entrance/exit of the building with decent lunch foods at very reasonable prices."

Fantastic building and obviously a lot of money has been spent here but personally I found this museum quite dull, mostly interactive so ok for kids learning science at school but adults will find it somewhat tedious.( similar to Techniquest in Cardiff.) Half of the interactive elements didn't work and those that did where unimpressive representations of the principles and elements of basic physics. (maybe if I didn't work in the sciences I'd be more impressed - but I doubt it) We didn't stop for the planetarium show so cannot comment on that, we'd had enough by then."

Ok, so most everything is in Spanish, but even if you don't speak the language, it's ok, because CosmoCaixa is a science museum, and science is international. There's a ton of hands-on experiences, a lot of things to look at and play with. There's a mind game that had a lot of success with the kids- by the energy of your brain waves you have to push a ball on your opponent's side. There's also an amazon forest that you can walk through, an aquarium....a ton of things to discover. A great way to get out of the heat and to entertain the kids. Tickets are not at all expensive, but the museum is a bit out of the city center. Which is why there are hardly any tourists, mostly families and summer camp groups."

At \u20ac3 per adult, this museum represents magnificent value and even the restaurant/caf\u00e9 is inexpensive.

There is so much to see in Cosmo Caixa. We loved the rain forest and the tropical fish and reptiles. The interactive science exhibits were just wonderful. So many simple physics experiments to do. Also the section on the evolution of man. Plus the section on the development of the written word. There is a great temporary exhibition on at the moment on various diseases and how they spread.

The exhibits are organized in levels around a huge tree and includes a rain forest, aquarium at the lowest level, geological and biological exhibits as well as a planetarium. The building is beautiful as well. It's a great place for family with kids -- there are lots of interactive exhibits through which they can lean about science."

The museum is a short, steep walk, bus ride or old tram ride up from the Tibidabo terminus of the L7 metro, past rows of modernist mansions to a large plain building. However, once you are inside, it is beautifully laid out with quirky architecture and fantastic displays. The highlights for us were the flooded forest and a series of interactive exhibits on the power of the mind and perception. - with enough English signage and instructions to get by. The staff were very friendly and helpful when we did need help. Our two museum veterans (and sceptics) emerged contented after 2 and a half hours - exceptional value at 3 Euros for adults and 2 for children."

The upside down layout is exciting as is the first view of the main 'hall of matter' Also the rainforest exhibit is as good as most zoo aquariums.The main part of the museum is called the 'hall of matter' thats a pretty broad term and its a good clue for how the exhibits are put together - there are themed areas but on one floor pretty much every scientific concept is covered; adaptive evolution, the physical laws, you name it.All of these concepts are interpreted using 'hands on' displays. great what could be wrong with that? my concern though was that with so many very young children flying around whacking every button they could find it was almost over stimulating and almost impossible to explain to them what they were actually seeing. for instance one exhibit was attempting to explain the laws of entropy by using a large glass cube with sand in the bottom, compressed air would shoot up and disturb the sand. Kids loved it for the effect but trying to make the link between this effect and the laws of thermodynamics would be beyond the reach of most parents!Another really fascinating display showed how different mouth, throat, tongue shapes and positions created different vowel sounds using reeds and cross section diagrams. kids just kept holding down the buttons because they made a loud noise making it hard to explain what was going on.Another small gripe to get out of the way is the fact that the planetarium and touch events are separate and you have to get tickets at the desk. This is not obvious when you come in and the people on the desk don't tell you. This is a really bad system and needs looking at.Despite all this though is a great space, a very cheap day out compared to the aquarium or the zoo and you can easily spend the whole day there."

The other floors are hard to understand. You can wander away to places not knowing if you're supposed to be there at all.The most disappointing part for us was to discover that you can actually enter the rainforest only after leaving the museum.

I've been to science centers and science museums in Canada, the US, and the UK and this is the best one I've been to. While it doesn't have an area for pre-school aged kids, the exhibits are interactive enough that even young kids will be happy to push, pull, and whack things even if they don't understand the science. Many of the explanations are clear, yet advanced. I would say that kids who like science and are between the ages of 10 and 15 will get the most out of this centre, but younger kids and adults will find enough stuff to keep them interested. The main theme of the place is evolution. Meaning evolution of the planet as well as the species on the planet.The planetarium show was great and the rainforest is definitely a must see. It's probably about 5,000 square feet and 5 stories tall with walk ways under and through the forest and the water filled area. The fish in the water filled area are fascinating. Huge predatory fish from the amazon swim slowly past, surrounded by other fish and the shore of the rainforest. And it actually rains periodically.The design of the building is amazing. It goes down a hill, so you start at the top and move down towards the activities, shows, and exhibits. There's a massive 5 story spiral walkway that gives amazing views of the place (as well as escalators and elevators, if you wish).The entry was eur3.00 for people aged 8 and older. There are other activities that cost extra, like the planetarium. Each activity is eur2.00.We spent about 4 hours there, but could have spent many more. "

It is underrated I think, not very much advertised, but it is a wonderful place to spend a morning or afternoon with kids. My kids are 5 and 10 and I think they grew so much by just visiting this place for a few hours. They were amazed by all the interactive features, were fascinated by how a pully works, saw robots, walked into a rain forest, experienced what brain waves \"look like\" and learned about bacteria... My daughter is convinced she wants to become a scientist! And all this for under ten euros for the whole family. This must be the best kept secret in Barcelona for families. Especially if you have a rainy day on your visit (and even if you dont and your kids are into fun, scientific discoveries)-- do not miss!"

The visit at Cosmo Caixa ruined my plans of the day but made the children happy. Two huge arapaimas (about 1.5 - 2 metres long) swimming slowly between the roots of the flooded trees, together with piranhas, turtles and snakes is something that the kids will not easy forget. There are hundreds of things to see, to do and experience here: tropical birds wandering free between the visitors of the flooded forest, skeletons of dinosaurs, wax replicas of Neanderthal Humans and other humans ancestors, real mummies and so many others, exposed in a very attractive way. There is a small restaurant near the entrance and a picnic aria."

But it's very well worth the visit to learn more about our planet, to experience great hands on exhibits and an amazing experience for the hands on brigade, the teenagers and students, where you can get involved in science. Exhibits work well, are varied and interesting. The rain forest is staggering, viewed from above, below there is a real well planned sophistication about the way all the fish, reptiles, birds & animals are displayed, amongst the well simulated rain forest. It's a shame the Planetarium is only open at weekends but I've recently seen the one in New York. The cafe is pleasant, staff are not over friendly but are helpful enough and the price is really inexpensive, so no complaints.

Nevertheless, you find advertisements nowhere except in the name of the place, and entrance fees are very low. On the other hand, the parking garage is very convenient but expensive. Another problem is how crowded the place (around the box offices) can get every month's first Sunday (it is free) or every rainy Sunday (not very common in Barcelona). The building is a curious and harmonious mixture of antique and new structures, placed uptown and surrounded by pines. The museum engulfs a very decent restaurant, cafeteria, snack machines and ample gardens, making it an ideal place to spend a whole day, especially with children.But just in a day you will not have time to see every regular exhibit, the temporary displays you coincide with and the separate activities. For the latter you have to register and pay additional (low) fares, but better try to do it either very early (at 10 am) or try to book the late ones.Within the regular exhibit you will find a reconstruction of a section of an Amazonic forest, with many of its exotic animals and even with its regular evening storms. It is spectacular, very instructive and gives you a very close feeling of walking in the warm and humid tropical jungles. Additionally, you will find hands-on displays from the very simple (springs, gears, chains, waves) to the very complex (for instance a mist chamber to see the traces of subatomic particles).And do not forget to vist its very good library."

I go twice or three times a year because my children, my wife and I love this science museum.One of the strengths of this museum is that it offers not only objects or images of really cool stuff, but a definite view about how our universe, our planet, life, and us are. In my opinion, the main idea behind Cosmocaixa's exhibitions is the multifarious richness of the forms that matter can take. It could easiliy be thought of as the adventure of matter (and energy): inanimate, living, and intelligent matter. The stable part of the exhibition includes a wall that shows different geological strata. A particularly enticing part of the exhibition is a super cool reconstruction of a piece of the Amazonian forest with some typical Amazonian beasts (e.g., capibaras and caimans), birds (e.g., jacanas and sun birds), snakes (e.g., anacondas) and, yes, fish (including piranhas and one of the largest fresh water fish in the world, the arapaima). Besides, there is a space devoted to human evolution (intelligent matter), with reconstructions of Austrolopithecus afarensis, among others. Moreover, there are interactive portions of the exhibition that kids will love, like those showing the Coriolis and the giroscope effects. There are workshops for children too, but you usually have to register beforehand in order to find a place. In sum, an excelent place to visit while in Barcelona."

There were a few strange exhibits in Spanish and then we walked down long ramps where everything seemed closed, just a few interesting fossils on the way - they we found the ground floor and it was AMAZING. All the experiments kept us busy for hours and the amazon forest was cool too. Overall it was a mixture of natural history and modern science, with loads of interactive things.

The admission was 2 euro! - a fantastic price for such an amazing museum. Most notable points:1) The museum was a visual delight, with exhibits that were artfully displayed and engaging for all ages. It was almost like visiting an art museum. We loved the tree! There was so much to do and we couldn't finish everything! We spent more than 5 hours at the museum and probably saw only half. We were too late to sign up for some of the special activites/labs -- when we got there they were already all filled up. The only complaint I would have was that these specific kid activities/lab were conducted only in Spanish but I can understand they couldn't accomodate all languages.2) The science exhibits were great. They tried to demonstrate scientific therory and principles in a a very basic manner. Our kids loved to try out all the exhibits - even though they may not have understood the scientific principles, they took delight seeing what each of the interactive displays did. There is something here for everyone.3) Amazon displayThis was a visually stunning display of habitat (with fish, brds and other animals). The aquarium with the fish alone will leave you in awe of what they've done. This was my daughter's favourite part -- one of the birds kept on gently pecking on her pinky toe -- which she found utterly delightful). You can watch the movie on how they built the aquarium and the labour,details etc., what went into putting the display together. The birds roamed freely and our kids loved that they were walking around them with no fear. 4) Cafeteria and cafeWe only went to the cafe for quick sandwiches and salds. The food was pretty reasonably priced and wholesome. (We were at the aquarium and the food wasn't as good.We would definitely go to the CosmoCaixa again!!! and again...."

A great value, especially for its low admission price. I'm definitely returning to CosmoCaixa in my next visit to Barcelona."

What a place, not a lot I can add to whats previously been said -cheap,well laid out,great displays in Spanish,Catalan and English.The rain forest display was the best bit for me.The only downside for us was that our kids were not as excited by the science as the adults but having said that there were loads of interactive things for them to do which kept them well occupied for hours.The facilities are all first class even down to the cafe which has a great value buffet lunch if you feel like it.Its a bit out of the way so it was a taxi job for us,there is no taxi rank outside for the return trip but the staff at the information desk were really helpful and sorted it out.If we go back to Barcelona we will be heading here although hopefully with older more science focused kids!!!!!"

Went there by mistake, not knowing what exactly we'll find... and we were AMAZED!Set in a cosmopolitan neighbourhood (close to the Tibidabo hill), CosmoCaixa has a very special architecture - it's actually built downhill, with the base level on the highest point, and the other floors downwards.Do not - i repeat - DO NOT! miss seeing this excellent museum. From the physics room (where every physics law has its own space and practical example), to the huge tree, sectioned so you can see how it grows over time (in the middle of the stairway), dinosaur skeletons, planetarium, (insert 1000 more things to see), right to the full-scale piece of tropical forest.The tropical forest is the most interesting place I've ever visited, everything is recreated like in the real one, with around 90% humidity in the air and walkable ledges, fishes and birds.Admission is very cheap, arount 2 or 3 EUR, with an extra 1 EUR fee if you want to see a planetarium show.Thumbs up for whoever had the idea of building such an amazing place. We'll be back here soon!"

So we jumped into the CosmoCaixa and boy was it worth it! Unfortunately we arrived too late for the planetarium, and had only two hours to spend there, but we could've easily stayed there the whole day. Lots and lots of scientific demonstrations in wave physics, optics, gravity, water, air flow; as well as biological and archeological exhibits. Everything is user-controlled and very interactive, with detailed yet understandable explanations. Very fairly priced (I think 2-3EUR) and well worth the time. Consider combining this activity with your trip to Tibidabo, you can reach it by the same bus."

We only went because we got in free with the Barcelona Card (well worth investing for free travel on Metro, Bus, Train & Trams), but I'm so glad we did.We could have spent all day here looking at the exhibits, but our highlights were the optical perceptions/illusions area and the Amazonian Rainforest. For a family with kids, this would be a fantastic day out, but even for adults it was fascinating! I would strongly recommend a visit just for the Rainforest!"
