We had a bit of an adventure arriving in Bali, but Padmi our travel co-ordinator and Made our guide and driver were completely in sync with juggling and rescheduling. We had our own itinerary and Made was an interesting local travel companion who gave us added information on local beliefs, legends and some interesting customs throughout our stay. Completely professional and quick in communication, we had a hassle free time in Bali. Go for them if you want a smooth travel experience within Bali."

            "review": "Batuan Temple, Tegenungan Waterfall, Tegalalang Rice Fields. Every day was a wonderful and adventurous day in Bali. Every tour had been amazing, especially Bali Sun Tours, which we booked through Viator. Our tour consisted of Batuan Temple, Tegenungan Waterfall, and Tegalalang Rice Fields. Our tour took the whole day. And we wished it wasn't over, because there's just so much to see and do. There were five girls in my group. We went to Bali for my friend's 40th birthday celebration. Imagine this...you got five girls, who think they're models....in other words, we're crazy about having pictures taken of ourselves. No one wants to be the photographer. And we love dance music. Last but not least, we love to shop. Our tour guide was a young man named Gus Dudik. He came to pick us up in Legian. He arrived on time, but us being girls always running late. I believe it was an hour drive to all the sites we wanted to see. And Gus was perfect for our group. He had all the music we liked to listen to, while other drivers had no music. It makes our day and drive more fun. Gus was our wonderful photographer. He was so patient with us American girls. Each of us were grabbing him, and pulling him aside to take pictures, because he just knew how to get a good picture. Some tour guide or driver would just stay in the van after they get you to the destination, but Gus would come along with us. He was like a friend to us already. We felt so comfortable with Gus that we wanted him to eat with us when he took us to the restaurant at one of our stop for food. We even treated him and gave him tips. He deserved it, because it takes a lot of patience to deal with us girls. I highly recommend Gus as your tour guide. We had so much fun at the temple, the waterfall, and the rice fields. He gives you great advice on where to eat and when to shop for souvenirs. I hope you will enjoy your trip just as we did. Thank you Bali Sun Tours for the fun and adventures!"

Note: M, 20 and duo travelling with friend.I booked this with my friend a day before, 8:30am start and the driver and tour guide (Gusti) was an amazing host with great English and was extremely helpful and fun the whole trip. We started the drive to Ubud, the art district of Bali where we saw (and bought) souvenirs but also how cloth is made for so many products and how amazing it may look (Cheers to Gusti for letting us wonder and browse for over an hour!). After that we went to the jewellery and painting. Even by the side of the road were so many amazing sculptures. The second part was the Temple was just a sight to see and Gusti had amazing local knowledge about it. Then the waterfall which was awesome. 165 steps down and 165 steps back up made for good exercise. The way down was fun and the waterfalls water was cooling. Finally the rice field was the depiction of the tour: Green. It was amazing to see and the food that came with it was strangely delicious.Overall: When visiting again with friends and/or family, I'll be sure to book these guys (and hopefully Gusti cause he's an awesome mate) to tour with!"

            "review": "Good experience, great driver, easy processing. We booked the quad bike ride Ubud tour. First our driver named Juli took us from the hotel to the monkey forrest. Already on the drive there Juli proved to be a great guide and answered all our questions, also telling us about his family and how they live balinese culture. We learned a lot about the culture and daily life in Bali. THANK YOU JULI!The monkey forrest was great and we enjoyed feeding bananas to the monkeys. Definately a place to enjoy for young and old \"kids\".As we asked to be driven to the Ubud arts villages Juni took us to see paintings, silver wood and batic crafts centers. Ok, if you like to buy stuff you might be right here,...The quad bike ride got the adrenaline pumping! If you want a scenic ride: Forget It! In this ride you go off road where the water filled track is often only as wide as the ATV itself. Going up and down the surprisingly hilly path is fun but sometimes even a little scary. Lots of fun and you definitely get wet and dirty (or was there only this much water because it rained the same day?)Then some more talking in the car and we were back at the hotel about 9 hours later."

Both were very friendly and helpful. The stops were good value for money and the companies doing the adventure tours were professional. I recommend you have some quad biking experience before taking on Bali tracks though. Food provided was good and tasty (we did not expect 5 star cuisine). We saw plenty of temples and the company was also very flexible on changing some of the stops on the day. Tanah Lot and the Holy water temples were some of the best temples to view.All and all a very good experience. This was our first experience of Bali. Bali Sun Tours also accommodated us the night before making bookings at 10pm the previous day for quad biking and river rafting.Quotes matched the prices."

Went on a day trip to a waterfall and the rice terrace whilst stopping at various cultural destination on the way including temples and coffee farms. We had Made as our tour guide and he couldn't have done a better job. He spoke excellent English and done everything to make sure we enjoyed our day allowing us to stay as long as we wanted in each place and where we went, as well as providing us with loads of information about the areas and culture. The rice terrace and waterfall were beautiful. We ended up using Made throughout our whole stay in Bali for various transfers and booking our boats to gili islands. He really done everything to make sure we were happy and comfortable (stop at shops for drinks, answer any questions etc). Great tour company with excellent tour guides. Thanks Made for making our time in beautiful Bali so great \u2600\ufe0f"

It seems tubing means a small two person raft with guides in their own raft. It was great albeit challenging. Definitely not tame with all in our group being dunked a few times and all coming out with bumps, bruises and scrapes. The guides were fantastic and very concerned for our well being. They guided us the best they could but sometimes we were at the mercy of the river. It was great."

The sites were beautiful, but the best part of the tour was getting to know Aldo. He was so welcoming and funny. He didn't just drive us around, he actually went to the sites with us and genuinely wanted to get to know us. By the end of the tour, it felt like friends visiting all the sites. Great value for everything you get to see, the highlights were Ulun Danu, Jatiluwih Rice Terrace (way better than Tegallalang) and GitGit Waterfall. It was a long drive to reach the destinations (as everywhere in Bali) but the journey was just as beautiful as the sights. Highly recommend booking a tour with Made Aldo!!!"

Made Astama was our wonderful guide for the day - from the moment we stepped off the ship and were greeted by his smile to the end of the day when he took us back to the port - he was friendly- respectful and very professional. He spoke excellent English and went out of his way to ensure we saw what we were interested in seeing (as we did not have a lot of time available to us). His driving was excellent :-) He took photos for us which we really appreciated and it was terrific to have photos of both of us in the same photo for a change. We would highly recommend Made as a fantastic tour guide and Bali Sun Tours as a reputable tour company. Made showed us a wide variety of experiences in Bali and we have decided that we will return to Bali for a holiday and explore more that the island has to offer."

We booked the one day tour to Tanah Lot through Viator and were very much looking forward to our trip as it was highly recommended through trip advisor. After doing the tour I really can't understand all the positive feedback! We got picked up by Yoga around 8 in the morning (he even was a little early).As we read in the reviews before the people said it was possible to slightly change the programme. But when we asked him to skip the art villages and instead go to Tirta Empul he looked shocked at us and said that it's not possible because it's not in the Ubud area (we later checked this and it's not true). This was OK for us so we made the tour as it was. First we got to the Tegalalong rice terrasses but unless the other guides we saw around, Yoga didn't want to come with us so we had to find the way through the terrasses by ourselves which didn't work out that good. He also nearly gave us no explanation. Next stop was a coffee plantation. Yoga just handed us over to a lady who \"explained\" us as short and fast as possible the coffee making process and sat next to us the whole time during the tasting trying to sell us there products. You nearly felt forced to buy something. We didn't buy anything and when we came back to the car Yoga directly asked us if we didn't like it because we didn't buy...The stops in the \"art villages\" which are only shops were all similar:Yoga hands you over to someone and the give you one sentence of explanation(like you can pay with credit card or cash) and then chase you through the whole shop trying to sell something. Originally we should stop at 4 art villages. Yoga shortened the programme to 3 villages without asking us. Well we didn't say anything because the chance was high that we get no explanation and only get forced to buy something. Final stop around noon was the Tanah Lot temple. According to the time schedule described we should have reached it got sunset but Yoga already told us in the beginning that the tour is never that long. The temple itself was not very spectacular but OK and again we got no explanation at all. All in all I don't recommend this tour as they just try to make money and you barely get any information. Instead of doing this tour better get to the temple yourself (it might be cheaper) or do the Batur volcano tour organised by Dek Bud which was a highlight of our stay in Bali."

He took us where we wanted to go and also suggested places of interest. His vehicle was perfect for 4 adults, clean, comfortable and air conditioned. He even took us to his home to meet his family over a cup of coffee.If you're going to Bali and require an English speaking driver then I can't recommend Oka enough."

We booked all of our tours (with the exception of one & boy did we regret not also booking that one with Bali Sun Tours) with this company prior to leaving Australia to come to Bali and frankly, I was a little nervous. Once we arrived and our first tour kicked off on day 2 of our trip, all of my concerns evaporated. Our driver (named Made Les) took excellent care of us and explained so much to us about local customs, traffic conditions, pricing for goods and so much more. We did one other tour with another company and it was incredible re lack of quality compared to the expert service and consistent, quality service via email, phone and through our driver with Bali Sun Tours. I recommend this company to all Australians visiting Bali who want the gold standard of tours. Worth every cent (and still very cheap) as these drivers work hard to make sure your tour is above average in every aspect (and you are not ripped off). My tip is to ask for our driver named Made and always make sure that you tip your driver a decent amount (we have 100,000 Rp per tour) as the quality and good karma you receive back is bountiful. We will only use Bali Sun Tours for our trips to Bali. Highly recommended to all."

My husband, three kids (aged 13,9 & 7) loved every moment of our adventure. It was the highlight of our Bali trip!Communication with this company prior to our water rafting was fantastic.The rafting itself was fun and perfect for beginners. We felt safe at all times.There were many times that we felt like we were in a scene from Jarassic World or Indiana Jones movie. Truly amazing!Our guide was very professional and great with the kids.Lunch following the rafting was also delicious.FYI - It is a steep walk down and up from the river. Approx 400 steps each way. Hard to complain though, when we watched women carrying our 50kg raft on their heads up the 400 steps.Tip: I would highly recommend bringing money to give to the women and men carrying our rafts back for us"

The Luminous Green Tour was spent with our lovely driver Tude exploring the Ubud region including fine arts of Batik, silver smithing, painting and wood carving. We visited Teganungan Waterfall, Batuan Temple, the Ubud Rice Terraces and last but not least the Coffee and Tea plantation where we tried a large variety of tea and coffee blends including the famous Luwak coffee. Today we went on the Romantic tour accompanied by our awesome driver Made Astama. Made is a young fun guy and we liked him playing music in the car - made the long drives in between places less awkward! First stop was Nusa Dua for tandem Parasailing - very exciting, then on to the amazing Padang Padang beach for an ice cold Bintang, a swim and sunbake...beautiful spot. Then on to Uluwatu Temple, absolutely stunning views and we even saw some monkeys. We finished off the day at Jimbaran Bay to have a seafood dinner and watch the sunset over the ocean. A perfect day."

            "review": "Not sure what all the fuss is about?. I chose to book a sunrise trek on Mt Batur with Bali Sun Tours because the Groupon seemed like good value, and (unusually) we were organising a fair bit of our holiday in advance from Australia. Normally we just book things on the fly, but I was curious to see the difference it would make using a very highly rated company like Bali Sun Tours. The reviews of the company are outstanding, so from curiosity more than anything, we thought we would test it out. How much better could they be than all the other companies we knew you could use to book a sunrise trek? (This was not our first time in Bali, and when you arrive in Ubud almost every third shopfront is selling tickets on sunrise volcano treks and river rafting trips so its very easy to organise something when you get there).First of all, forget all romantic notions you have about climbing a volcano for sunrise! This is a HUGELY popular thing to do, and despite it being quite a difficult climb (vertical tracks up loose, rocky & sandy paths under torchlight in the dark) there might literally be 2000 other people doing it with you.Now this is not the fault of Bali Sun Tours, but when the full price of your tour is AUD$150 each you might expect a comprehensively guided trip - information about the geology, the environment, the volcano's history...You get absolutely nothing along these lines! As far as I can tell, Bali Sun Tours employ very nice drivers, with uniforms and modern cars with good air conditioning and heating - but we were told to be ready at our homestay for pickup between 2am - 2:15am...and at 2:45am there was still no sign of our driver. The car turned up at 2:50am (so we had been standing on the street in the dark waiting for 50 minutes) with a humble apology that we were made to wait, because he had to pick up other trekkers. Ok fine, but clearly there is a communication breakdown somewhere!Once we arrived at the starting point of the trek, we were introduced to our \"guide\" and I feel bad putting that in inverted commas, but honestly he was just an escort. Speaking very little English, he was a young, shy local guy who was more interested in hanging out with his guide mates (and I don't blame him, as a young shy kid being put in charge of random foreigners where communication is strained). The promised \"volcanic egg breakfast\" is a bit of a joke - I wasn't even sure were were going to get anything to eat because our guide didn't communicate with us what was going on once we reached the top. Eventually boiled eggs, hot bananas and white bread were delivered to us but they came out of a hut (and I'm pretty sure out of a saucepan on a gas cooker) - not out of the earth. Our guide forgot to offer us tea and coffee until sunrise was over and we were ready to leave - he was just doing his best, but I feel he could use some more guidance himself on how to be a good guide.I spotted other trekkers with much fancier breakfasts, and very engaged guides answering lots of questions - so all this made me wonder - what is all the fuss about Bali Sun Tours, when I'm pretty sure you could get exactly the same experience booking a trek through a company off the street and probably for less than we paid even with the Groupon discount?Overall I was disappointed, and would recommend lowering your expectations for the whole experience, as it is a very crowded, popular, touristy tour to do.But to finish on a positive, at the end of the day we had climbed a volcano and seen the sun rise, and eaten a hot banana sandwich at the summit, which you don't do every day..."

Highly recommend to anyone travelling to use this company for transport or booking agent.Surya will meet you at your hotel and help you book what you need, no pressure and with lots of information!We have used them to do tours up to tree top climbing and monkey forest... Also just to do some local sights and some shopping!Drivers are also friendly, can drive really well and informative!Vehicles big enough for large family and cool to drive around in8 hours will cost $50 au dollars but well worth it when travelling long distances as Taxis quickly add up in traffic!Always happy with service and communication over messenger makes it very easy to keep in touch Never a problem, will always and only use Bali Sun Tours when we return to Bali in future! Now for Surya to find a wife \u2764\ufe0f"

We decided to skip the tour packages offered at the airport and instead make a more informed decision by doing research on trip advisor and utilizing brochures we picked up. Bali Sun Tours received great reviews and because there were specific places we wanted to see, we booked a driver for 10 hours in hopes of going to places we had our hearts set on. The booking process was extremely simple. I sent them an email stating what I wanted and an agent answered quickly to set up the payment and instructions on where and when the driver would meet us. The next day Putu came to pick us up in the lobby of our hotel at The Mulia. He was excited and enthusiastic about the day ahead. We told him all the places we wanted to see and he also included suggestions of other destinations we might enjoy. Putu was full of knowledge because we had a million questions we wanted to know about Bali, the people, the culture, and the language. We got to see the monkeys in Ubud, rice terraces, and Gunung Kawi temple. At all of these places Putu knew the perfect spots to get the best pictures from. The next stop was a suggestion from Putu to Manik Abian Bali Agriculture. We weren't too enthusiastic about coffee and tea tasting but thought we would give it a try. We are so glad we did! We got to try cinnamon right off the trees, coffee bean plants, cacao, everything was just sensory overload. Then when we arrived at the area where we would have our tea and coffee tasting, we are amazed by the spectacular view. It was set high above what looked like a jungle, so peaceful and serene. We would have missed this experience if it weren't for Putu. Honestly, anything we were interested in, whether it was a specific type of cuisine or massage place, Putu had a suggestion. He took us to this delicious Thai place where the locals eat and a beautiful spa where we had a Balinese massage. We even told him we wanted to go and get fried bananas from a street vendor. He took us to a place and got out and ensured it was freshly made and ordered for us. The best part is that during our drive to each destination Putu taught us so many phrases that we could use during our stay. We learned \"how are you\", \"good morning\", \"thank you\" and so much more!!! I cannot express how thankful and blessed we are to have had such an amazing experience in Bali, and it was all because of Putu. We are already planning a trip back because there is still so much to see and the hospitality is probably the best we have ever experienced in the world. Thank you Bali Sun Tours and especially Putu, for making our adventures around Bali unforgettably wonderful. See you next year!"

Each time we have had different experience but we found the sparkling tour today was very special and meaningful visiting the less popular and crowded areas. We visited temple, walked on beautiful beaches, watched families harvesting rice, watched salt making process, visited oldest village in Bali, stood in the river under waterfall, ate in a very special restaurant etc. very special day. Thankyou Nyoman Widana xoxo"

Took us out to the beach and then onto the boat. During this time I started to panic a bit! The guys on the pontoon were amazing. One of the divers took to the side and calmed me down, and reassured me. So glad he did because it was amazing down there. I thoroughly recommend it. We paid for a camera (cost around $30) and so glad we did, the photos were awesome. Such an amazing experience. And I wouldn't have gone down if the divers weren't so reassuring and professional."

We were given his information from our friends who visit Bali often and do day trips with Nyoman. We have just finished our Third trip with him today and it was amazing just like the other days. The first trip we did was the Ubud tour where we visited a few sights such as a cool waterfall, rice fields, monkey forrest and a coffee plantation. Since we enjoyed this so much we then proceeded to book the volcano trek with Nyoman, once again this was a great experience and our volcano guide (Made)was great... He seemed to be the most fun guide we came across during the trek! Today we visited the temple on the lake, the twin lakes, another monkey forrest and tanah lot... Again it was a fun day. These trips have allowed us to visit the 'real bali' away from all the commercial beach resorts... Id highly recommend giving these trips a go. We've also had great help from Nyoman in sorting some logistics out for us such as our ferry and transfers to Gilli T and also our airport transfers! Keep up the good work Dr Bali!!"

After seeing excellent reviews about Bali Sun Tours we chose them to assist us in seeing all that Bali has to offer.In those 7 days we did about 7 planned tours Bali Sun Tours has to offer (below) plus we were also able to customise our own itinerary using the private driver services and we had the same driver- Made for the whole trip including Airport Transfers.Our Private driver Made, he was an excellent host, always made us fee comfortable and was very patient with us even when we wanted to stop for food/ bathroom etc His English was excellent, and was always able to answer questions we had about Balinese culture and traditions. He also helped us communicating with locals and making sure we weren't paying too much when bartering. The car we traveled was very comfortable and clean with air conditioning and a cooler/esky in the back where we could put our drinks to have ice cold. Using Bali Sun Tours took the stress away from us for airport and hotel transfers. It made our holiday more enjoyable not having to worry about how to get around. We made great friends with Made and we recommend Bali Sun Tours to our friends wanting to visit Bali. These are the services we used from Bali Sun Tours. Safe to say our review is credible with the amount of tours we did with them;-Eat Pray Tour-Bright Bali Tour-Elephant Ride Tour-Bali 3 Island Cruise-Sunset Dinner Cruise-Sunset Dinner -Fast Boat to Gili Islands. Thank you to Agung & Made once again for making our Bali experience wonderful."

If we wanted to leave, we left, wanted to sit under a tree, he sat with us and waited. Fantastic. He also took us to the most amazing little 'local knowledge' hole in the wall Warung, where we were served delicious pork, rice and vegetables, which cost around $4.00AUD per plate - You can't beat that. Highly recommend booking Oka for your next day tour! I sure as hell will be when I return to bali."

The day was great, made drove us to the destinations and gave a great insight into each one before letting us head off and explore by ourselves.

Rafting was great, safe well organised and absolutely beautiful to travel down the ayung river experiencing the rapids.On our way to Seminyak, Made was explaining the other parts of the Island that we hadn't seen. We were really interested in seeing Nusa Dua and Uluwatu, we arranged to meet Made again for a tour of this area which was great, we did watersports, went to padang padang beach which was beautiful then to Uluwatu temple where Made shown us around and taught us about the hindu religion, we saw the beautiful cliff top views before we watched the Kecack fire dance.

As well as this, I found Bali Sun Tours very easy to communicate with via email whilst I was still in Australia. I booked a couple of months in advance on a Groupon, and Padmi was so quick and helpful that I decided to book a few more tours with them.

He has so much knowledge about Bali - it's incredible! Gusti was helpful at all the spots we went to, he took some amazing photos for us! Bali Sun Tours was so easy to make our arrangements. Gusti arrived promptly at our hotel and immediately made us feel comfortable and safe. Gusti's company was definitely a big part of our trip, it would not have been the same without him! Again, I would like to say a massive thank you to Gusti & the team at Bali Sun Tours. Can't wait to see you next time i'm in Bali :)"

I was somewhat sceptical of what we would get given the price we paid, however we were pleasantly surprised. We were picked up from our hotel at 08:30 by Jule our guide/driver for the day. The day was fantastic with Jule's company being the highlight of our tour. He was on time for our pick up, professional, knowledgeable, skilful at navigating the terrible Bali traffic, funny and accommodating to all our needs.We were firstly taken the the Tegallalang Rice Terrace, followed by a tasting of Luwak coffee, then on to The Sacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary in Ubud, with some art shops (painting/wood carving/jewellery & batik) to end the day. Whilst the shopping at the end was not my favourite element, it was still interesting and all parties were kind and respectful with us just looking and not buying.Our day finished at about 1700 dropped back at our hotel. We both really enjoyed the tour and the company of Jule throughout the day. I would definitely book another tour with Bali Sun Tours on our next trip to Bali."

This was an extremely disappointing, not to mention the lack of safety, firstly no life jackets on boat to get you to main station, then no one to help you get on boat and one man slipped getting in boat and injured himself and could not do the ocean walk. Then once on main station, our boat driver crashed into the boat, no one could speak English and the instructions were not explained. However once in water the guys were very good. On the way back the boat had engine troubles and when back to shore, we were advised the reason for problems on boat was because it was his first day. The only saving grace for us was one of the girls on the tour could speak the local language and thus translated everything on our behalf. Very, very, disappointing trip and unsafe!!!!!!!"

We had a great day and our driver Lila was a really fun guy, who told us lots about the area, and his own life and experiences living in Bali. He also changed our tour around slightly to fit our requests and skip places we were less interested in seeing.The rice fields at Tegalalang were amazing, lush and green at the time we visited, and well worth stopping and the photo opp. We also really enjoyed seeing the artwork in the art villages and while closely accompanied through each shop, we didn't feel pressured to buy something and could spend time appreciating the different styles of art and skills that went into each piece. To be honest, we would be unlikely do this as part of a tour again though, and would research our own shops etc if we were interested in purchasing something and visit them separately. The paintings and wood carvings were really impressive and we were able to ask lots of questions; however, the silver/gold and batik may mostly be of interest to you if you are looking to make a purchase as they are really just large stores (less emphasis on how the pieces are made) but they do have some beautiful fabrics/ jewellery.  The Tegenungan waterfall was also very nice to visit. Quite busy compared to those in the Northern waterfalls we saw but we like waterfalls so enjoyed it. Didn't swim as was really rocky, and to be honest the water looked an unappealing colour but that didn't bother most people there. Also, it seemed pretty well maintained and kept free largely of rubbish which is always good to see in Bali :)Overall, a fun day, glad we booked through Bali Sun Tours, might have been a little more expensive than some day driver rates we had elsewhere but for us it was really worth it to get a driver who was very friendly, local, with great english and knowledge of the areas, and a nice comfortable/clean car for the day!"

At the temple we also watched the Kecak Fire Dance this started at 6pm and finished around 7pm, get there early to get a good front seat as it gets very busy.After the fire dance we were driven back to Jimbaran Bay where we went to a seafood restaurant for a nice seafood dinner, you select the seafood you want fresh from the tanks and get it cooked how you like & enjoy eating while watching the waves roll in.A great tour & highly recommend it, our guide Yoga was great, spoke very good English & provided great information about everything."

Had 2 young drivers on the 17/5/16 (can't remember names) but they were extremely friendly, well spoken and cheerful lads. Offered local advice for places to eat and drink and an insight into the Balinese lifestyle and culture. We did a tour to Ubud monkey forest, art markets, coffee tour (Kopi lewak) and rice fields. They also accommodated an extra stop for us to go and get a massage and lunch from a spa in the area. Unfortunately we didn't get to see the rice fields as it was 330pm by the time we finished our massage. The drivers were still happy to take us for no extra fee even though we'd gone well-over our \"half day\" tour. The monkey tour is a must and great fun for the whole family. You can buy bananas in the forest and have monkeys sit on your head for photos. Just ask one of the monkey forest staff. Art tour isn't my cup of tea and can probably be skipped for something else. Kopi lewak coffee making tour is great!! You walk through a local farm and the coffee making process from plant to cup is explained. You get a free sample of about 15 different kinds of teas made locally, some delicious, some not. Coffee is Rp$50000 per cup but well worth every penny."

Basically we planned our itinerary based on what was recommended in TripAdvisor, and we just handed over to Wayun to drive us to the places we want to visit for 3 of the days. Wayun is a really friendly and professional driver. Not only was he always on time to pick us up everyday, he was also very familiar with his directions. Wayun even took the initiative to change into a bigger car on our third day knowing that some of us have quite a bit of things to carry and thus might possibly compromise our leg space. We were really appreciative of the many small gestures he had done for us, and it was undoubtedly that the service he provided was excellent.Over the 3 days, we visited Tanah Lot Temple, Pasar Seni Ubud, Tegallalang Rice Terraces, Mount Batur, Tegenungan Waterfall, Rock Bar, Potato Head Beach Club, Jimbaran Beach and did river rafting on the Ayung River. We also had meals over at Bebek Joni, Naughty Nuri's and Habitual Quench & Feed. It was a pity that we could not visit the Uluwatu Temple on our last day due to the poor traffic conditions and we had a flight to catch, but Wayun was quick to suggest other places whenever we needed alternatives. Traffic in Bali can be pretty bad at times, but Wayun was always patient and positive, which made us feel very comfortable being around him.Definitely would recommend the places that we visited, but even more so for our driver Wayun. Visiting the places aforementioned would only be possible if there is a driver to take you around for the day, and of course having an excellent service provided by Wayun certainly enhanced the overall travelling experience in Bali.Do look for Wayun if you plan on visiting Bali and need a driver! PM me if you need his contact."

Be sure to bargain for a cheaper price especially if buying two tours. White water rafting facilities were Pretty basic and run down faculties by the river. But the boat instructor was brilliant! It was a nice small group just the 4 of us, unlike other tours which seemed to have about 30 people in many boats. It was a 2hour drive from legian, and the drive was uncomfortable and tiring. The lunch at the end of the river was traditional Indonesian food. The Mt Batur Volcano tour was VERY EARLY 2am pickup, arrived at the bottom at about 4am. There were only the two of us in our group and the instructor. He was very helpful and held my hand in the difficult areas of the climb and decent so I didn't fall. If you're fit, this climb will be fine. There were a few hundred people climbing at the same time, sometimes other groups were slow and the path was too narrow to overtake. The brochure says wear long pants, we wore shorts and got pretty hot & sweaty. But At 5:15 when we got to our spot for the sunrise, we got quite cold. I recommend shorts but pack a small blanket or jumper! Also bring a spare shirt! Our bus driver Dedik was awesome. After the volcano we went to Lewak Coffee which was awesome! Loved it! Then Dedik took us to the rice fields and To the Bebek restaurant in Ubud. Since there was only two of us (my husband and I) in the bus, it was like having a personal tour. Thank you Bali sun tours!"

He even rang the owner of our villa to make sure of the directions so he knew exactly where to go. Every time Nyoman came to collect us for a lift or for a tour he was on time and always full of energy ready to help us learn about Bali's customs and traditions. We learnt so much from him and he helped us to fall in love with Bali!

On the day, the first pick-up was over one hour late, one of the parties stayed at Vlad Bali Villa which was located in a complex that was out of sight (no signage, directions etc) so this was partly our fault. Communication during pick-up however, lacked efficiency and the fact we speak indo didn't help, quite frustrating. When we did get picked-up, the driver was extremely apologetic and was kind & courteous. The ATV was a little disappointing, the vehicles were old and poorly maintained, the facilities were quite poor (broken lockers and mediocre lunch) the guide's ATV broke down so he had to ride with me, and one of ours kept stalling, but it was quite fun. The whitewater rafting was AWESOME, the company used by Bali Sun Tours had a great facility, the staff was very friendly and the rafting was heaps of fun, absolutely loved it. Bali Sun Tour, please change the ATV company."

We bought a Groupon voucher for a tubing adventure and it was the best thing we ever did!We went in separate doughnut boats and had to got through a few tough rafts in the river (be aware if you go single it is a little bit tough and you need a lot of upper body strength! Not for the faint hearted) the rainforest was AMAZING and we ended the tour with coffee tasting (vanilla and chocolate were my favourites!!)We loved the rafting so much we did an ATV ride (also in Ubud) the terrain was muddy and gritty but it's exactly what we wanted! We had Dodik for our driver and he was so friendly and young and up for a chat! We laughed the whole ride there and back and he would tell us what we were passing and answer all of our questions. So informative and fun!The next day we wanted to go to Uluwatu Temple, and we requested Dodik again but he was not available so we got his Uncle, Komang Suant. He was Brilliant! Had cold water and towels every time we came back to the car after being in the sun. He explained everything and had amazing stories to tell us! Great English and could understand us as well (most of the time) it was our best day yet! We thanked him by taking him to a restaurant of his choice and he didn't disappoint!Sun tours is definitely a great company to go with for all your Bali activities!!"

Then we were off around Ubud chatting the whole time. Did the Atv ride and then back for a yummy lunch. After lunch Made Aldo took us back to our hotel again chatting the whole way back. Felt so comfortable with him and he was a great driver (considering the mayhem of bali streets/traffic). Today we were suppose to go water rafting but my husband woke up sick as a dog called bali sun tours to reschedule and there was no problem at all! That is great service! So glad we chose bali sun tours - highly recommend them!!! Can't wait to go water rafting with them in a few days. \u263a"

He picked us up exactly at the designated pick up time and not a moment later, which was great as we are used to other tour companies picking us up late. The tour included seeing woodcalving, silver jewellery making, going to a coffee plantation, walking through rice terraces in Ubud, experiencing 2 temples and the lunch spot Oka chose for us was great. Before we booked this tour, back home in AUS I emailed Bali Sun Tours and spoke with Padmi for extra information and i am very happy with the fast and helpful replies I got.Overall I am very happy with Bali Sun Tours as their staff provide excellent service for good value."

We asked to change the date of one of our bookings and it was so easy to do with them. Unbeknown to us we had booked a day trip to Ubud on the day of a big ceremony that was a few days prior to Nyepi Day & roads were to be closed. This would cause chaos for us and our driver so they again re-arranged my bookings to fit in with this. When we finally got our day trip our driver Putu was just awesome! Polite, funny and always happy to fit in with us and our requests. Putu lives in a small village near Ubud so he knew all the back roads to avoid tourist traffic. He even took us down through his village. I would highly recommend Bali Sun to anybody. We've already booked one tour with them for our October visit and will most certainly be booking another (when the voucher dates are extended on Groupon) Putu was an absolute pleasure to have as our guide and we will specifically ask for him again. Thanks Bali Sun & thanks PutuAndrea & Steve"

After purchasing a Groupon deal $90 (which was a bit cheaper then the online price) for two for white water rafting i emailed BST for a booking and padmi responded immediately! So efficient in answering all my queries and confirming all the details. We were located in nusa dua so our pickup time was at 8.30 am and we arrived at anout 9.45- So just over an hour. Our driver was de wa who was quite friendly. English is obviously not the first language but we were able to communicate w him just fine. And we were the only couple so it was a great! If only the aircon worked better.. Better then nothing i guess? A step up- prob offer wAter, mint and free wifi?Got to the rafting venue and we were handed over to marty our guide. A funny and happy guide who was able to speak english quite well. Just a few years older then my husband so they got on really well - shared a few smokes and a beer too.. Met 4 other travellers and promptly got all our gear, ready to start! The walk down to the start of the rafting is about 400 steps.. Approx 10min walk.. Steps are quite steep! The rafting was amazing! We were at the front so we faced all the adventure front on! Its ok to wear thongs thats what we did and it was perfectly fine. Remember to hold onto the rope when theres rocks!! A few of the other travellers fell off the seat a few times.. Hehe.. Whole trip was over 2 hrs and it was good that they gave us a break at about halfway. Prior warming the 300 steps back up is hard! Different route - stairs are not as steep but phew.. After 2hrs of rafting, hungry, high humidity and whilst very hot - the 300steps was a challenge! Take your time.. And work those sweat!!Back to the rental venue and a lunch buffet was provided. Only let down was the meal - bland rice and noodle and curry chicken w veggies and fruits as dessert.. You have to buy your drinks as well.. No water provided.Changing room was fairly clean. Towels and shower/change room provided.So overall a great experience! Im feeling sore now.. :("

Yoga is such a pleasant tour guide, he's chilled out and flexible with the tour plan based on our preferences. :) His knowledge of the areas we drove past as well as the temples, markets and coffee/tea plantation we visited as part of the tour was fascinating, made all the more easier with his relaxed attitude and sense of humour. He also made time to stop over during the drive to show us around the beautiful scenery and took awesome photos for us.All in all we had a fun, memorable experience and certainly recommend Yoga as a tour guide for any one deciding to embark on the Eat Pray tour. :)"

Both my partner and I found it fun and exciting! All the activities met our expectations. ATVing was thrilling! Lots of energy and getting dirty in the mud too! And the volcano hike was spectacular. The hike was physical but worth it when you get to the top. Our driver Made was amazing. After taking us on our first tour we ended up using him to book more tours and just used him as our driver in Bali! He was very informative, friendly, and easy going - best driver you can get! I would highly recommend using him as your driver for he provides the best rates and can take you to the best places. He even helped out when my boyfriend got sick and had to go to the hospital!Bali sun tour was super easy to work with. Easy to book, great communication, and they always rock up on time. If you do book through them, see if you can get Made to be your driver"

We had the same tour guide to drive us to and from every activity everyday. Aldo Made was so welcoming and friendly. He went above and beyond what I ever expected from a driver. He lent my cousin his very own shoes to protect him from the water and even gave us his shirt to dry ourselves with. We all got along so well that I am very happy to call him a friend."

We were taken to Tirta Empul Temple to visit the iconic holy spring water temple but not before stopping first to take some quick happy snaps of the rice terraces near Tegalalang along the way. Oka has taken us to visit one of the coffee and spice plantations where they offered us free samples of coffee and teas. For all coffee lovers, this is the one place you will need to visit during your stay in Bali. Awesome aromatic flavours that would sure to give your taste buds a treat. Try the premium Luwak coffee or easily known as \"Cat-poo-chino\" made by the post part-digestive processing from the Asian palm civet.Towards the end of the day, Oka has drove us back to Ubud to visit Ubud Palace and the markets until finishing the day at a restaurant of his recommendations for a delicious suckling pig special. A tasty dish!We highly recommend Oka and Bali Sun Tours. We only wished that our stay in Bali was longer."

We found Bali sun tour through Groupon and wasn't expect much from them as the price was cheaper than the local agent offered. However our guide name Made made out our trip a memorable and at the end we hired him as a our private tour guide again on our last trip day. We had an awesome time on a day tour with Made to Ubud area (beautiful rice fields, ubud monkey forest, a coffee luwak plantation, Ubud art villages and a Ubud market)Actually, Ubud market tour wasn't in the program however, Made (the tour guide) generously negotiate the program and letting us to tour Ubud area. Made took us to Uluwatu temple, Kuta are shopping centre (Discovery mall) and Spa on our last day. We found that the massage price is a bit expensive than other places, we could have done a deal with the massage shop people but we didn't want to ruin our last day we paid what they offered.Car was clean and super cool. If anyone concern what to do with your luggage don't worry they will keep an eyes on your luggage. We carried all our luggage for our last day trip before going to airport, we didn't have any trouble with that.Made speaks English very well and friendly. Very polite, patient and knowledgeable. I will definitely recommend to all our friends.We are very satisfy of what they provided to us."

White water raftingThe ATV tour was very good, thrilling and exciting especially for first timers. You get to ride through several villages, on the open road, and also through rice terraces. Make sure to apply insect repellent though!The Let's Get Wet tour included parasailing, rolling donut, banana boat and jet ski - great fun for people who want a taste of what each of these are, you only get one round of each activity so it doesn't actually last very long but great fun. If you do this, remember to add on the Seawalker (albeit expensive) which takes you about 5-6m underwater under a helmet without the hassle of dive equipment. You can feed the fish and touch coral and it was truly amazing.White water rafting is at Ayung river, and it is quite an easy, breezy cruise down the river. There are rapids, but not the kinds you see in movies of course. So for all those afraid of falling into the water and stuff, don't worry, this tour is amazing. For all those who want more adventure, I'd suggest looking to do an alternative rafting tour at a different river.Last but not least, the ubud chocolate making and arts tour. This was highly disappointing and a huge letdown. It took us over an hour to get to the chocolate factory, the staff did not entertain us or acknowledge our presence and even after asking twice nicely to take us around to go through the process of chocolate making, they refused to bring us around and \"pretended\" they didn't speak English, or maybe the general staff's English is really poor. The only thing we got to do upon arrival is make some chocolate which was basically piping melted chocolate into moulds and topping it with whatever ingredient you chose. They somehow managed to give my partner's bag of chocolate to someone else and didn't bother notifying us until we asked them where our chocolates were as we realised we had been sitting around for 1.5-2 hours doing nothing. They didn't apologise for their mistake, and said we could make another batch of chocolates but would have to wait an extra 30-45min. We politely declined. The rest of the tour was just driving around to the different villages to see silver jewellery, stone carvings, wood carvings and paintings. I appreciate culture but going to those places was not worth it as they don't really show you how they've come to achieve the final product but just follow you around hassling you to buy products instead. The only up-side to this tour was we got to watch the elephants play and bathe and the sun bears enjoying the sunshine and eating whilst we were at the chocolate factory. padmi (tour booking manager) is really helpful, polite and responds promptly which made booking the tours and reconfirmations a breeze.all the drivers were awesome and friendly, good drivers as well (for those of you who know traffic in bali) and always early/on time.there are heaps of other tours offered, so make sure to check out their website. i'd highly recommend this company, just maybe skip out on the arts tours."

Very friendly and jovial. The rafting was good. Not too extreme. Make sure you apply sunscreen as you're out on the river for over 2 hours.

We have used Bali Sun Tours previously and always found them to be fantastic at communicating and booking and all their drivers polite, fluent in english and friendly. Our wreck drive tour this holidays was no exception. The driver took as over the mountains through an area of Bali we hadn't seen before - breathtaking. Ketut the dive master/guide was wonderful. He looked after our 12you exceptionally well and with great humour. She will be hooked on diving for life - her initial nerves were quickly dispelled and she had a ball. I would not hesitate to recommend them to anyone. Thank you Padmi and all at Bali Sun Tour"

The driver (aldo) was on time and so friendly with in minutes we felt like old mates and he started his tour with us a few things listed didn't really interest us so we skipped a few and did different things he was happy to accommodate us we started with the agung. Dance which was amazing to see .We then headed to a coffee farm which was absolutely fantastic aldo came through the tour with us and he was very funny and informative of the area. Following that we were off to monkey forest , the whole time aldo explaining places as we passed through and spoke often about traditions and culture . Monkey forest was amazing to see , all monkeys running free be careful of the monkeys as not all are friendly don't let monkeys see water bottle or bananas keep those thing well hidden :) and you will enjoy your day as we did . We then Went to a beautiful place for lunch I can't recall the name but it was very nice and the food was lovely .. Aldo was happy to stop along the way back to our hotel as I wanted to purchase some items for my Bali hut at home he helped me negotiate price and assisted due to the language barrier in the village I was so happy with my purchase it made my day .. I am looking forward to heading back to Bali in the coming months and will definitely booking another tour through Bali sun tours I thank them very much for a wonderful experience I would highly recommend this tour group to anyone :)"

He's one of the best driver you can find in Bali, from personal point, friendly, helpful, interactive, patient, a great smile and even take picture for us. I would strongly recommend him. Although theirs a lot of rip off from tourist places in Bali, it's negotiable. Walk away or even dare to say No if you don't want to purchase or join anything. He is helpful in arranging itinerary and based on how everything can fit in with the time you have in Bali. All is well except the northCoast water sports which was a major rip off from the offered/given prices. I find it unfair based on skin colour or different nationalities. We paid 800,000rp just for 3 activities (seawalker excluded) which I feel was too much compare to the price that can be found in other websites. Overall service for it was good, but price was a big spending.Nyoman is the one who's doing Yoga with me in the shared picture."

Out of these 3 luckily 2 was with Bali Sun tours, we did the parasailing with a different company and it was a complete rip off, instead of 8 minutes each we had 2 minutes each. Everything we did with Bali Sun tours on the other hand was worth the money, pick up in the morning was always on time by the very friendly Oka or Mardi, they knew a lot about the places we went to and had so much fun on the day tour and ATV riding that on Oka's recommendation we booked white water rafting as well. In fact he booked it for us for the next day which made it very simple, we didn't need to do anything. The activities we did were among the highlights of our holiday without them it wouldn't have been the same, thank you! And if we ever go again we're definitely booking directly through Bali Sun Tours"

Although Bali Sun tour mentions on their website that they have shower and toilet facilities but these facilities are not in proper working condition. Toilets were stinky and were not suitable for use. Even the shower rooms were nowhere close to being called a shower room. All their trainers need to be polite. I wont book it next time.Next day, I was again picked up from my hotel with my wife by Bali Sun tour Driver \"Made Les\" for White Water Rafting. This time experience was completely different as the driver was very friendly and informative. For Water Rafting, we had \"Bo Bo\" as our trainer and he was amazing person and really funny. I would highly recommend rafting and ask for \"Bo Bo\" as your trainer and trust me you wont be disappointed. Toilets and shower rooms were in really good condition in comparison to water sport facilities and also they will provide you clean towels. Will definitely do it again with \"Bo Bo\".Next day, we were again picked up by our driver \"Made Les\" for \"Bright Bali Tour\" and that too turned out to be amazing experience because of our driver."

Gusti picked us up right on time from our hotel. His vehicle was spotless and we were happy to have him to navigate those hectic Bali roads! Gusti was very knowledgable about the sights we saw (including: Tanah Lot, rice fields, the Luwak Coffee Plantation, and the Batik factory). He was eager to answer all of our questions about the Balinese culture and the Hindu religion. He was also interested to learn about our lives and what our culture was like. We all quickly became friends. We really enjoyed our time with Gusti and decided to book more tours with him. On our second tour we went to Mount Batur for a sunrise climb. Unfortunately, I became very ill after 1km of hiking. I could no longer continue the hike and turned around. I found Gusti in his car with his girlfriend. I felt bad for interrupting their time together but they treated me like family! They allowed me to sit in the car with them and even gave me some local medicine to make me feel better. They were excellent company. Even though I was sick, spending time with them and getting to know them will always be one of my favorite memories of Bali. On our third tour with Gusti, he took us to WaterBom Bali. Gusti was nice enough to score us discounted tickets and even stood in line with us before we went in. As always, he was there right on time to pick us up and even went out of his way to make sure we had enough water for the rest of the night. On our final day with Gusti, he drove us around Kuta to a few more places we wanted to see and he also drove us all to the airport. We were so lucky to have met Gusti. He made our time in Bali much more special and I am happy to now call him my friend. Book this company for a tour! You will not regret it."

He picked us up in Ubud, where we were staying at the time, and we spent the day visiting the rice terraces, the Luwak coffee plantation, the handmade silver, paintings and Batik factory stores and then Tanah Lot Temple. Gusti walked with me while we were on the coast at Tanah Lot and answered my many questions about the Hindu religion, culture and customs. He was so nice and was curious about our culture too :) Later when we asked for a good food recommendation, he took us to a beautiful restaurant on rice terraces with floating huts and a wonderful atmosphere. He patiently waited outside as we ate our late lunch, even though we invited him to join us! We loved Gusti's company so much, we asked him via Facebook to also take us to take us to Mount Batur volcano, for a sunrise climb towards the end of our stay in Ubud. When the day came, he was promptly ready to pick us up at our early 2am start time. Despite the long drive through the winding, dark roads up to Mount Batur, Gusti was very skilled in his driving and I didn't feel nervous at all, which helped me get a little sleep on the way there ;)When we arrived, he set us up with a local climbing guide, Nyoman (who was so incredible!) and planned to sleep in the car while we climbed. Unfortunately one of our friends got very sick early on in the climbing and had to turn back, but Gusti and his girlfriend were gracious enough to make room for her to rest as well and even gave her a little medicine to help her. We were so so grateful for that! When we left Ubud, we were sad to say goodbye, but later on in our trip, while we were in Canggu, we decided to ask Gusti for transportation again :) On a different day, he picked us up at our hotel in Canggu and took us to Waterbom Bali and even got us discounted tickets! Afterwards, he was ready waiting for us early as usual (he's always a few minutes early which is comforting in a foreign country), but when we had issues with the ATM, he patiently waited for us and then drove us to pick up a quick lunch. On our last day, we had Gusti pick us up again in Canggu, with our 4 big suitcases and 4 smaller bags in his vehicle and he drove us to Kuta to spend our last afternoon. He dropped us off at the Hard Rock Cafe, and we were able to explore the beach and area and release van sea turtles while he kept our luggage in his car for the day! He picked us up in the later in the evening and finally drove us to the airport. We were all sad to say goodbye to our favorite personal guide and driver!! He is so sweet and helpful and you would definitely be happy to book Gusti and this company while enjoying your trip in Bali!! Thank you Gusti!!! <3"

            "review": "Amazing Afternoon, Average Morning.. The second part of this day tour was much more exciting and fun than the first part.Firstly, the driver was great. Very respectful of our privacy and was informative and educational when the time called for it. He picked us up from our hotel very promptly and was very happy, smiley and friendly throughout the whole day. I can\u2019t fault the service, both over email and once we were with our guide. There was no pressure of time and the amount of time spent at each attraction was very much up to us - which was great.The downsides:Before we set off we were given an itinerary which consisted of what you'll see on the website: Art Villages, Luwak Plantation, Rice Fields, Monkey Forest - Great! We were also told that, if there was time, we could go to see a traditional Balinese dance later in the day, which would be great if we were still interested in that after everything else.We set off and were immediately taken to see the dance/play/performance without being asked if we did actually went to see it. It was quite frustrating, but we rolled with it considering we were already there. However this came with an additional 100,000 Rupiah cost of entry, which we didn't sign up for or agree to! It was too late by that point and we sat through the hour-long performance which was ok. We came out with a decent-enough decorative plate/bowl with our picture on it.We then set off to go to the Art Village. The name is quite deceptive, as you imagine traditional markets/villages selling hand-crafted wares. What we weren't told is that they were two separate shops more than anything - far from a village - although they were hand-crafted.The first was a material/art shop, selling clothes, wicker decorations and some really beautiful paintings. The second was the silver shop which had some lovely pieces of jewellery and more paintings. The two were about a 20-30 min drive apart, so it took up a good couple of hours from the day.We were then asked if we wanted to go to a wood-carving shop, but we decided against that because we thought it would be more of the same. Very basic and brief \u201cdemonstrations\u201d of how items were made and straight into sales-heavy walk-arounds where shop assistants were pressing you to buy their stuff - despite much of it not being allowed into Australia. It seemed as though the drivers/companies were on some sort of commission for taking people there or people buying from there.It was around 5 hours after we left the hotel that we could get into the real good stuff and see the real sights of Ubud without feeling pressured into buying add-ons.The positives:Next up was the Luwak plantation. This was similar to the Art shops in which we were given a demonstration before taken into a shop and expected to buy, however it was a much more friendly and hands-on experience with lots of free add-ons. I\u2019ll write a separate review on that particular plantation on TripAdvisor if you wish to go to my profile and view it. There were no purchasing obligations with the Teba Sari plantation.The rice terrace was an amazing spectacle. Again, we had to pay - this time for parking rather than entry, which seemed strange as we could have just parked on the roadside for free. We were also blocked from going any further on the trail by a woman who demanded a \u201cdonation\u201d and a man who simply repeated \u201cmoney\u201d whilst I was taking photos. The views were breathtaking however, and it was a very nice walk that wasn\u2019t too taxing or exerting. Again, I\u2019ll do a separate review on the Tebalalang Rice Terrace.The pinnacle of the day was going to the Monkey Forest (again, separate review) and it was what we had been looking forward most to throughout the day. There was, again, an entry fee and you could pay for bananas to entice the monkeys to come and jump on you. We didn\u2019t pay, we just found a member of staff and asked him to help us, and he had nuts/berries of some sort to encourage the monkeys. We got some fantastic photos and had a great time.Dinner that evening was at a restaurant in Ubud. The name escapes me and I can\u2019t find any evidence of it online. It had an amazing view out the back, with lush paddies and a giant colourful statue of what I presume to be a God. The food was good - I had a Chinese-style beef dish. The smoke being blown over to our table by the two women from London on the table next to us wasn\u2019t particularly nice while we were eating (we later found out they were also staying at our hotel, so they got the best of our scathing stares). The staff were great and friendly and priced very reasonably.Overall:if you can, try and plan out your day before heading off, and make sure you only go to where you want, otherwise you\u2019ll find yourself paying more on entry fees, tips and other costs than the cost of the actual tour itself.The guide was great, unfortunately didn\u2019t catch his name, but he deserved the pretty large tip we gave him. From my perspective, try to miss out on the morning\u2019s dance/shopping if you don\u2019t want to pay on top of what you have to and get to do the better experiences sooner!"

We were very lucky to have Putu as our driver, he was absolutely amazing and did a wonderful job. He catered to our needs and even took us to see a Barong dance even though this was not part of the original itinerary. He met us at our hotel sharp at 8:30am to ensure we beat the traffic and were able to get the most of out of our day. We were meant to return around 4pm, however he was kind enough to allow us to stay longer at places we wanted to spend more time which was greatly appreciated.We really appreciated Putu's local knowledge and the information he provided us about the places we visited and local customs - the complimentary iced bottled water he provided was definitely much appreciated in the heat.Although entrance fees weren't included in the tour, they were not expensive and we really enjoyed being able to be at each place as long as we liked, without having a time limit.Putu is definitely the best tour guide and driver we had during our stay.Thank you Bali Sun Tours for making our trip even more memorable."

We had a trek down to the river through the forest, which was so beautiful. The rafting was fun, in the dry season the water levels are much lower - so you don't go as fast and you can get stuck on rocks, we still had an awesome time, amazing views - we even saw a monkey on the other side of the River. The waterfalls are lovely, you can take your own pics standing under one, and wade around the river. Lunch was nice, buffet style - which was needed after the day of rafting! I would recommend this to people who like adventure and action, who don't mind exercise! - you do a lot of walking up and down stairs getting to and from the river (which we loved but other people did have trouble). Our tour guide was fantastic too - funny and informative - Thanks Sonic! All in all, a great day!"

Super friendly from the second he met us at the airport. Each day he would always greet us with a smile and was always happy to chat with us and answer all of my partners questions about Bali, its culture and random things we drove past. He was even great about us wanting to add extra things to our itinerary or change things slightly. We did the Mt Batur Climb - this was a great morning despite the grueling climb in the dark. We watched the sun rise from the top of the mountain and then saw the volcano crater and where the monkeys live. Our guide was great, full of information!We also did the Monkey forest, at first i was excited and happy to see all of the monkeys. We had taken very little into the forest with us as it indicated they can try to take your things, all we had was cameras and a water bottle. They love the bottle and were jumping on us to try and take it. I had a baby monkey jump on me and chew on the bottle, which was cute, until the mother came up and started biting me coz she thought i was trying to steal her baby. Id recommend taking bare minimum into the forest, and staying away from the babies. Our final tour was the ATV adventure - this was a great day, although i had never ridden and ATV before and found it quite daunting at first. They give you a very quick run down of the controls and then send you on your way. The course is quite challenging if you don't know what you're doing. We had a lady ride off the edge of the path into a ditch within the first few minutes. I would recommend this if you have done ATVing before as a lot of the course if over a mud track and there are some quite challenging parts. I ended up sideways a few times.All in all Bali sun tours is a great company and i will definitely use them again if i return to bali :)"

Food was average, when we arrived back to the starting point for our buffet lunch, the buffet was almost empty and the remaining food was cold, it took a while to get a top up. But that was a minor negative.We also did an ATV tour, this was average. We did an atv tour on our last bali trip with a different company and were looking forward to this ne as it was a bit more extreme. We were disappointed in the group size (16 people) was far too many especially when alot of people had never ridden an ATV let alone seen one before... withon 5 minutes of the group leaving a girl drove off a bank and rooled her atv.... for the rest of the tour we continuusly had to stop and wait for her and her friend to catch up... this effeced ur time and experience. the bikes also kepot stalling and let out lots of fumes, not nice to be stuck behind that breathing it in.This tour indicates it is fine for beginners, i disgree. Alot of the track was mud and we slid around alot without any control. You drive along a small path with a metre drop to the side, one slip and you would be down the bank. I wouldnt reccommed this tour to anyone who has never ridden an atv, without the understanding how heavy they are and dangerous it can be if you crash or do not know how to steer, break, accerate or change gears, id reccommend the tour we did last year along the beach....."

We elected to check out the monkey forest (very cool), and asked our driver to take us for the best shopping for silver, batik and furniture...we scored!

Traffic in Bali is haphazard -- at best -- with a set of 'road rules' all their own, but we negotiated all moving obstacles with ease and complete safety, thanks to YOGA'S skill behind the wheel. Not only was YOGA very courteous, and fun to be with, but he cracked as many jokes as we did -- his English language skills were near perfect. Apart from knowing \"all the good places to go to\", he never once forced us into any particular establishment, instead, allowing us to choose where and when to stop. Another 'plus' was the fact that he never once even alluded to expecting more money -- as some do -- and this allowed us to enjoy our days with him, without feeling any pressure for 'the poor, underpaid, driver. (In fact, we have no idea what his wage may have been, as it never came up in conversation.) We can thoroughly recommend YOGA from Bali Sun Tours when you are in need of a driver in Bali, and contact him on yoga7335@gmail.com or info@balisuntours.comfrom 'Mr. John' and 'Mr. Des'."

I have a specific driver, Tudi, who is a fantastic driver and very friendly. We have become good friends over the four trips I have made to Bali, and he has always been courteous, punctual, and patient with us. Highly recommended !"

He was a source of knowledge about anything we wanted to know about. Never hurried us and helped us through all the different arts in Ubud (though my bartering skills need some work!). Loved the whole day and would definitely recommend Wayan and Bali Sun Tours to anyone wanting an insiders guide to Bali. Made our honeymoon trip easy, enjoyable and stress free. Will book again when in Bali."

I booked a full day tour with Bali Sun tours while I was still in NZ. the admin staff were very good at organising the details via email and were very quick with their responses. On the day we were lucky enough to have Nyoman turn up at our resort. He was an absolute pleasure for our whole trip taking us to all sorts of places we wouldn't have otherwise known about. He made our day that much more enjoyable and I will absolutely be recommending him to everyone I know heading to Bali"

Our driver Made was amazing, spoke perfect English, was insightful, polite and knew his stuff inside out. Nothing was an issue. We stayed at three different hotels whilst we were in Bali and it was never a problem to pick us up wherever we were. A couple of minor issues with traffic meant we missed out on something however Made was so accommodating and went out of his way to make sure we saw something else. Both tours were majestic. We loved the Traditional dances, the Temples were so breathtaking and because there were four of us he didn't disappoint in making each one of us comfortable. Made was able to make sure we each did what we wanted to do. Made was an excellent driver and we felt very safe at all times. I couldn't recommend the company or Made enough."

Just like the first time, Surya was an absolute pleasure to book with via email. We asked for the same driver we had last time (Nyoman) because he was so awesome the first time! Unfortunately, he was not available for all of our bookings so we only saw him for our airport transfer on the first night. He was there, at the airport gate with a big smile and a sign with our names. The other drivers we had during this stay were also very lovely. On the second day, Nyoman even called our driver to ensure that he had picked us up on time and was treating us well! (Aw!) Their english is very good, their vehicles are clean, comfortable, and well air conditioned. They are lovely and informative and very flexible on their itineraries. Words can't express how much I recommend you book with these professionals!"

We got picked up promptly from our hotel, and as soon as we got into the car he tried to sell us a fire show. We politely declined but thanked him for the offer.Our first stop was the King's Palace in Ubud. The drive was around 1hr 45mins. It was a lot smaller than I imagined, so we checked out the markets there, much more arty than the markets in Kuta!The tour boasted a suckling pig & buffet for lunch, which I was looking forward to, but for that, we would have to stay in Ubud, and since it was 10.20am, we were not ready for lunch. Our driver then said there was another option for a buffet lunch, without the suckling pig, we opted for that so it would be a better time for lunch.I wish we hadn't, the other option was overlooking Kintamani Volcano & Lake Butar. The view is absolutely stunning but the food - terrible. It was inandated by flies and did not look hygienic at all. My friend & I had to hunt for a clean looking plate and served ourselves a small helping of fried noodles & some funny looking chicken. We felt a bit ill afterwards.After lunch we got some more photos of the lake and had a browse of the street markets there. Then we headed to our coffee tasting! It was the best part of the tour, we got a tour of the plantation, and saw the process of the coffee making. The lady who worked there did a terrific job of this. We then got to have a complimentary tea & coffee taste, there were about 7 different flavours, and they were all so good! We had to pay 50,000rp (5AUD) for the coffe that's been passed through the Civet, but it's well worth it. Very lovely!A short drive later and we were at the Holy Springs. Our driver came in with us and I'm glad he did, he helped explain a lot of things, and let us know when we could take photos and when to put on sarongs ect. They provide sarongs before you enter the Springs for respect, which was handy. It was a great experience! Be aware, there is a fee to use the bathroom 2000rp (.20cents) and you will need your own toilet paper. After you exit the Holy Springs, there is a maze of markets! And to be honest, it's MUCH cheaper than Kuta markets! The ride home was long, and left the both of us feeling travel sick. I think the food we are also had something to do with it. It was good to have a cultural day, and that's what this tour does!"

A great amphitheatre the only thing letting it down was the rudeness of other audience members, many getting up and down throughout the performance and leaving before the end. I believe these were mostly Chinese tourists. After the show we went for dinner at Jimbaran Bay and really enjoyed eating on the beach and being serenaded by the band."

On both occasions we were collected from our resort punctually at the nominated time by courteous drivers in clean, late-model air-conditioned vehicles.The highlight of the Ubud trip was the tea/coffee tasting at the Ubud Luwak coffee plantation that only a local would be able to find. Our driver had earlier taken us to a Barong Dance which happens every morning at 9.30, costs A$10pp and was interesting, but a tad long (1 hour). Yoga, our driver, saw that I'd spotted a Ralph Lauren Polo outlet & happily took us there as well as to a silver factory. The Bali Sun Tour drivers will take you wherever you want to go but if there are parking costs or admission charges, they're your own responsibility.The Sunset Tour was beautiful & climbing the clifftop path to Uluwatu Temple was spectacular. There was a traditional Kecak Fire Dance on offer for A$10pp but we preferred to enjoy the view rather than taking in another hour-long dance performance. Be prepared to pay incidentals like temple admission/sarong hire at Uluwatu plus parking costs when you go to Jimbaran Bay. Dinner at Jimbaran Bay is delightful, dining under the stars enjoying fresh seafood before returning to your accommodation. Check out what restaurants along the strip have on offer (dinner is your own expense).Well done Bali Sun Tours for having so many itineraries on offer & such knowledgable local drivers."

Having heard mixed reviews of Bali - we were impressed with what we experienced with our host Oka.We used Oka for ~6 days during our 9 day stay. Oka stayed with us during the tour and explained all aspects of Balinese culture in great detail with great knowledge of Ubud and neighbouring villages.We started our tour on Friday morning with visit to Sea walk, Flying fish, Jimbaran Bay, Coffee Luwak and Dreamland beach. With plenty of time to enjoy each activity.Saturday and Sunday we had half days due to weather and hotel transfer. Oka was very accomodating and even agreed to enjoy a crazy rain bath at Tanah Lot Temple with us! The two halfdays we covered Tana Lot Temple and another beautiful temple close-by. Sarong factory and silver factory was done during our transfer to Ubud Villa with Oka.Across the next few days we enjoyed - Warung Dance, Sarong Factory, Ubud Locals Market, Monkey Forest, Rice Terrace, Volcano Walk, Temple and Water Blessings, Goa Gajah Cave saving best for last - the White Water Rafting with Oka's cousin Ary. What a fantastic bloke. Down to earth and also very understanding as my wife couldnt swim and it was our first rafting experience. Action packed and not to mention the wonderful foods we tried. Hands down to our host and the wonderful Bslinese locals for making this trip memorable. Thank you Oka, Ary and Bali Sun Tours!"

Oka it would not of been the same without you you not only took us on the Eat Pray Love tour you educated us about Bali and were open to answering our questions. You showed us so much more and were more than available to us. When you were not available due to being booked by someone else you arranged for your brother Gus who was so lovely. You made our trip so much better and through that great experience we have made a friend who we will contact for life and we have and will continue to share our experience with friends and family. Thank you and for anyone travelling to Bali the Eat Pray Love tour was great my hubby and I enjoyed it but we also took the Bali safari park riding the elephant experience on recommendation from Oka and that was our highlight but to also know that this park was the only one 100% owned by the balinese meant allot to us.

We found Sunset tours online and purchased the pack to see Uluwatu , kecak dance and Jimbaran. Not only was it great value for money, but our host \"Gusti\" was so lovely. We felt so welcomed, and he suggested interesting activities and things we could do during our trip. We enjoyed his company so much that we booked him again the next day to go to Ubud, of which he was so helpful and took us to see the Luwak Kopi, Barong dance and explore the rice fields. I have been around other parts of Asia (Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Indonesia etc) , But I have never met such a welcoming, honest and fun host. Bli Gusti was great company, and made our short time in Bali a great experience, we gained a true friendship out of the experience, and it was so nice to get away from the business of the Kuta area, and explore Bali with a local!. I have reccomended this Tour company to my friends , and would especially reccomend Bli Gusti as the host. His customer service and genuine care for our experience was fantastic!. Thankyou for showing us an amazing time in Bali - we will be back ! Yana , Laura, Emily and Mira - Melbourne, Australia -"

We felt taken care of, always on the lookout in making sure we're okay. He's very eager to interact and learn about our culture, and share with us his culture as well. He didn't make us feel rushed, always patient in waiting in between tours. We felt that we could trust him, so sometimes we'd leave our personla stuff with him, like phones and wallets (especially during the Water Sports Tour). Since he's still young, I believe experience will make him a very very good tourguide in the future, as he has all the basic qualities of one."

We were picked up at 11am at our hotel in Seminyak and drove around 1.5 hours to the location. We got changed into our swimmers and put our life jackets/helmets on, picked up an oar and off we went down to the river. NOTE: the trip down is very steep and slippery, care needs to be taken.Our guide, Made, was great - so funny and controlled the raft really well and had good English and instructed us well. We travelled for 5km through the rapids where we stopped to go swimming, grab a drink, and jump off rocks into the river (if you were game!) then travelled another 5km to the finish point. As we reached the finish point, we jumped out of the raft and swam the final 50m. We walked up to the restaurant where we had showers and got changed and had lunch.We were then driven back to our hotel.It was a well organised and fun day! We took a camera in a plastic bag and they provided us with a water proof bag to place it in. We suggest having a change of clothes for the end.Our guide, Made, went out of his way to make our trip enjoyable and fun!!!Highly recommended!!"

Apart from the buzz of the rapids & the amazing scenery, our guide made the experience so much fun, laughing & joking with us the whole time (my teenage daughter thought he was very \"upbeat\"). Lunch was lovely with equally pleasing views from the restaurant over rice fields (although the walk from the river partly along the road was a bit hairy). Fresh towels were handed out and a shower was offered too. The trip back to the Hotel was equally as comfortable and we were able to leave when we were ready. I would highly recommend this tour for anyone visiting Bali - an experience to remember. Don't forget a plastic bag to put your valuables in while your in the raft. Thank you Bali Sun Tours.

We enjoyed our day so much we booked Oka to pick us up a few day later to look at a few temples and do some shopping, and we finished the day watching the sun set at a sea food restaurant in Jambarung, which was just spectacular and a fantastic way to finish off our time in Bali."

He found us a lovely place for lunch which we visited another 3 times. We asked if he cow;d drop us off early so the kids could get home to the pool and it was only smiles. The water sports was pretty full on with lots of people but we enjoyed the sea walker and got it for the group on price of $49 each. The guy there was good as he wasn't pushy at all, they understood that we had 3 little kids under 5 so hard to do it all. I would recommend this tour to anyone.

We didn't have enough time to explore everywhere, which is why his expertise made it easier for us to pick and choose where we wanted to go. We even took longer than the agreed time, but he graciously waited for us in smiles. If we went back to Bali, Bali Sun Tours would be the first place we'd contact. Thanks Nyoman, Wayan and Bali Sun Tours for making our honeymoon trip worth it!"

It worked out to be around $25aud for an Ubud private tour including Luwak coffee, ubid rice paddies, the monkey forest and the art village. The driver was due to pick us up from out hotel at 830am, he was there and ready to go at 820am. He spoke excellent english and was actually from Ubud so he had alot of local knowledge of the area.His driving was safe and reliable and he didnt appear to be speeding at any stage. We left bags in the van at each place and he stayed with them for us. He also had a very friendly demanour.Our tour was meant to go from 830-230 but he told us that there was no other bookings for the day and we ended up getting back to our hotel at 430pm and he didnt charge us any extra. I'd recommend using Bali Sun Tours for anyone wishing for a great day out with reliable and safe service."

Picked us up at mid night from the airport no worries (even had the sign with our name on it). Was friendly and polite straight away, shoed away the pesky taxi drivers trying to take advantage of you when you first come out the doors of the airport..Over the course of ten days we used him prob 5 of those days on and off, he was sooo easy to deal with, very knowledgeable of places to go or places not to go. nothing was ever to much trouble everything is always 'ok' with Oka!he is happy to wait around for you to finish dinner or whatever it is you are doing.. or if you invite him in for a beer or dinner will normally happily pull up a seat and have a chat!MAKE SURE you get Oka to take you to where the \"locals eat\" its called a Warung. omg some of the best food you will ever eat... each one specialises in different things depending on what part of Bali you are in and he knows the best ones and you won't get sick!! Suckling pig mmmmmmm.i could go on for ever here but i will cut it short all in all Oka really made our holiday AMAZING with out him i feel we would have had the amazing cultural experience we did.

I continuously asked my Guide Nyoman heaps of questions and he was only to happy to share with me his knowledge of Bali and its culture. I felt safe at all times and I don't think i would have got the same experience if I had of hired a random driver to drive me around. Its the little thinks like letting me know how to behave around monkeys and which hand to use for purification. Its always hard for someone who wants to respect another culture to feel comfortable because you worry so much about making mistakes...but i felt fine. I went on the Luminous tour and the Ubud Tour. The Barong dance was cool, the temples were amazing and I loved the restaurant at the volcano. The food was lovely and so inexpensive. The next trip we went to the monkey forest and to Ubud and we also looked at the process of making Batik...Its my first time to Bali so Nyoman helped me to understand local custom and that's what i'm there for to learn.....so Wow and that's all i can say. Totes recommend. Do take a camera, sunblock, water and a hat and be prepared to be amazed"

The length of this tour (about 5 hours) suited both the older and younger people in our group. Surya kindly arranged this tour for us on short notice and Wayan was our guide. He was very friendly and provided us with some basic background information. This tour included a visit to Uluwatu temple (which included a kecak dance performance) and dinner on the beach at Ganesh Cafe (Seafood restaurant), Jimbaran. The location of the temple (on a cliff) was amazing! The temple itself was closed off to tourists so we walked around the temple grounds (not very large) took pictures of the astounding views and monkeys. Be sure to keep your belongings in your vehicle if possible (sunglasses etc.) as these monkeys take whatever they can, edible or not. We saw one with a coin purse it had pinched from a fellow tourist!The view from the outdoor theatre overlooking the ocean was breathtaking. We were told that on a less cloudy day, we would have had a better view of the sun setting. We paid a little less than USD 10 for each adult (half price for kids) to watch the kecak dance (this is in addition to the $2 we paid to enter the temple grounds). The kecak dance started off on a serious note and quickly became farcical after the second act. The kecak chorus was quite unusual and kept the show moving along. After the show ended, we made our way to Jimbaran for dinner. If you feel cold with wind blowing, do bring along a light jacket/sweater so you can comfortably enjoy dinner on the beach. The ordering process was a bit chaotic. The red snapper we ordered (sweet sour style) was tasty. The rest of it was average. The seafood fried rice was cold when it arrived and the prawns were over-cooked. I wouldn't opt go back to this restaurant even though the fish was quite good. Wayan was great! I hope to take another tour with Bali Sun Tours when I return to Bali."

Words can explain how considerate and knowledgable our driver (Norman) was, there was no doubt he went above and beyond on this first outing. I was travelling with my sister and mother and agreed we needed our Norman back for a other day of touring and again he exceeded. I would recommend Bali sun tours and Norman to any one I know traveling to Bali. By far the best!!!!"

Did not regret choosing Bali Sun to organise and coordinate all the tours during my entire stay. Everything ran smoothly and I totally enjoyed all the tours even though I was a solo traveler. Knowledgeable guides and personalised service. Will definitely ring them up again if I do ever drop by Bali again, be it for a business or leisure. It was one of the best business trips combining both work and r&r!"

Agree that Bali Safari and Marine Park is a great destination for rare animals because not only had I great recreation place, we also get many new knowledge from educational shows. Having a \u201ctiger package\u201d with Bali Sun Tours, I had totally satisfying a full day trip at Bali Safari and Marine Park. My friends and I get crazy to take photos even at entrance because there is a lobby called Lobby Barong that\u2019s just so Balinese :DOur steps stopped to take photos again in front of Hanoman Stage, statues gallery of Ramayana. Sure there are statues of Hanoman itself, Rahwana and others. We didn\u2019t go inside because I insisted to take a safari tour by bus, of course. Luckily I had sat near the window so I could clearly what is outside. A young guide started to tell us about animals living there. I felt amazed seeing three zebras coming near to our bus. Then, we see rhinoceros, a sunbathing hippopotamus lol, tigers, and other wildlife creatures that have their uniqueness. \u201cWe are no longer in Bali, here is Africa\u201d my friend joked. But yeah, it showed us the riches of wildlife rare animals either in Indonesia or in Africa. After that, we were gladly welcomed by professional elephant trainers. Both of the elephant and trainer were ready to show! I heard so many \u201cwow\u201d when the elephants fulfilled its trainer\u2019s command. Then, we were having lunch at Uma restaurant, luckily we came on Sunday then we could watch traditional dance performance. In short, I enjoyed my tour in Bali Safari Marine Park that ended with sightseeing fresh water aquarium where we could see thousand fish. Thanks Bali Sun Tours\ufeff for giving the great and worth scheduled package!"

All members of the team were lovely and made you feel comfortable and at home in Bali, Surya helped me to organize and pre plan some of our activities before we went via email and facebook and always messaged me to offer assistance to make our trip the best it could be. He gave us good deals on everything we did and every single activity we did ran smoothly. The one time we booked NOT through Bali Sun Tours was the one thing we didnt like, so continued to book through their company. MY friends who were in bali at the same time as us were booking through the street stalls everyone back home tells you to book at and they were being ripped off on comparison to us, and said their tours were no where near as good as ours. Surya is an excellent host for Bali, so cheerful and genuinely wanting to provide the best for all his customers. I couldnt recommenced bali sun tours more, making sure my friends and my parents who come to Bali this year go through this company!!!"

I had so much fun with my friends doing rafting at Telaga Waja River. When I was there, I felt like I found the secret beauty of Bali. The forest was so thick and green with vines hanging down the tall trees, falling leaves, bird chirping, total opposite of all the crowd and the buzz in US. The price was reasonable and I had a river guide who was the very definition of friendliness with an air of professionalism in his every rafting advices and guidelines. He provided us with waterproof bag and towel too. The safety equipment was international standardized, added with insurance cover hence I could put my worries aside. We ended the day with tasty buffet. We went back to our hotel completely merry for we tamed the wild dragon on the best river in Bali! Thank you Bali Sun Tours!!!"

We did parasailing, banana boat, and jet ski. I wanted to do snorkeling at first, but the staff advised me not to because they were worried of my health, so I agreed with activities that did not include submerging myself under water. I was really thankful for the advice, if not I wouldn't be able to enjoy the last 3 days. Thank you for caring, Bali Sun Tour, I really appreciated it.The parasailing was so much fun, when I was on the sky I saw the beauty of Bali, the vast blue ocean surrounding the brown sandy shore, that was a breath-taking view to take. The blazing sun was a nice compliment for the chilling ocean breeze so I was comfortable up there. It seemed that Bali Sun Tours chose the right time to be that high. That was awesome and really thoughtful!The banana boat and jet ski were enjoyable. The instructor explained how to drive the jet ski very clearly and even tested us whether we understood his explanation or not, a detail man with detail explanation. 3 hours on the beach was not enough because Bali Sun Tours made our holiday so enjoyable. The staffs were so helpful too right from the very beginning when we were scheduling up to when the driver took us back to my hotel.Bali Sun Tours gave me a marvelous holiday in Bali. Fantastic holiday agent! Please help with my next trip too!"

It was pouring rain, the driver was early and greeted us with an umbrella so we didn't get wet. He introduced himself as Made.We got in the very comfy A/C van and explained we didn't really know where to go for shopping, so we'll leave it to him. Made suggested quite a few places including Geneva, matahari, kuta art market, discovery, and took us to quite a few others along the way and also took us for lunch @ Bubba Gumps. Nothing was at all to much trouble, being pregnant, I wanted to look at baby stuff, Made even walked me to the baby sections of the department stores to show me !Made was obliging, courteous and his English was 10/10. He also took us to a bank to exchange money along the way.....bringing us back to our villa at 4.30 via Seminyak square to pick up some dresses that I had made a few days earlier to accommodate my expanding belly.I would recommend this driver to anyone visiting Bali, he certainly looked after us!

We spent 3 wonderful days with Wayan Juli on customized tours around Ubud.Everything was perfect and the whole family loved him; he was polite and attentive with the Grandma ; he answered all the questions of the mother about Balinese culture; he played with our little girls (5 years old, who does not speak English but still asks when we will meet Wayan again) as the mother took countless photos and carried her on his back when she did not want to walk any more; without forgetting the dad for whom Wayan is by far the best guide we had during our 29 days in Bali.Bref, nous sommes unanimes, Wayan Juli est un chauffeur extr\u00eamement attentif et prudent; un guide comp\u00e9tent et flexible qui s'est adapt\u00e9 \u00e0 toutes nos demandes et changements de derni\u00e8re minute et un jeune homme honn\u00eate, avec le c\u0153ur sur la main et digne de confiance. Nous le recommandons donc sans h\u00e9siter et nous esp\u00e9rons retourner un jour \u00e0 Bali pour continuer \u00e0 visiter cette \u00eele magnifique et cette fois pas la peine de chercher un autre guide, ce sera Wayan.Thanks again for all these beautiful moments Sybille, Thomas, Romane and the Grandmother"

Thanks Ju gave us a wonderful day in Ubud.Me and my girls arrived in Bali, took Ju's airport pickup straight to Ubud, it feels really nice to see your name on the board as soon as you walk out the airport.

Wayan Juli was a great tour guide \u2013 professional and friendly, fluent in English, very flexible with our itinerary, has good knowledge of Balinese culture and always took a great care of us. He was not available for the 4th tour we did in Bali, so he organized us his partner Ketut Ajus \u2013 who is also a great guide \u2013 taking great care of his clients, fluent in English and very flexible.

He is mild mannered and a great driver. His patience while I took a lot of photos was endless. He knows the area very well - what towns specialize in what crafts, where to walk around a private rice terrace away from the crowds, etc.His knowledge of the Hindu culture and Bali history is comprehensive. I extended our amount of time with him the day before. I only would have liked the tour to be slightly more organized, but I think that's the road system in Bali more than the tour. I've had a lot of enthusiastic tour guides, wayan juli is more soft spoken. It doesn't make it bad, just more Balinese. The island in general is calmer than most of our other destinations. This is an overall cultural interpretation of Bali and Be Balinese was also like that during our tour.We requested seeing lots of temples and he satisfied that as well as the rice terraces. I agree with the other reviewer that he should have cold water and clean wipes for his guests. The car was amazing - very new and clean. He offers sarongs for the temples and stays with you for the whole tour. Lastly Wayan Juli's English both written and spoken is the best we experienced on the island."

We found Wayan Juli here on TripAdvisor and we can tell that that was the best decision we could have made! We contacted him on WhatsApp two days before we wanted to make our trip. We just told him the date and the places we wanted to see. He answered pretty quick and gave us all the information we needed - so we just had to confirm. On our one day trip we almost explored whole Bali. Wayan Juli picked us up with his nice car. He told us so much about the country, the culture, religion and the life in Bali. By the way, his English is great! All the information he has given were not told like a studied poetry, we had a great conversation with him so he could answer all the questions we had. It was so interesting to talk to him, so we can tell that now we know more about Bali than we would have ever known with an usual guide! He also joined us while visiting all the places and told us the meanings and histories of them. He gave us good advices and showed us markets and places where we could go shopping for good prices. He always waited patiently while we were walking around by ourselves no matter how long it took. All in one, he was the best guide we could have had! We definitively recommend to plan your Bali trip with him!"

On the first day, we saw Goa Gajah, Gunung Kawi, Tirta Empul, Kitamani Batur Volcano, and the Tegallalang rice fields.

Be Balinese stuck out of the mass by seeming to be very authentic which was the reason why we contacted Mr Wayan Juli (the owner) for a tour. The correspondence was very professional and the next morning Mr Ketut Ajus was waiting for us at our hotel. Ketut is a very friendly, polite and funny guy with a nearly unlimited knowledge about Bali, its traditions, poeple's habits and everything else that comes with it. On top of that, he is a very safe driver which is quite a skill in balinese traffic. We had great conversations with him and it was rather like being with a friend than just with a tour guide. Ketut showed us the island through the eyes of a local, explained every temple, lake, village, vulcano and so on we went to in the utmost detail. He asked for our interests and even managed to take us to a Warung out in the country, where there were no tourists because we wanted to try \"real\" balinese food. This one of the best lunch we had during our whole time on Bali. Words cannot describe the beauty of the things he showed us and the perfect time and fun we had these two days. Sadly all things come to an end and the best things just seem never to last long enough. Surely we will miss exploring the island together with Ketut!If you are looking for a \"good\", \"decent\" or \"very good\" tourguide on Bali, go look somewhere else. But if you are looking for noone but the best there is on this island, you should go to be balinese tours and ask for Mr Ketut Ajus!Thanks again Ketut!"

We managed to create a full day tour which included most of the sights on my list. I also arranged airport pick up with Julie (which was much cheaper than what the hotel was asking for). My flight was delayed but I managed to stay in touch with Julie over whatsapp which was very helpful and gave me some piece of mind. When we finally arrived at the airport at 1am, Julie was waiting for us and made us feel very welcome! We had a lovely chat on the way to the hotel which made me really look forward to the trip we had planned a couple of days later. On the day of the trip Julie arrived on time with a big smile on his face.

As with other reviewers, I was extremely impressed with Wayan Surya who was really dedicated as a tour guide. We picked the tour that brought us to some of the famous temples in Ubud as well as rice terrace and it was fantastic. He also brought us to one of the best kept secrets for lunch where we had such a nice view over the rice padi with really good food - all for a very reasonable pricing. Throughout the tour, he also played a very active role in sharing with us more about the culture and interacting with us. As an experienced tour guide, he also taught us how to ensure our tour was better by not falling into some of the common tourist traps. What I really admired about him was that whilst he looked after the welfare of us by giving us tips on how to avoid tourist traps or how to bargain, he never once intervened and helped us do it. It really shows how he balances well between being a dedicated tour guide and being a loyal local who understood his fellow Balinese friends. During the rice terrace tour, one of my friend accidentally got caught in a sticky situation with the mud and he took the initiative to get resources and help without any delay. We also liked that though we stayed in seminyak which could be quite far from Besakih temple (especially with a traffic jam), he never once complained about the distance and timing that took during travelling. Personally, we heard that the company is a family-owned company. A really small company but we loved it as such because the quality is so good and they treat their clients like their own family members. Really thankful for his company and the wonderful service by this tour. Will definitely recommend it to everyone!"

We\u2019ve visited the area on multiple occasions and used many different tour operators and can say without a doubt, his service tops all of them on all fronts!

We originally hired Wayan Juli for an intense full day of tours around the area, visiting temples but soon realized it would be more productive for us to split the day into 2 half days. Juli was happy to accommodate and even suggested alterative options, combining areas with sites we hadn\u2019t even thought about. Besides his refreshingly pleasant demeanor, we found him to be thoughtful and courteous in considering our needs along with the added benefit of being a skilled safe driver. He is knowledgeable and happily shares his love for the Balinese culture and the history of the area. On our first day out for temple tours, we commented on the beautiful rice fields we were passing. We were pleasantly surprised when he offered to pull over at a colleagues rice field and talked about the business of rice farming in Indonesia. He showed us the difference between new vs mature rice, the process of growing wet rice, and current challenges/ trends impacting their country. Although this was a diversion from our agenda, we never felt rushed into hitting our prescribed schedule. Besides his formal tour guide services, we found his airport transport to be cost efficient and reliable. He\u2019s helped us arrange SIM cards for our mobile phones and we\u2019ve used him as a driver for easier shopping and communicating with locals around the street markets. On our last shopping trip it poured rain. He provided an extra umbrella, called shop-owners to find out when they would re-open and dropped us off at a cute caf\u00e9 where we could wait out the rain. When we ran out of money (not once but Twice!) he drove us to an ATM, waited and then drove us back to the street market. No matter what service he provides, we have found his prices more then fair and his customer service outstanding. In short, we love being able to work with one trusted guide, who speaks excellent English, quickly responds to emails and who we can count on to be completely honest and arrange all our varied needs."

            "review": "2 full day tours of Bali. My husband and I, along with another couple we met on the Celebrity Millennium cruise ship booked 2 full day tours with Wayan in Jan 2016. All of us were amazed with his professionalism and quality of service. From the start, when I emailed him about my request for his tour, he always responded me instantly, unlike other tour guides I worked with, for other ports. Based on the recommended sightseeing stops from his website, I selected the ones that accommodated my interest and worked with him to create a private itinerary for my group. He was efficient and his English is good.From the time he picked us up at Benoa port to start the tour till he dropped us to return to the ship in the evening, we spent almost 12 hours together on the first day, He gave us time to enjoy the sites at our leisure and privacy but also knew to give us history and cultural information when needed. He showed his care for us by constantly reminding us to bargain when we shopped and took us to the currency exchange kiosk in the city (versus the one at the port) so we would get a better exchange rate.On the second day, one of the stops was the monkey forest in Ubud. My girl friend and I changed our mind at the last minute and decided to opt for massages (highly recommended!) while our husband visited the monkey forest. He was eager to comply.We all felt very safe with his driving throughout the 2 days!If I return to Bali, I will contact Wayan for his service again with no hesitation!"

Wayan was extremely flexible with us as we requested a number of changes to his normal routines---later start times, limited walking and as few stairs as possible. Bali was extremely hot and humid and this was complicated by some mobility issues but Wayan did his best to make sure we saw most of the key highlights on our areas of interest list. Would recommend him ---his SUV was comfortable, he provided umbrellas and saris for temple visits. Thought he could have better planned the itinerary to minimize transit but recognizing the large group tours and their timing he did a good job. Suggest he provide cold water and cool towlets given extreme heat."

I contacted a few other companies reviewed on trip advisor and felt Be Balinese charged reasonably as compared to others. You however may find cheaper rides and negotiate better with local Cab drivers.The owner Wayan Juli was very responsive over email. He would promptly answer any questions I had during the booking process. He was also ready to accommodate couple extra spots that we wanted to cover. Our driver/guide for all the rides was Wayan Surya, who is a very polite gentleman. He drove us safely through the narrow and windy roads in the island. He explained well the history of the places we visited and the hindu culture and traditions followed in Bali. He was also interested in learning the traditions followed in India. We had a great time chatting with him!Below were our rides with them:- Airport -> Ubud- Day tour - We covered Tegallalang rice terrace, Ulun Danau Bratan, Sekumpul Water falls, Kintamani, Tirtha Empul, Gunung Kawi- Ubud -> Pemuteran(to visit Menjangan island) -> Ubud- Ubud -> Padang Bai"

He was extremely friendly and approachable. He took us to all the sites we wanted, and his narration was interesting as he shared his personal experiences about many sites. Throughout our tour we felt at ease and enjoyed our experience. I certainly highly recommend this tour and our guide, and in fact when back at the hotel passed on the details to other guests.After dropping us at our hotel, I discovered I forgot my camera in the car. I was impressed by the care shown by Mr Juli & Mr Surya, who came back to my hotel two hours later in the night to return the camera. I'm very grateful for this, which demonstrates the excellent care to customers."

We had a late flight out of Bali and whole day to use we didn't want to spend waiting at the airport. Organizing a tour was a great way to go, and our guide even managed to take us to the airport at the end, without the need for a separate transfer from Ubud.We had a wonderful guide and driver - Ketut Ajus - who was happy to take our (multiple) requests in hand with how we wanted to spend out last day. The highlight was a local Balinese market as the sun was setting - a real glimpse into life in Bali away from the tourism-driven glitz and buzz. The local people were friendly and welcoming, and the market was full of life - with few, if any, other tourists in sight. The trip to the kopi Luwak / coffee plantation was also a surprisingly good adventure, and despite the fact that the coffee was clearly marketed towards tourists, the grounds and staff were lovely and Ketut took the time to take us through various spice and fruit trees that grow there. The tour is great value for money and wonderful that it can be individualized, and tailored to your wishes and travel plans. We had a wonderful time asking questions about everything, and having a few laughs. Would definitely use this service again!"

Ketut gave us a guided tour of a temple on the way to Ubud which was fantastic. He also took us to a beautiful waterfall and a relaxing coffee plantation. His best suggestion was our restaurant for lunch which was overlooking the rice terraces and had fantastic food. We decided to change our plans throughout the day and Ketut was more than happy to go wherever we wanted. He has amazing local knowledge of the area and wants to share the best parts of Bali with his guests. The best part is that he loves photography so will take excellent photos for you!

I was visiting Bali, Indonesia for the first time and was staying in the cultural heart of the island in Ubud.Having read tips on Trip advisor the best way to see the island was by private tour. Be balinese private tours had some excellent reviews so I decided to book through them.All correspondence is done through e-mail with Wayan. Final confirmation is given 2 to 3 days prior to start of your tour.There are several different packages you can choose from on their website, these as I found out can be very flexibly to suit your needs.Wayan turned up on time at my hotel ready for my tour. I had booked two different tours over two days. The price of the tour is regardless of how many are in the tour party. I was travelling alone which was not a problem.My tour took me to several temples and historical sights. Wayan was very knowledgeable in the history surrounding the temples and explained this in great detail. Be prepared to take some money with you as the tour does not include entrance tickets to the temples, lunch, water etc.The two days that I spent with Wayan were amazing, through his guidance I was able to imerse myself into the balinese culture. He was very acomodating, there was no rush things were done at your pace.I would highly recommended using Be balinese tours if you wish to see the true side of Bali."

Persuaded by other TripAdvisor reviews and the company\u2019s highly informative website, we thought a tour from Be Balinese might provide us Bali newbies with a good introduction to Balinese culture. They did not disappoint! After only 24 hours\u2019 notice, our guide, Ketut Ajus, greeted us at our Ubud hotel right on time at 9 a.m. Our first stop was the Goa Gajah temple; but before we got there, Ketut set the cultural stage for us\u2014the basics of Balinese Hinduism, the role of temples therein, and the all-important do\u2019s and don\u2019ts of a temple visit. When we arrived, he supplied us with proper attire (sarongs, which we otherwise would have been obliged to \u201crent\u201d or buy on the spot), and he then provided careful explanations of what we were seeing as he led us through the temple complex. This was the pattern for the entire day\u2019s outing\u2014which included more temples (each highly unique), and also walks through rice terraces, a coffee plantation, and a lunch stop overlooking Lake Batur. When we returned around 5 p.m., we felt that we had seen and learned more in one Balinese day than in a week in other parts of the world. Here in San Francisco, we often provide \u201ctours\u201d to visitors who want not only to see the sights, but who seek to live life and see the world as we do, if only for a moment or two. Ketut Ajus and Be Balinese presented Bali to us in a similar way, and we\u2019re eager to come back for more!"

I found them on TripAdvisor and emailed them at 8 PM, the evening before my intended tour date. I didn't know if they would be able to get back to me in time, but they did -- and in such a great way too! They asked me what I was interested in, and I rattled off a bunch of things that I had seen on TripAdvisor, and in catalogs and guide books; and before my spouse and I went to bed that night, we had settled on a full itinerary with Be Balinese for the next day, and a pickup time of 8:30 AM.The next morning, our guide Ketut Widana was there right on time. He was very friendly and his vehicle was comfortable. He brought us to our first two stops, the Barong and Kris dance in Batubulan village, and a batik workshop. After the batik workshop, which had been quite touristy -- it was one of these huge showrooms that just had a handful of \"artisans\" in the front \"working\" on the craft -- my spouse and I agreed that we would rather see something less touristy, and more of the real Bali. We told Ketut this, and he immediately reworked our itinerary -- he drove us through the Balinese countryside, brought us to a beach with no resorts and which was frequented by locals, showed us through a smaller but \"alive\" (i.e., actually used by locals) and no less spectacular temple with few tourists, took us to a delicious restaurant for lunch and to another batik showroom with really rare and special products, and gave us a different view of the Tegalalang rice terraces. Having been accustomed to cookie-cutter package tours, this level of customization in response to what we were interested in seeing and doing was a refreshing treat. Also, though we ended our tour earlier than we thought -- we were exhausted by 5:30 PM and asked to be taken back to our hotel in Ubud -- Ketut Widana had actually been willing to go for two more hours. Excellent value indeed!My one [semi]regret is that I hadn't done more thorough research on Bali beforehand. Maybe I would have actually wanted to see some touristy, post-card-y things, just to be able to say I'd been there. But still, it was a great experience."

            "review": "Excellent 3 day tours. I contacted Be Balinese quite late before arriving in Bali but they were able to accommodate me with everything we requested. We had different tour guides for each of the days we were with Be Balinese but all three of them were great in their own individual way. All three of the guides were able to give us lots of information on Bali, and traditions and customs. This was something we really enjoyed, as we wanted to really understand the island we were visiting. For the first day, our tour guide was Wayan Suriya. Suriya was very chatty and very interested in finding out more about where we came from. On our tour to the woodcarving villages, Suriya took us to a second place as we were a bit disappointed with the first. He was very helpful, and wanted to ensure we were enjoying everything in our tour. For the second day, we were with Ketut Widana. Wi also explained a lot about Balinese culture and often joked around making us laugh. He was very pleasant and we had some good laughs with him over the day. Our last tour was with Wayan Juli. This tour was only a half day tour but we enjoyed it just as much as the others. Juli was again just as pleasant as our other 2 guides. He was interested in finding out about where we come from, and was able to give us even more information about Bali. With Juli we visited Kintamani and the Spring Water temple. At both sites he was with us giving us information.All three tours with Be Balinese were great. Juli was able to organise 3 great tours for us, including everything we wanted to see. All 3 guides seemed to know a lot about the history and traditions of Bali, and were very happy to answer any questions we had and give us as much information as possible on the sites we were visiting. If I am ever in Bali, I will definitely book with Be Balinese again. Thank you from Cyprus!"

I would recommend everyone to this tour agency. We did the Kintamani Volcano Tour. Every single second was very informative and amazing. Lets just say I just took the tour couple of hours ago and here I am giving a review right after. You will not regret it! Thank you Wayan Juli for your flexibility and responsiveness and Wayan Surya for the amazing tour! I will definitely be back in Bali and contact you guys. BTW, Wayan means First Born....Learned that today."

Wayan Juli got back with us immediately and was extremely patient in helping us plan our events. We ended up spending two days with him. The first day we did an all day tour. Throughout he was extremely knowledgeable and gracious. Stopping when we wanted/needed to and always being patient. He was great with our kids too and our 3 year old really liked hanging out with \"Mr Wayan\". On the second day we did the cooking class and it was awesome. We wanted our kids to see and experience Balinese life and this tour did a great job of that. We were able to go to his family compound and see how they lived and their farmland. We then got to spend a few hours watching our kids learn to prepare traditional meals with Wayan and his awesome family. Our sons even got to fish and eat their catch!Both days were amazing and our whole family loved it. If we ever go back to Bali we'll try to use Wayan for all of our trips.-Chris"

Juli is very professional, knowledgeable, humble, accommodating, and punctual. Also, his English is great. There was never a dull moment during our time with him - the conversation was great. We learnt a lot about Balinese life, culture and history - we couldn't have asked for anything more. The best part of all was that it never felt like we were being shown around by our driver - it was more like spending 5 days with an old friend who was always willing to do anything last minute! We had a great time in Bali and Juli made it that much more memorable! If you're heading to Bali, we highly recommend booking with BeBalinese :-)"

This Tripadvisor account was created so I can write a good review for Wayan Juli :)From the time I started contacting him after reading great reviews from Tripadvisor, he has been very accomodating to all my requests. From changing of pick up time to adding more guests to the tour, Wayan offers me solutions rather than trying to conform me to a standard itinerary. He gave me the maximum flexibility to customise my tour but at the same time offered me his wealth of experience about Bali to better organise the tour for my family and in-laws.Our 1 day tour with Wayan Juli and his colleague, also Wayan, started off at noon with lunch at Bebek Tepi Sawah, followed by shopping at Ubud Market and enjoying the great view of the rice terrance at Tegalalang Village. Then we headed over to a plantation where we have our first experience of Luwak coffee. After which it was a night tour of Tirta Empul Temple and we ended the well organised tour with Naughty Nuri's signature pork ribs paired with local Bintang beer.Not only was Wayan well verse in his knowledge of his home town, he speaks really good English and is the safest driver on the road. In fact I think what I enjoyed the most were the long chats we had while on the road. We talked about everything under the sun from our hometown cultures to politics to food to personal topics like marriage and family.I think he is more than a guide of Bali. He is my first Balinese friend.Highly recommended friend of Bali!!!"

My wife and I traveled to Bali in April 2015.The travel company which had done our booking for Bali booked a few tours for us beforehand with a travel agency from Bali called Pacto Ltd. Since Pura Ulun Danu Bratan and Pura Besakih were not included in those tours we searched for a tour guide on tripadviser and found Be Balinese tours whose owner Wayan Juli had very good reviews . We booked a trip to Pura Ulun Danu Bratan and Pura Besakih for 30th April 2015 with Be Balinese tours. It was good that we did not book this tour with Pacto Ltd since it made us realise the difference between the two. We had a horrible experience with Pacto Ltd and would not recommend them to anyone.Anyways our Be Balinese tour guide was Wayan Surya who picked us up at our hotel in Nusa Dua on time. He was an extremely good guide with excellent knowledge of all the places he took us to.Through him we came to know a great deal about Balinese culture, traditions and its people. He even knew a whole lot about India (my country)and its culture, which was quite impressive. He was friendly, very accommodating, willing to alter our route as we went (in one of our previous tours we missed seeing Mount Batur properly since it was all cloudy so when we told this to Wayan Surya he made a stop at kintamani so that we could spend some time there and get good pictures which we could not get previously), was very attentive, kept us engaged through the long drive with interesting conversations about Bali and India so that we did get bored and happily answered all our questions. He also has a good command over English. He made our Bali experience amazing and worth cherishing for life and we would definitely recommend Be Balinese tours and Wayan Surya to everyone who wants to visit Bali and make it memorable.Thank you Be Balinese tours for this wonderful tour.Ankur SharmaIndia"

After having reviewed transport solutions for Bali on the internet we realised that there is much more to transport than simply going from one point to another. This is how we found Be Balinese Tour and Wayan who became our gracious host rather than a driver. Always quick to answer emails and flexible to adapt to suggestions for itinerary. Through him, we got to see Bali the way we had hoped for!From the North, in Lovina, to the East in Amed to the South in Sanur to the center in Ubud and many points in between, Wayan was a gracious host, a knowledgeable cultural guide and a really good driver too! My wife, who easily gets car sick, did not have any issues whatsoever! He was so nice to our children and understood the challenges it might bring to have small children along for all the tours. Always on time and with a welcoming smile! We can only recommend Wayan and Be Balinese with the warmest regards. Wayan, we really hope we were not too much of a burden and that you would consider having us again when we decide to visit in the future! Top marks! RegardsKatarina, Haroon, Maia and Emil"

Spent part of the last month of 2014 in Bali Indonesia with my wife & in-laws and had the pleasure of having Wayan Surya as our 'personal tour guide' and driver around the island. Could not have made a better choice! First off, he was a very safe driver. The streets are a bit hectic there, very busy, and not all of the drivers we had took the safety of my family into account. Surya did and for that alone he gets our 100% Recommendation. Not only was he safe and patient, he knew where all of the places we wanted to go were, and he added to the experience by stopping by some places he thought we'd like. He showed us Bali temples, took us by the former house of the Royal Family, while explaining some Balinese traditions and really adding information to the sights & sounds of Indonesia. When we said we wanted to try Luwak Coffee, he took us to the place it was made, where we got a full tour and were able to try Luwak & other types of coffee!

He was always on time picking us up and helped us avoid a few scams (i.e. being asked to pay double for a ticket to a local cock fight because we were tourists, etc.). We also signed up for his Be Balinese Cooking Class - I think this was one of our most favorite experiences while in Bali. Juli gave us a tour of his family farm and his aunts taught us how to cook some delicious dishes (i.e. chicken satay, soup, corn fritters, etc.). Thanks for a great time Juli!"

I wrote to Juli and he responded right away! I told him some things I wanted to see and he helped make suggestions and create an itinerary with me. Surya was my driver and he was amazing! On time, speaks great English, very nice guy, and most importantly so knowledgeable on the history and culture of Bali. He was able to add and explain so much at each place we went. It was very helpful and I learned a lot! He was also able to drive me to the airport the next day. I recommended bebalinesetour to all my friends traveling to Bali and will forsure use them again if I ever return to Bali. Thank you so much Juli and Surya!"

Our driver/guide Ketut Widana (Wi) did a fabulous job, he was a very safe driver, spoke excellent english and we learnt a lot about Balinese history and culture. Awesome job Wi, thank you.We booked our tour days over the internet before arriving in Bali and Wayan replied to all emails very promptly, in excellent english with detail. Our 10 year old daughter is very interested in history and culture and Wi went out of his way to make her holiday memorable. A trip into the crater at Mt Batur, walking on a quiet black sand beach and meeting Wi's family were her highlights of Bali and experiences she will never forget.Thank you Be Balinese for sharing your Bali with us and ensuring we had an extremely positive holiday, we look forward to spending more time with your company next visit.regards and hugs to LastMaeThe Ortel family"

He is very friendly, pleasant, speaks good English and very humble.Coming from a small village in Ubud, Wayan Surya shared with us, amongst other things, his experience growing up in Ubud, getting married and also the Balinese culture/festivals. He is therefore not only a driver or a tour guide who brings you to touristy places, but nevertheless he is in fact a true local who you can learn a lot about the Balinese culture. We highly recommend Wayan Surya as your next local guide in Bali."

First day we went to elephant cave temple, spring water temple, Batur volcano, another temple by the lake (forgot the name) and then we went to a local market for shopping. Second day we went to Krisna first, which is a HUGE souvinir/clothes/snack shop near denpasar - this is a must go place for all tourist visiting Bali!! Juli waited for us outside for a good 2 hours! Then Juli took us to 2 beaches which were both nice. Finished the night off having seafood dinner bythe beach at jimbaran - Juli helped us to get 10% off discount!Overall, great tourguiding by Juli - hes very knowledgeable of the history of the temples, just a great person to chat with during the drive as well. Thanks Juli!"

Our driver Wayan Surya, had many qualities that added tremendous value to our Balinese experience. His English was very good and easy to understand, and his driving skills were excellent (a big consideration when travelling in Bali!) Numerous times he exceeded expectations to show us the wonders of Bali, which he knew very well. Most important of all though, he was a really nice guy, always positive and great fun to be around.

His english was almost perfect and it was nice talking with him! After this day, we decided to book a second day to visit the Jatiluwih rice fields. Again, we did so much more than what we expected : we visited a traditionnal market, the beautiful Bratan temple on the lake and much more! I couldn't imagine a better way to visit the real Bali.

The trip included a Balinese show, craft workshops, temples, coffee plantation and views of the rice terraces and volcano - a real mixture. Ketut spoke great English, was able to explain Balinese life and traditions and had a good sense of humour. Ketut knew great places to stop - and I did not feel pressured to purchase souvenirs along the way - he chose the stops because of the good quality demonstrations not a commission arrangement like in some other countries. We visited a water temple and Ketut took the time to explain the purification process, organise sarongs and offerings so that we could take part - a very special memory. Overall a very memorable day. Many thanks Ketut and Be Balinese."

I made my booking through email and it was such a pleasant surprise to see that Wayan respond so quickly to my requests. When we arrived at Bali, i received an email from Wayan to remind me when we were meeting the next day. I was impressed. The next day, Ketut came in place of Wayan because he was not feeling well. Ketut was an amazing guide. His english was really good and we had a really good time just chit chatting about life in Bali and his childhood. I told Ketut in very general terms what I wanted to do (i.e. rice fields and sunset at Tanah Lot) and he organised our itinerary for me immediately. first, he brought us to the Royal Temple. There, Ketut launched into a lot of history behind the Balinese culture which we found really interesting. Next up we went to Jatiluwih which was gorgeous. I love that place. Lunch was arranged for us - I would not say that was my best meal but it was decent. after that, Ketut brought us to roam around the rice padi fields. there, i found true peace and serenity. Ketut knew we did not want to rush around going through one attraction after another so he gave us plenty of time to explore Jatiluwih on our own. for a few hours, my friend and I just sat down on the fields and chatted. Ketut busy himself with his other tasks behind us. He was not intrusive but remain near enough in case we needed help. Sunset at Tanah Lot was breathtaking - if you didn't plan to go, you should because the splash of colours in the skies will shock you. There, Ketut showed us around, explained to us how the various rituals work in Bali. Then he left us to enjoy the sunset on our own. it was a beautiful day. On our way back, Ketut gave lots of good recommendation for food. we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. never felt unsafe throughout the trip. Ketut is also a very safe driver. I would definitely recommend Be Balinese Tours!"

He responded to all my emails swiftly (within 24 hours) and was very patient in answering all my queries and doubts about Bali. Wayan also tailored an itinerary that eventually panned out to be immensely enjoyable, with equal bits tourist spots for first time visitors and hidden surprises well off the beaten track. Wayan was preoccupied during my first two days in Bali so he left me in the hands of his uncle (Made Suweta) who was a good guide in his own right. But the magic really took off when Wayan took over on the third day. We started the day with a visit to a Balinese village way off the tourist radar, where Wayan gave numerous interesting titbits and insights about the local way of life. He explained in great detail how the education system worked, how locals prepared offerings, etc. with just enough humour to keep the boredom away, which was really enlightening. The journey to the other places we visited (such as Bedugul and Tanah Lot) was long but never arduous because Wayan would keep us engaged with anecdotes and trivia about Bali. Wayan is a great conversationalist and you'll never have a dull moment with him -- just ask him for his opinion/insights on matters ranging from Indonesian politics to favorite warungs! I was particularly interested in Indonesian/Balinese history and Wayan proved to be extremely knowledgeable about the subject too! Wayan also gave great tips for photography at the numerous spots we stopped at. His advice was spot-on and it was thanks to him that I got some of my best shots. At Tanah Lot, for example, Wayan led me away from where the main bulk of the tourists were to a more secluded area where I had great shots of the sun setting behind the temple. Similarly, at Jatiluwih, Wayan led me down the tracks to the rice fields where I obtained a more intimate and authentic view of the locals, as opposed to observing from afar. When it comes to recommendations, you similarly won't go wrong with Wayan. For our last dinner in Bali, Wayan recommended a Padang restaurant around Ubud that was both delectable and affordable -- it turned out to be one of the culinary highlights of the trip! He also recommended a kecak dance around town -- also an unforgettable experience I would've otherwise missed had it not been for his advice. Always there with a friendly smile, Wayan made me feel more than an observer of the local culture; he made me feel as though I were almost local, and he showed me what the true Bali is, stripped of the postcard cliches. Above all this, Wayan offers one of the most competitive rates there is out there -- especially for a service without a time limit. I couldn't recommend Wayan enough! When we parted ways at the airport, I regretted not extending my stay in Bali because such a short stay couldn't possibly do justice to this beautiful island, especially with such an extraordinary guide. I'm determined to return to Bali, and when I do, I won't hesitate to contact Wayan again for another trip!(P/S: If you're reading this, Wayan, I hope you enjoyed the Arts Festival in Denpasar!)"

He is an amazing young man, full of fascinating information and always smiling. We were so comfortable with him from the first minutes we met. We had a plan, but the heavy rain led us to change some things. On our first day, we went to his family compound for a fabulous lunch. We were in a lush jungle (no bugs!) with a beautiful open air kitchen and seating area. We met some of his family members, including his Auntie (a superb cook!), his cousin's wife and her kids. Juli's Auntie prepared a wonderful meal that will be a bit hard to explain. Everything was presented in banana leaf bowls and plates. Before eating anything, his Auntie prepared an offering to the spirits. This is something that is a huge part of their lives. It is the first thing done in the morning, after cooking and after eating, and the last thing at night. We had a pyramid of rice surrounded by corn fritters, a wonderful small dish of a tomato sauce, some spicy sauce with lemon grass, chicken satay and some kind of dumpling, steamed in a banana leaf pouch. We were made to feel like royalty as we tasted local cuisine, prepared and presented beautifully! We learned more about their customs and the offerings they make to the spirits and deities.This was one of the most fascinating parts of our two-day adventure with Juli. Learning about the local customs, schooling, families and religions gave us a sense of awe and appreciation for the Balinese people. That's what \"Be Balinese\" is all about - you can learn about and feel the gentle warmth and vitality of Balinese life.We talked about what would be of interest to us and Juli made suggestions for places to see. We visited beautiful temples and museums and the monkey forest (you must see it). We would start the day having breakfast together after he picked us up and then we would enjoy the scenery as we drove to our various destinations. Ubud, the artist town was great for shopping!Bali is very inexpensive and extraordinarily beautiful. Juli is the perfect guide for anyone wanting to see beautiful sites in a beautiful country. We only wish we could have stayed for a few weeks to really take it all in. We WILL go back and Juli will be the first call we make to ensure he is available!btw, our ship was three hours late in arriving, and Juli was waiting for us with a big smile and no complaints!Use him as your guide and let me know if you feel the same way!!! Having your own private guide and car at amazing rates was just like being royalty!"

We went there 4 persons, including my mom. From the beginning, my mom didn't know about Bali. She reluctanted to join with I & my friends to Bali. After she went there already, she fall in love with Bali & nice Tour Guide like Wayan-Juliana, too. He recommended us all of the nice places in Ubud, Kuta, etc. My first time in Bali were quite worthful. Last time, we went to many places & also tasted many local foods according to my tour guide's recommendation. Next time, we planned to join his rafting trip also. If we have more free time, next time, we will go to see the Loma show there also. I recommended \"Be Balinese Tour\" to my friends & anybody who wants to visit Bali, too. Next time, I plan to go to Bali again with my family and will contact to Be Balinese Tour. Thank you very much to Be Balinese Tour to made us knew a lot about Bali. (^_^)"

His knowledge about balinese culture and history is outstanding. He explains everything very clearly and thoroughly. He is very proffesional with very warm and friendly approach. He goes above and beyond what would have been expected from a normal guide. He was always ready with solutions and advices everytime we called him with questions (as stupid as : where can my dad in law get a nice haircut in Ubud ?). Spending 10'days with him in bali has made our holiday so enjoyable and memorable. I highly recommend Wayan Juliana as your tour guide in Bali."

His cheery and laid back disposition made us extremely comfortable, and he picked up the tab every single time (even when we tried to). The climb itself was lovely, although i recommend bringing trail mix/ snacks because we got cold and hungry at the summit. We were exhausted and barely conscious after a night of climbing but Made made the effort to stop by a local tourist attraction, a waterfall in one of the villages, which was a nice end to the trip.Do plan your next trip with Made Holidays, you won't regret it, trust me."

            "review": "\u201cVery good price, probably the best on market; great service and valuable friendship. Totally stress free and no worries. We rented the car for one month and then for another 25 days more. The price was the very best on the market. We got a Suzuki Estilo, in good condition, plus free sim card I used for gps and the detailed road map of Bali. Everything was smooth. Communication was so excellent and we had no worries. We exchanged like dozens of emails and it was so stress free! I was really happy of finding Made. No payment before meeting. Made with his team waited us at the airport. We arrived late in the evening. As Made was returning to Ubud I just fallowed him so it was an easy driving for the fist time on busy Bali. Our son of 2 years and half was sleeping by the time we reached Ubud so I asked Made a favour: to get us to our location, close to Ubud. It was reliving to have had such big help, we reached our destination in no time. During the first rental period I had a broken tire so I used the spare until I met Made and he solved the problem with his money. And in the first days I got a mirror broken but Made gave me one of his member team to join me to a mega store for cars and I fixed the problem by having a new mirror at a low cost price. Oh, I got a big discount for the second rental period, I couldn't believe myself. Made was so nice and understanding and willing to help. Thank you so much Made! Greetings from me, my wife and our son! And see you soon. We highly recommend Made and his team, for price and service and friendship!"

I d been looking and asking around to find a good car with a fair price, but even my local friends couldn\u00b4t find a car with a price which Made offered me.I highly recommend his company to anybody who is looking for a car to rent.

He explained the history of Balinese religion to us and answered any and all questions we had about Indonesia enthusiastically. He even volunteered to come pick me up at 4 AM the next day to take me to the airport! I could go on forever about how wonderful Made is but you should really see for yourself!

Here is a man who is a local to the Ubud area and can answer any question one might have. Made's english is excellent and he was more than happy to help in any way. He has a very positive spirit and a very funny sense of humor, always smiling. On the way to the place I was staying he kindly stopped at a money exchange office where I was able to exchange my money. Throughout my two weeks in Bali, Made was only a phone call away. I was able to call him if I needed a car or motor bike ride anywhere or even if I had any questions. I even called him the night before to ask him if he would take me on a day trip to the North side of Bali. He picked me up the next morning and we took a comfortable car trip stopping to see the terrace rice fields, coffee and tea plantations, elephant sanctuary and even a beautiful waterfall. I had a great day and was delightfully surprised to stop at all those beautiful places. Made became not only my tour guide but my friend. I was able to meet his wife on another day took me and my friends to see the thousands of heroins that flock in one specific area of Bali. The memories I made thanks to Made's help will last me my whole life. Made is am example of someone who works hard to make a better life for him and his family. I am so honored to have met him and when I go back to Bali I will for sure be calling up Made."

He is happy to share his local knowledge, he is a super safe driver and he is a pleasure to spend the day with. I would never use another driver for a day tour, he is simply the best! Rio also speaks excellent english. :)"

My sister has used his services many times, so we did too and he is fantastic. So friendly and helpful, nothing was too much trouble. We have enjoyed his vast knowledge and enthusiasm for anything that we needed to know about the island. We have recommended Putu and his services to the rest of our family and they now call him prior to travel. He is always reliable and punctual. He goes above and beyond to help to make your holiday memorable. Again, i would recommend this company , you wont be disappointed."

Winda our driver turned friend was totally amazing!! Very friendly and extremely informative. He has good english and pointed out sites along the way. Always on time and flexible. Took us to the best place for suckling pig lunch even when it wasnt on the agenda I highly recommend the cooking class as that was a true Bali experience out in Ubud with a local market tour. I feel like I got to do so much in the short time we were there as the packages were so fun filled. Thank you for the amazing time"

Bloody traffic and motorbikes everywhere !! After first day of rest Winda collected us for a shopping day in Denpasar and made great suggestions of places to go that we didn't know about. Winda is very obliging in all aspects of making your time very enjoyable. Winda does not rush you and if you are unsure of where you want to go he is very knowledgable in the best destinations. This was very obvious on our next trip with him. We wanted to go to the Monkey Forest the next day and had no other places in mind to visit. He suggested a few places and we readily agreed, and that enabled us to see far more than we expected in the culture of Bali. What started out as a 1 location trip ended up in about 8 locations that were very pleasing and interesting especially the coffee plantation visit. Winda is always on time, generally early but happy to wait until you are ready, and that is also the case wherever he takes you. He is an excellent driver and negotiates all the bloody traffic with ease. Winda's final job for us was dropping us off at the airport to come home. We enjoyed Winda's company, friendly knowledgable and funny. We highly recommend Winda for anyone looking for a driver (all ages) and we will be using his service again when we go back to Bali. Thank you very much Winda !!!"

He will gladly make suggestions on what activities you want and is also very open to what you really like to visit or do. As he said, \"When my guest is happy, I'm Happy\". This is what the whole experience has been like. He is not just on time, but is always early(around 20minutes early). He is friendly and caring and always asks us if we're doing fine or if we forgot something. What he offers is a very personalized experience. He accomodates your wishes even on the day of the trip itself. We originally wanted to go to both Pura Besakih and Ulun Danu Beratan, to which he agreed to even if it was far away from each other(more than two hours drive), but changed our mind on the day of our trip and he gladly suggested other places to visit which we enjoyed just the same. If you see a good photo oppurtunity, he will gladly stop the car for you and even take your photos with all the scenic views you pass by. He is honest, especially about prices of food and souvenirs and will give you tips when transacting with locals. He talks with you if you need to know more about Bali and their culture, etc. and also allows you to just rest if you need it. The car is very comfortable, good air-conditioning and is amazingly well maintained.All in all, we had a great experience with Windah and we even got him for airport service. Very safe, comfortable, and great value for money. It's totally worth it! Windah is not just a driver or a guide, we consider him as a good friend in Bali!

The cost was a little higher than first quoted because we were arriving by cruise ship but Winda was very helpful and made all the arrangements for the things we wanted to do. I would highly recommend prearranging transport especially if you want to do more than 1 activity in a day."

Both my husband and I traveled a lot for work over the years and we often go on family holidays overseas, including Bali 14 times. We've had many, many experiences with drivers over our journey's.....good bad and yes the ugly Some of the bad and ugly experiences we've had with drivers:Different person sent, who didn't speak or understand English well Driver forgot to book us on the horse riding tour and instead offer us elephants rides once he arrived to pick us up ......we were not happy as we'd done the elephants already Many have turned up late, one over an hour.....apparently he was on island time Some drive and are talking most of the time on their phones, to family and friends Aircon wasn't working and the car wasn't the same one we were shown.Only took us to friends and friends shops or locations were they would get a kickback. Doesn't worry us to much, but can restrict variety, experiences and take up valuable time (depending on location).On a previous trip to Bali with 2 friends and one had driver she always used and kept raving about. We decided to go thirds and book a half day shopping. Very disappointing and awkward day. The only effort or communication that was made was with the friend who had used them before. Unfortunately for the business, I travel fare more often to Bali than the friend and will never use their services or recommend them Another driver got lost and we missed the start of a show. The list goes on......What set Windah apart from the majority....he went over and above and out of his way to accommodate us. We've had several friendly drivers, but Windah proved to be more than that. His advice and honesty re prices, shops, locations, local knowledge etc was much appreciated and welcomed. He's also a very safe and skilled driver. .....A few days before leaving Bali, my husband and I met went on a half day shopping trip to Ubud with Windah, not really knowing what we were looking for, other than the vague description we gave Windah, \"you know....the blown glass thing on wood\". He found it and at a fantastic price too!My husband Paul was after wood carvings. I also wanted to go to Geneva and locate places to purchase the white stone carvings. Windah, found several places and was relentless in locating everything on our list, which evolved....and grew over the day Having only just met him, we were very confutable with Windah and felt like we were out with a good friend. He never made us feel rushed, like we were on the clock or restricted to any particular shop or location. We felt Windah looked after our best interests and could let our grad down around him. It was a relaxed, enjoyable experience and needless to say.....we came back with a car load of goodies We were so happy with Windah, we arranged a water rafting tour at the end of the day shopping. Windah out did himself. The price was great and we had a fantastic day. Windah came with us in the raft and took amazing care of our family. Amazing! We all have fond memory's of a hassle free, exciting, fun and enjoyable day.For us it's all about safety for our family, enjoying the journey and creating fond memories. Windah helped us achieve this buy insuring his part in our holiday was stress free and enjoyable. THANK YOU Windah!We would highly recommend Windah and will definitely be using his service again."

Mr Bedu makes you feel very welcome and comfortable and knows the scene. He gave us great advice for Rock Bar and had the Jimbaran scene fully scoped. His car is clean and reliable and he drives, so you'd aren't slugged with any sort of guide + driver costs. He's wonderful and we wish him loads of luck with his tour business"

I have known him for many years and have recommended all my friends and family going to Bali. Every person who has used his services has been so impressed. From couples to families, his happy personality has won them over-to the point that they then recommend him to their friends. Overwhelming the feedback I get is how reliable, trustworthy and kind he is. Just a great guy who will make your Bali experience one to remember."

Bedu is keen to share with you all about his beautiful culture & what the country has to offer. We went to the rice terraces, coffee/tea farm, volcano, 2 temples & a waterfall. He also catered the tour to whether or not we wanted to do certain things (as we didn't want to go to the monkey temple etc). He has great recommendations & happy to drop you at your next destination point. He has very good English which is helpful and a air conditioned and clean car for the trip :)"

My wife put a post up on \"Bali Bogans\" an Australian Facebook group seeking a Tour Guide and Driver for her 'Nerd Husband'. Mr.Bedu was highly recommended. I'm actually a Social Science & Drama Teacher and as such was seeking an honest look at Bali, Indonesia from a locals perspective. Through out the day I pestered Mr. Bedu with questions on culture, social issues, politics, religion and gender roles throughout our day was fantastic. His command of English, understanding of why I was asking these things and patience with my need to stop and photograph things was much appreciated. My review is written with some bias. Although it was only a one day tour and it was a professional arrangement it is hard not to become friends with Mr. Bedu. His love for his country, its people and his casual and polite manner is hard not to befriend. He know a lot of locals of course, enjoys a joke and ok me to some truly sensational places. Waterfalls, plantations, rice terraces, monkey forests, little villages, busy roads and temples and all in a few short hours. Regardless of if you are travelling alone or in a small group of 5 or 6 I have no doubt you will be satisfied with this young mans knowledge, organisation, professionalism and cleanliness. The car is well cared for, reliable and clearly a symbol of pride for him. I am certain he will not disappoint and works hard to remain flexible and yet ensure the best experience given the changeable conditions of the region. Lastly I would like share his recommendation which I will follow on my next visit. Often tourists first visit is centred around Kuta which is essentially the beach strip and 'tourist party central'. Mr. Bedu suggested that next time we look at say 3 or 4 days of the week being located in or near Ubud which is central to the island and the artisan and cultural hub of Bali. Of course there are still a lot of tourists but it's also central to Tourist ventures such as the Monkeys, Elephants, sunrise over the Volcano, ATV adventures, rafting and other such persuits where as if you are at Kuta these are an hour drive or more away. Follow up the trip with 3 or 4 days in Kuta, a much busier and touristy experience which is also close to the airport for a stress free departure. Well, as stress free as Bali traffic can be. Being close means less chance of being held up for a flight trying to get through the city. All in all a most amazing experience and a single day with Mr. Bedu was enough of a taste of Bali to secure my return in the future. I have no hesitation recommending him for day or even an extended trip. If I could make one more suggestion and that would be book him early as I have no doubt this young man will be certainly an asset who will be in high demand during the peak seasons. Well done Mr. Bedu on providing such a professional and affordable service for those which to experience the best Bali has to offer."

Having never visited Bali before, I looked to the internet and hired Mr. Bedu as our tour guide for an airport pickup and drive to Ubud, Mount Batur trek and day tour. I'm sure that I asked so many questions that I started to become annoying but he remained patient and answered all of my questions before my arrival in Bali and during our stay in Bali. During our stay in Ubud, we ended up deciding to do an additional last minute day tour with another driver to West Bali because Bedu was not available. The driver got us to the places we asked but did not take the time to explain what we were seeing or make recommendations on nearby attractions. We later learned that we had missed an important landmark on that side of the island! We may never get to see it again!In contrast, our experience with Bedu was so different. Even though our airport pickup was at 1am and our plane was delayed, he happily chatted with us all the way to Ubud and made itinerary, restaurant recommendations - all of which were spot on. On our other trips, not only did he get us to the places we were interested in, he came into temples with us and explained what we were looking at and explained the culture, which really helped us understand and appreciate what we were visiting. He also recommended a few optional stops that we took advantage of as well! By the way, I have yet to meet another Balinese person with better English skills - he is always clear when he speaks and understands you very easily. His rates were reasonable and the best value for the service you are receiving in Bali. He went above and beyond - he booked our Gili transfers for us and even called the company for us when the shuttle bus pickup was late. Thanks for everything Bedu. You made the start to our Bali honeymoon memorable. If you're ever in Vancouver, I'll take you to our whiskey bar ;). Cheers."

Even from the minute we emailed, Mr Bedu was super quick to respond, gave us advice, and we immediately felt at ease that someone would be there to pick us up from the airport as soon as we arrived (even though our cases meant he was waiting for a while!). Literally anything we needed was not a problem for Mr Bedu - before getting to our hotel we headed for a quick supermarket shop, and we chatted most of the way home (although Mr Bedu was also sensitive to our long journey and also let us nap in his comfortable car for a little while when the jet lag hit).Along with our airport transfers, we also hired Mr Bedu for a number of day tours in Bali - one to Seminyak, Bali Safari Park, and an Ubud day tour. Mr Bedu always wants you to get the best out of your time in Bali, and suggested an alternative tour to what we had selected, because he wants to share the culture of Bali with you - and we're so glad we took his advice! We went first to the rice terrace, then on to a coffee plantation, a temple, local shopping for wood carving, painting, silver making, and finally a waterfall - and throughout his explanations were fantastic. Always punctual, always happy, always fun - always our first choice - and now hopefully yours too!Thank you Mr Bedu, for making our trip to Bali - wouldn't have been the same without you!

However, if you do want to shop, these are reputable people to buy from. He chose a beautiful lunch spot for us (even with buy one get one free mixed drinks for mom ).

He can point you to the most perfect restaurants with unbelievable views and at reasonable prices. If you want to spend longer at an area then just say so and it can happen. Bedu caters for many different age groups and tour types. Bedu has lots of good information that will assist you in your dealings with the Balanese merchants to make sure you get the best outcome. He will also let you know how much most things should cost.I highly recommend Mr Bedu as a tour guide.\"Oh Mr Bedu, you did it again.\""

That was the best decision we made (besides switching to San Miguel from Bin Tang). Mr. Bedu is polite, informative, charismatic, knowledgeable, and trustworthy. When we were in Ubud, he even trusted us with one of his cellphones so that we could stay coordinated and find each other once we were done shopping.

We booked Mr Bedu for the day and were really glad we made this choice rather than the driver recommended by our hotel. His English was excellent and we were able to have great discussions on politics, religion and all the things you are not supposed to talk about, but really want to know about cultures so different from our own. While we were going round temples we saw other tourists who had just been dumped there by their guide and given no information on the rituals, and other aspects of Balinese life. What a waste of a journey. By contrast Mr Bedu was there to explain things that needed explains but didn't butt in when we didn't need him. We also did not get any sense we were being driven from one \" shopping opportunity\" to another - he took time to find out what we were interested in and took us there. He also altered the timing of our itinerary to make sure we got to the sites when the weather and visibility was at its best rather than simply following a standard route.He was very easy to contact and responded to emails very promptly"

Our trip was to Mt Batur, the rice terraces, Tirta Empul, the water fall, wood carvers, batik makers and we had lunch at a lovely restaurant.

I began to think his tour was a chance for him to get in a smoke, plus he took us to a rip off 'coffee plantation,' When we later complained that we had been suckered in and spent too much for nothing, his response was 'hey i'm only the driver.' Fair enough. 'i'm only the reviewer bud.' I had much better guides than he while in Bali."

He's lived in Bali his whole life, but his English is awesome with an Australian accent on the side! Even though it was my first time meeting Bedu, he treated me like I was a long lost friend and he was a pleasant people person! Mr. Bedu was easy to a get a hold of, his response time was very quick, and he was very punctual (or maybe its better to say he's early). Spending a whole day with him goes by very quickly. He knows a lot about Bali , so you just give him your itinerary and he'll make it happen. If you don't know what you want to do, just give him a gist and he'll take you to the best spots in Bali. I was traveling to multiple countries so the original dates I reserved with Mr.Bedu did not work out. He was very flexible with the changes I made; and even though some of the dates didn't work out anymore, he set me up with a reliable friend who was also a driver. During the time his friend drove us, he would call his friend to make sure we were getting the best experience. While communicating with him back in the states, we planned our itinerary together, because it was my first time in Bali. He helped me to group all my activities to see which activities would make the most sense and to maximize my time in Indonesia. He arranged for transport when necessary, he drove us to all the spots we wanted to see (even between transport, he would point out spots to see for a quick look). We did the whole Ubud main spots, and then we did another day of visiting beautiful beaches, he set us up with a beachfront seafood restaurant for sunset where you can ride horses. Lastly, I wanted to cross over to Gili Islands, and he made it possible in the last minute with the shuttle bus back to my hotel and everything! There were many people being turned away despite having purchased tickets from third parties, which makes me believe that he is a reliable source. Side note: Even with third party companies out of his control it seemed like he took the extra step to talk to the right people and make sure I knew what to check/look out for to ensure that we had a good experience with that company or even street vendors! When I return to Bali, I am definitely booking through Bedu Tours again!"

Mr. Bedu happily showed up and drove us around Bali despite it being a holiday. He was an excellent driver and was highly knowledgeable about the area and local traditions. Furthermore, his taste in music is impeccable :) After such a wonderful experience, I am happy to consider Mr. Bedu a friend and would strongly recommend him to any tourist in Bali."

We highly recommend Bedu's service to all newcomers to Bali, you will not regret, guaranteed!"

Bedu is like family to us and has also taken care of countless friends who have travelled to Bali. Bedu knows the \"hot spots\" as well as other great quieter areas to explore. No matter what your looking to do in Bali, Bedu can cater for your needs and desires. His English is perfect and he is more than a gentleman, always going above and beyond the call of duty. If it's an airport transfer, a full day trip or even a big group trip he will arrange the best time with lots of laughs along the way! Do yourself a favour and meet this great man, he will make you fall more in love with Bali."

I have been to Bali on 3 separate occasions and have had the pleasure of having Bedu as my driver/guide/mate for every one of them. First holiday was with my partner, second was with our kids aged 9 and 6, and the third was with mates - he is suitable for any and ALL holidays. He has amazing English, an incredible understanding of Bali and it's history and the best rates around. Bedu will go above and beyond every single time, is incredibly reliable and above all else will make your holiday in Bali the best it can be. Thanks Bedu!!!!!!"

His communication before the trip was great - always very friendly.His car is obviously his pride and joy and is immaculate. And then to arrive at Denpasar and see his happy face waiting for us was just brilliant! Bedu took us to our hotel in Ubud and told us lots about Balinese culture and gave us tips on bars, restaurants etc. We used him again on a tour of Ubud which was great - he knew all the local spots and the car journey was so much fun - we were all singing and laughing - brilliant! We then used Bedu to go back to the airport and it was like saying goodbye to an old friend. Bedu's prices are very reasonable though we always tipped. He also gave us lots of info on trips/tours we could do and how he could get them cheaper but he was never pushy. I can't wait to go back to Bali and see my new friend Mr.Bedu."

Some friends of mine suggested using Mr Bedu when we travelled to Bali in April 2015 and it was the best thing we ever did. We used him for airport and harbour pick ups and then day tours which were just superb. He is extremely knowledgeable and informative and goes out of his way to make your trip extra special and combine any additional elements that he thinks you may like. We did 2 day tours, 2 half day tours and also went with him to a night market and was even shown exactly what best to eat. He is also funny and just a genuinely nice guy. You will not regret using him for any trip you may need, no matter how short or long."

The tour was a very reasonable price, and he was incredibly knowledgable and friendly. He took us to a few different places around Ubud, and even writing this months later after traveling around Southeast Asia, it was one of the best tours I have been on.

Not only did he provide an excellent, clean, prompt and personalised service but he took the time to chat and talk with our group to help us gain a better understanding of the Balinese culture. His costs were very reasonable and we were more than happy to tip more for such great service. To top this off he let us play our Ipod and together we all sang our trips away - making a memorable few car trips. I cannot recommend Mr Bedu highly enough and would not consider using another one other than Mr Bedu for your next Bali adventure."

Someone we knew said we had to contact Komang Bedu cause he is a good guide, that was one of the best decisions we made during the holiday. Bedu is always on time, is the best priced guide, very friendly, funny and he knows all the best places. During our holiday we have booked Bedu 3 times and these days were great. When you ask him to drive you around to show you some beautiful spots like waterfalls and temples, just trust him, you will be satisfied. He even picked us up middle in the night to drive to the ocean to see dolphins and took us for lunch afterwards. He is one of the reasons i want to go back to Bali. When you want a good priced, fun and beautiful day --> book Mr Bedu!"
