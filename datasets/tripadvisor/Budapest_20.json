There is also a museum on the left side. What I found really interesting were the statues in the park next to it and this big sculpture that look like it came out of a superman movie.Behind it was a golden bridge that let to a house and church."

Do be aware that this can be a raceway for Segway driving tourists so you can get run over. But this is a beautiful sight. Also you can walk into the park behind the square where the zoo is located. We ate lunch in a charming cafe at the right corner off the square."

This large square is situated adjacent to City Park and is probably a perfect size for gatherings and meetings. It is a major square used in modern day Hungary, and it's history, and offers some superb statues of the seven chieftains of the Magyars as well as the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. It is clean, easily accessible and honestly a delight to visit. Every part is well maintained and clean and tidy and with the thermal baths and park adjacent adds to a great part of the city which is a must visit location. The four hours we spent here and in the castle in the park were great. The area has a lot to offer all visitor likes."

This majestic square is located at the end of Andrassy Avenue. By the sides of the square one can find the Museum of fine Art and the Kunsthalle. This square is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In the middle of the square there is the Millennium Monument which was done in 1929. At the top of this central pillar there is the Archangel holding the crown and the double cross of Christianity. Behind this central pillar there are two curved colonnades each with six pillars. Between these pillars are the statues of past famous Kings and other important historic figures."

Whilst there is nothing to do there, it is simply a nice area to look around and is a useful point to work out directions, since some of the tourist bus companies use it as a Hop-on, Hop-off point. Often, if you walk past Heroes Square, there are national events or unique things taking place all the time. If you want something truly beautiful and spectacular, visit Heroes Square at night, where you can get unique photo opportunities. Regardless, Heroes Square is a fantastic place to spend some time."

Easy to reach by walking from the central part of the city, approaching to the statue slowly leaves you speechless! It's a lot better to visit when the night falls, the lights make it even more beautiful than it already is! History of Hungarian people written on those statues, even if you don't have a clue what was happening in the past, this place will take your breath away. The museums on it's sides surround it, also two beautiful buildings that make the whole scene look bigger and more valuable. Even the majority of historical spots is on Buda side of the city, this one is well worth visiting! Terror house is also close so you can make half a day tour for visiting a couple of lovely spots on the Pest side. Big recommend!"

We took one instead of using the metro and got completely scammed. The taxi driver tampered with his meter and as we struggled with our young children, we didn't have time to check the 5000 note he gave us as change carefully. Later we found out that he has given us 5000 Indonesian rupiah! About 50 pence instead of the twenty over quid. Always be on your guard!"

The monument which was built originally around 1900 consists of large columns and a series of statues that commemorate Hungarian kings and leaders. The statues', horses' and chariots' monumental sizes dwarf the ordinary visitor. It's impressive and a great spot for pictures. There's not much to do besides walking around and taking pictures though. During the 1989 revolution, large crowds of people gathered here and it was the site of the reburial of Imre Nagy. The day we visited, a demonstration of some kind was expected and the square was filled with police."

There are also museums on each side of the square and a number of consulates just down the street. Quite a few people will try to sell you books, clothing, souvenirs, etc but a polite no and they leave you alone. An hour is probably plenty of time to see what you want unless the place is packed."

The area is more a rectangle plus a semi-circle. I believe, the view of the Heroes' Square would be from a balloon at the end of the Andrassy street, but this is generally not an option. Staying at the ground level, the best view remains from the end of the Andrassy street, from where you can see the monument celebrating the 1000th anniversary of the Hungarian state (in front), the building of the Museum of Fine Arts (under reconstruction, on the left) and the Mucsarnok (Kunsthalle, Art Gallery, on the right), and you do not see the contrasting buildings at the end of the street. Proceeding forward, you reach a nice park (Varosliget) with an artificial pond (good for rowing in Summer and ice-skating in Winter), the Vajdahunyad Castle, and the Budapest Zoo - really worth a visit."

Heroes Square is a large, open plaza with monuments/statues commemorating three distinct groups: the leaders of the founding tribes of Hungary, famous leaders of Hungary; and the Hungarian monument to the unknown soldier. It was definitely worthwhile to visit the square with a guide. Our guide made this much more than a collection of statues by explaining a bit of Hungarian history and the significance of the various men commemorated in the statues. Just beyond the square is a nice park with lakes and reconstructions of historical buildings in Hungary and Transylvania."

We went at night, and didn't have enough to come back in the day. In one word, Heroes' Square was breathtaking. At first we were foolish enough to think just the statues in the square were all there was to see - they're gorgeous, BUT - don't shortchange yourself, go for a walk behind the monument in the middle, and you'll see a real life Disney Castle! Over the Bridge the sights are beyond anything we expected. Seriously, this one is not to be missed. Go in the late afternoon so you can see it in the day and in the nigh, all lit up and magical."

You can take a subway, or a bus and even a tram to visit the square and the adjoining park but you can also just take a rather log but pleasant walk up the beautiful Andrassy admiring the large and once very fashionable homes on the way. In addition to the Square, the monument, and the park, there is also a Museum, a really terrific Budapest main Museum which features great special exhibitions as well as a permanent collection on view."

My comments are below.The following information is from visitbudapest.travel: \"Laid out in 1896 to mark the thousandth anniversary of Hungary, Heroes' Square (H\u0151s\u00f6k tere) is the largest and most impressive square of the city. Located at the end of Andr\u00e1ssy Avenue and next to City Park, Heroes\u2019 Square is one of the most visited sights in Budapest. Surrounded by two important buildings, Museum of Fine Arts on the left and Kunsthalle (Hall of Art) on the right, Heroes\u2019 Square is also a station of the Millennium Underground.The Millennium Monument in the middle of the square was erected to commemorate the 1000-year-old history of the Magyars. Archangel Gabriel stands on top of the center pillar, holding the holy crown and the double cross of Christianity. The seven chieftains who led the Magyar tribes to Hungary can be seen on the stand below. Statues of kings and other important historical figures stand on top of the colonnades on either side of the center pillar.When the monument was originally constructed, Hungary was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and thus the last five spaces for statues on the left of the colonnade were reserved for members of the ruling Habsburg dynasty. The Habsburg emperors were replaced with Hungarian freedom fighters when the monument was rebuilt after World War II.In 1989 a crowd of 250,000 gathered at the square for the reburial of Imre Nagy, former Prime Minister of Hungary, who was executed in 1958\"I absolutely loved the visit here, until the bus loads started arriving. I had some time to kill this morning so decided to hop on the Metro to the Square. It's really beautiful and worth the effort and so easy to get to.However what drives me insane is people's need to climb on top of monuments - so disrespectful & destructive!!!!!!! I really hope the authorities address this!!Pop into the City Park while you're there....it's just beautiful and would be excellent for a picnic"

This is very nice feature, but there should be more information on the site in form of some tourist info boxes or something.One of the most photographed places in the city.

Adult: 2300FtChild (2-14 years): 1600Ft. I am glad we did. The exhibition starts with an hour and half movie that you can watch sitting on folding chairs or sitting on the floor - we didn't watch it as it was not really about dinosaurs, it was more about bulling and the movie used personalized dinos' characters trying to create a rather boring story. After entering the exhibit we found our self in a rather dark place. They tried to create a night set I think. There were about 8 different dinosaur on display that was suppose to be interactive. All they did was occasionally they moved their mouth and tail and there was growling sound coming out from their mouth in about every 20 seconds. The figures were about 1/3 of a stated real size of the animals. They also had two mammoth species on display with a rather impressive size and a couple of other creatures from the late cretaceous time. It was hard to take a good picture is it was dark there.Exiting the exhibition there was a small dinosaur with a saddle and the children were able to ride it for a jetton that you need to buy at a rather small souvenir shop - one shelf of items but mostly catering for the other exhibition - GOAL.The chair on the dinosaur was moving up and down on the back of the rubber animal and that was it. On the other side of the dino ride there was a huge sand box set up so children were able to experience what it takes to be a paleontologist.I would recommend this place with children under 8. Time required for the visit: 20 minutes + the movie time if you are interested. Length of the movie: 1.5 hour.A Dinosaurs exhibit is from 2016. June 20 to August 22. There is an exhibit called Invisible Exhibit which is to educate the visitors about the world of the blind people. It offers either massage, dinner or vine tasting experience. Recommended for older children or adults.There is an exhibit for soccer fans called GOAL, right next to the Dinosaur place but we didn't visit that one."

Fascinating to see how Hungarians liked to view themselves 120 years ago, at the height of the country's power, pre-WWI: their ancestors had not just moved there 1000 years earlier - no, they had CONQUERED. Look at the wild horsemen at the centre of the square: each one of them could give you the shivers. There is plenty more to see around Hero's Square; this just happened to catch my attention (i am a lover of horses)."

Located at the end of Andrassy Street by Varosliget/City Park, Heroes Square is too far to walk from St. Stephen's Cathedral, but is certainly accessible by tram and metro. The square was very spacious even though the monuments on it were huge. The square was built in 1896 to commemorate 1000 years since the Magyars settled in Hungary and had been used as a parade area during communist times.In the center of the square was the Millennium Memorial. It consisted of a very tall fluted column on top of which a bronze statue of a winged Gabriel held St. Stephen's crown and the double cross of Christianity. What caught my eye, however, was the dais surrounding this column. It had bronze statues of the 7 Magyar tribal leaders sitting on horses. These rugged looking men were responsible for the Magyars settling in Hungary 1000 years ago. On either side of this column were 2 colonaded semi-circular structures on which stood 14 bronze statues of important people in the history of Hungary - 7 on each side. Underneath each was a plaque with the name of the person represented and a scene from his life, done in relief. It was interesting to see what all these important people in Hungary's history like St. Stephen or Matthias looked like. While 7 of the statues were kings of Hungary, the 7 others were men who were associated with important battles/victories. On the ends of the colonaded structure were 4 statues. Two of them were the common ones often seen on triumphal arches - 2 horses drawing a chariot. The male figures in each represented war and peace. The other two had groups of figures which represented wealth coming from work and knowledge. All of these bronze figures had aged to a lovely turquoise patina which contrasted impressively with their beige marble surrounds. This memorial was very interesting to look at as there were so many details to examine. I also liked that Hungary celebrated these people who had contributed in different ways, but all significantly, in making Hungary a country. I was really impressed with this tribute and the skill it took to cast these figures.  In front of this huge memorial, was a memorial stone or cenotaph for all of Hungary's other unknown war heroes. It was surrounded by an ornamental chain barrier. We just had about a 15 minute stop here on our city bus tour. The guide did point out 2 buildings on the side of the square - the Museum of Fine Arts and the Kunsthalle/Hall of Arts should we wish to return as well as the City Park behind which looked like a great place for a stroll under the shady trees."

If you want to know more about the history go to the national museum. Besides, it is a huge open space, so on a sunny day it is most unrecommended. I can understand that for Hungarians it is a place of huge symbolism. But for the visitor it offers little.

We came by this place for a photo-stop visit after visiting the Mattias Church and the Fisherman's Bastion as part of our city walking tour (do refer to my earlier reviews on these places here too). It was already late morning and sunny but there were lots of visitors there as well.The monument from afar looked great and magnificent. Each of the statue there has a story behind and our guide explained to us in details about the historical background of this monument. It does invoke some sense of patriotic feeling.Unfortunately during our visit, we were not allowed to enter the square as the area was fenced off as there was a rehearsal for some kinds of national or anniversary event on gong as we saw performers, horse riders taking up their positions and roles intensely. On the other side, site workers were busy wiring up the lightings and arranging the seats. As such, we could only stand from a distance to watch it and taking photos and of course could not see the entire square from where we stood.We trust the night view here will be more beautiful and grander due to the special lightings that add splendor to the status and monument!Fortunately, our coach driver later drove us past the square 2 times to allow us to see the entire square (though we were on the coach and only seeing faintly but its better than nothing). It was then we realized how magnificent and grand the place was and the fine work that were done in setting up this place during those days!From here, the Kunsthalle (Contemporary Art Museum) is just directly opposite where one could visit and just next to it, are an open market with several makeshift stalls selling food and drinks, candies and souvenirs etc, in front of the car park. The entire area is full of vibrancy and energy and one can simply spend hours exploring the place to understand more about Hungary culture, arts, history and the lifestyle of the people!Highly recommended."

Our guide from the Viking River Cruises explained why this was so important to his people, but what I loved was the sculpture. Gy\u00f6rgy Zala became my new favorite sculptor. Had I not been tied down to the tour, I would have loved to explore the wonderful park that abuts the beautiful square, but that wasn't on the itinerary. If you keep your eyes on the monuments you'll be fine, but if you allow one of the strolling vendors to catch your eye you'll be sorry. There were a lot of women wandering around hawking sweaters that looked very \"Made in China\" to me, but they won't bother you if you use the right body language. I noticed several women on our boat ended up with one of these sweaters and I discovered they'd made the mistake of engaging the vendors in conversation and they were pretty much forced to buy the sweater to get away. If sculpture or history is important to you, include a visit to this site, but it won't take long to appreciate it and move on. We happened to be there in the city for some sort of special celebration and that's how we were treated to the fun sculpture which spells out Budapest."

The square is vast in scale, and feels like a huge area of flat tarmac with big roads on three sides, a (nice) park at the back, a couple of ornate museum type buildings on the flanks and some statues and a column in the middle. The latter is very Nelson's column style, only smaller.The square is grand but without that much of a wow factor and the statues are good but not amazing. I'm sure it means a lot more if you are Hungarian and/or understand the cultural significance of the place and the statues. But other than a quick look, there's not much to do in the square, and no seats or caf\u00e9s from which to take it in.You could get the metro or a taxi here or walk a mile or so up Andrassy. I normally like squares and cultural monuments, but this felt like an effort to reach it for a 10 minute look around. Probably better to double a visit up with a trip to the City Park or its palatial thermal baths."

It is located at the Northeastern end of Andrassy Avenue, one of the most fashionable and beautiful avenues in Budapest. on the opposite end of the square starts the major city park (Varosliget), which deserves a visit on its own merit. On the Northwestern side of the square is the Museum of Fine Arts and on the opposite side, the Palace of Art. The Museum of Fine Arts houses an excellent collection of European masters, including Durer, Goya, Rembrandt, Rubens and TItian. Other wings of the museum offer collections from Antiquity through the Middle Ages and Renaissance until the recent past. The Palace of Art is mostly an exhibition hall and it si frequently used for contemporary or visiting exhibitions. Both museums were built on the model of classical Greek architecture, with massive colonnades in the front, including elaborately carved capitels at the top of each column. The Museum of Fine Arts deserves at least a couple of hours; the Palace of Arts is certainly worth visiting, although the required time will depend on the collection being exhibited. In the center of Heroes' Square is an imposing monument that reflects much of Hungarian history in the center, there is a large column and on top, you will see the archangel Gabriel holding St. Stephen's crown. St. Stephen was the first king of Hungary and converted the country to Christianity. At the base of the column there are equestrian bronze sculptures representing the 7 tribal leaders or chieftains who conquered and occupied the Carpatian basin and thus settled the territory that currently includes Hungary and parts of Slovakia, Romania, the Ukraine and Serbia. Surrounding the central column there are two semicircular colonnades, each with seven statues: on the left colonnade (arriving from Andrassy avenue) are seven if the most prominent Hungarian kings; on the right, Hungarians who had a major role in Hungarian history, regardless of the place in society. The square is easy to access by subway or bus, although on a nice day, walking down Andrassy avenue makes for a lovely stroll. Around the square, there are multiple restaurants, including Gundel, that historically used to be one of the top restaurant in Budapest. The Square, statues, the surrounding museums and city park will occupy a good part of a day."

No entry fee applies as this site is a square that's surrounded on on all sides by a busy road. Take extra care when crossing the road if you have mobility problems and please wait for the 'green' man to appear when using the lights.I try to not be intolerant of others if I can help it, as I may very well annoy people but was disappointed to see people climbing over the statues for their colleagues to take pictures. Would be good if guards were present to minimise people climbing all over monuments. If you have kids with you then it's worth visiting the nearby small boating lake where you can hire pedalos that are formed in the shape of cars. You can also head towards the huge spa baths which are nearby too. Additional Info - - - We purchased a Budapest pass which allowed us free access to a spa bath in Buda; which was frequented more by locals than tourists.We signed the back of the pass and therefore could hop and off the trolley bus, the tram, and the metro. We were stopped several times by transport guards and were asked to produce our travel ticket/pass. I understand that if people buy a one or two day travel pass is that they must be validated by a ticket machine prior to travelling. If you do not validate your ticket prior to travelling, you will incur an on the spot fine for approximately \u20ac30.... You have been warned. I bought a 3 day Budapest pass for 9900 HUF which equates to \u00a38.33 a day and once it's signed; it's validated for the ticket/pass duration. I could hop on and off the trolley bus, tram, metro as I pleased and I also had some attractions thrown in as free and discount for other attractions too."

Behind that are two colonnades with statues of famous Hungarian leaders that are being honored. I believe this was completed and opened around 1896.

Even that it is located away from the center of Budapest, we (a couple) recommend you to come here by using yellow metro line or even by walking through the whole Andrassy street. In general, this square is quite empty during day. However, it might get very crowdy during national holidays. Horse races and other events take place on this square from time to time.Also, this square might be your starting point of exploration of nearby sights like Museum of Fine Arts, Palace of Art, Budapest Zoo, Circus, Szechenyi baths and many other places as well.All in all, come here to explore another important part of Budapest!"

Having traveled all over the world and visited many squares in many cities, I can say that HS takes a back seat to none.Flanked by two interesting and imposing museums on either end and with the City Park as a backdrop, it has an impressive appearance. Knowing something of Hungarian history as one studies the 7 ancient chiefs of the tribe that migrated from the Urals over 800 years (beginning with Attila and settling in the now Budapest by Arpad. Contrast that with the rows of Soviet tanks which occupied it during the 1956 uprising, and you get a bit of a chill up your spine. In the rear of the square are famous Hungarian kings and leaders beginning with the founder of the country, King St Stephen to a hero of the 1848 revolution, Kossuth Lajos.It's a great place for photo-ops, followed by a visit to the museums, Szenchenyi Bath, the zoo or City Park. Excellent restaurants are in the vicinity."

Heroes' Square is almost at the end of the subway line, but if you're going to the Szechenyi Baths (which you should), you can easily go to the incredibly impressive Heroes' Square, too.The Square used to be a big meeting a rally point for communist rallies, and it's easy to see why. The Square is enormous. There are huge monuments, pillars and columns in the Square, too, and it's crazy to think about how many people can fit in it when there's something going on. It's not too crowded on the average day in Budapest now, so it's easy to get some space and be able to see what you want to see without pushing people out of the way.The Square isn't somewhere you are going to spend a lot of time, but there's a subway station right by the Square, so you can easily see it without having to walk a long way."

Sure, it is big and sure it has the statues atop the facade on one side. Yes, the sculptures are very well executed. What I found more interesting are the small, intimate cathedral just across the river (which, by the way, is converted into a large open air skating rink in winter) and the main arterial which runs to the square, as are the buildings surrounding the square. Apart from all the different buildings on this route, the very visible holes in the walls, a sign of wartime fighting, I found more interesting. So for me the square was more the end destination rather than the focal point."

We visited or traveled by the square nearly every day as it was centrally located between various parks, attractions, baths, and museums. We did not experience any unwanted peddlers whom I expected to be there preying on tourists. Instead visitors are given free reign to enjoy the art and architecture in their own time.If you are in Budapest, make it a point to visit this area!"

It will take about an hour to stroll around everything and take it all in. There is no charge and it is really pleasant just to soak up the beauty and the architecture.

Nice outdoor ice skating arena is nearby, my only complaint is that there are no public toilets that I could find. Not saying that there are none but I could not find any. Definitely should visit when in Budapest."

Or, if there were placards with the information below each in several languages, including English, it would have been helpful.Had some kind of information been readily available, the rating would be a 5.I would hope that citizens of Hungary would know all of the heroes and their claim to fame.Despite the criticism, it is a large area and beautiful structure...very well done.

At the back of the Millenium monument is the statue complex that has monuments of Hungarian National leaders,the seven chieftains of the Magyars and also the tomb of the unknown soldier.This square has had a important role in Hungarian history and many political events have been held on this large ground..During my tour there was a huge police parade in progress at the square and on inquiry learnt that it was a parade of the induction of new Hungarian police into the police force.Vajdahunyad castle,Szechenyi thermal baths ,Budapest zoo and the Capital circus are within walking distance from Hero's square."

Visit daytime and nighttime if you can. Approaching it from Andr\u00e1ssy \u00dat is perfect since this avenue is on the UNESCO's World Heritage site. The square is also easily accessible by underground (station H\u00f6s\u00f6k Tere). Why not also stroll around in the City Park or visit the zoo, circus, and the amusement parc or have a relaxing swim at the lovely Sz\u00e8cheny Baths since they're located nearby? Or the museum of Transport maybe?"

A methodical flow of mass transit will get you there and back at minimal cost. If you are going to tour Budapest I would suggest the weekly pass at around $20 US, it covers the metro, bus, and streetcar inside the city. Once you are at Heroes' Square Hungarian historical and cultural masterpieces are literally surrounding you, excellent restaurants also. Venture out a bit and chat the locals up for dining tips. Most of the dining in the city is very competitive, just meander back toward the Danube on Andrassy Ut and make your choice. You could spend a full week on the surrounding blocks of Heroes' Square and continue to discover wonderful attractions"

We visited the square 19-20 September when they were holding the National gallop. Apparently they wanted to hold an event that would unite the city and country folk and decided that horses and horse racing were the common denominator. So for the past four years, once a year, the square is closed off to local traffic and a sand race track is laid around the monuments. Horse teams come from all over the country to compete dressed in all their fine racing colours and uniforms.........we really did see Hussars racing round the course! Around the surrounds there is also a medieval Fayre with tradional foods and craft stalls. It really does have a carnival atmosphere and the main road leading back into town (approx 3 km) is completely encompassed on both sides by various stalls and places to eat or drink!!Szechenyi spa and baths are nearby so you can combine the two in one visit"

I understand that it was designed in 1898 to commemorate the 1000th anniversary of Hungary. It is quite impressive and definitely worth a visit. The millennium monument in the center of the square commemorates the Magyar tribes with Archangel Gabriel on top of the center pillar. The statues on the monument are well done and detailed. The square is surrounded by several museums that we did not have time to visit.There were many very aggressive women selling Hungarian shirts/blouses. We were told by our tour guide that although the clothing sold there is inexpensive, it is poorly made and will not hold up. Stick to legitimate vendors."

This square has the tomb of the unknown soldier.On either side of the square are the Hall of Art and the Museum of Fine Arts - both are beautiful buildings.There are two colonnades. The left one has a statue of a man with a scythe and a woman sowing some seeds - and these represent labour and wealth. There is also a statue of a man riding a chariot using a snake as a whip which represents war. On the right colonnade is a woman in a chariot holding a palm leaf which represents peace. On the top of the colonnade is a statue of a man holding a little golden statue and a woman with a palm leaf which represents knowledge and glory.At night, the heroes square is lit up and it is a sight to behold.

From the city centre, I would recommend the metro from Deac Ferenc to Hosok Tere rather than walking up Andrassy - after walking the distance twice in one evening it does take a long time and gets quite exhausting. Visiting in the middle of the day is probably the best for well-lit photos, but if your camera is good in the dark I would certainly recommend visiting at night. When one visits later, the crowds are all but gone and the statue is lit up until about 01:00 just like St Istvan's Cathedral down the other end of Andrassy. In summer months, the square gets swelteringly hot too, so visiting early or late is preferable for this reason as well as to miss the crowds. One could really, however, do with more information around the square about the monument. As it is, one needs to go online and do all the research beforehand or afterwards - a placque or two in the square with some basic facts would certainly not go amiss."

What should be a wonderful review is marred by all of the idiots that climb the monuments in Heroes' Square. If you are one of them, you should be ashamed of yourself. And if you think it is OK, you should re-evaluate your position.Is this what the people of Budapest, let along Hungary, had in mind when they built this incredible square? When I first visited it about 6 years ago it was a solemn place that recognized and respected Hungary's heritage. But when I visited it 3 weeks ago every selfie-craving idiot dolt was using it as a \"Jungle Jim\". I would have liked to have gotten at least a couple pictures of its incredible statues ... but unless the statues were 36 meters above the square, that was not going to happen.I beg the people of Hungary to immediately put up signs requiring that visitors stay off the monuments. And if they do not the violators should be fined and/or put into jail. What has common sense and respect come to? I don't know for sure but I'm willing to bet that anyone that climbed up on the Lincoln statue at the Lincoln Memorial would be immediately removed. And at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier I would bet that the guard would unceremoniously \"take them out\".Heroes' Square is a solid 5 in my book. But they need to address a societal issue as it relates to all of the disrespectful idiots that are ruining it."

It was built in 1895 to commemorate the 1000th anniversary of the arrival of the seven Magyar chieftains to the Carpathian Basin. It was completed in 1929. To get there you can take the Millennium Underground (M1) to Nosok tere (Heroes' Square).In the middle of the square sits a 36 meter Corinthian column with a statue of the Archangel Gabriel resting on top. Gabriel is a symbol of the Roman Catholic church as he holds the holy crown and cross of Christianity. Below on a pedestal surrounding the column are the seven Magyar chieftains. Arpad (9th-10th) century is prominent being center forward. His descendants formed the royal Hungarian dynasty. Each side of the column is flanked by a colonnade. On top of the colonnade s are four statues depicting (Peace) female in a chariot holding a palm frond, (Glory & Knowledge) man holding a golden statue and woman with a palm frond, (Labor & Wealth) man with a scythe & woman sowing seed and (War) man riding a chariot with a snake whip. Between the columns of the colonnade are 14 statues of the most prominent figures in Hungarian history. King Stephen I, the first king of Hungary is among the 14 represented. There is a relief under each of the 14 figures which depicts an important event in each of their lives. King Stephen shows him recieving the crown from the Pope's emissary. The memorial to the Unknown Soldier can also be found here. Surrounding the square is the City Park, The Museum of Fine Arts and the Art Gallery. Nearby is the city Zoo."

The only down sides are that there is no shelter, so on a hot day, or a cold and rainy one, it would be uncomfortable to stand around viewing the statues. The other down side is that it is in a very remote part of Budapest, far from almost everything else, so if you are staying in the main part, it would be either a long trek, or you would have to try to figure out the public bus or tram service (or the tour bus!)

They tell the entire history of a christian European state. The statues themselves are beautiful too: in the middle the leaders of the 7 tribes who led the folk to the Carpathian Basin, with archangel Gabriel at the top of the column, who handed over the crown (believed: gift of God) to our first king St. Stephan, and around in the left wing the most important kings of Hungary, in the right wing the important Hungarian leaders. The Museum of fine arts and the Art exhibition hall are well managed houses with internationally famous artworks. they (opposite to each others) close the square very harmonically ."

In the middle is a massive stone column with an angel on top spreading his wings.While it is all certainly huge and visible from far away, it is quite honestly not a whole lot to look at. We were planning to visit the museums on both sides, but everything was shut and looked rather uninviting.Lots of tourists taking selfies or attempting to take \"that special shot\", but of course not something that hasn't already been photographed a gazillion times before. A lot of cars, buses and beer bicycle vehicles. All pretty awesome, but also a bit depressing as it remonds of a long gone dream of a grand and rich Hungary. The square is not particularly worth visiting on its own, unless paired with a visit at the nearby park area.To be honest, I found the derelict Pest neighborhood with those once georgeous buildings totally worn down to almost ruins much more interesting to check out."

We enjoyed taking in the culture of Budapest but didn't cover Heroes' Square via any of the official walking tours of the city because it's off the beaten track compared to the more central attractions. As a result, we didn't appreciate its significance as much when we first visited, as there isn't a great deal of tourist information at the site itself - though it does lend itself as a very eye-catching photo opportunity as a rare expanse of open space in quite a densely built up city.The best chance to take in the site is part of a trip to the wonderful Szczesny Baths. They're just the other side of the river, which you can either cross 'the long way round' via a bridge, or take the more exhilarating option of crossing it via the stepping stones that sit just above water height. Not for the feint hearted, and best undertaken if you've not got your valuables in your pocket in case you fall in!"

I had no idea who half the heroes were and it takes a good bit of time to track down their names in our guide books, so we just basked in the presence of some finely sculpted works of fierce looking men. After a while, too many heroic statues can get boring, so we stopped into some of the fine museums surrounding the square and indulged in some intimate tete-a-tete with Hungary's fine artists."

With one year delay it started in 1896 and was completed in 1929. The monument designed by architect Albert Schichedanz took the 1st prize at the 1900 World Exhibition in Paris. The sculptures were designed by Zala Gy\u00f6rgy. The column in the centre is 36 m high and on the top Archangel Gabriel holds the holy crown of St.Istvan (Stephen) and the apostolic double cross. According to the legend St.Istvan, Hungary's 1st king, saw in his dreams the Archangel offering him the crown of the country. At the base of the column the statues of the 7 Hungarian chieftains led by \u00c1rp\u00e1d, considered the founder of the Hungarian nation. There are 2 colonnades with Corinthian columns and the statues of various historical personalities of Hungary. In front of the the column, a cenotaph, a Monument of National Heroes or Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. At one corner of the square the impressive 1895 building of M\u0171csarnok ( Hall of Art) and to the opposite side, the Museum of Fine Arts. A lot of events take place in this square.

This expansive square lies at one end of Andrassy ut and forms part of the area that is included in the UNESCO list of Word Heritage Sites. Completed in 1900, the square's most prominent feature is a central column bearing a bronze statue of the Archangel Gabriel holding the crown of St Stephen aloft. At the base of the column are equestrian statues of the seven lords who were responsible for bringing the Hungarian people into the area the country roughly occupies today. In front of the column is a cenotaph that pays tribute to the people who gave their lives to Hungary. Contrary to popular belief, no one's actually buried there. Behind the column and expanding outwards in the form of a semi circle are two colonnades bearing the figures of fourteen historic individuals whose achievements for Hungary between the 15th and 19th centuries are shown in the panels underneath each figure. Unfortunately, there is no explanation of what those achievements are. So, unless you've studied Hungarian history, read up beforehand, or have a travel guide with you, it may be difficult to appreciate the significance of the panels. Overall, it's a nice place to spend some time but be aware that there is no shelter so it can be baking hot or horribly exposed to rain or snow."

The Hunyadi castle in Hunedoara (Transylvania) is still one of the nicest in Romania and a big touristic attraction.Near the Heroes' Square are situated some other interesting places to visit, like the Zoo, the contemporary art museum, the Museum of Fine Arts and Vajdahunyad Castle.You can get there by public transport, with a bus from the hop-on hop-off tours or by car (you will not have brig problems with finding a parking place)."

Many tourists arrive here by metro, an attraction in itself: the M1 metro line that stops at Heroes' Square is one of the world's oldest (it opened in 1896) and has even been declared a World Heritage Site. Both Heroes' Square and V\u00e1rosliget, the adjoining city park, were created at the end of the nineteenth century to commemorate the thousandth anniversary of the Magyar conquest of Hungary in 895. Since many of the attractions weren't ready in time the festivities were held one year late, in 1896. The square only received its current name in 1932, three years after the completion of the Millennium Monument.Since its creation Heroes' Square has been the site of numerous special events, including many Socialist holiday celebrations staged during the country's Communist era. In 1989 it was the site of the ceremonial reburial of Imre Nagy, leader of the uprising against the Soviet occupation in 1956.Millennium MonumentAt the center of Heroes' Square stands the Millennium Monument, designed in 1894 by Albert Schickedanz and completed thirty-five years later. The many statues were designed by Gy\u00f6rgy Zala.Soaring above Heroes' Square is the Millennium Column, the focal point of the Millennium Monument. The column is topped with a statue of the archangel Gabriel. Behind the column is a semicircular colonnade with statues of famous men who made their mark on Hungarian history. Statues atop the colonnades symbolize War, Peace, Work and Welfare, and Knowledge and Glory. Around the base of the monument are a number of equestrian statues honoring the seven chieftains of the Hungarian tribes who, led by \u00c1rp\u00e1d, conquered the area now known as Hungary."

What I liked is that the statues have changed over the years to reflect the current view of what is a hero. The \"heroes' from the communist era have been removed and moved out of town to Memento Park, and replaced with more recent heroes. Worth a visit if you are in the neighborhood, but don't plan a long time for your visit."

This historical site was built at the turn of the 20th century (1900) as a millennium monument to commemorate the Hungarian kingdom which started by the Arpad Dynasty in the year 896. One can\u2019t disregard the time mismanagement of this project which should have started early enough to be completed by 1896 and NOT 1900, but then again who\u2019s counting. This spectacular site is absolutely gratis to the public and it\u2019s easily accessible by the public transportation, but you ought to visit the site in a sunny to avoid penurious photo experience. Here are some high level description of the site: In the front of the monument is the ornamental chained cenotaph dedicated to the patriotic individuals who fought and died for the independence of Hungary. There are statues of the leaders of the seven Hungarian tribes that formed Hungary in the 9th century. There are two colonnades each with seven statues of Hungarian historical figures such as King Stephen I, the king Bella IV, general Matthias Corvinus and so on. Topping the outer edge of the left colonnade is a statue of a man with a scythe and a woman sowing seed, representing Labor and Wealth. At the inner top edge of the left colonnade is a male figure driving a chariot using a snake as a whip representing War. On the facing end of the right colonnade is a female figure in a chariot holding a palm frond representing Peace. In the corresponding position on the top of right colonnade is a statue of a man holding a little golden statue and a woman with a palm frond representing Knowledge and Glory. Directly behind the cenotaph is a column topped by a statue of the archangel Gabriel. In his right hand, the angel is holding the crown of St. Stephan, the first king of Hungary, in his left hand the angel holds a two barred apostolic cross, a symbol awarded to St Stephan by the pope in recognition of his effort to convert Hungary to Christianity. Behind the cenotaph within the decorative chain, is a flat bronze plate which marks the site of artesian well whose drilling was completed in 1878. The well provides water for the Sz\u00e9chenyi baths behind the monument and the Dag\u00e1ly baths. The well is 971 meter deep and produces 831 liters of water per minute at 74 degrees Celsius."

There are two good museums on either side of the square. The statues are all very impressive but you'd need a good guide to talk through the history and significance, because otherwise you'd have no idea who these people were, and why they are commemorated here. The square itself is sparse, there is not much happening here apart from tourists taking pictures. It lacks the hustle and bustle of a city centre because geographically it is located further out from the main tourist hot spots, so you dont get that feel of being in the centre of things. There is nowhere decent to have food - the only places I could find were the small cafes on the porch of the two museums - overpriced and limited choice of sandwiches. There was no ambiance either to sit and have a nice beer etc, as from the porches the square's statues seem too distant and the views are spoilt by the traffic going around it.

The statues along the colonnade at the back are notable Hungarian monarchs, starting with Stephen the First at the far left. The square was built when the city celebrated it's 1000th year since being founded, in 1896. The column in the middle is the Millennium Memorial. Angel Gabriel sits at the top while seven Magyar chieftains decorate the base. H\u0151s\u00f6k tere metro station opens direct onto the square.

The nearby park is great, and on the square you can also rent out Beer-bikes (for those who look for a bit more fun).The main attraction is the Millennium Memorial. The base is characterised by the Seven Chieftains of the Magyars (who were first noted by Anonymus, who coincidently has his statue in the park nearby). The back of the monument is made up of two colonnades, each with seven statues representing Hungarian historical figures.On the left is the Museum of Fine Arts and on the right is the Hall of Art. It goes onto Andr\u00e1ssy Avenue which has two buildings looking at the square \u2014 one is residential and the other one is the embassy of Serbia. The attraction is definitely a must-see in Budapest."

Heroes' Square is one the major squares in Budapest, Hungary, noted for its iconic statue complex featuring the Seven Chieftains of the Magyars and other important national leaders, as well as the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. The square lies at the outbound end of Andr\u00e1ssy Avenue next to City Park (V\u00e1rosliget). It hosts the Museum of Fine Arts and the Palace of Arts. The square has played an important part in contemporary Hungarian history and has been a host to many political events, such as the reburial of Imre Nagy (Communist politician executed for treason in 1958) in 1989. The Millenium Moment which is a well known landmark can also be found here. There is more than adequate parking adjacent to the square, just a short walk away."

The plan was to enjoy that Avenue and walk to the Heroes' Square and then to end my day in Sz\u00e9chenyi Thermal Bath. But after the Opera the avenue was boring to me (I'm in a budget and this was full of shops I don't visit), so I decided to use subway in there for the first time. There was a guy, I asked can I buy ticket from him and he pointed to a little cabin but said that also from him too, so I bought a ticket from him - coming back and in my other subway-trips other men never sold a ticket, but everyone bought it from the cabin. So - I went to the thermal bath and after that, in the evening, I walked to the Heroes' Square. There were few tourists and one couple who was roller skating. It was calm and beautiful in there. It's nice that they have a whole square to the people they think as heroes and all of their statues there.If you have time and you are there for a culture, then I recommend to make a day-trip in that area - there are two museums (both side of the square, unfortunately I didn't get to visit those) and a thermal spa.

We use sir Rick's of Steve...wonderful tour guide. There is no posted information for the average tourist. I did appreciate the numerous amounts of school kids here on a field trip. Talking with a teacher here, before they can enjoy the zoo, they must learn, by use of these immense statues, the history of their country. As an educator, I must say this is impressive. I wish I could have been taught history like this...Anyway, enjoy yourself here. Visit the Transylvanian castle behind the statues or at least get a few photos.

A glance confirms that Heroes\u2019 Square is the largest of Budapest\u2019s squares, but sheer expanse doesn\u2019t compensate for scarcity of visual interest. The two large public buildings flanking the space are handsome, but not exceptional. It is the Millennium Monument that makes this square a destination rather than a drive-by, so that is where tourists converge, and that is where their cameras are aimed."

If you choose to walk up Andrassy blvd. towards Heroes' square you have the experience of it raising in all its glory to meet you. At night the square is beautifully illuminated. You don't need a lot of time to see it, twenty minutes at most, but you will always remember the sight."

There were tourists, protestors (they wanted their mortgages forgiven) and locals out for a walk on a beautiful day. What is nice about the Square, besides the few minutes of sniffing about you should so, is its location. It is the gateway to City Park, a stopover on the way to the great Szechenyi Baths, there is an underground metro stop right there, the Fine Arts Museum is right there, a Modern Art Museum is there, and you can walk to see several other memorials or grab lunch at a somewhat over priced (for Budapest, cheap anywhere else), somewhat mediocre tourist restaurant with a nice outdoor cafe. If you have time, plan at least half a day, take the tram or Metro to the Oktagon, go the one of the best museums anywhere, The House of Terror, then go to Heroes Square, walk though the park or get on the subway and go to the baths. A perfect day."

It's a little out of the way from the main part of the city but you can take the metro to get quite near to it and then it's a straight walk to the square. It doesn't take long to look at the statues (which are great for posing with), so once you're done you can hit up the museums located right next to the square or the Castle right behind it. Worth the trip if you need to fill in an afternoon in Budapest."

I can only imagine the significance of the place for the Hungarian people. During our visit, the city of Budapest was preparing for the memorial day of October 23rd uprising and many of the festivities took place on the Heroes Square."

Around the colonnade to the rear are more present day heroes of the region. What I don't get is this (and this is not exclusive to Budapest: why is graffiti tolerated? This is the Magyar equivalent to say, Wellington Arch, or the Arc D' Triomphe, yet the beauty and significance is sullied by crude attempts to display \"teen culture.\" I just don't get it. You want to paint up the sound barriers along the train tracks, knock your socks off. Otherwise, let your heroes be heroes and show them the respect they richly deserve. And, I digress......

Yet another structure built in the late 1800s in honor of Hungary's 1000 year anniversary celebration. It's obvious that the country was doing alright for itself in the late 19th century, as there were many beautiful structures and attractions built during that time which we can still appreciate today. This one is fairly easy to get to as all you have to do is go east on Andrassy korut or go east on the Metro 1 line. It is definitely a bit of a walk from the Danube/city center, especially during cold or inclement weather,  This place is an essential stop for any visitor wanting to put faces to some of the names that are most revered in Hungary. It would pay to know a bit about the history of Hungary before going, or finding an online audio-tour, or just doing a little research on the people whose statues are on display. The surrounding area contains Vajdahunyad castle, City Park (Varosliget), Szechenyi Thermal Bath, and during the winter the lake in between Heroes Sq and Valdahunyad castle turns into one of Europe's largest open-air skating rinks. For Michael Jackson fans, this area might also be familiar from his music video \"History\" ( http://youtu.be/ybPQ4UpLncA ) as it was shot primarily at Heroes' Square and with the help of some computer graphics, was made to look quadruple it's size."

Our idea was to take the subway from here into town, but this idea was dead before we started. We didn't yet have any Hungarian money, so we figured we could pay for tickets with our bank our creditcards. Normally this would have worked, but the machines for this were broken. When we went to ask one of the subway-employees about nearby ATMs they didn't understand us or couldn't explain where to find one.

Awesome statues that evoke the power and prestige of former empires. Easily reached via the Metro system which cost approx \u00a31 per single ticket... ( I think... the Forin is a hard currency to get your head around.... my mind anyway.) On either side are two galleries, one featuring classic art, the other showing contemporary artwork. A great place to visit. Sadly when we were there a dozen or so young men peddled into the square on a contraption known as the beer bus, I think.... they then started acting like complete morons, even urinating openly in front of woman and children visitors to the square. My dismay when I heard their English accents cannot be put into words. The guide on our tour bus said, \"every nation has its national traits.... this is the English way of doing things. Mortified!"

Ok, a few of the previous Habsburgs were replaced after the WWI, but most of them are the same as they were planned for the millennium in 1896.This is exactly a place where you should not go by hophop kind of tours... Take your guide (book or person) and get closer to them, let them reveal their stories to You.It can be fun with children to watch the horses, learn the names of the 7 leaders (\u00c1rp\u00e1d, El\u0151d, Ond, Kond, Tas, Huba, T\u00f6h\u00f6t\u00f6m:)) or find out the main deeds of the kings in the semicircles by the subjects around them... as it is NOT audiovisual&interactive, pepole have to use \"old type\" of sightseeing. If you are not really for history, just go through the square to visit the City park, and for photographers I definitely recommend to return at night... it is worth visiting to learn about the history and culture of Hungary.Once you are there you can visit the Museum of Fine Arts for really good paintings and various temporary exchibition, with good cafe and bathroom possibility."

That might be an option doing it in one trip if you are an art lover."

For Hungary's 1000th anniversary (in 1896), the city of Budapest decided to build palatial monuments to show essence of the countries history, and look to the future.Heroes square is one of those monuments built in the Budapest city park (the park was also built for the 1896 celebrations).The statues display the Kings of Hungary, as well in the center the 7 Vez\u00e9r that brought the Magyars to the Carpathian basin to settle... now modern day Hungary.In the central landing of the monument is also the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.The square is facing southwest, directly looking onto Andr\u00e1ssy Street towards the center of Budapest.Parking is limited, and so the best way to get to the monument is perhaps a trip on the F\u00f6ldalatti (M1 subway). The F\u00f6ldalatti was the first underground subway in continental Europe, also built for the 1896 Millennium celebrations.(...of course it has since been updated and maintained to modern standards).In the city park, you will also find a man-made lake surrounding a replica castle displaying differing architectural styles (Vajdahunyad V\u00e1r, now the agricultural museum). On the lake boat rentals are available in the summer and ice skating in the winter.There are many other attractions in the city park, so plan your day for walking, and make sure your memory cards have space to take a lot of pictures.This sight is breathtaking!"

After a wonderful meal at the nearby Paprika Vend\u00e9gl\u0151 \u00c9tterem, our family took a nice evening stroll to Heroes Square in Budapest. This is one of the major outdoor areas in the city, and the history that is depicted here is amazing. Located at the intersection of Andr\u00e1ssy Avenue and D\u00f3zsa Gy\u00f6rgy Way, the square itself is bordered by two important and imposing buildings. The Hall of Art [aka the Palace of Art] is a museum of contemporary art, and the Museum of Fine Art [Sz\u00e9pm\u0171v\u00e9szeti M\u00fazeum] houses over 100.000 objects in the areas of Ancient Egypt art, classical antiquities, Old Masters\u2019 paintings, early sculpture, drawings and prints, and art produced after 1800. Also bordering the square is the Serbian embassy, as well as a private residence. The City Park also skirts the square. If you have plenty of time, visit both of the museums, and also take a leisurely walk through the park...they\u2019re all worth a visit!!At the center of the square is the famous Millennium Memorial, which features a tall column with a statue of the Archangel Gabriel on top, holding the Hungarian Holy Crown. At the base of the column are statues of the seven chieftains of the tribes that established Hungary as a state in the 9th century. Their leader, King \u00c1rp\u00e1d, is considered the founder of the Hungarian nation. The statues are imposing figures on their horses.The other statues found in two identical colonnades are of famous people in Hungarian history. Each colonnade is topped with bronze statues that symbolize war and peace, labor and wealth, and knowledge and glory. This historic Hungarian square is awesome in the daytime, and is even more majestic under the lights at night!"

The statues are impressive, but the broken tiles underfoot were reminiscent of the worst Canarian resorts and after ten minutes I was ready to move on."

If you find you only have limited time in Budapest this is a must do.Magnificent both in day and at night.The central focal point of the hero's square, as well as one of the most recognized landmarks of Budapest and all of Hungary, is the Millennium Memorial sometimes often referred to as Millennium Monument or Millenary Monument. It is comprised of several statues of the leaders of the seven tribes that founded Hungary in the 9th century and other outstanding figures of Hungarian history . They surround a Corinthia column topped by a magnificent statue of the archangel Gabriel. In his right hand the angel holds the Holy Crown of St. Stephen the first king of Hungary. In his left hand the angel holds a two barred apostolic cross, a symbol awarded to St. Stephen by the Pope in recognition of his efforts to convert Hungary to Christianity.Directly in front of the monument sits a large stone cenotaph surrounded by a large iron chain. The cenotaph is dedicated \"To the memory of all the heroic men and women sacrificed and gave their lives for the cause of freedom and national independence.\" While some guide books refer to this as a \"tomb\" it is not a burial place.One interesting and little known fact not to be missed here is a flat bronze plate within the decorative chain that marks the site of Budapest's first artesian well whose drilling was completed in 1878. Additionally this well provides the water for the Sz\u00e9chenyi Baths behind the square in the city park.The back of the square consists of two matched colonnades, each housing seven statues each representing great figures in Hungarian history. Both of these matching monuments consists of two semi-circles that on top of sit the Greek symbols of War and Peace, Work and Welfare, Knowledge and Glory can be seen. The niches within each colonnade are decorated by the statues of kings, governors and other famous characters of the Hungarian history. At the foot of each statue small reliefs depict the most important moment of the life of the personality.The square is flanked on two sides by two very magnificent and important museums the Museum of Fine Arts and Hall of Art both worth you time if you have it. And in the front by the Unesco heritage sight Andrassy Avenue which is a nice way to arrive from above or by the Yellow metro line Europe's oldest continental subway line and the second oldest in the world.In closing I should finish they way I started. If you find you only have limited time in Budapest this is a must do!!! Magnificent both in day and at night."

If you walk from Andrassy (the beautiful tree-lined street) after visiting the Opra House and the Terror House (15 minute walk), walk to this beautiful Square. It is an easy trek on your tourist-filled day. Go to the Opra House and the Terror House (on the way) and go to this beautiful square and take a few pictures of the beautiful statues. The zoo is right next door (really interesting and one of the oldest in Europe with historical cages). The fine art museum is also adjacent (if you like da Vinci and a world class museum). The place is absolutely in a great location and so many touristy things to do - REALLY worthwhile and in my opinion, you have not visited Budapest until you have seen this square. There is no cost for this attraction. Take a look at the photos I snapped. I would HIGHLY recommend planning your day as follows: Visit the opera House (be careful as they have selected times) then the House of Terror and then look at Heroes Square. Then spend a couple of hours at the Fine Arts Museum so when it is dark you can see the square at night before having dinner or whatever you decide to do. I wish someone would have told me this itinerary before I went!"

I went to Heroes' Square during my last visit and really enjoyed the statues and museums on either side of the square. A Hungarian friend pointed out that the museums are actually different sizes, and therefore the square was created asymmetrically to give the effect of equal size. I cannot commend on the insides of the museums flanking the square, but if you have the opportunity I do recommend walking around the adjacent park. If you're there in the wintertime, stop at the thermal baths or throw on some ice-skates, drink mulled-wine, and enjoy the Christmas markets. While I'm not entirely sure that this style of Christmas market is \"Hungarian\", after a few hours walking around in the snow you'll be happy to have some warm food to warm you up! Be sure to check out interesting buildings inside of the park- they each have an interesting history!"

It was built to mark the time when Hungary joined the EU. Sadly it now has anti EU graffiti on one side of it.

It is very historical, and depicts the different periods in the history of Hungary. There is a memorial to the Unknown Soldier in the middle. The statuary represents different heroes and conquerors of Hungary. It is a large square, bordered by two large museums. We only stayed a short while, but it is worth seeing, it is part of the culture and history of Hungary. I would read about it before I go, unless you have a better guide than we did."

The Agricultural Museum is housed in a replica Transylvanian castle that is something else - the grounds of the place are predictably classy and the adjoining V\u00e1rosligeti Park is very relaxing.Easy to get to on the Metro with a stop right at the front door!

It has a tiled floor and two curved sets of columns made into a wall topped with four figures that represent Labour, War, Peace and The Sciences. Between the columns there are more figures who I believe represent the great and the good from Budapest's history. In the centre of these two sets of columns is a tall tower with another figure on top and surrounded by fiercesome warriors on horseback.There is a park at the back of the square, a zoo nearby and a museum right next to it. If you walk to the other side of the park that is where the Szechenyi Spa Baths are."

The monument main / centre has a massive 36metre column with a figure depicting the Archangel Gabriel. Around the outside on curved mounts are various figures in Hungarian history starting with Magyar tribes who inhabited the Hungarian lands of modern day Hungary. Well worth a visit to stand in awe of the shear scale of things & to take an impressive look down Andrassy Avenue."

We too the metro to hosok tere and hopped out from the under groud to find the square in front of us. We did nt do the tour thing as we wanted to amble around ourselves we bought the Budapest card from our hotel and for 29 euros each we had the freedom of the twin city.Also lots of discounts on bars cafes and resturants / museums. Although if you want to know the exact history of every monument take the tour . heros Square is really worth taking a look at but is full of people so mind your bag."

The column in the center is surrounded by statues of the Seven Magyar Chieftans who were believed to have founded Hungary, and the colonnade behind commemorates Hungary's great leaders including Kings and great warriors. The towering statues and gleaming marble give one a sense of the Budapest of the 1890's with its glorious innovations that caused reflections on Hungary's greatness.

It has rained on us, the sun has shone, we have been there on quiet days and days crowded with tourists and on other days it has been turned into a race track for the National Gallop or a parking lot for bicycles during Critical Mass. With the museums on either side and the monument in the middle, there is always something to see and do. It is one of our \"have to's\" when we are in Budapest."

We had a Rick Steves guidebook to tell us about the square and surrounding area, which was very helpful.

The square has imposing dimensions, but if you don't know that it was built around 1900 you could very well think it was a Soviet propaganda construction...The Andrassy boulevard starts here and ends almost down at the Danube bank.

The light and shadows on all the statues was amazing, and changing second by second. It was impossible to take a bad photo.

Flanking this statue are 14 statues of Hungary's most important people.Heroes Square is very large, very clean and very well done.If you are not on a tour, do your homework before you stop at this attraction - especially the 14 statues."

It's a giant square with statues of Hungary's old kings and national heroes. Behind it, there is a huge castle, it's a museum, Agricultural museum or I'm not sure. We didn't go in because it was closed but, it is worth to go and walk around the castle as well. It's perfect. Plus there is an art \"museum\" right in front of this castle, ON THE LAKE! I highly recommend this place to everyone, I really really enjoyed it."

It depicts the major figures in the country's history. Together with Andrassy Avenue, it is a World Heritage Site. Rick Steves' city guide tells you about each of the many statutes in the square. But the half hour it will take you see the square itself will be worth any trip, because lots more is nearby. All within walking distance: two art galleries, flanking the square on two sides, the zoo and a fun park, the Szechenyi Baths, and Vajadahunyad Castle -- the last an intruiging hodgepodge or architectural styles. There is a metro stop at the square."

Upon arriving there I was struck by the beauty and magic that surrounds the Square. The area is huge and monuments surrounding the whole area are magnificent. In the middle one can find Attila and rest of his men on horses. Around the square the monuments of kings surround the whole place.Take a tour of if you prefer buy a lonely planet and read all about these great warriors. Tour does not end there.If you keep walking straight you will enter castle area and lake and garden surrounding it."

The centrepiece is the Millennium Monument, built in 1896 to commemmorate the 1000th anniversary of the Magyar conquest. Statues of famous kings, variuos symbols (war and peace, work and welfare) can also be found, as well as equestrian statues commemorating Arpad and the seven chieftains of the Hungarian tribes. Andrassy AVenue is also worth a stroll, as well as a visit to the Museum of Fine Arts and Art Gallery. Lots of tourists .. and vendors who will try and sell you everything from tourbooks to sweaters (some take no for an answer .. others not so much!). Well worth a visit, especially if you have limited time in Budapest."

They had some lovely paintings even though they were poorly displayed. The Spanish section was especially rich. The square is fun to walk around particularly if you go into the park on a weekend. Many of the locals come there for the amusement park and the stalls that are set up with souvenirs and food. It gives the tourist a chance to actually see some of the locals enjoying the sights."

The Fine Art Museum and the Mucsarnok (Palace of Art) face each other on this square. The Zoo and Szechenyi Spa are both very close to here.The main attraction is a wonderful composition of statues. There is a tall cenotaph or Millenium Memorial in the middle surrounded by statues in a semi-cicrle. The statues depict the 7 chieftans wholed the Hungarian tribes into what is now Hungary, and there are other important historical figures and kings included as well. There is no traffic on a large part of the square, which makes a nice change and lets you have a wonder round in the middle. It is impressive and huge, and I am pretty sure it has all kinds of political connotations."

This memorial is HUGE! with several segments like the gods of war/peace, all the different kings and the main statue itself. There are various museums and arts centers around. Andrassy street leads up to the square and also contains a lot of culture/touristy thing (House of Terror, Opera House..) Behind the square is a huge park which contains many statues, a castle and church, baths, a circus, etc. I would read up or get a map on all the little things to do/see here or you may get lots in the park/woods!"

After that we walked around in the City Park located behind the square and took a look at the Szcehenyi Bath building, through the park some more and then back to Hero's Square. On either side of Hero's square are two art museums, but we didn't go to them this time around.We took the yellow line metro across the street to our next destination. You really need to pop down there even if you aren't going to use the metro. The yellow line is one of the oldest underground transportation in Europe."
