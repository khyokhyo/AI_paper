I prefer the small mirador of Senhora do Monte at the top of Graca. A word about Graca: we were disappointed with the bairro generally, and specifically the restaurants. The largo and the buildings could be delightful, but the promise of the neighborhood is yet to be fulfilled. So, we can enjoy the miradoures and the crowded tram 28 and then move on."

As sometimes occurs the cloud of misfortune (a foreshortened tram ride) had a silver lining in the form of a trad jazz band playing to a small crowd in the Miradouro.We found a table and ordered coffee, then sat back and enjoyed the performance and the view - see photos. There is also a church nearby. Lovely place to while away a sunny afternoon."

A bit further up and a touch more spectacular is the Miradouro da Senhora do Monte. But definitely both are very worthwhile.The Miradouro da Gra\u00e7a can also be reached by using public transport, namely the unique Tram 28 from the Pra\u00e7a Martim Moniz up to the stop Gra\u00e7a at the Largo da Gra\u00e7a. From here it is a short walk to the viewpoint, which is next to the quite grand church Igreja da Gra\u00e7a. Rebuilt after the earthquake of 1755 this church can also be visited unlike its adjoining building around a cloister, which once belonged to an Augustinian monastery.From the miradouro can be seen the whole center of Lisbon and also the castle Sao Jorge. There are trees for shade up here and in a corner is a caf\u00e9 with outdoor seating, the 'Esplanada da Gra\u00e7a'.Since 2009 the Miradouro da Gra\u00e7a has officially been renamed Miradouro Sophia de Mello Breyner Andresen, but hardly anybody uses this new name. It is in honour of a 20th century poetess, who is held in high esteem in Portugal and who is buried not far from here in the National Pantheon. At the miradouro can be seen a bronze bust of her as well as a plaque with her poem 'Lisboa' (only in Portuguese)."

I think that the Miradouro de Sao Pedro de Alcantara is better which is opposite to this one.

On the Miradoura there is a coffee shop and from here you get great views of the Castle, over Lisbon right down to the River Tagus. The tram 28 terminus at the top is a 5 minute walk away. Tram 28 is part of the day pass for Carris system so is great value and can be bought at Metro Stations machines for 6 euro / day.If this review is helpful then please indicate so below."

I gave up and turned back only to discover an easily visible sign on the return walk. I think most people take a tram or a tour, but I noticed other people walking with maps looking perplexed. You get a stunning view of Lisbon. I belive it's the highest point."

Lovers of all ages, photographers, and historians alike will enjoy the unique experience provided by Miradoura de Gra\u00e7a. For starters, the overlook provides 180 degree panoramic views of the city itself, including the Carmo Church Ruins (Igreja do Carmo), the Castle of Saint George (Castelo de S\u00e3o Jorge) and even the 25th of April Bridge, which is Lisbon's version of the famous Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. The views by day are stunning, but by night they are simply breathtaking. A lovely caf\u00e9, located just atop this beautiful vista, provides refreshments and beverages for the weary traveler. For the slightly more adventuresome, there are a number of local caf\u00e9s within the immediate vicinity that provide authentic dining experiences that are not easily forgotten. Lisbon has some of the best food and service in the world, so don't miss the opportunity to experience it firsthand. Portuguese food is a treat that is a joy unto itself.For photographers, the best time to visit is during the late afternoon until an hour past sunset. Bring your tripod and brush up on your long-exposure techniques. The best images can be taken just after sunset when the lights of the city become visible and the sky turns sapphire blue. To catch sunstars from all the lights, set your F-Stop to F16 or F11 and use a long exposure of at least 30 seconds. For best results, consult your camera owner's manual.For lovers, come early in the day and enjoy a nice lunch at the caf\u00e9 or grab a bite at any of the local delis. If you really want to get into the spirit of things though, pack a picnic lunch and bring your favorite bottle of wine. If you prefer, Beer and wine are also available at the caf\u00e9 kiosk. Then, sit back and take in the wonderful views together. This is an ideal venue for one-of-a-kind couples photos, and together you can leisurely explore the adjacent pocket park, or the Igreja da Gra\u00e7a \u2013 a beautiful 18th century church. Of course, you will want to stick around for sunset, which can be stunning from this vantage point and is also best time to experience the views together. Miradoura de Gra\u00e7a offers the best vantage point in the city to see and understand how all the districts fit together. Regardless of what type of traveler you are, you will not want to miss out on one of the best attractions in all of Lisbon. The best part? This unforgettable overlook and the astonishing views it affords are free, proving that the best things in life don't have to cost money. So, as you plan your Lisbon adventure, be sure to include a visit to Miradoura de Gra\u00e7a; you will not be disappointed."
