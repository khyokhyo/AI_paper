The museum provides a prospective that is easily missed in a general observation of the activity that occurs daily out on the streets. You'll find a depth of knowledge on these 5 floors that is well presented through visual and written explanations. For those who lived through the Viet Nam/American war - an entire floor is dedicated to this era - you'll find information that was never reported in western news reports."

It was so informative and some of the exhibitions were stunning, especially the traditional clothing/costumes.The only annoying part was the ticket booth being completely separate to the museum building, so we were told to walk back outside and to the street to purchase tickets rather than at the museum itself which made no sense. And there were two separate parking staff out the front who argued amongst themselves where we should park, a minor inconvenience really."

Once you enter the museum, you can rent the audio guide at the counter for another 30 000 dong. Do rent one so that it will be easier to understand the exhibits as the information board will not contain all information. There is a locker where you can keep your belongings for free. I walked from the top level down to each exhibition level. Very informative gallery which detailed the contributions of the vietnamese women from past to present on culture and history. The strength and resilience of vietnamese ladies shown during the war time can only be witnessed by us now in this museum. You may want to spend more time at the exhibition hall level which showcases the women who fought in the war. There is also a small gallery on the left of the exhibition hall door on each level. Do take the time to sit down and watch the videos in these galleries, especially the film on life of the women street vendors."

The taxi fare was 34,000 VND including a 1,000 VND tip.My host recommended I visit this museum and I wasn't sure what to expect. To be honest I thought \u2018oh no, not another museum\u2019 and \u2018what's so great about a women's museum anyway\u2019? Lo and behold I was there for 2.5 hours and could have stayed longer but I had to get to work. Entry was 30,000 VND.It is an interesting display of a women's integral role in the family throughout history and their fashion based on their traditional culture, marriage customs and child birth. All the exhibits have good Vietnamese, English and French translations so there\u2019s no need for a guide or the headsets. It's easy to navigate. I didn't get to see fashion floor because it was closed for maintenance. The museum is covered so it's great on a rainy day but the day I went the air conditioning wasn't working so they were relying on fans and it was still hot inside.Afterwards you may be in need of a tea or coffee and cake. Well across the road slightly to the left is a Madame Huong bakery that do yummy pastries and coffee. The service there is a little gruff but it\u2019s a good place to take a load off and people watch for a bit. The price is probably expensive by local standards it cost 150,000 VND for 2 coffees and 2 cakes. It's probably best to get your pastries and order your coffee at the counter then sit down as I waited a very long time to be served and they only bring a drinks menu so you have to go and choose your cake anyway.I visited 8 September."

I have been to this museum a few times over the years and the exhibits are well presented and generally well documented. I mainly go to see the textiles in the Costume section and I feel this exhibit could do with further informed documentation. The photos around the walls are very well documented but the actual different ethnic costumes on the models are all presented under the title of 'costume' with no reference to the particular ethnic group the costume comes from. This would not involve much extra effort as I'm sure the knowledge is locally available and for people like me it would add greatly to the learning experience. The full impact of the textile collection would be enhanced by these extra details.There is a very professional exhibition regarding the Mother Goddess on another floor which has a much more informed approach as does the exhibition regarding women's role in the defence of Vietnam and overall it's an interesting and informative place.Staff are mainly invisible and don't look at all interested in their jobs. I have met many young graduates on my trips to Vietnam who would make more of a contribution if they had the chance to work at such a place."

It's easy to take a look at these themes because each floor follows one theme. what you receive when u go inside the museum? well, you can see by yourselves the hard life of Vietnamese women who ride bikes through the crowded streets to sell something, who sacrifice to take care of the family and so on. However, the objects on display mostly belonged to the past, so they may not truly reflect the modern life of Vietnamese people these days. The solution is to ask your tour guide to tell you about the changes in people's lifestyle and customs. You would be in awe if you happen to know the change. If you don't have a tour guide with you, rent a headphone available at the museum.There will be automatic explanations of the objects on display so you can understand the meaning and stories behind these objects. The ticket price is reasonable and worth your money. Overall, highly recommended. Take a visit to the museum to see the whole picture!"

However, the war level was amazing. It was awesome to see how many female war hero there were and what they went through. A fascinating history for females.

You go around at your own pace and there's some really confronting areas, for instance the room with photos of women who'd lost husbands and multiple children in the war.

I found the role of women during the American/Vietnamese War, and the top floor where students currently have a photography display most interesting. I found the clothing floor and the childbirth/family floors to be a little dull, as they did not detail each culture specifically in their brief placards and seemed to state the obvious. It's still definitely worth a visit, maybe allow an hour or 2 of your afternoon to take it all in. There is an option for audio commentary for 30 k Dong, so perhaps this details each culture more."

Had exhibits on female clothing and different ethnic groups. Indeed, some of the customs such as with regard to marriage may be different depending on the ethnic group.You buy the entrance ticket near the street about 30-40 meters from the entrance to the museum.Convenient location in the French Quarter. Just a 5-6 minute walk from the Sofitel Metropole hotel. We were staying in the Old Quarter, and took a very short taxi ride to the museum, and then walked back to the Old Quarter from the museum.

The room on birth and children had a lot more than I had time to go through, and I basically had to run through the fashion/traditional clothing exhibition. One part that didn't seem too interesting was the room with 'women in history,' which seemed more like a bunch of Vietnam War references/Communist propaganda than a real narrative about a wide range of historical figures, so we didn't spend much time in that one. There was a nook with audio stories about women in business in Vietnam, and that was significantly better.The gift shop was nice- maybe a little more expensive than most stores in Hanoi for fairly similar goods, but helpful clerks and some nice items. The whole museum was air conditioned and cool, and that was a nice change. Admission was definitely more than I expected, especially since we only had an hour to spend before we had to beat it back to our hotel and catch a shuttle to the airport. If I'd had the time to hang out there longer and get a little more out of the visit, then the price would probably have seemed more worth it. We didn't even consider springing for the extra audio tour, given how much the ticket price cost to begin with, but all the signage was in English, Vietnamese, and French, and it was even pretty clearly translated."

It covers subjects from marriage and birth, to the day-to-day life of ordinary VIetnamese women selling vegetables and artifacts on the streets of Hanoi. The video interviews of such women made us realise, as we really hadn't before, just how tough life can be for ordinary women and families in Vietnam. The room devoted to the role of women in the military (and in the 'American war', of course) was fascinating and moving. We had no idea that so many women were under arms, or that women attained high ranks in combat roles. This museum wasn't included in the pre-arranged tour we took in Hanoi, but we are very glad we visited it during a free morning. Don't miss it."

I'm not a huge history buff in some ways and I learned quite a bit and found the information very accessible. I would recommend this attraction for sure!"

It took us about 2.5hrs to do the museum.In the 'Women in war' section, We found comfortable seats under the AIR CONDITIONING to listen to ALL the audio of a particular section and then went and looked at the exhibits. This kept us cool & saved our legs but meant we didn't miss anything.I also particularly loved the minority fashion on the top floor which explained key techniques - this info made my trip to Sapa even more rich and gave me a good appreciation of the costumes of each of the tribes."

We learned about the leading roles women took as fighters, protestors and healers. So many were commanders and leaders. Third floor covers women's fashions among the many ethnic groups that make up Vietnam. The audio guide is essential - it is concise, comprehensive, clear and intelligent. I can't recommend this museum highly enough. It's a proud and expansive exposition on the contribution of women in every aspect of life in Vietnam.

The 1st level contained a small but enticing museum shop. The Fashion exhibition not only showed many costumes but also went into some depth on the techniques used to produce them, the history section covered much of the time when Vietnam was fighting for independence from the French and the objective to re-unify the country. Life and family focused on marriage and childbirth and demonstrated the mix of matriarchal and patriarchal communities that exist in Vietnam. Don't miss it when visiting Hanoi.

The stand out for me was the second floor which contained photos & short biographies of women who participated in the wars for Vietnamese independence. Each story further illuminated by a poignant collection of thepossessions that were part of their work and/or survival at that time. So moving to see: the stained shirt that had disguised a woman as mad person so as part of the resistance she could monitor & share enemy movements; or the embroidery sewn secretly for a year by a prisoner as a gift for her mother; or the meagre tool kits of a woman driver or the surgical tools of doctor Dang Thuy Tram whose journal has been published in 2005 with the title, 'Last night I dreamed of peace'. So moving and profound. I recommend hiring the audio guide from the front counter (at time of writing in Vietnamese, French & English) as it provided more and different detail than provided in the exhibits. You will need to leave id as a deposit, I used my drivers licence, I think it cost 50,000 dong (about the same price as coffee or a smoothie). Another standout exhibition was the film about the street vendors of Hanoi, contemporary & relevant. A must see museum, if you are in Hanoi."

Incredible stories about compelling individuals and through these stories one could learn a great deal about the Vietnamese perspective on this chapter in their history.Located just south of the lake, this is an easy museum to get to and is a must if you are in town for a few days and not planning to get out to the (far more expansive) enthnograohic museum."

Split over a number of floors, with each showcasing a different aspect of the lives and experiences of Vietnamese women including marriage, motherhood, history and their involvement in Vietnam's cultural revolution and various conflicts.I particularly enjoyed the marriage exhibit and learning about how different ethnic groups within Vietnam celebrate the ceremony, how it is carried out, what they wear etc. I found the English translations to read very naturally too, which was not my experience in other Vietnamese museums.Overall my visit here was incredibly interesting and although the museum was a little walk away from the main tourist centre of Hanoi I felt it was well worth it and at a 30,000 VND entry fee (approximately \u00a31) I really cannot think of any reason why one would not visit here, I highly recommend it."

Upon paying my admission fee I was offered the audio system and then asked to pay a deposit in VND or leave my passport as security. This was strongly queried by a fellow visitor as there were no signs about a fee for the audio system and I backed her up on this, we were told that this was a new policy and hence no signage. Am hopeful that the signage situation will be rectified for any future visits. In hindsight I should have refused the audio system - my opinion is that a personal audio system is not necessary to enjoy and get the maximum benefit out of this museum."

It also gives tribute to the women who made a difference in the 'war of aggression' (U.S. -As they call it.) It is disappointing in that the role of women in society now isn't addressed at all. With all that recognition for their roles in the war, you'd expect to at least try to address issues of today. The only hint was also the most disturbing--a film on the street vendors of Hanoi...they leave their villages for 10-14 days to work in the city and may only take home $20 for their labors. You can't look at them the same after seeing the film."

I was extremely touched when reading the tragic stories of war heroines on the second floor - very little propaganda there, just the stories, and they are heartbreaking. There were also video interviews of contemporary women having to do backbreaking jobs to support their family even today - an eye-opener that teaches us how lucky we are!

Each floor had different theme- although the museum is about 'women' - it tells the story of all the people of Vietnam- it took us through marriage rituals across the country, farming, women's role in the wars amongst others. I personally was really taken by the textiles and fabrics. I learnt a lot about reliefs rituals and there was a really interesting video about the street sellers. It was calm and a real escape from the busy streets. The displays were all well translated into English and French- the museum really top class."

Strongly recommend, that the Vietnamese Women's Museum be your first destination as you begin to explore Hanoi, an amazing city of culture, history, people, food and so much more. Women are the foundation of this culture. So many of the women leave their small farming, fishing communities to come to work and to live , 30 in a room, in the city In order to support their children-providing funds for education. In seeing, a video and photo exhibit, showing the women street vendors of Hanoi, I stood humbly in awe. I suddenly had a more sensitive understanding of the women selling flowers, fruit, stuff out of their balanced baskets asking for a few dollars to support their families. The idea is to buy and not to donate. So please do so when you meet them. Also at the entrance of the museum was a poster contest encouraging students to focus on gender equity. The sensitivity, maturity, reality, and impact was powerful. A must visit."

I was really pleasantly surprised by the Women's Museum - the exhibitions have recently been redone and there are three floors covering such topics as women's role in family life, childbirth rituals, and women in military history in Vietnam. In most museums the entire experience of women only gets a token nod in one small room so I found it refreshing that this museum exists and is so well done. The interpretation materials are detailed and thoughtfully researched in the information provided, I wish more museums would provide this level of quality. You can borrow a free audio tour in Vietnamese, English or French which gives good information about the exhibits. The exhibits are really fascinating and I learnt a lot about Vietnamese culture, I especially appreciated the video presentations which were humbling at times and stuck in my mind a long time after I left. There was a wonderful floor of beautiful clothing from the various ethnic groups of Vietnam which I really enjoyed. There is also a stone mill in the museum which the visitor has the opportunity to try and use the wooden lever to grind the grains - very hard and makes you appreciate how tiring this task is.Would highly recommend this as an example of how museums should be."

Each floor has a different theme: top floor - tribal clothes and traditional fashions, excellent. Next floor down, the role of women in wars - very good, but clearly written from the 'winners' perspective - not overly so though. Then down one floor again, the traditional roles of women in the home and childbirth. All very well presented and displayed in VN, FR and English.The atrium mobile of painted coolie hats is worth the small admission price by itself. Have the ginger tea at the attached Cafe - wonderfully refreshing."

Themes were sectioned off on levels and there was the typical offering of a video room and artifacts, although i did feel there could have been more. At the very top of the building was an gallery with some of the most bizarre art i've seen, which i probably enjoyed the most. It seemed a little difficult to get to, even for a local as that's who took me.

I thought it was fun. From the ground floor up to the 4th floor. Each floor has a history to tell from religion, culture and beliefs. Don't worry too when it comes to reading or knowing because all is translated in English.The museum is really informative and educational. I enjoyed visiting all the floors but the display on the 3rd floor interest me more, their women fashion. The presentation of their different clothing from before and now is somewhat very interesting. The generation change, but they keep their traditional style of woman's clothing 'alive' up to now. Overall, its really wonderful!"

You can read or listen to storys of vietnamese Women, which shows a beautiful and strong storyline of the past."

            "review": "An Excellent Idea Inadequately Executed. I was looking forward to this museum immensely, but left disappointed and somewhat irritated. Things start brilliantly with a 10 minute video about the lives of contemporary female street vendors, which gives an insight into the everyday experience of poor women in Vietnam, mostly working to support their husbands, as well as their children. Perhaps it's a misconception on the part of a casual visitor, but it struck me that I saw huge numbers of women diligently working away, and lots of men drinking in cafes and bars, so this part of the exhibition seemed as though it was setting the tone for something not only appraising Vietnamese women's role in shaping their society, but also some level of criticism of gender roles. This hope was short lived, however, as despite what followed having some interesting moments (explanation of marriage arrangements, the immense war contribution), there was very little in the way of challenging what appears to be an extraordinary burden that women fulfil in Vietnam, and a complete absence of the role of men in relation to the ascribed female roles. There was also a puritanical theme, a kind of straight jacketing, that Vietnamese women can only function as support figures for men and the nation, symbolically pure and divine motherly figures, reified through mystical/religious belief. Only towards the very end, is there a brief mention of women in professional roles, and nothing about female involvement in art, literature and music; this small section is somewhat ironically juxtaposed with a much larger exhibition on female fashion and appearance. The seemingly separate art gallery on the top floor makes no sense whatsoever. It could be argued that I've misunderstood the museum and Vietnamese culture, or it's simply not the museum I wanted, but all good museums have some kind of unifying critical theme; the theme of this museum seemed to me be close to celebrating how much Vietnamese women have had to put up with historically, how things aren't really changing despite all their hard work, and - hey - there's no point in complaining because that's just how it is."

Some of the stories of what the women endured during their fights, espionage etc were not known to me beforehand. I did however feel very unsettled with a little of the glorification (not sure if this is the right word, but I had a bad taste in my mouth)The fashion floor was also interesting, but did seem a bit of an afterthought given the many different topics that would be more relevant to women in Vietnam and elsewhere."

The museum gives an insight in women's role in Vietnamese culture, with several different ethnic groups through their history up to the American war. Found more information in the museum than we did from any tour guide. Cost 30,000VD each."

The women's museum is a large, modern space that attempts to elevate the value of women in a society that is well, extremely male dominated! Some of the information has been exaggerated in significance in order to give the impression that women are very equal and valued in Vietnamese society. Although female war heroes are given notice, as well as some modern cultural topics such as gender are also touched on, the dark side to Vietnamese culture being male dominated is highly overlooked."

The exhibits of the \"famous\" women of the struggle, including those who fought in the American War, was especially touching. We liked learning about this point of view.

The ground floor starts with Family Life, moves to Marriage on the next floor. Given that Vietnamese society is made up of 53 different ethnic groups, each with its own traditions and cultures, the explanations, in English and French as well as Vietnamese, are clear and concise. The next floor moves to the role of Vietnamese women in war (they'd had a few..) and is enlightening. The following floor is given to Vietnamese fashion, both traditional and contemporary, and the top floor is given to temporary art exhibitions. If nothing else, you'll think twice when you next pompously reject the entreaties of a street-seller who she almost begs you to buy a few bananas. She's looking for 20000Nvd to help keep her family alive."

My 8 y.o. found the floor of Women in History (mostly war related) at little too much, but enjoyed about daily life. Had a small discovery room that wasn't staffed, but had a few things to dress up in. A nice morning, easy walk from hotels in the old quarter. Very inexpensive, too, like all museums in Vietnam."

I had two choices for a museum today and I went for the nearest one within walking distance from our lodgings near Hoan Kiem Lake.I was glad to have chosen to see this with my mom. First, its said to be located on the most ancient street in Hanoi and if you like just seeing French architecture, there's a lot of structures which can be seen while roaming around.A blend of good documentation, photographs, vids and display tableaus, I thoroughly enjoyed visiting all the floors. Each level in the building focuses on a different theme such as women in history, in family, fashion and some temporary exhibitions on a wide range of topics.They are also open on everyday (as of this writing), so its a bonus because some countries have the museum close on that one day.Ticket was VND 30,000."

When I visited, there was some sort of a farmer's market under a massive tent just outside the museum. So it was quite a treat for tourists like me! They had about 5-6 levels, I think. Each level got more interesting. I especially love the section where they talk about women in military and how they celebrated them. They're so exceptionally fearless and brave. It's kind of ironic how women of the 21st century in Vietnam has regressed just a bit. A guide I spoke to during my trip, said that it is most important for a woman in vietnam to know how to cook. Overall, it was a educational and informative museum that took me through the evolution of women in Vietnam. I'd say take your time to go through every section, it will open your eyes and minds to their culture. The exhibition had a nice flow from section to section. For 30,000 dong, you'll learn alot!"

Right from the start, I was moved by the area devoted to Hanoi's (predominantly women) street vendors - their backgrounds, reasons for living this way etc. - and impressed that this contemporary theme was the first gallery you come across. All the other themes were fascinating too - the Mother goddess, the 'Women in War', childbirth and the culture associated with it, to name but a few. And I love the art in the central shaft - the balloon-like hats. It is a 'must-see' in Hanoi, in my book!"

I went there is a guide from Hanoi Free Tours and it was enormously helpful--she knew the museum very well and guided me through, explaining things and pointing out the important exhibits, answering my questions, and offering more in-depth explanations.

In our free time in that afternoon we went to the Vietnamese Women's Museum. We found the section on Women and the War really expanded on our understanding of life during the War.Part of the display had well presented personal histories of individual women who had been involved in a variety of ways including one who was a negotiator at the Paris Peace Talks.This was an impressive exhibition which had been curated to really engage the visitor.An added bonus was in a building in the same courtyard was another excellent exhibition showcasing women inventing better ways of doing a whole variety of things in industry, education, commerce and daily life."

I walked away feeling much better informed about the culture, but also inspired by the stories I'd read."

The museum has several permanent exhibitions including a survey of the clothing and jewellery of Vietnam's 54 ethnic groups and an exhibition about the lives of women street traders. When I visited there was a fascinating temporary exhibition about Vietnamese worship of the Mother Goddess. More about all of this on the museum's website, which can be viewed in Vietnamese, English, French and Japanese. The museum has two additional attractions. The first is a caf\u00e9 that sells excellent espresso coffee - it's the second caf\u00e9 on the right when you enter the grounds of the museum. The second is the first-rate gift shop on the ground floor. It sells at very reasonable prices art and history books, tote bags, traditional embroidery and other crafts, jewellery, home wares and reproductions of propaganda posters. I spent a couple of hours at the museum and could easily have stayed for longer."

It gives a diversified oversight of female status in Vietnam throughout the years (marriage, ethnicity, religion & rituals, war contribution, fashion, etc.). It is completely harmless as it is most certainly neither an advocate nor the eyes of waning female rights in VN. One wonders how it could come this far after the strong position women occupied during and shortly after the war. You won\u2019t find the answer here. Moreover, this museum gives well-documented proof and elaborate testimony of woman\u2019s past strong position in society. The \u2018art floor\u2019 is rather poor : one would expect happenings to take place. It consists of around 10 paintings by most certainly 1 artist (a lesser Bacon; end September 2015).Overall I would recommend a visit because of the museums interesting and active appearance.

If you have already noticed how hard women in Vietnam work, this will give you more of an insight into the contribution women have given to the country. It also gives you an insight into various traditions with regards marriage and family, struggles of the women selling fruit and vegetables on their bicycles, not forgetting their enormous contribution toward the war and the role of the Mother Goddess in worship. It's good to see women and their lives being recognised and celebrated. You can whizz round in an hour, or take longer reading more. Museums are not generally as you might find in the Western world with hands on activities for children, all in all considering others, it is worth a visit as the information you will glean, you won't be able to find on one site on the internet.

This museum provides very good background for anyone interested in the current situation and history of women in Vietnam. Highlights include very colorful traditional dress of ethnic groups and artifacts from home and work associated with women. Although there are photos and displays documenting the role of women in the war with the U.S., it was disappointing to see very little representation of current efforts of Vietnamese women working for peace. A special current exhibition is \"Worshipping Mother Goddess\" which includes an actual altar used in Mother Goddess Worship and oral accounts of the meaning of worship for common people. An inexpensive catalog for the exhibition is available in English."

I still felt as if it has its own beauty. It was a bit pricy to enter and it was also very stuffy inside in some places. The displays were very modern however theres a lot of information to take it, its very interesting to see the things they present in this museum. I learnt a lot (this may be niave because I went in not knowing a thing about Vietnamese cutlure and people) especially about the hawker ladies and the marriage and child birth culture. I liked the interactive basket holding, a very good touristic photo to snap up. I liked the videos they showed on each floor as well, although the headphones could do with updating.

There are exhibits on basic aspects of life for women: birth, marriage, family. They do a good job and highlighting different ethnic groups experiences throughout Vietnam. There was a short video section highlighting women street vendors and there lives that made look at every fruit and flower station differently. A while section was dedicated to women who were of service to the communist cause during the recent wars, which was fascinating read about particularly because it is presented from a very specific viewpoint. The roving exhibit was focused on Mother Earth worship and that ritual and tradition. I especially appreciated this not just because it was interesting but also because it's something I would have known nothing about if I hadn't visited there. I will say that the information provided could have been fleshed out more.Overall I am really supportive of what they are trying to do through this facility and are on their way.

We were especially impressed by a video on the 2nd floor about female street vendors. It was eye-opening. Several of these women were interviewed, their hardships brought to light. I truly think it's something that visitors to Vietnam should see, particularly because there are female street vendors all over the country.

The only con about the museum was that there were videos translated only into french, or only into English. My basic french got me through the french only videos, but if you had no knowledge of it you might struggle to access all of the displays.

From honoring women as mothers, to soldiers, to artisans and the multiple ethnic groups in the country, there is so much to learn about the culture and history. You have to like history, not get miffed about the obvious communist propaganda that gets thrown in (what do you expect?) and be open to taking your time to learn about the people of this country. I've never been to a museum that was so honoring to women. I especially loved getting to see the many traditional costumes that have been collected from all over the country. The clothing is beautifully displayed and you can see the details of each piece. A real score if you enjoy looking at clothing design. The museum is old, it doesn't have any bells and whistles, the rooms are HOT and there is no air conditioning, so come with water and a fan!

There are many exhibits relating to women in Vietnam, mostly about hill tribe ceremonies and the various minor deeds and artifacts of women who fought for the Viet Cong in the war. If you like seeing milk powder sachets or the shoes of some female martyr, then this is the museum for you! All others, this place is boring, stiflingly hot, and indecipherable."

The street vendor display and video is a must see - if ever you've been a little annoyed at being approached so constantly, this will give you pause to reflect on the hardships these women endure to make ends meet. We may not buy but we can always be polite to them. The marriage and family exhibits are extensive and something really enjoyable to linger over. Do visit this place if you are ever in Hanoi."

Therefore we were not able to spend as much time as we would have liked in all of the exhibits. We particularly liked the exhibit on marriage and family life. Our favorite part of the museum was the video of street vendors talking about their experiences. We were a little disappointed in the limited information about contemporary women's lives. The historical exhibit was also primarily focused on women during the war. Despite our mixed impressions of the various exhibits the museum was very enjoyable and well worth visiting."

I was happy to visit this museum rather than some of the other attractions in Hanoi due to the heat and a couple of members of the family were feeling a little worse for wear so a slightly easier day was order. Again, like most Vietnamese museums, the entry price was negligible. There were free lockers provided which was fantastic - most venues in Sydney charge for lockers so that was a welcome change. The museum itself provided us with a decent insight into vietnamese life, not just for women but for people in general. My favourite exhibit was the wedding exhibit which showed rituals around traditional marriage processes and ceremonies for the various ethnic groups within the country. This revealed a lot that I hadn't already understood. I also liked the exhibit describing the work of women and the lives that they lead around earning money for the family. We all marvelled that so many women leave their families for weeks at a time to come to the big cities to sell wares for a few weeks at a time before returning to their homes to see their children. What a different life they lead! And how good for my own kids to see this! Finally, I was moved by impact of war exhibit that showed mothers who had lost multiple sons and/or their husbands in the war. One woman had lost 10 members of the family! How could you not be affected by that??"

I recommend to invest five minutes to watch the video Street Workers, that show the reality of the women that walk to the streets selling fruits and handcrafts. I bought a book and a dvd about this matter for both ten us dollars. The entrance fee is more than fair (U$1.50 per person) and after the visit you can have lunch in one of the restaurants nearby.

This place had short writeups on many things and a couple paragraphs on different sections.They also did a very good job with video - another area that is not often done well. For most people (including me) many short videos at different places are better. If we wanted 20 minutes we could just get a DVD or watch YouTube... They did a good job and included subtitles in English, French and some others I think (I wasn't too clear if there was some rotation or selection mechanism (I saw enough with English that I was fine and skipped the ones with French...).There is AC also.If you like museums or at least sometimes do I think this is a very wise item to add to your agenda in Hanoi."

Even a mother goddess section.Fascinating to discover the patriarchal and matriarchal societies and the different roles of women in each. Interesting to see the stark contrast of women's roles in the military when compared to the West including the numbers of female leaders and the recognition of women as national heroes.You can easily spend a few hours in the museum, information is well presented and available in English, French and Vietnamese."

I found the written elements short yet informative. The information on wedding rituals and the guerrilla fighters was particularly interesting. The artefacts were often very beautiful (ornate jewelry and clothing) and the photos engaging. The rooms were mostly very air conditioned which was a relief from the humid day. Definitely worth a look."

It gives you an insight into the life of a Vietnamese Woman from working long hard hours to marriage/childbirth, traditions/culture.Throughout there are videos to watch (make sure you watch the one showing the street vendors - my heart went out to these women long hours for little money).Entry price 30,000 dong and definitely worth it. Glad I went and a great learning experience."

It was the third museum I visited...and at it I learned something I wish I'd known when I'd been at the Museum of Ethnology and the Museum of Fine Arts: That the exhibits are laid out left to right, not right to left. At this museum on the second floor they had a clear arrow pointing one to the LEFT to begin the tour. That was very helpful, cuz I like to see history from older to more recent. GREAT (and beautifully laid our) museum."

Displays include domestic life, marriage ceremonies, fashion, farming and famous revolutionaries. A contemporary art gallery is on the top floor where exhibits can be purchased. By combining a visit to this museum in the morning with the Museum of Ethnology in the afternoon a relaxed and interesting day can be had - especially if it is very hot and humid outside. Lunch can be purchased in the restaurant at the Museum of Ethnology so no need to go hunting around for a meal. I visited both museums on a motorcycle driven by a University student. During long vacations they supplement their income as Hanoi guides and are very knowledgeable taking you to where you want to go and not what a tour company wants you to visit. This can be adventurous."

Every country should have one of these museums but sadly only 3 do (The US and Germany being the other 2).

As others have noted, it is a bit repetitive, but you can go through at whatever pace you feel and dwell on the parts of interest, just moving through others. I think 70-90 minutes would be a typical trip. There are quite a few floors, with the lower floors of the most interest. The large exhibit on the left before you ascend the main museum steps is a woman-in-war exhibit, which was rather unique. Have seen similar topics in other places, but it is mostly the home front, this one very mixed with interesting bios. There is more on the topic in the Main Museum. It wasn't very expensive and they have a little crafts shop on the main floor. The shop isn't as good as the one at the Ethic Museum. The Womans Museum is very convenient to Old Town and the Business areas, but a little hard to see from the street. I walked right buy it once, looking for it. Signs are inside the courtyard. Certainly worth the time and money."

The airconditioning in the museum is good compared to many others.This is a must. Worldwide the place of women in political and commercial history is either ignored or merely assumed. The collection is of everyday artifacts, stories and photographs covering birth, marriage and death, clothing styles etc. Then you get to the third floor where a principally photographic and film illustration of the stories of the heroes of Vietnam in, particularly, the American war, the women, is told. A very moving collection and rendition. Fantastic communist poster art.On the second floor is a little subsection about the street vendors of Hanoi. As a visitor they can be mildly annoying. I will never have the same view - this is a stand out story of life for the poor, where there is little welfare support for the sick or injured.This alcove makes an effective full stop to the wartime philosophy of 'three responsibilities' for women: to protect and nurture the family, improve agricultural productivity and be in a state of readiness for war. You can buy a DVD at the shop - the proceeds go towards assisting these women."

There were lots of interesting displays on traditional clothing. Of particular interest, though also slightly depressing, was the video and display on the women vendors who wander the streets selling fruit and the like, simply because of the fact that I had seen so many during my time walking through the city.

Apparently , Women's Day is celebrated widely in Hanoi. i am not sure about the other cities/provinces though.When we came, the museum had an ad-hoc exhibition, if I am not wrong, it was called the '55th Anniversary of the Long Haired Army'. The ad-hoc exhibition is free but the permanent ones are not. There are 3 main themes and each theme is different for each levels. They are basically Family, History, Fashion and if I am not wrong, there are also themes of weddings and birth. The exhibition showcased the different practices that the different ethnic minorities and the majority Viets follow through their customs and traditions.However, do visit if you have the interests in looking at the different cultures of the minorities. I am especially amazed at how closely a few of the ethnic minorities are similar to the Malays and the Eastern Malaysians. The whole visit took about 1.5hours and that was enough to cover the whole 4 levels."

The floor of day to day family life, traditions, marriage, and household tasks interesting to see and could be better developed in future with more research. This is a patrilineal society, except for a few hill tribes as noted in the displays, so not sure why some previous reviewers call it matriarchal culture. The floor with the women war heroes was tragic and too focused on the recent war, with no mention of the Japanese in WW2. It becomes boringly biased with too much focus on blaming Americans.

Great way of getting knowledge of diff tribes before heading to sapa. Only wish we had more time here instead of in the ho chi Minh museum and Vietnamese history museum."

The staff were all friendly, helpful and efficient .The layout of the museum is perfect with signage in Vietnamese, English and French. Adequate written descriptions of all artefacts explaining the date, purpose and detail. We especially liked the selection of costumes and the explanation and examples of textile techniques. The museum shop is worth a visit with well priced gifts and mementoes. The coffee shop is also an excellent stop with a range of coffees and refreshments. A perfect sightseeing and informative venue."

The history was so interesting as well as impressive; the role that women have taken in Vietnam's history and the social standing they still enjoy surpasses any western country. I really enjoyed finding out about traditional Vietnamese culture as well as more about the wars that have moulded the country into the nation it is now. I would say take your time, I spent around 2 hours there and I would have preferred to have a little more time. It's pretty cold in the museum so take a jacket."

It shows that women have the courage, nationalism, and viciousness that is usually attributed to men. It's worth 1-2 hours visit for the price.

You will learn a lot about women in Vietnam and therefore also about men, children, politics, history, ethnic groups, religion, marriage ceremonies, fashion, women in war times, heroes... I totally agree with a previous review that the movie about the street vendors is most interesting, but there are many more movies which are not to miss.

Work never ends. And the women of war who fought alongside their men and helped rebuild the country, literally and figuratively, thereafter.

The area displaying worship of the Mother Goddess was interesting. The two sections that most attracted us were the short movie of women street vendors describing their lives and why they needed to work so incredibly hard. Westerners just don't know. The section recording the sacrifices of individual women in the struggles against invaders since and including the Japanese has, by far, the most impact. What I found most striking of all is that the state, in a third world country, has recognised and institutionalised the role and equality of women. An average attempt at presentation but an outstanding social comment and well worth visiting."

You are actually given interesting information about the exhibits and each of the floors has narrative. There are four floors in total. The attic held a temporary art exhibit, which was not worth the space. The lower three floors have exhibits on women's clothing (a good introduction to the costumes of the minority ethnic tribes if you are going to visit Sapa), family life (including a fascinating glimpse into patriarchal and matriarchal societies of the North and South), and the role of the goddess in religion.I particularly found moving the exhibits on the contribution of women in the war of independence and one on the life of street vendors. The former included real life stories of the brave contribution made by so many. The latter will make you look differently at the hawker who approaches you in the hope that you may spend a few cents on some food. The money will probably mean nothing to most tourists but it could help a child to finish high school...Well done to all those connected to this museum. It is history and education at its best. It cost just 30000 dong - less than \u00a31 - to enter. The museum is about a 10 minute walk from the bottom of )Hoan Kiem Lake."

Find the woman who personally killed 150 American soldiers. Note too that women have been warriors in wars going back at least 2,000 years. I got very lucky and was invited to a concert at the museum where the Mother Goddess appeared, sang, danced, metamorphosed from one personality to another, and gave out gifts--all to the accompaniment of traditional Vietnamese instruments.

The staff are also friendly too & able to give me a direction for traveling in HANOI ( where to go & where to visit). The location was good, not to far from the other museum & opera house. What I don't like from the museum was the smelt of the exhibitions good or display, the room may need an air freshener. Perhaps the management have an attention on it.Regards,Carindra UNTORO"

The clothing displays were of secondary interest to me. But there were some excellent videos and photographs depicting women's varied roles in subsistence activities and also, during their struggle for independence. I knew little of the minority women's roles as fighters during the American/Vietnam war. Overall, an enjoyable visit. Be sure to check out the gift shop on the first floor.

(I skipped the fashion floor). The museum's exhibits, photographs, and artwork provide a lasting picture on the importance of women in Vietnam in cultural, historical, and artistic perspectives. The experience left me with the perception, perhaps inaccurate but probably the intent of the museum's curators, that women in Vietnamese society experience less discrimination than in many Western cultures."

Make this one of the first places you see in Hanoi as it makes the temple symbology make sense. Great little cafe. I enjoyed a Vienna coffee & my friend enjoyed a lovely drink too. Even gate crashed an art opening. Child friendly family friendly with beautiful souvenirs to boot. Highly recommended."

I found it on Trip Advisor and was directed there by my Hanoikids guide. She (my guide) said it is not in the books, and when I checked I found she was correct. The exhibits are top-notch and the size is substantive while not being overwhelming. Coming from another culture, I found the information to be eye-opening both historically and culturally. I was surprised with Hoa Lo Prison had half dedicated to the women prisoners. After visiting the Women's Museum I was able to have a full understanding of how significant a role women have played in all parts of life in Vietnam for a very long time. It was one of my favorite experiences in Hanoi."

Each floor was different in content and very insightful. It was not all we expected as we were expecting more of a an emphasis on historic figures. However it was more of a timeline of womens roles in everything ranging from the war, to child rearing and marriage. It was a great cultural insight into the way in which world traditions are carried out. There was also a heroic tribute to female revolutionaries!"

The museum provides a great insight into the lives of Vietnamese women throughout their lives and throughout history. The highlight of the museum for me were the video displays into the lives of the women selling fruit/flowers etc on the side of the street. You see a lot of propaganda in Vietnam but the stories from these women seems quite genuine leaving a very poignant feeling lingering. The video of the wedding celebrations was another highlight. I was both suprised and delighted to see a video in a museum showing people drinking beers, taking shots, and stumbling around in front of the camera."

We agree that is is a fascinating museum focusing on the role of women in Vietnam through history and today, particularly their role during the American War as guerillas, spies, generals and organisers. We spent 1.5 hours and perhaps that was a little short. I liked the film clips though lack of time makes it impossible to watch all of them. The series of conversations with street traders was most interesting and gave a true perspective on the reality of life today for many Vietnamese. Unfortunately for all exhibits, the use of white writing on a red or blue perspex backing made all the writing extremely hard to read. There is reflection from lights and shadows, and the print is small! The translation is the best English we saw throughout Vietnam, however it is extremely tiring on the eyes trying to make out the words. Nothing beats, black print on a white background in a size 14+ font! Please consider adding this to the exhibits.Other than this practical drawback, it is a well organised museum and gives visitors a thorough understanding of the economic and political and cultural aspects of Vietnam from a women's perspective. Absolutely recommend to women and men keen to understand life in Vietnam - past and present. Women are the driving force behind the family and culture and economy, if not it's decision-makers!"

The museum is definitely worth a visit (and it's only in the French Quarter - a 15 minute walk from the centre of the Old Quarter) as it shows you the important and under appreciated role of women across Vietnam throughout the ages. There is a little shop at the end and there is a nice cafe outside the steps at the entrance of the museum. The entry fee is only 20,000 Vietnamese Dong (about $1USD, \u00a30.60GBP) and is definitely well worth it. There are secure lockers at the entrance of the museum to leave your bag (as you're not allowed to take your bag inside)."

I met a couple here who thought that they wouldn't go as the man might nbot be into it, but I persuaded them as the museum looks at so many of the important milestones and cultural aspects of Vietnam which come from women and give great insight into the traditions of the country.The permanent floors include exhibitions on marriage and birth (no gruesome pictures though), women in history, family life and women heroes. These were really interesting and include explanations in Vietnamese, English and French, making it all really clear. Some good, honest and frank videos too about women in the culture, spoken in Vietnamese and subtitled in English and French. I went with my Mum and we both really enjoyed it and could have spent more time there. Wish there were such a good tribute to women in London Museums!"

In terms of presentation, this museum was excellent and very well-maintained and surprisingly so as entry fee was only VND 30,000 (AU$ 1.50 give or take). The lobby had a locker area and a nice, souvenir shop, different to what I've seen in other shops about town.We went there on a particularly hot day, the main exhibition was airconditioned although it wasn't cold enough it was decent. The stair area weren't airconditioned.The content of the museum was amazing, it broke down patrilineal, matrilineal and ambilineal societies as normally one tribe to another practice different lineage, Vietnamese women's different traditional wear from north to south, pregnancy and birth traditions. It was all a rush of information that I missed to look into prior to my trip to Vietnam. I wasn't aware the level of acknowledgment of women's role in Vietnamese culture, there are more aspects than I anticipated where Vietnam is more forward thinking in gender equality than most South-East Asian countries. That's not to say inequality doesn't exist but they have less work to do to reach the gender equality goal.Definitely worth a couple hour out of your time in Hanoi to visit."

The entrance fee here is very cheap, and it is a four or five story building with each floor dedicated to one aspect of Vietnamese women's lives (family/fashion/war/marriage etc). The exhibits were interesting but I found there was less to see, and more to learn. I could have probably learnt just as much researching from home on the internet. The museum was also very hot so lots of water was a must."

A 'women's museum' doesn't necessarily give the right marketing message as I know this would cause some people to pass this by - more fool them. The museum is three floors dedicated to: women's contribution to the war, their role in family life and women's fashions; but it really gives an overall review of Vietnamese society.The exhibits are interesting and there are good explanatory texts (as far as I can remember in a variety of languages - at least Vietnamese, French and English). The key exhibits for me were the short films that play in the side-rooms off the main hall on each floor describing the lives of contemporary Vietnamese women; you will learn a new found sense of admiration for the street vendors when you understand their lives, you'll maybe even then be tempted to buy a few doughnuts as a result .....The Museum is easy to navigate, well air-conditioned, the displays are well attended to, has helpful staff, clean facilities etc. and will certainly provide 1-2 hours of interesting history and social documentary. there is a shop, a cafe and the location is pretty central and near other exhibits."

I enjoyed the area that focuse on various traditions and dress codes of Ethnic minority groups. And was especially impressed with the section that focuses on the women who fought so bravely during the American/Vietnam war. In this country of hard working, courageous, family orientated people, it is always the women who shine out brightly. I loved to see this being honoured in this museum. I guess I am biased being a woman but my male companion on the day found it equally interesting."

There is a detailed display of marriage and children. There is also a beautiful display of women's fashion on the 4th floor but they do not tell you what minorities wore them. Having just traveled from Sapa it would have been nice to know which clothing came from what minority group. The Women's Museum is worth a visit if you have an extra hour or two in the city."

The Vietnamese Women's Museum (B\u1ea3o T\u00e0ng Ph\u1ee5 N\u1eef Vi\u1ec7t Nam) will help you understand why. As the 2nd floor exhibit illustrates (with photos, propaganda posters and other material artifacts), Vietnam's women played a pivotal role in the country's spectacularly war-ridden history. The museum has three other floors, each of which explores a different aspect of women's lives, from marriage and childbirth to fashion and ethnic costumes. My favorite was obviously the second, for it's chill-inducing stories of women soldiers and their efforts in both in south and north Vietnam from the beginning of the communist revolution until liberation. Other points of interests were the floor dedicated to the Mother Goddess and the video documentary with women street vendors in Hanoi. Overall, an excellent way to spend a morning or afternoon in Hanoi."

The women's perspective is important to recognise even if you're not a feminist historian, and gender roles in Vietnam's history are incredibly interesting, so it's a must-see. Free Wi-Fi too! I would go in the late afternoon - if you really like museums, maybe plan for two hours, and finish off with a look around Hao Lo Prison (500m away) which closes at 5pm."

However, I wonder if other people know this because the museum was brimming with westerners, all of which were women (either solo or in groups). Perhaps it was just a coincidence, or perhaps guys avoid this place because of the name? Who knows.I am usually not a fan of museums, but this one held my interest for awhile. There are a bunch of videos to watch throughout the exhibits and they mostly have English subtitles. The one that affected me the most was the one about women selling stuff on the streets of Hanoi. I no longer look at them as annoying pests, but instead have a new respect for them (many come from the countryside out of desperation and would rather be living in their home villages).The museum has a lot of info covering 4 floors and depending on your attention span it could take up anywhere from 1-3+ hours of time to fully explore.As I said, I am not a fan of museums, but this one seems worthy of visiting."

Number 1 was the Old Quarter which we had done (and after 10 days we were shopped out), and number 2 was the Vietnam Woman\u2019s Museum. So we headed there.It is an excellent very well done museum. And the only thing I would recommend would be to do this early in your Vietnam holiday and not last. The museum gives excellent insight to the many women you see carting their wares on their bicycles, or carrying them in huge loads on the double ended poles they carry on their shoulders, and then selling their wares on the street. The museum covers Vietnamese woman in the family, religion, wars, and fashion. Very memorable. They also have a nice tasteful gift shot."

On 4 floors a great overview is given in the role women played in Vietnamese history, defending their proud country and progressing society as mothers and those that create families. It humbled me as a oerson from the opposite sex. Very subtle, moving through the museum, one is brought to the role of women in todays Vietnamese society. This part is well done. I very much liked the videos of the women who sell their goods in the streets. These people lead difficult lives for a few dollars per day.The museum is worth a visit, as it also nicely shows the spiritual connection of womanhood to familial leadership (Mother Goddess). The only thing that bemused me was to see an obstetric forceps on exhibition with the label: 'Forceps - Device to purify the newborn'."

There are various exhibits about women and their lives in Vietnam, all with English commentary. The most interesting I thought was a video about the lives of women street sellers and the whole section on the Vietnam War (known as the American War, in Vietnam).It was the first time my wife and I had thought about this war from the Vietnamese point of view (as all previous knowledge was from US films) and this museum certainly shows the war from the opposite point of view and highlights the heroism of the Vietnamese women as well as the futility of war. Having said that, the museum in HCMC was even better regarding this.It is not a far walk from here to the Hoa Lo Prison which we thought was even more interesting than the women's museum."

They had a lot of examples of what all different type of vietnamese wore from the north to the south. What I wish they had more of was stories of modern woman. Or a video of women from the past. They had many quick bios of the women from revolutionary war, but didn't emphasize a lot on any certain ones. I think if you're in the area and have time to kill, it's a good place to visit."

The video on the life stories of the famous hawkers carrying merchandise on their shoulder poles gave me a compelling picture of how hard those women work to support their families.I think I spent close to an hour in the wartime history section alone. While there are many exhibits related to the Communist Party, I felt that the museum takes great pains to go beyond political preferences and reach out to a global audience with stories that touch us all. The story of the 10 young girls (who were hit by a US bomb while repairing bomb craters on a road) reminded me of similar stories that took place on Okinawa in 1945, and drove me to tears.After those two hours, I think I have come to appreciate the true beauty that lies behind their smiles and ao dais."

There are 6 floors; all but the top floor being dedicated to a different area of life, such as marriage ceremonies and rituals, fashion, and women's contribution to the war efforts. There is a lot to see and read about so I'd recommend allowing 2-3 hours for your visit, especially if you want to read many of the stories of the dozens of remarkable women the gallery pays homage to, or if you are hungry and decide to stop by their cafe.Pros:-Professional displays, with good lighting and excellemt translations of each exhibit into English and French.-Detailed forays into fascinating aspects of life in Vietnam over the past 50 years for women, with lots about nuances between regions, and ethnicities and tribes.-Very well laid out, with no panicking about where to start and finish each exhibition and which way to circulate.-amazingly cheap at only 30,000 VND each ($1.40/90p).Con:-Dirty toilet with no towel or tissue paper."

I loved seeing the fashion and different dress. One of the highlights for me was a movie they played that was a documentary containing interviews of the female street vendors. It really explained why the women have to sell items and food on the street. It was sad to hear how hard they have to work for such little pay."

From stunning garments to the detailed role Vietnamese women have played in conflict and protecting their country from invading forces, each exhibit is thoughtfully displayed. As an observer you are invited to travel on a journey through the milestone of Vietnamese women's culture without any cheap sentimentality - a really worthwhile visit."

One gets to explore the role and context of women in society and in the many different Vietnamese cultures. In one segment the women who sell their flowers and rice cakes and other wares on the street talk about their lives, I found this to be particularly moving. Becoming acquainted with the achievements some of the women that are excelling in business or as social entrepreneurs was also a highlight.The exhibit on the role of women in the military and the many and various wars in the history of this country left me quite thoughtful. Even more more poignant than the feats and achievements of these women - 15 battles fought, 150 killed or wounded, twice captured, 3 Dakota's shot down, met Uncle Ho 5 times - is what is said by omission. How many died? How did they suffer? How did the many wars impact the lives of men and women and children?Vietnam remains a tricky place to become acquainted with in a real way, I do think a visit to this museum brings one a small step closer to a knowing."

This is a great museum- it really focuses on daily life in Vietnam by looking at it through the lenses of marriage, pregnancy and childbirth, the role of women in the shaping of the country during the American war, and the possibilities for the future. On the first floor, don't miss the video interviews with women street vendors- their stories are quite revealing and often touching. They spend all of their waking moments working to help their families and yet they are so strong and so hopeful. The section on marriage ceremonies is interesting in part because it is divided into matrilinear and patrilinear based cultures/ethnic groups. I was really impressed with clear respect and emphasis given to the women who fought during the- it is a level of recognition of women's efforts I have not see in any other museum. This was a great museum and I highly recommend a visit. (There is a school right next door- peering into the windows as the students studied or recited was fun. It was even better to witness the 'let out of school' scene with tons of scooters and parents waiting for their kids to come out and all the chatter amongst the kids.)"

The cost is 30.000 VND (a little less than $1.50 US), 20.000 VND for students. I entered, expecting to spend only 2-3 hours and spent the entire day there (6 hours) with two breaks: having lunch as well as a soda in The Museum Cafe. Good prices and very tasty. Eat there, you won't be disappointed if you don't order fries and order rice instead. The oil is not hot enough, making the fries full of oil. Yuck.I only spent time on the second and third floors of the main museum, fascinated by their information, graphics and exhibits. Don't miss the film about the street vendors selling trinkets, fresh fruit or doughnut-like things made with heavy rice flour. The taste is not that of a \"usual\" donut that one would order in the US: heavier, tougher, GREASIER and sweeter than any apple fritter! Their lives are very hard and they have no other way to try to support themselves. When you learn how much they take home to their families each month, you must know that many earn less than $50 US per month in Viet nam outside of the three or four major cities. The first floor relates how women marry, marriage customs and childbirth (with notations describing rituals and local beliefs). This is a \"slow\" room, expansive and not overwhelming. If you read everything (all titles and notations are in Vietnamese, English and French), it can easily take an hour or two, more if you really look at the wedding ritualistic gowns and the implements used for birthing and taking care of one's baby.The second floor, referred to by some as the \"propaganda\" room here on this site, documents women through history. There is an area before entering where a film on women through the history of Viet Nam begins with the year 40 BCE with a woman who lead a successful war against the Chinese and continues to the contribution of women in the 21st century. It plays in two languages: French and English. I sat through the French and wanted to see it again as it is fascinating. Well, the second time through, it is in English. So, be patient. Learning the role of women in the various conflicts, something for the West only shown in glorified war films, is very real and touching. In the area before entering, there is a set of three walls with pictures of Vietnamese medal recipients (many posthumously) for their service. Sit there, look around. Look at the faces of these old women, many now deceased, and wonder what they did, their sacrifices for their homeland: Imagine their suffering and of those who knew them. When you go into the main room, it creates perspective as well as a greater appreciation for what you will see. Inside of the main gallery, it is much less spacious than on the second floor. It begins with the work of those supporting the government of the north beginning in 1945. Yes, it is VIETNAMESE history, NOT propaganda. Remember that the North won the war despite the massive power used against them by the French and then the Americans. Women of all ages, spied, supported the troops and even fought and died for and in their activities. The war posters are wonderful to see as well and all are translated into English and French.Yes, many will remember the deaths of the French, Americans and others who were young; however, this is an accounting of the role of Vietnamese \"women,\" not men! Personal possessions, usually very minute, are shown, making one wonder about her use of that item, leading each of us, if open and able, to reach into each one's heart and feelings.It becomes severely personal and, for some, that may be hard: from the tough life of street vendors, through childbirth and marriage and, then, into the tragedy of many wars.Yes, if you get ANY sense of this, the \"humanity\" of these people will strike you deeply and you will take home a profound sense of the role of women in Viet Nam, warts and all!"

One section was dedicated to women who assisted during the Vietnam Conflict. There was an entire wall of women heroes who were considered heros, but it did not include the names of the individuals which seemed rather sad because they didn't get recognized for their accomplishments.

A girl in my Hotel recommended it to me, she especially pointed out the videos of the street vendors. On my first visit I was on my own, enjoying the 4 floors full of information, every floor has its own subject like \"family\", \"tradition\", \"north and south\", \"clothes\". The museum is made with an eye for details and is packed with objects from history (like a painting a young girl made in war time) and every day life. A lot of colored and black and white photographs demonstrate different stations in vietnamese women's lifes like harvesting, family life, history. The interviews with the streetvendors give a precious insight in their everyday life and their individual stories, there are further interviews with a doctor, a translator and a fashiondesigner. Only the fith floor that is refering to a museum in Singapore is less interesting. My second and third visit was with friends, who loved the museum as well. Next door is the women's museum cafe, a nice place with a cheap and tasty lunch offer and a big choice of beverages, I often meet up in there with friends."

The first floor \"Women in Family\" was good, particularly for new baby rituals and marriage arrangements. The second floor \"Women in History\" was absolutely fantastic. Please take your time to read all of the women's war heroics/contributions to their war effort and do watch the movies. Also the 'propaganda' posters were very interesting! . Third floor: \"Women's Fashion\". Super fine silk embroidery detail and how Vietnamese female designers are influencing today's fashion. On the ground floor, the '\"Discovery Room\" was interesting and quite fun; although the shop was just OK. The toilets INSIDE the museum were clean. For 30,000 Viet Dong entry, it was well worthwhile. There is also a nice cafe outside."

The representation of minority groups was also impressive. The little video presentations dotted around we're great. Well worth a visit. I fell a little bit more in love with Vietnam as a result!"

The contemporary designed building is really catchy along the street dominated by the buildings from French Colonial Era. We were guided by HanoiKids, so we had no problem to reach the museum.The museum is open from 8 am - 5 pm, seven days a week, with entrance fee of 30,000 Dong per person. Be noted that some of the museum in Hanoi are closed on Friday and Monday. Locker are available on the ground floor of the museum, but visitors are allowed to bring their belongings into the exhibition hall.The museum was built to honour the women's contribution to Vietnam. From costume of wedding, the tools for farming and fishing, to the fire arms that the women of Vietnam used in the fight against the intruders.By naming it a museum, we had in fact a higher expectation on it. However, it was more to an exhibition hall than a museum. However, with about 20,000 objects exhibited, it took us one hour to just take a quick round trip in the museum. Is it worth a visit? For us, it is a big \"Yes\". It is a good place for us to learn more about Vietnam."

The three floors are dedicated to: women's contribution to the war of liberation, family life, and fashions. I found the story of women's role in what Vietnamese call 'the American war' fascinating. The exhibits are well chosen and there are good explanatory texts (in Vietnamese, French, and English).Also of interest are the videos that play in the side-rooms off the main hall on each floor. These videos are about the lives of contemporary VietNamese women - everything from successful fashion designers to poor street vendors. One story - a woman who founded a home for orphans - was particularly moving.I went with low expectations, but came away feeling I had spent a very interesting morning."

You can also find some education about ethnic minority unique fashion and textiles on Women's Fashion floor.There is a Japanese Dolls exhibition on-going during our visit in a separate annexe at the Museum compound with photography opportunities (with kimono wear) for children / teens, and my what a frenzy the atmosphere was. A fine example on how we can encourage young ones to visit Museum by combining relevant activity(s) of interest of this generation.Highly recommended. Allocate at least 2 hours or more to enjoy this cultural experience!"

A really enjoyable visit and insight into the role women play in Vietnam, both in the past, through the war years and now in modern day Vietnam. What comes through is how tough and determined the women have been and still are. Not just during the Vietnam war, but through out the uprising against French rule women played a pivotal part in helping defeat both regimes, obtaining equality that many nations still struggle to achieve now.The heritage and culture through the ages also comes through, and what you soon realise when you get into the countyside is that although the women have an equal footing the old customs are still alive and well. Particularly poignant are the stories about the women you see carrying huge loads of fruit etc. on their shoulders around the streets if Hanoi on a daily basis to help support their families back home on the farms. The long hours and weeks away from home life are very touching. Helps put into perspective that holiday snap you've just taken and the 50 cents saving you have just archived from five minutes hard bargaining.Spent nearly 2 hours in the here, a welcome relief from the heat of the day and a fascinating insight into real life. Well worth the entrance fee and more than enough of interest to suit any blokes. So take your time and take some I interest. Surprising what you might learn."

There is a very revealing short documentary film, prepared by an American university team, which portrays the lives of women who ply their wares, fruit, vegetables, street-food or small objects, around the streets of Hanoi, most of whom are rural women having to work extremely long hours in order to make a little extra money for their beleaguered families, often spending many weeks away from home. To hear that such families earn little more than a couple of hundred dollars a year and still have to pay for education and health-care, is a chastening experience. Much of the museum is taken up with the role of women in the Vietnamese struggle for independence, first against the French and then the US. There is no triumphalism just a very factual account of what they all went through. And finally, there are exhibitions of weddings, births, family occasions and, of course, the history of women's work. Altogether an unmissable experience."

Captions are in Vietnamese, English and French.The museum is well worth a visit to learn more about birth, marriage, family organisation and the role Vietnamese have played in various conflicts in the country.One thing I would recommend before going is to learn the basics of the various conflicts in Vietnam as some of the captions talk about the enemy etc. but don't mention which country is the enemy. Simply knowing who was involved in each conflict, who was considered the enemy and rough dates will help the conflict floor make more sense.Out of the museums I visitied in Hanoi I think this was probably the best."

One woman infiltrated the American offices in Saigon as a clerk and provided \"valuable information\" to the north. In 1954, according to the museum, \"the north was liberated while the south continued to fight for freedom against the aggressor America\" or something like this. As the saying goes, winners write history.The display of textiles was more interesting but lacked context with regard to the war heros. Why these two as a focus? I went away wondering what else Vietnamese women contributed to its history. Science? Music? Literature? I guess I should have gone to other museums to find out.Entry fee was about $2.

First floor was marriage, food, and childbirth. Second floor was dedicated to women and war- incredible. Third was fashion. I only had an hour here. I could have spent at least double that. I did buy some scarves and stuff from the shop. I was lucky to meet the director and she sad proceeds go straight to the women who make the crafts. I asked her why the prices were so low in comparison to most museum shops. She told me that the women would rather sell more and get the money than hold out for a higher priced item. I was happy to hear that the women in villages around Hanoi are truly benefiting. So if you visit there, buy! It will definitely go to the greater good in need."

There were some interactive exhibitions were fun and believe that more of this kind of exhibit would improve the experience. Also I was keen to hear about Vietnamese women's journey towards gender equality and political rights (a subject I know little about)I think some people were unhappy that the museum focused on the role of women in communist victory. Well I think that you should expect that considering this is a communist country and as most museums get public support from the party it is a case of \"whomever pays the piper calls the tune\" remember that history is written by the victors and this is no exception (probably museums in the US, UK or rest of the world are guilty of the same sort of bias)"

It is quite interesting, but it would be sooo much better if it was an outdoor exhibition and/or if the whole place would be in a more traditional facility. It seems somehow too modern for the history it tells, but it certainly tells an interesting history."

            "review": "An enjoyable must for great background information.. This is a really good museum. In addition to all of the wonderful information and displays about Vietnamese culture from the feminine perspective (birth, marriage, fashion, costumes, rituals, work life and war) for the next several months there is an exhibition of 301 portraits of Heroic Mothers of Vietnam. This is a title bestowed upon women whose husbands or children have died in Vietnam's struggles for freedom. Artist Dang Ai Viet travelled all over Vietnam (35000Km) on her Chally Scooter from Feb 2010 until June 2012 to meet and paint the women. Her scooter is there. Also her notebooks and maps etc.At first it is overwhelming to see walls and walls of unique watercolours. The capturing of the faces, demeanour, and grace of each mother is different. There is a small explanation in English and French beneath each portrait. It might say that Madame was born in 1919 and her 4 sons died for the country or more usually that sons or daughters died in 1952, 1979, 1968 and so on. The artwork is excellent. It is a marvel that one woman could do all this work so well, travelling in all sorts of conditions, often on dodgy roads, getting accommodation where she could, and with small funds. In addition to the practical difficulties of getting to nearly every province, Dang Ai Viet had to manage her emotions when she found many times that she had arrived at a remote village too late. The Mother had died. There are poignant mementoes, mostly parting gifts from sons - one, a tin cup not ever used by the mother, lest it should become damaged or broken! It is very moving to emerse oneself in the space.The exhibition is just near the ticket office ($2 each) and I was glad we saw this first because we could skip parts of the main building even though it was so engaging. Another reviewer nailed it when she said you will never look the same way again, at those women walking around carrying fruits etc. hoping for a sale. They are usually living away from the their family on a farm that requires another income. She works all week, pays rent to sleep in a room with 9 others and travels back to see her husband and children when she can. The section about women and work is really well done.In the section about beliefs we saw a video about the Mother Goddess ceremony and were actually lucky enough to see (and participate) in such a ceremony in Bac Ha several days later. So it's always worth popping in to the local temple! This museum is a must for background information."

The descriptions on the display panels were very informative but the exhibits are quite simple. For me, the most interesting section was the one that covered women's role in the war. It showed how many of them took on high positions in the resistance at a young age as well as their tenacity and sacrifices. The other exhibits showed the lives of women in Vietnam, including the hill tribes, such as marriage and motherhood."

A recent one was on the life of the women coming in from the rural areas, going to the Long Bien market in the early hours, then selling their goods by day and night in the streets of Hanoi, They are the same ones you can see sleeping on every street corner just after mid-day.It also explains the role of religion in Vietnam and the work done by the women in the recent resistance to the French, Japanese and Americans. We regularly revisit this museum just to better understand and to see what's new. It is undoubtedly the best of Hanoi's museums and has a nice handicrafts store attached. Don't miss it."

A lot of the displays were about ethnic minority women and not the average Viet ethnicity, which I wasn't expecting. This museum should be near the top of your list of museums to visit in Hanoi."

It was quiet and staff ran around turning on lights every time we approached an exhibit. Some of the exhibits were interesting and it gave a reasonable sense of the role women play in each of the ethnic groups in Vietnam. That said it was a little monotonous at times and in places felt a little too much like a mouthpiece for Socialist state propaganda."

However, on reaching the women in war section I quickly became desensitised as the exhibit didn't really give any information about women on the other side or the ones that worked outside the Viet Cong or women's general role in society. All there was was a series of pictures of Viet Cong female members, their rank, how many they killed and how they died etc. It seemed to be a top 20 female army commanders exhibit rather than one examining the role of women in the war. The other floors showed exhibits about family life, wedding rituals (which coming from a different culture I found interesting) and the role of women in religion (which although I read every bit of info I still felt a little lost on) as well as a bit about traditional crafts, farming and agricultural roles of women in villages.I found some of the details throughout the museum to vary from vague to non-existent bodering on propoganda so visit the musem with an open mind. The best bit about the museum was a short documentary about the role of women as street vendors, and I felt I learned more about their plight and everyday life in society than anything else in the museum."

There was an honesty and rawness on show which, being honest, is not too easy to find in Vietnamese museums. But, sadly, when I got to the war section, the governments handprints were all over it and I left feeling lied to. Again. There are two sides to every conflict, and it jarred with me that the only heroic women in the Vietnam war happened to be on the Viet Cong side. There wasn't a single exhibit about any of the women who found themselves on the other side of the conflict. It's like they didn't exist. There weren't any exhibits detailing the pain and suffering endured by Vietnamese women during the war- just medals of Heroic Mothers, propaganda photos of 5 foot nothing Vietnamese women pointing a gun at 6 foot plus US soldiers etc. It was a brutal war. But step into any museum in this country and you'd swear it was a glorious victory parade where anyone who died actually wanted to die. Crass."

I especially enjoyed the religious ceremonies with the women taking an active role as intermediaries representing the various deities. As a tourist, I saw many women taking on strong roles in the economic progress of the country and the livelihood of their families and the museum helped me to understand their strength and challenges at a deeper level.Some tourists complained about the propanada in the women in war section, but I didn't find this offensive, even as an American. Women always sacrifice their children and husbands and often their own lives during war. The fact that Vietnam fought a long and painful war of independence against France before the civil war and U.S. involvement underscores the pain and sacrifices of several generations of women."

The displays are arranged so that they are easy to understand and information is provided in Vietnamese, English and French.The museum also has exhibits. Last time I visited in May, there were exhibits about the life of workers in the night markets at Long Bien, the Mother Goddess and street vendors. All of these encourage a better understanding of life for women in Vietnam.One of the aspects of the museum that I really like is that it doesn't focus on well-known figures in Vietnamese history, although you will find some of these, but it is the views of everyday life and the extraordinary that comes from ordinary lives that makes this museum a great one for me."

The first is all about women and their obvious love to get married and have babies, another section is what women like to wear and the middle section arguably the most imformative but still not very indepth was the role women playing during the American war.There was not one word about women authors, painters or political women or women in powerful roles. There was no discussion about the role the modern Veitnamese women are taking in shaping the new Vietnam or about how womens views have changed over the generations.This place was more than a waste of money, time & efffort it was saddening in its wasted opportunity."

The exhibits were displayed in a fashion where footprints on the floor directed you from start to finish to see the exhibits in the correct order, which was helpful. Interesting personal accounts of hard-working Vietnamese women which provided an insight into their lives. I thought the section about the celebrations/princesses/religion-type things a bit boring. Fashion section was okay but the best was the family-life section and their side-exhibit about domestic abuse, working life, and rehabilitation programmes. Cost only 20,000D which was worth it."

And I loved how the museum mixed the cultural practices of women from the variety of ethnic backgrounds in Vietnam with the history of women in Vietnam. It even had a section on fashion, and interviews with street vendors, which were great.If I had any complaint, it was that the museum was too focused on women from the recent past (Last 100 years or so). This is a problem a lot of Vietnamese museums have, I noticed, but knowing that there were a great number of Vietnamese influential women in history during earlier centuries made me a bit dissapointed that all they got was one paragraph on a wall of text, and aren't mentioned at all in the women of history exhibit."

She earnt only enough to go home(in the country) once a month with $20 in her pocket for her young family. Her husband made $60 a year raising pigs. In hanoi she stays in a boarding house with 10 others paying .35c a day for the little sleep she gets. Very moving & gave me a new appreciation of hard work. Worth a visit."

They are very strong women who not only work miles away from home to support their familes now, but played a huge role in the wars. Many have been awarded for their bravery, which I think is not known by many people. It was interesting to also learn about the Mother worship, everyday lives including marriage and childbirth, and also traditional clothing."

Vietnamese women are really the backbone of the country. In the Women's museum are three floors, each floor dedicated to a different topic, family life, costumes trough the ages and women during the wars. During the visit to the museum you get a good impression of the role and influence of women in the Vietnamese society. To be recommended."

Of course, women have a special place in Vietnam. In the past some of the greatest patriots such as Ba Trieu and Hai Ba Trung (look at the road signs) were famous female generals and a whole floor is given over to Vietnamese women in war, especially the long haired army of the American War. The museum teaches you a lot about why Vietnamese women are special and is a good lesson to both women and men.

It was only 30,000vnd to enter, but I'm afraid that I found it a little boring. Maybe this is because my partner and I are in our mid-twenties, but if you are short on time I'm give this one a miss."

You'll find fewer tourists here than at the Hanoi Hilton but it's infinitely more worthwhile a trip (and also very near by so you can in fact do both sites). I took my 9 year old and she was gripped. Simple but brilliant mix of media to give a protrait of Vietnamese women from belief systems about childbirth to their role in the 'American War' and what modern day women are achieving in Vietnam's current burgeoning economy. It's modern, colourful, well thought out but feels authentically Vietnamese. A great insight into Vietnamese society: traditional and modern. If you go to Hanoi do not miss it."

The style of this renovated museum was particularly pleasing aesthetically, as well as providing clear information in Vietnamese, English & French. While the textiles on display were of particular interest to me, other exhibitions on Street Vendors, Against Violence to Migrants, & the Mother Goddess were also absorbing. Certainly there seems to be a deeply respectful, ethical, & culturally sensitive approach to the subjects & themes being shown. The exhibitions aimed to provide some insight into the past as well as the very contemporary present. While Vietnamese people are well served by this very attractive museum, it is a real gem for the traveller wishing to gain more knowledge & understanding of Vietnamese women who after all, make up half the population! It certainly helps to bridge the cultural divide between different nationalities, ethnicities, genders as well as social classes. It was very inclusive & creative in approach, showing a different face to more traditional museums in this city. Congratulations must go to the director of this museum."

Some of the stories of women's contributions to Vietnamese history are powerful and very moving and it is great that they are honoured in this way. It is however very party oriented and I felt that what is missing is any real recognition of the many dynamic, professional women who are now making an enormous contribution to the country's development in many different sectors. Another small criticism is that some of the information about display is difficult to read because of poor presentation and lighting."

Hi,The womens museum was by and large similar to the ethnology museum but not as good showing the various costumes of the ethnic tribes and a lot of the rest was nationalistic propaganda which after a number of museums gets so repetitive, it's boring.I wouldn't rate it more than average.It mentions the various sacrifices mothers made by sending their sons off to war and being awarded medals for their losses but that is no different to any war really. Also, how the women stood by their country and took up jobs that men normally did. They could have been talking about British wives in World War II for that matter.Worth an hour if it's raining, I suppose. All attractions in Hanoi are not particularly large nor expensive with the cost being $1 to $1.50 an adult.It was on five floors and there was a lift for disabled visitors who can easily get around with the layout."

Top floor was a display on Vietnamese fashion highlighting ceremonial outfits for weddings and funerals. Third floor was role of women during French colonization and the American War (aka Vietnam War). Second floor, which I consider to be the most interesting, highlighted the role of women in Vietnam\u2019s economy and motherhood. First floor was a small gift shop.The second building had a single floor highlighting women in Vietnam\u2019s recent history of economic growth, urbanization, and migration from the countryside to urban areas. A few displays on literacy, economic challenges, drug abuse, etc. Quite surprised at how open the displays were to discuss the \u201cgrowing pains\u201d of a growing Vietnam.Would not plan my entire day around this museum, but if you have a couple of free hours, it is worth a visit."

Probably because it's funded by Western organisations, the logistics, setup and design of the exhibitions seem to be very professional and tastefully done by Western standards. What a pleasant surprise!!As a Hong Kong Chinese, I was not very interested in the 1st and 2nd floors dedicated to Vietnamese women's martial rituals, which are very similar to the Chinese. However, I am very impressed by the more upper floors that show the daily lives of women from ethnic minorities such as the Hmongs, with photos that show so much humanity, and informative and eye-opening videos (that show how they cook, and how they dye the clothes with natural sources), this is very interesting to me especially I missed the chance to visit these villages in Northern Thailand the month before. I also learned about the role of Vietnamese women in the society, especially during the Vietnam War, when they picked up their AK-47s and fought just like men. It's very awe-inspiring.You can easily spend three hours or more in this museum, because there's so much to learn and see. Highly recommended, maybe do this on a cloudy day!"

After seeing the high rating on Trip Advisor, friend (20 yo male) and I (21 yo female) decided to check it out.At 30,000VND entry, it's a bit pricier than other museums but it's still nothing to complain about. Note- you have to leave large bags in provided locker rooms (free of charge).There are 4 levels, each depicting different aspects of the lives of the Vietnamese women (i.e. marriage, birth, fashion etc.) and there is both an elevator or staircases between each level.While informative, my friend and I found it to be quite boring overall and nothing too special. The best part was hearing the life stories of some of the women street vendors in a documentary (English Subtitles). However, I'm sure you could find that sort of information without a museum. It was only a 7 minute video, but it was the most interesting thing out of the entire exhibition. The colourful costumes of the ethnic tribes on display were also interesting to look at, but if you make the trip out to Lao Cai/Sa Pa, you would see more of the same thing there anyway.The museum is very new still, so maybe they will develop it further yet. Looking around, I noticed the lack of men viewing the exhibition... generally speaking- maybe this might be a place catered more to the interests of women. Friend and I much preferred the Military Museum in Hanoi."

The museum gives you a picture of just how much women do to keep the country moving (a lot). There's a nice exhibit on marriage traditions among the different ethnic groups. Throughout the museum we enjoyed the video segments, including an enlightening mini-documentary on street vendors: why they come to the city, their living conditions, etc... It truly informed our understanding of the city and the videos enhanced our appreciation of the country.For history buffs, there's a huge segment on women in the war. Other floors included exhibits on birth and fashion. English signs were terrific. The gift shop is small without much to speak of. Don't be put off by the construction on the sidewalk in front of the museum - it's worth at least 45 minutes and the $1.50 entrance fee."

We were told by some other tourists that a French woman was dominant in putting together the current exhibition which, I hope, will be permanent. There are three floors of exhibits with different themes - family, dress and revolutionary women. Some of the old street vendor exhibits have been included and this includes a video providing background stories from female vendors. Translations are in both French and English."

            "review": "Videos throughout the Museum Make it Special. Throughout the museum are monitors that play videos about the life of women in Vietnam. Most are in English or captioned in English; some are in French. The video about the street vendors is especially eye-opening. The exhibit about women who helped shaped the future of the country by participating in its wars and revolutions was also fascinating to me (especially as I am American.) One floor shows examples of the traditional dress of some of the ethnic minorities. That floor also has videos and exhibits about traditions surrounding pregnancy and birth.There is a good restaurant next door to the museum."

My favorite was the exhibit on the street vendors. It was almost empty when we went and only cost 30,000 dong. Well worth the visit. Only takes an hour or so to go through."

            "review": "The Women's Museum Hanoi. A must see in Hanoi, spent a few hours just browsing through the most interesting history of the women of Vietnam, the first floor was the history of courtship and wedding ceremony dress and artifacts.The second floor contained women and the birthing process and methods used and the ceremony that is conducted depending on whether its a boy or girl. The third floor I found fascinating it was dedicated to the women who fought in all they're wars along side the men folk, not in a nursing capacity, but in actual hand to hand combat, the women who where tortured and kept in the tiger cages. This was long before western women were allowed alongside men in battle. Truly courageous women.Another floor was dedicated to the traditional women's dress through the ages including the garments of the hill tribes. Last but definitely not least the last floor was dedicated to the human trafficking, which is still happening today true stories of young women lured through various means into this illegal practice. It outlined the work the agencies do to rehabilitate these young women when they return to Vietnam so they can once again lead productive lives.A must see for any women in Hanoi, drag your husbands along for a look also."

But if you have time to spare, sure, why not.Pls keep in mind that Vietnam is a communist country. And a very historicAnd interesting city, Hanoi. It seems to be a center of trade and commerce."

Go on a guided tour so you can ask questions, and then go back and spend longer to have a closer look at what interests you. It is so moving, humbling and inspiring and puts into context and perspective the place women have had in Vietnamese history, particularly confict. Although the displays are not super slick and they are in need of repair, the content is superb. Keep aside a few hours to have a good look at all the photos and artefacts, and make sure you go to all 3 floors to get the breadth of history and contemporary life. Definately will return a visit to this place and recommend it to everyone as it is not just of interest to women."
