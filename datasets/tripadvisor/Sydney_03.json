            "review": "Coogee Beach to Bondi Beach Coast walk - even nice in the rain!. On a gray Sunday we parked at Coogee and headed towards Bondi on what is mostly a paved path right along the coastline. Sky & water views were spectacular as bursts of sunlight snuck through the clouds. A walk through Waverley Cemetery was most interesting. About half way along were 2 wild Macaws resting patiently on a fence post while eager walkers took photos. Out in the water were some whales. We got to Bondi and had brunch, then headed back. A third of the way the heavens opened and we were drenched! Still a great day out, and a great feeling to have walked it! Eager to do it again when Sculptures of the Sea is on!"

Today (until 5/11) there is an event called Sculptures at the Sea, this was fantastic, i am not sure if it was busier because of this event but well worth going to. Take a picnic. To get there go to Bondi Junction then get the bus to the North of Bondi. To get back from Coogee you can get a bus direct to the centre of Sydney, i think if i do this again i would go by bus to Coogee, much quicker and avoided the queue for the shuttle bus. I suspect this walk is fantastic in all weathers."

There are a lot of steps, sometimes quite steep but saying this there were quite a few people with push chairs. We were lucky enough to do this walk when the sculptures were there. They are well worth a look. We ended our walk at Iceburgs got a drink. You do need to fill in a form to get in as it members only but it only took a few minutes to do."

We made a stop in Bronte for a cold drink and some snacks - there were lots of places to sit with tables and benches or of course the beach. The walk has hilly parts and quite a few steps. The path on the whole is paved and very smooth so buggy friendly. Some steps can be a little uneven or a bit steeper than others but as long as you go knowing you will have to carry buggy, it is totally possible. We did it the day after we arrived in Sydney so our son was confused over time change but being able to walk with him in the buggy, stop when we needed and get him lots of fresh air, he napped when he needed. I think this was better for all of us than trying to get straight on to seeing the sights in busy parts of the city. There were loads of runners on the route - it would make a lovely run if it is easy enough for you to get to from where you were staying. Anyway- just stunning."

I used to run it a few times a day. I moved away then had to return for a funeral, so decided to do the run. The crowd was like a City to Surf run, 5 wide, had to run on the road! Very dangerous. Pick your time to do the walk, I'd say mid morning to mid afternoon, when everyone else is at work."

We often walk the Coogee Bondi walk, but today was beautiful to say the least.Me a local for 50 odd years and it still has the WOW effect.0745 start crowds minimal for a blue sky first few days of the display. But disappointing to still have the Waverley cemetery walkway section still not open due to storm damage but the walk through the cemetery is still well worth doing, see the resting places of the rich and famous, very elaborate headstones set with the most spectacular sea views.Tamarama beach looking pristine with the many pieces on display, a rhino in the sand and more.Marks park at the top of the hill with The Grounds cafe looking and feeling the goods a great spot to sit have a bite and a coffee to watch the world pass by. It's a must do in fact...excellent!Then Finnish off the walk over to the surf club the Icebergs to see the big handbag and more.The walk back to Coogee is the same path, beautiful, enjoy and just do it!"

The views along the cliff tops are worth the effort of climbing the steps involved. Just make sure to remember the sunscreen as there isn't much shade along the way. There are however quite a few bays and little beaches where you can find surf clubs selling ice creams and drinks if you get hungry or thirsty.Getting to Bondi Beach is easy. Just catch the 333 bus from Circular Quay - just don't get off at Bondi Junction by mistake. On your return why not catch the 380 to Watson's Bay and take the ferry back to Circular Quay. Just remember to get yourself an Opal card for quick, easy and relatively cheap transport around Sydney on the buses, trains and ferries."

Wow, the views from this walk are truly epic. I've visited many coastlines and must say, this was beautiful step after step. There was so much to see! The ever changing surf crashing on the rocks OR purposely crashing into a swimming pool and yes, the swimmers were having a great time with it. And the surfers! They were a show unto themselves as they tackled those waves. There are ample places to rest, safety bars to keep you on track, exits if you don't want to walk the entire way, and stops along the way for restrooms or a bite to eat. We also enjoyed seeing the lovely (sometimes quirky) homes that overlook the coast as well as the native habitats that AUS is hoping to preserve. We dressed in layers and that's probably best for any time of the year in Australia! Happy trekking!"

The Bondi to Coogee coast walk is number one - totally free, it show aces one of the most beautiful coastal strips of our city.It's an easy walk along coastal cliffs and past some of our best beaches and is suitable for all ages and fitness levels. Number two is to just simply catch a commuter ferry - but that's a different review of its own."

This has to be the best walk in Sydney visiting great beaches that are minutes from the city - those Europeans don't know the meaning of the word beach. the walk does require negotiating a few hundred steps along the way. Every day is pure magic on this stunning walk an depending on the season there can be whale watching opportunities and the annual Sculptures by the Sea exhibition which is featured along the path and on Tamarama beach (late October to early November). Check out the great houses along the path too especially those south of Coogee beach. I live nearby and still get a buzz each time, even though it is in my backyard - I wish!. You can dial up the distance depending on how much time you have and bail out and catch a bus/taxi/uber. There are also plenty of cafes along the way at each of the bigger beaches to choose from."

Pick a clear sunny day (quite frequent in Sydney), make sure you have camera & good walking shoes, and head out from Bondi Beach to Coogee (or vice versa). You will not be disappointed!Total distance takes approximately 1 1/2 hours at a relaxed pace, but not including time for photographs or just view-gazing. Broken down, walking times are: Bondi Beach to Tamarama Beach 15 min; Tamarama to Bronte 20-25 min; Bronte to Clovelly 20-25 min and Clovelly to Coogee 30-35 min.The coastal walk goes along the road in two places, but mostly it runs along the cliff high above the ocean. At numerous points, one can leave the walk and catch a bus back to your starting point.Be warned, there are a lot of steps in some sections, particularly Clovelly to Coogee. There are fountains of filtered water along the way, for pets too! When you arrive in Coogee (or Bondi Beach if doing it in reverse), there are numerous cafes where you can rest & enjoy a cool drink or casual meal.All in all, an extremely pleasant half-day excursion!"

The breathtaking scenery of this coastal walk will take up all your attention while you get guided through little coastal settlements girt by the sea. Would do anytime again.

It would seem there is a beach for all occasions and tastes along the way, each has its own unique character. We particularly liked Bronte and Coogee beach as they had a more laid back family feel to them and are less touristy than Bondi, and less choppy waters. It was then a case of catching the bus back from Coogee (you'll see everyone hanging around in the bus shelter next to the public toilets)."

I say \"doable\" because as a 43 yo not in good shape, I was able to do it. We walked to Bronte and were caught by the rain. This is about 2 miles of the most beautiful beaches, sandstone cliffs and amazing waves I've ever seen. We saw a few surfers, but it was extremely windy with the incoming storm. It's free and well maintained. There are several parks, water fountains and many benches for rests or even just a stop to enjoy the views. There are cafes along the way if you wanted to stop for coffee or lunch. It certainly didn't seem like 2 miles because I was too busy admiring the view. My only regret is that we didn't make it all the way to Coogee due to the weather. Don't leave Sydney without walking at least part of the coastal path!"

If you stay in the city just take the train to Bondi Junction and transfer to a Bus to Bondi Beach. You can take bus 333 or 380 with final stop North Bondi and get off as soon as you spot the beach. The walk starts after the iconic Bondi icebergs, which is a open door swimming pool. It's if you are at the beach and look out to the ocean just keep right along the coast and you can't miss it.My suggestion is to leave early. Otherwise you share it with the crowds. You walking past the headland and your first small bay will be cute Tamarama Beach. You have a kiosk there or if you bring your own food also barbecue stations and benches to eat. Then you keep going along the walkway and your next beach will be Bronte beach. Perfect for a dip in the ocean or a ice cream. You will find toilets at every beach and plenty of great photo opportunities. You keep walking along the cliffs and you will see the street carved into the rocks. This was the look for the former Bronte tram who winded her way down to Bronte back in the days. Keep going and you walk thou the majestic Waverley cemetery with impressive rock art. Keep going and you pass the Clovelly bowls club then the Clovelly rugby field. If you are lucky you can spot some sweaty hotties training there. Then you get to Clovelly beach probably the safest swimming beach in Sydney. Because the rocks break the waves making it safe to swim and for kids to play. There is also a nice coffee shop next to the lifeguard club. From here you could catch busses back to the city if you had enough at this point. Roughly 1 hour to 1.5 hour walk but I would suggest you to continue to Coogee another 30 min to one hour walk so all together depending on speed you can walk it in 1.5- 2 hours. But no rush. Take your time and enjoy the view. Once you arrive in Coogee you can chill on the beach barbecue, eat or drink. It's a bustling little seaside suburb. From here you can catch busses to the city or to Bondi junction. Enjoy your day. I am sometimes also running this walk early in the morning or in the evening. It's a great workout. Enjoy."

It offers some great views from the cliffs, beaches, some stairs, a small beautiful curvy road, a walk through a peaceful serene cemetery as well. Beautiful rocks, seagulls, beaches and October was just the perfect weather - this is a must do on a travellers list who loves to walk or to enjoy some breathtaking landscapes. Both ends are well connected by transport so you can carry on with the journey post the walk very comfortably. There are restaurants and numerous water points en route so the coastal walk is well planned by the government. Superb Experience!"

We were lucky to spot several dolphins and a whale en route.My GPS indicated a distance of about 8km, most of which is quite straightforward despite one or two sections of stairs.There were a couple of deviations in place at the time of our visit owing to storm damage earlier in 2016, one of which is through a cemetery!Conditions were quite warm even in late Winter (23 deg C) and some sections are fairly exposed, so on a warm sunny day a hat and sunscreen would be essential. Fortunately several places en route sell lunches and refreshments.Access to Bondi is via train to Bondi Junction thence bus to Bondi Beach; the bus terminal is in the station complex. At Coogee, there are plenty of eateries and a good pub to finish off the day. The row of bus stops for transport back to the City are readily visible next to the waterfront at the end of the walk."

It is admittedly heaving with walkers, dogs and joggers but maybe it was busier with it being a Saturday. We had to do a detour through Waverly cemetery although that in itself was quite interesting to meander through, and boy, talk about having the best view for a cemetery! We stopped off for a coffee in one of the beachside towns, can't recall which one, but it was just before Coogee. All in, perhaps it took us 2 hours? but there was a lot of stopping to take in the views and taking photos. it's a much easier walk than the Manly/Spit Bridge one so perhaps opt for this if you are less energetic/fit and shorter on time."

The coastal path does have stairs along the way so it's not completely wheelchair accessible, but there are a lot of areas along the path that can be accessed by foot or wheels, so no one misses out. Take good shoes, water and your camera if you want to capture the view. Whales can be seen during the right time of year and Sculptures By the Sea is also a great attraction to check out when it's on (Google for dates)."

Did this spoil my experience ? not at all as I accepted the fact it would be good for my butt and legs and quite honestly seeing the surfers, spotting a cockatoo en-route and coming across one of the most beautiful cemeteries that I have ever seen (what a place to end your days) was worth the effort.

It's an easy walk to Tamarama then onto Bronte....you can go further to Coogee if you wish or have the time. There are so many photo ops that the walk will take twice as long as expected. Watch out for the super fit Bondians who run past you not admiring the beauty to behold.Bronte has lots of coffee pitstops for those in need of sustenance. PS why not stop at Icebergs on the way back for a drink and dessert?? Cheaper than a whole meal here!"

The views are great, but the paths are narrow, so coming up to people going in the opposite direction sometimes required moving off the path to let them pass. Views were cool for the first few days of our trip, but we easily saw much better ones as we continued to travel up the coast (Shoal Bay, for example). It's probably a cool little trek for someone local, but personally, we feel we could have skipped it and not missed much."

Gym gear not obligatory, water bottle important and sun screen.

Of course the scenery is breathtaking and we stopped to admire the view and catch our breath on more than one occasion.The ground and steps are uneven in places, so wear sensible footwear and watch your step! Part of the walk takes your through a cemetery and we needed to follow signs as there was work being done to the normal path that everyone follows.There was a sea breeze but that's no surprise.

The bus took about 30 min from downtown, less with an express bus on the return trip. Definitely take public transit there, it's easy to find and its nice to see the neighborhoods as you drive through.Starting at Coogee, I hadn't read much about the walk and was surprised to find so much to look at and discover on the walk. There is literally a beautiful beach around every corner, some with incredible beachside pools, and it was interesting to observe the occasional surfer or fisherman, as well as tourists getting too close to edge of the cliffs while taking selfies.The path is mostly well marked even though there were some detours due to reconstruction after storms. You can easily walk right down to each beach and explore as you pass by. Best to walk from Coogee to Bondi direction as it's is easy to catch a bus from Bondi. Waverley cemetery was the absolute highlight of the walk."

All in all little guy seemed to love the walk and the stunning scenery (probably more than us since we were more focused more on not tripping whilst carrying him!). Fortunately there were two of us to share the load, but personally I would not advise taking a toddler on this walk. Wait until they can walk it competently and until then - save those mesmerising views for yourself!!Be sure to wear really comfy walking shoes and bring loads of sunscreen and water. You will need it!!"

I did however walk from Bondi Junction to Bondi and walked the length of Bondi up and back and then walked to Bronti. Bondi Junction is a fair walk away from Bondi itself but there are some very interesting shops and buildings to see on the way. Bondi itself is full of the usual cafes and seaside attractions. Bondi beach is a spectacle in itself best viewed from the lookout which you arrive at as walk the path from Bondi to Bronti. This walk is not difficult and on a sunny day is really fantastic. I've done this walk a number of times and I'll be back to do it again, highly reccomended."

It doesn't matter which season, the Bondi to Coogee coastal walk is a fabulous way to experience the Eastern beaches in Sydney, especially the world-famous Bondi Beach! It takes a good 2hours or so one-way, leisurely walking. This is great for couples on dates, friends catching up, or even solo. Listen to the ocean waves, watch surfers in action, take in the salty air, get those legs moving and camera snapping! Plenty of cafes at either end and in between Bondi and Coogee, whenever you're ready to take a break ;) Even on a rainy day, the scenery is quite amazing. Storms out at sea, crazy waves, you might even get treated to a lightning show! In Summer there's also Sculptures by the Sea that takes place along here :)"

I did this walk early September and the photo's I have taken along the walk are magical reminders of how beautiful Sydney is and, in particular, along our coastal areas. Start the walk at the car park on Bondi Beach (the walk is signposted so you can't miss it). Although you may be tempted to stop off at Icebergs, save that visit for later. Walk past Icebergs and you are on your way. It takes about an hour or so (depending how long you stop to take amazing photo's) and the walk does involve some stairs (therefore, difficult if you have a pram or wheelchair). It is dog friendly (you will pass many dog walkers along the way) and in some areas a steep couple of patches, however, I did not find the walk difficult at all. There are taps along the way to fill your drink bottle if you need also. As you are directly on the coast the entire walk, the sea breeze will keep you cool, however, as there is no shade, wear sunscreen at all times. Finish you walk with a visit to a caf\u00e9, restaurant or pub to reminisce about the gorgeous scenes you just witnessed. You can either take the return walk (if you car is in the car park and you need to return to Bondi), or you will find many buses at Coogee to take you to where you need to head. You will thoroughly enjoy this beautiful and free activity (and feel all the more healthy for doing it too)."

If Coogee is too far just walk from Bronte to Bondi, this takes about 1hr doing a solid pace(1.20hr) if you stroll more. There are bubblers along the route but its a good idea to have a water bottle or light weight water belt etc. Once you reach the Bondi promenade the path to walk is much wider and you can stop off for some lunch etc before heading back."

We had cockatoos and kookaburras calling out, Bondi Rescue lifeguards patrolling the beaches around us. The terrain is very undulating - with quite a lot of steps. Some sections of the walk are closed due to recent storm activity but this pushes you into the most scenic cemetery for something different.

Still great. The walk is fairly easy. Although there are hills and steps to deal with. Difficult with a pram. Stop at clovelly for an amazing snorkel, at one of the lovely bronte cafes for a bite to eat or power on to Bondi ice bergs and grab a bite and be sure to sit on the balcony for a breath taking view.

With warm weather, you can do a pit stop at multiple beaches and hop in for some cooling down. Note, however, that there are rather steep parts. Therefore, be aware that parts of the walk can be strenuous. If you are staying either at Bondi or Coogee, the walk is a definite must."

Had never been to Bondi or Coogee before and were absolutely blown away by the natural beauty of this area, a world away from the Sydney CBD where we usually stay. We scored perfect weather in May, warm enough for swimming. Set off on the walk early - quite a lot of walkers. Shade a bit scarce in some areas. Just so surprised at the clarity and beauty of the water in the multitude of little bays. And the locals in Coogee were so friendly. Can't wait until we plan another trip and we'll definitely stay again in Coogee and walk further in the other direction."

You'll see lots of people walking, running, talking - doing what Sydneysiders love to do - showing off their city or just enjoying its beauty and tranquillity. Whenever Sculpture by the Sea is on (this year 20 October to 6 November 2016) there are additional thousands of people clambering over the hillsides admiring or trying to make sense of the huge outdoor sculpture exhibition 'n competition. Spot the items in the water, on the rock faces, up the garden slopes... some serious, brilliantly attuned to the natural environment, some witty, some not much to speak of, but as a whole always always interesting and engaging as you walk from Bondi to Tamarama or vice versa. At either end of the walk there are places to eat 'n drink - I always recommend the pub (not the fancy restaurant) at Bondi Icebergs as you hit the road at Bondi with the beach in the distance. Have fish 'n chips or a burger, grab a beer or coke, and sit overlooking the churning ocean all around, the idyllic pool below, the balancing surfers nearby, the omnipresent swimmers braving the cold water. Can't be beaten - a visual feast second to none..."

Early morning hours I had preferred, since that time the walk wasn\u2019t overcrowded, mostly runners were around me. Now, when I live in a different part of the city, still try to make this beautiful walk time to time. Parking a car there is nearly impossible, and very expensive, so its better to use public transport.From Circular Quay the bus 333 goes to Bondi Beach, and from Bondi Junction Interchange, use the 380. On the way back from Coogee you also can use the 380, or the 378.Don\u2019t worry; this walk is worth every effort. If you\u2019re lucky enough to be in Sydney that time I suggest to go and see \u201eThe Sculptures by the Sea\u201d exhibition (20 October \u2013 6 November 2016). It is always wonderful and stretches from Bondi Beach to Tamarama Beach. All that you have to do just continue walking till Coogee Beach. To see all the sculptures and do the walk as well, probably will occupy an average person nearly the whole day. It depends on how much time one needs to spend to examine the sculptures and how long to adore the beauties made by nature."

I am so glad we did this walk b/c it was gorgeous but I think the guide should have advised people better that this is a pretty strenuous hike! You are up and down stairs and steep roads all the time. But totally worth it if you are fit for the hike (or just do a smaller portion if the whole thing is too much) and wearing good shoes. Getting to Bondi by bus from Circular Quay was really easy. We explored Bondi a little, loaded up with a snack from Sadhana Kitchen, then made our way down to Coogee. A storm came through in June that wiped out some big sections of the walk, but there were lots of signs directing you on detours. There were a lot of people on the walk closer to Bondi but it thinned out more as we headed south. The whole walk was so pretty, alternating between cliff tops and then down on little beach coves. We ended in Coogee with a coffee at the Coogee Pavilion and then caught a bus all the way back to Circular Quay.The only downside on this walk is that we started out trying to find the cliff paintings north of Bondi. This was a total failure and we ended up hiking around these super steep streets not knowing where we were going."

So, overall, the walk was good, the scenery was great, the walkways are well maintained, the views are good. So, overall, I can totally recommend it, but I'd say don't have too high expectations because the really great spots of this walk are only a few and otherwise it's simply a walkway."

You have nice beaches on the way you can probably stop at any beach and go back to Bondi. You can catch a bus or uber back to bondi from any of the beaches. It's quite popular with lot of tourists and locals going back and back and forth all the time.We went with a pram and children it's probably not suitable to go with the pram because it's under construction at the moment and it has quite a few steps.Maybe after the construction the steps will be less but I think it still advisable to just go without the prams."

You pass beaches (each with its won character), the Waverly cemetery, the Clovelly lawn Bowling club; go up an down, gently undulating with fantastic views of the ocean and the various beaches passing by beautiful Gordon Bay which is excellent for snorkeling and scuba diving. They all have nice cafes for a stop. I recommend starting at Bondi and finishing at the Coogee. The Coogee Bay Pavillion for a meal at the end. They have great pizzas, mezze, grills, steaks and other bar food. On the weekend as well as early morning and late afternoon it can get rather crowded with runners, dog walkers and many local walkers but it is still wroth it. Sometimes you see whales or dolphins and you always see surfers."

The best ever !!Never really check the distance but I think it could be a bit over 10-12 km return. I am not a physically fit fit person. Not a walk walk fanatic one either. But this clifftop coastal walk is still my most favourite thing to do in Sydney. All you need is just a good pair of walking shoes, sunglasses, towel and a bottle of water ( don't worry. There are refill spots along the route. Clean and convenient) Easy walk along Coogee Beach, ups and downs n stairs/ steps followed by boardwalk along Clovelly, easy walk along Tamarama, Bronte and Bondi. You will be just a few meters to Pacific Ocean all the way.... It's a wow...wow...wow...in every turns...Beaches, cliffs, parks, bays, rock pools...icecream and cafes!!The views are breathtaking, trust me! Highlights are to the right of Coogee Beach, the board walk part at Clovelly, the Bronte approaching Bondi part. Love it !! If you don't have time, just walk to the right of Coogee Beach till the end. It's an easy relaxing 20 min walk with the ocean on your left. Spectacular!!If you are driving, there are plenty of free parkings at Coogee and Clovelly. Crowded on weekends. So, weekdays r much better.Happy walking,!!"

            "review": "Beautiful Coastline. This walk is well worth the effort for Sydney locals and tourists alike. A visit to Bondi beach is great but the walk to Coogee from Bondi gives you a more fulsome taste of our beautiful coastline. The trail meanders around the coast on well worn paths, there are a few uphill parts but this is not a difficult walk. You pass through many other lesser known beaches which are much quieter for a swim than Bondi itself and passing through the old Waverley Cemetery is a real treat. Its residents have great ocean views and interesting head stones. (Great for photos)Take a picnic lunch and stop somewhere on the way or eat in the many places Coogee has to offer once you get there. The bowling club, three quarters of the way along, is somewhere to stop if you need a cleansing ale to cool you down on a hot day too. Summer or winter it is a great walk and if you love walking is quite doable there and back in a day."

Many great photo opportunities - just take a light camera and water. A chance to catch the sun, take some exercise, escape for a day of low cost activity that reveals a new scene around every corner. A cold glass of something alcoholic at the RSL Bondi is a lovely reward after paddling through the surf from one end of Bondi beach to the North end :)"

The Bondi to Coogee walk takes you along the cliff tops of a wonderfully rugged coastline, at its best when the sun is shining and the sky is blue. The sea will then be a mesmerising greedy-blue. There are wonderful sections that have a wooden walkway which gives you excellent views and photo opportunities. The coastline includes a number of excellent beaches, with Bronte perhaps my favourite. There are great places to eat at this delightful little beach, as there are at either end of the journey, although I prefer Bondi for swimming. If you think a shorter trip would suit, then get down to Clovelly beach and walk to Bronte from there. It takes you on the walkway, past an amazing old cemetery on the top of the cliff and there are stunning views back for miles along the coast. There are buses from the city to Clovelly and back from Bronte, as there are at Coogee and Bondi. Stop on the longer walk to spend time at Tamarama, which has an excellent cafe on the lawn immediately above the sand line. The Harbor is a real attraction, but for many locals, the Coogee to Bondi coastline is one of the great things to enjoy about Sydney."

There has also been quite a lot of damage to sections of the walk caused by the last East Coast Low, which have yet to be repaired.

The walk has magnificent views and is very calming. It's also beautiful in the middle of winter watching the waves go against the rocks and watching Bronte Beach disappear when the walk has a corner to go round. I used to go in the City to Surf (I was living in Coogee then and my parents still lived in their house in Bronte). After the City to Surf I would then head off on the walk from Bondi to Bronte, call in at my parents' place then walk home to Coogee. It's really a wonderful, pleasant scenic walk. Also, I used to take my grand-children and my dog on the 'Coogee walk' and walk up those 500 stairs regularly.When there are not many people around, the walk and surrounds are so much more relaxing."

It is a bit hilly and quite few steps so not recommended for those who have trouble walking far or quite unfit. There are a lot of runners and your constantly moving left to right or right to left but luckily we did ours on a week day and around 2pm so wasn't full of tourists and had free space to move. I would recommend to do it because it is lovely and nice way to spend your afternoon with great views."

Impressed by volunteer surf rescue teams at every beach. Two delightful surprises along the way........Seascape Caf\u00e9 at Coverley Beach and Waverly Cemetery. Don't forget your sunscreen, hat and water! If you're able, take a towel and dip in the ocean but watch the surf doesn't get you. In total there are 5 beaches along this walk and each of them with a different atmosphere. Along the way there are some stretches with wooden stairs along the cliff which I was still able to navigate with my arthritic knees."

It's easy to imagine, having done it, that if you lived here you'd want to head to the beach every day after work.

You can catch the M50 from Park Street opposite Town Hall Woolworths, which will take you to Coogee Beach and the walk starts from here and there are many buses which connect to the city"

One problem is that the walk is not circular and if you come by come, at least one of the group members will have to make his/her way back to where you parked. There are parts where you can deviate from the path and go on the rocks on the water edge. There are some not-so-obvious things you can look for like aboriginal rock paintings, and I advise you to look on the web in advance in order to know where to expect those."

I should say that we didn't stop for a swim at Coogee Beach but rather a little before in Gordons Bay. The water is warmer and nicer and there aren't as many annoying groups of people with screaming children. Take tonnes of sunblock and a hat, and super cold water (freeze it if you have to, in summer it will melt). Great date idea (maybe not first date as you will work up a sweat) and lovely day outdoors."

Great views of the ocean, beaches, cliffs, etc. Sections of the walkway were damaged so there were detours. Make sure to read the signs to show you where to walk - we got to the cemetery and walked too far around which added about 30 mins to the walk. Ended the walk at the Bondi Icebergs club - also worth stopping in for a snack/drink while you enjoy the views. The entire walk took us less than 2 hours with the detour.

However my colleagues told me this was a walk I needed to enjoy and the group tour wouldn't let me experience the joy of being a local. So I ditched the tours and if you're adventurous like me get the bus and experience Bondi to Cover.Make sure you take the destination, Bondi Beach. The bus literally drops you at the beach. The journey from Darling Harbour or CBD is about 45-60mins. It's a scenic route so you get to take in the beauty and architecture of Sydney.It's winter but the beach is full of surfers--thisnisba lovely sight to behold.You must stop at the famous Bondi Iceberg pool where everyone takes a dip to prove they have been in Bondi. You must stop at the Waverly Cemetry and see the hundreds of graveyards dating the 18th century; a spectacular sight. And then you head for the Cogee beach where there are many restaurants. By the time you have done this stretch (7.5 km or 4.66 miles) you will be ready for a drink or a meal.If you're brave you can take the walk back and add another 7.5k to your distance . I really enjoyed it and of course noticed different things. If you feel you have had enough, then you can take a bus back to Bondi or the city. I would recommend stopping by in Bondi at one of the many caf\u00e9s and slowly wind up.This was one of my best walks in Sydney."

Waling time is around 2 and a half hours, not including breaks. You'll like it, there's nothing like being by the ocean."

The weather was perfect which helped and the waves were crashing dramatically against the rocks - so it is hard to fault. The path is clearly marked and we walked from Bondi to Congee which is about 6 Kms. Some parts were fairly long and steep but the views kept you going plus the drinking fountains supplied along the way. It really was stunning and good for the soul. There was a sense of community too along the way. We were moved by the Bali monument towards the end of the walk. We rewarded ourselves with a pie and a drink before setting back to Sydney."

Everytime I turned a corner I was again mesmerized by the coast's beauty. It took me about five hours to complete the tour because I had to stop every other minute to take loads of pictures. Make sure to make a stop at the Three Blue Ducks (Macpherson St) for lunch. They are pretty good. Turn right right in front of Waverly Cementary and you get right to them. You can also take picnic stuff. There are several nice places to sit and you even find barbeque grills at one of the beaches along the way.If you are into geocaching, also bring your GPS! There are a handful nice boxes to find!"

It's become so incredibly popular that most of Sydney and their dogs, kids, grannies, and out of towners visit in droves from sunrise to sundown and it's almost impossible to move!!!"

It really is spectacular and between April and October you are highly likely to spot whales migrating and not far off shore. Plenty of places to stop and eat. Clovelly is the spot to dive in and if you have a mask and snorkel you will be treated to a festival of coloured fish and may even spot the local blue Groper. Not to be missed. Enjoy"

So the walk itself starts from Bondi (wherever you like along the beach, north end or south end) and you follow a well sign-posted walk heading south past the Bondi Icebergs pool and around the coast past the very pretty Tamarama Beach and onto Bronte Beach.We stopped at Bronte and turned around and walked back again, but I understand you can keep walking on to Coogee Beach.The walk is fairly easy (certainly not strenuous) and is along a pathway all the way, so its pretty easy going. One direction takes approx 45 mins, so an hour and a half or so, depending on exactly how fast you walk, there and back.On a nice sunny day you get a fair few people doing the walk, so try not to go during 'peak' time if you don't like some company!The walk itself is quite pretty, and well worth the effort - especially on a nice sunny day!Depending on where you're coming from; to get there we caught the train to Central, then changed and got the train to Bondi Junction. The 380 bus which leaves from the bus interchange at Bondi Junction station will drop you right opposite Bondi Beach."

I walked from Coogee to Bondi (rather than Bondi to Coogee) and I would definitely recommend doing it this way because there are more shops and food places at Bondi to relax for an hour or two before heading back. It took me about 2 hours to walk each way, but I was stopping to take a lot of photos along the way. A small bit of the path has been washed away by the recent storms, but you could still go along the coastal walk, there was just one part which directed you through a cemetery rather than along the path. At Bondi there is currently an ice rink overlooking the beach, and also camel rides along the beach (costing about $25 for an adult). It was such a stunning walk and there were plenty of water fountains along the way as well as little cafes at each beach. All in all, a beautiful day and a great bit of exercise at the same time!"

We had almost perfect running conditions at 17 degrees C in bright sunshine and a light breeze. Some of the Coastal Path suffered damage during the June storms and there are a couple of diversions in force; the integrity of the route remains pretty much the same with just a little additional distance. One of the diversions takes you through Wakerley Cemetery which I confess provided some additional interest picking out names on the graves. The route also takes you past the Bali Bombing Memorial which provides a poignant reminder of the 43 people from New South Wales who lost their lives.It's a great route for a run; great coastal views. A couple of cheeky hills and one longish set of steps got the pulse rate up. It's a downhill finish into Coogee to end the run on the beach and we rewarded ourselves with a well-deserved ice cream."

Plenty of little bays to stop & rest in & shops / dairies by them though. We liked the plarks along the way with history info on them about the area.

All drivers and attendants were helpful--just buy an Opal card and travel with ease. Bring your camera and tennis shoes and if you are bold bring your swimsuit. Many surfers out on Bondi but the waves were not developed much yet. Be Warned--Some parts of the walkway are under construction July 2016, and although marked, people still proceeded. Looks like a landslide toward Bondi Beach makes it more challenging as some of the walkway is missing."

In between there is Tamarama beach, then Bronte beach, then Clovelly beach...If you have less time as a tourist you can cover a short distance to one or two beaches.7...In between there is a natural salty swimming pool and open gymnasium.8... In winters you should carry jackets as it is chilly and in summers hat, gogs and lots of sunscreen.9... Kids should not be left alone during walk as in some places proper fence is not there.10... In the month of June July whale can be spotted and in the month of October November.....sculptures at sea are displayed....11... Prefer going weekdays or in the mornings for tourists. For locals weekends is best..12....Lots of cafes serving beer and mouth watering dishes on the way and Surfers busy in surfing and swimming."

Some of the cafes at either ends are quite nice even though the food can be somewhat limited Make sure you bring some snacks for the little ones as the choices really are not that superlative. Also, don't forget swimmers and towels (or spare clothes) ... you know ... just in case. Just have fun, forget about your work troubles, stress and bills and just let the ocean do the work on your soul for a change. Oh, if you like this walk, make sure you do the northern part of this coastal walk. Either from Cremorne to Balmoral, from Clontarf to Manly and my secret favourite all the way to Barenjoy."

This is a classic walk to enjoy with friends, family or as a couple.A great way to enjoy this is to park at either Coogee or Clovelly & walk to Bondi, have lunch in one of the many cafes, we went to the Bondi Icebergs & walk lunch off with the return. A highly recommended activity for a day, depending on your inclination this return trip, including lunch could take any where from 2-4 hours . Enjoy"

The weather obviously has the most impact, and it is dramatic on a stormy day, and calm and relaxing on a warm sunny still day. But everytime is a new experience. Can't recommend it enough! And whichever way you walk it, there's plenty of choices of cafes at either end to provide the mid-walk interlude :)PS I've had to say that it's a good rainy day attraction because personally I love walking in the rain, but that is a matter of choice, obviously :)"

Arrived in Bondi and made sure I went to the furthest away end as I wanted to enjoy walking around the bay of this famous beach. as the path wound its way away from Bondi a number of smaller and totally stunning bays are reached. The coastal scenery was amazing and there were plenty of surfers to spot along the way. Each bay had an area for refreshments and also toilets. Enjoyed the walk very very much and would highly recommend. Also enjoyed a well earned drink in the Coogee bay hotel on reaching the end where I sat gazing out at the beautiful bay. Perfect."

The view of the moon rising from the ocean was simply breath taking as it ascended into partky clouded sky. The walk is fairly easy along bike/walking path although we took a detour via the Waverley cemetry as the usual route was blocked due to the recent Sydney storm. Had a 10 minutes break at Bondi before heading back to Coogee. Took us 2 hours for the return trip. Very enjoyable evening walk during winter."

We saw the recent reviews that said that this walk was closed, so we asked our hotel concierge to check, and according to him, it was open. We took the bus to Bondi and headed south on foot. Parts of it WERE closed, but we were able to navigate a slightly different path. As we got south of Bondi, when parts of the coastal walk were closed, good detour signs were in place that made it easy to follow. We made it all the way to Coogee, where we took another bus back to Sydney. The walk was easy. There are stairs involved, so it's not for those in strollers or wheelchairs, but anyone else should be able to do it. The scenery was lovely and there are places to fill up your water bottle plus restrooms at each beach you hit along the way. We even got to watch a bowling tournament at a bowling green when we were almost to Coogee!"

You get to see dramatic coast lines and soak up the Australian sun, as well as experience a bit more of the coastal beauty than just Bondi Beach. The walk is moderate - it is about 6-7km but there are frequent breaks in the track when you arrive at the next beach along which gives you a chance to re-fill water bottles or take a swim. The track is fairly easy with stairs on the steeper hills. Once you get to Coogee, there is access to public transport to get you back home again"

This is a lovely walk, even more interesting during the sculptures by the sea exhibition (March each year). There are parts that are quite accessible for all but much of it involves old stairs, carved into the sandstone. It is not too hard and you can always walk one way and catch a bus from the other end back to the city or bondi junction. It is in fact better to go by public transport as parking can be tricky and expensive, and public transport gives you more options. It is not Sydney Harbour, it's the ocean, but you can sometimes see whales off the coast. It is a pleasant way to get a bit of exercise and take in the sea air and views"

The biggest challenge was the section through the grave yard. This is not baby stroller friendly.

If you love the sun and you don't mind a little walk or exercise then here is the perfect place, the views are unreal and if you like doing water sports then here is the place it can get very hot which is obvious so you will need to make sure you take a lot of fluids but it was a lovely day out"

            "review": "A great sunny day activity.... I actually did the walk from coogee beach to bondi beach. Take the bus 373 or 374 from the circular quay in Sydney CBD to coogee beach. ( u can catch it midway along the bus route also ) The walk aligns along the coast for the most part but some parts u take the paved road. The biggest issue with the whole walk is that there are no signs directing where to go. So you have to take a guess. Most times take the one closest to ocean. Some time taking the ocean route means a rugged terrain so be ready. Wear a pair of comfortable shoes. Preferably sporty. Be advised that some parts of the walk is closed because of the cave ins. These area are warded off but unfortunately the alternative path is also not clearly marked. But rest assured soon or later you will join the path again if you follow the paved road. Or simply follow other local walkers. Finally there is few food outlets actually along the path, all the outlets are along the main road path just a few mins away. Now for the good part, this is great 6-7 km walk ideal for a sunny day. When it's cold and windy it might get bit to chilly for the uninitiated. Bring a swim kit so u can swim in as many little coves of sea water you see along the way as you can. Bring picnic so u can enjoy a the view from atop the rock formations while enjoying a snack. This walk covers several sandy beach beach coves and rock formations and few hills. So enjoy this must do in Sydney. Whole walk takes roughly 2 hours with little stopping. Finally take the bus 333 from bondi beach back to circular quay or Sydney CBD."

If thats not an option, opt for Saturday morning over Sunday as there's lots of strollers - prime family time. There are plenty of places to stop off and take in the view or a coffee. Highly recommended if you're in Sydney. You'll get great photos of our beautiful coast."

There are also some amazing rock pools so make sure you take swimwear. It is about 6km I think so not too challenging. The views are stunning and definitely worth the walk"

Experience is wonderful. Amazing views. Well developed residential areas, clean and facility like drinking water available along the ways. My advice is to cover the route in 3 to 4 short walk. First Bondai to Tamarama beach. Then to Bronte beach. Then to Clovelly beach. Then Coogee. Take some rest and pics in these beaches. Toilet is available in these beaches. Not be missed attraction in Sydney. This is one of my best costal walk I have 3ver done."

It is quite safe walking, there are mostly paths, formed walks, street walking in parts. It can be quite crowded in summer and the warmer months.It is very popular for runners and walkers, both for visitors and locals who use it extensively.The walk is about 8 kms and is quite a physical effort so take water. There are shops along the way.You don't have to do the whole walk, you can stop at various beaches eg Bronte along the way and catch a bus back to the city or elsewhere.PS note parts of the walk have been damaged in the huge June 16 storms in Sydney.

Take your \"Swimmers\" a.k.a swimming cosies because there are places where you can stop and go for a dip in the outdoor pools along the way.

This is a private members club where you can usually sign in as a visitor without problem. Entrance is at street level and not to be confused with the very upmarket restaurant which occupies the top level of the building. You will be able to get a well priced meal/grill and ample beverages whilst sitting on the sunny terrace overlooking the famous Bondi Beach. But wait, there's more !!. On the beach side of the building is a fabulous salt water pool for your use after paying a few dollars entrance. You can have a swim and a hot shower after your walk and then head upstairs to the club refreshed. Even in winter it's worth the plunge and a couple of quick laps."

Then head south along the beaches walk. Enjoy the views along the cliff tops...you might even see whales. You'll come to a very small beach at Tamarama where only the beautiful will sun bake. Continue on to Bronte where you might stop at one of the many cafes. As you continue south you'll pass through a cemetery...watch out for ghosts! You'll then come upon a very unique little bay, cemented on both sides with a tiny beach at the end. Did you bring your goggles? This is the perfect place to enjoy a dip and swim with the local menagerie of fish. The groupers are amazing to see! As you continue south you'll pass around Gordon's Bay, which is popular with scuba divers, until you crest the cliffs to arrive at Coogee. You might want to stop off here for a beer at the famous Coogee Bay Hotel. But it's not too far to go to Maroubra from here...you're almost there. And remember you can always bus it home if you choose not to make the return journey!"

I saw people doing it in flip flops, which I wouldn't necessarily recommend due to some of the steps, but you certainly don't need athletic shoes etc. You can stop off and see the cemetery, grab a drink, take a seat and just enjoy along the way. I walked Bondi to Coogee but I know many prefer the other way as you come upon Bondi as a final reveal. I went on a Monday so it was quieter. There were some serious runners and I can imagine that when busy this could be quite a slow walk. I like to walk briskly so it was a good day for me to go."

Although it looks Bondy-like as in a breathtaking destination scene from a James Bond movie. This beach is amazing, no picture can ever do this beach justice. It goes on forever. The sand is a soft cream-coloured powder and the water is a soothing turquoise. You can't help but just want to take it all in for hours. The walk is incredible, every corner and curve in the paved path introduces you to another incredible view of not just the beach but some of the strangest rock formations I have ever seen. It takes a lot of time to get through this trail simply due to the fact that you keep stopping to try to capture these images on camera. From a distance it looks like the mediterranian with it's hillside homes and beautiful sand. I understand why there is so much hype about this place. On Bondi beach itself there is a large grassy area free of sand where you can sit down and enjoy a meal from one of the great restaurants or cafes along the strip.Walking the path is very easy, there are plenty of places to stop and relax or take pictures as well as refill your water bottle with filtered water for free. Wash rooms are also available to the public. Ladies, even if you don't see any of the Hemsworth brothers, Hugh Jackman or any of the other Australian beefcakes on the beach, this is still an amazing place to see."

This is a fairly easy walk, though you may have to climb up and down some steps along the way. The views are beautiful and you will meet lots of fellow walkers along the way. You can even break up the walk and stop at Bronte beach before continuing to Coogee beach. Along the way, you will also see the beautiful waverly cemetery. Best to walk in the early morning or evening when it is cooler. Enjoy the breeze and sights along the way. Along the way, you can also refill your water bottle. Sydney has lots of watering stations all over the main public areas. If you wish to stop halfway, you can always take a bus back to Bondi junction and then catch the train.

Glad we did the Coogee to Bronte part, so pretty. There are stairs in parts but the whole walk is designed for all abilities to enjoy. We went on a Sunday morning, as the morning progresses it got a bit busy with joggers and families. But there is lots of room and it never felt crowded. You won't regret using a half day of your Sydney vacation for this unforgettable sea side walk."

Just get to Bondi Beach and then at the southern end of the beach, you will see the concrete walkway. You would have to be blind not to see it. First, getting to Bondi Beach is easy. You can catch buses from the city or catch the train to Bondi Junction and then a bus ....just a few minutes further.The walk hugs the coast and is very easy ...you can't get lost and you can walk at your pace. Moreover, here are many points where bus routes are nearby so you can pull the pin whenever you want. The walk is generally flat some steps but again walk at your pace. Houses and parks on your right and spectacular views of the Sydney coastline to your left.This is an absolute must and can take you a few hours or all day .... Stopping for coffee etc at (say) Coogee Beach would be highly recommended and then just walk across the park and hop on a bus back to Bondi Junction where you can either shop or catch the train back into the Sydney CBD or do both. This would be a rather cheap day...just costs you time and a few dollars on what you want to spend.Truly, no need to join an organised your. I live in Sydney and when we can, take visitors on this walk. Each time, I see something different and often stop and just crave at the views."

It's nice, but it is not spectacular, and ultimately it felt too long/hard to walk in one go. I'm sure it would be better with the whole day, with time to hop from cafe to cafe and swim. If you are just interested in seeing the beaches and a few rocky cliffs, the bus might be a better option.P.S. Lots of runners rushing past us at 8 in the morning on fairly narrow paths, which really affects the experience."

The weather was incredibly warm, sky was blue and the coastal scenery is spectacular. I love Tamarama Beach - much calmer both in waves and people. It's not a long walk but as some steps are quite steep not for those with mobility issues. It was hotter for this time of year to what I had expected and I didn't have a hat on so didn't continue to Coogee and didn't want to go back to Bondi Beach so walked up the top and caught the bus back from Tamarama to Bondi Junction shopping centre (much quieter bus). Plenty of places to have lunch in Bondi Junction or back in Bondi."

At GOrdons Bay, pop on your bathers and have a refershing dip in the ocean. If, after a nice lunch at one of the many fantastic eating places in Bondi you feel energetic, walk back!

Clovelly and Gordon's Bay for snorkelling. There are also ocean pools at Clovelly, Bronte and Bondi. (Or Coogee if you start there). One cafe at Clovelly, one at Tamarama, many many restaurants and cafes at Bronte and 100s of places to eat in Bondi.

You absolutely need sunscreen.The only downside is the presence of people walking their dogs: although there are plenty of signs proibiting this, we met many people with their dogs, unleashed. My sister is afraid of dogs, so the walk was not so pleasant as it could be due to this problem.The view is amazing, though."

We did this walk as a group of four and had lunch on the way and my three companions decided to get a taxi back to Clovelly as it looked like rain was on the way. I decided to walk back and despite the rain was inspired by the fabulous scenery and the tranquil sights and sounds of the waves crashing onto the rocks. The only hazard on the walk are all the joggers who think they own the place and will never be happy if they don't achieve a personal best because someone stops for a minute to enjoy the view."

This walk is great, it goes around the coast from Bondi all the way to Coogee, although we often stop at Bronte for a drink then wander back to Bondi. We only do it early in the morning or late in the day on a Saturday or Sunday though as any other time on the weekend it's too busy and you feel like you're in a herd of animals or you're queuing all around the walk.The walk is relatively easy although there are quite a few gradients and steps to go up or down and not much seating on the way round either so anyone who struggles with either walking or with steps should air on the side of caution.It's a great walk with a great view though, I highly recommend it - at the right time of day! :)"

Please do it till the end as Bronte to Clovelly walk features the Waverley Cemetery and a cliff top board walk.

The path it's self follows the cost line and is not too difficult a walk , it has magnificent views around every turn . Beautiful beaches and wild flowers most of the way . Done this walk one day in the second week of April, the weather started off fine then turned a bit wet , but still warm . And if you do walk the route you must visit the Clovelly Bowling club . A bit of serendipity regards our walk as we wandered around a bend to be met by what must be the best view from any clubhouse in the world. Made more than welcome at the door and a good chat with the barman a couple of drinks and an hour later we were on our way."

The walk from Bondi to Coogee is amazing with awesome views of Bondi, the beaches and coves between and the rock formations along the coast line. The walk is a concrete path the whole way and easily marked as you just walk along the coastline.This is a busy path with the locals walking, walking their dogs, Jogging and running. We started from Bondi walked the whole way turned around at Coogee and walked back. We were not disappointed. The views down into the surf are beautiful. Tips: Don't take up too much path, if in groups be wary of walking more then 2 abreast as you may block the joggers and others on the track, move aside and let other through, if you see someone running towards you make an obvious decision as to where you are walking (usually on the left side). Bring a bottle of water and some sunscreen on the sunny days. Wear decent shoes if you are walking the full length and back. Take a camera to capture some awesome shots of Bondi and rock formations along the way. Take your time and enjoy the scenery. Watch out for dog poo. Occasionally someone may forget to pick up after there pup and you may end up on the receiving end. There are some stairs along the track noting to strenuous."

There are a few shops along the way where drinks and snacks can be purchased and drinking fountains on the beaches, too.

We've walked both ways, but starting at Coogee and finishing at Bondi is my favourite direction. If it's cold and windy take a jumper and umbrella. If it's sunny wear plenty of sunscreen and take some water. A few water drink fountains along the way. Approximately 6kms from Coogee beach to Bondi beach. If you're feeling fit you could run it as the paths are very well maintained. A beautiful part of Australia!!"

We did it on what turned out to be the hottest recorded April day in Sydney and while it was hot and we hadn't taken water with us, there are plenty of free drinking water bubbler taps along the way. The walk would be easy enough for most, and there is something interesting around almost every twist and turn (my 9 year old was excited to come across the Tamarama life saving club as featured in the Dulux ad!). Follow the signs and you'll have no problem.If you are staying in Coogee as we were, you can walk in the other direction as well towards Maroubra Beach - which is a shorter walk (just less than 3km). The walk diverts at one point on to residential streets and we got a bit confused momentarily, but if you keep heading in the same direction you won't get lost. Might be best to google bonditocoogeewalk for more detailed instructions before you set off."

Pretty views and interesting rocks that have been worn away through the years by wind/sand/salt erosion. If you don't get the chance to see beaches often, go for the walk. If you're from Queensland and see beaches all the time, this won't impress you. Not too strenuous, some stairs involved, but the quality of the path is excellent with only a few spots that aren't like walking in the city."

Recommended early morning best - it can get quite crammed on a good day. But even with a bit of inclement weather about, it's still a fun walk. A couple of good cafes for a coffee or breakfast too (Tamarama or Bronte). Also one for four-legged friends. There are water refill stations along the way and some benches when you just want to take in the view and grab some nice pics. I've never run the length, but a good 90 min walk for most.

At the time of the Full Moon the Moon can be viewed as it rises above the horizon in the early evening (take a torch). If there is a heavy surf running, the cliffs at Tamarama are great for viewing the brave and masterful surfers doing their thing. Walkers should walk on the left so that joggers can whiz by on your right. Tamarama is known as Glamourama so there are beautiful sights on the beach. At Bronte you can stop for coffee or take a Bus back to the city. The walk continuing from Bronte has a short section cantilevered off the cliff face over the ocean, then past the Clovelly ocean pool and onwards to Coogee, where there are buses to the city."

Incorporating steps and hills you can make this path a great work out. With many cafes along the way you can turn this outing in to great day. Be mindful the path can get quite busy on a beatiful sunny day so I like to go early and enjoy big breakfast afterwards at ine of the many cafes to try in Coogee."

If you are looking for a fun way to experience Sydney's best beaches, walking the Bondi to Coogee path is a great way to get fit, check out the eye candy, and take in four iconic but uniquely different Eastern Suburbs beaches in a day. The best place to start is North Bondi and enjoy the idyllic view of kids frolicking in the wading pool. Make your way past the calisthenics and outdoor work out areas where the perv factor is quite high, especially after 5 pm when the locals come to train. Cruise past the Bondi Icebergs club and sea pool and follow the path. It will lead you through some beautiful cliff views of the sea along limestone rock faces that in themselves tell a weathered story. If sea-spray is not your desired product for your tresses, wear a baseball cap, especially on a windy day.You walk around the secluded but no less colorful Tamarama beach, (nicknamed Glamorama by the locals for the quality of its inhabitants), and eventually you'll arrive at Bronte. Bronte beach is a local favourite with a stunning beach, park, and swimming pool, as well as access to good coffee and is a popular spot with young families and locals alike. Finally, you'll wind up at Coogee. Coogee is a family beach with ample parking, and is bordered by some terrific restaurants including the Coogee Palace. If you've made it this far, reward yourself with a libation and a swim. You would have spent about three hours walking and earned it!"

I would suggest stop by in Clovelly and Gordon bay. Just be careful in Gordon bay because there are no life guards so you are on your own. Great snorkelling spot but make sure you are with someone all the time. Never had any problems but ocean is a mysterious place haha. When you arrive at Bondi beach make sure you visit the iceberg restaurant because the views of Bondi beach are magnificent. They do require Identification on the entrance of the restaurant. It's a casual dining on level 2 so dress code can be casual. If you are doing this walk on Sunday I would suggest also visit Bondi Markets where local and Sydney designers sell their clothes so I am sure you will find something trendy."

Each beach encounter is different. April is fall so it is somewhat off season. We enjoyed the lack of people. There are many places to stop along the way. We moseyed along so the walk took us about five hours! Take time to sit and enjoy the view along the way. Don't rush! Very accessible from downtown Sydney and an easy ride back too."

I am fortunate enough to reside in Bondi, which means if I ever opt for an outdoor workout, this stunning walk is my go to.Despite how frequently I venture upon the coastal walk, I feel like I constantly need to pinch myself and make sure that this is my reality. Around so many bends I find myself comparing the crystal clear waters and their beautiful colours to those of the Greek Islands. This walk is honestly good for your soul, it has cured many a bad mood for me. I recommend going early afternoon and also avoiding weekends if you're a brisk walker like myself with a low tolerance for those climbing up/down the wrong side of the steps and those walking with absolutely no sense of urgency."

I can't express just how infinitely lucky I am to call this walk my backyard. The sheer beauty and dramatic views from headland to headland never cease to inspire awe and relaxation in me. Blissful at sunrise, magic at sunset, this walk is simply one of the most beautiful coastal walks in Australia. Perfect for a morning exercise route, or an easy, evening stroll with a friend or lover. Take it slow to inhale the best of the ocean views and salty air. Best times are at dawn or dusk before the crowds settle in, but perfect all year round. Number one recommendation for showcasing the best of Sydney to international friends and guests. The Bondi to Coogee Coastal Walk is the million dollar trail that costs nothing."

There are also lots of small cafes at Bronte if you need a break and a coffee. The walk then takes you past a cemetery which is also interesting to explore. As the walk continues you pass some lovely bays and another ocean pool at Clovelly. Finally you reach Coogee after a good 1 hour and a bit with no stops. I recommend the Coogee Pavilion for a drink and a bite to eat. There are plenty of other cafes or get some takeaway and sit on the grass and enjoy the view of the beach! There is also many buses that will take you back to the city or bondi junction. You can easily do the walk in the opposite direction and enjoy the Ice bergs club or the Bucket list at the end of your walk.A must do if you are in the Easteen suburbs of Sydney."

On our most recent trip due to limited time and drizzling rain we chose to do only part of the walk going from Coogee to Clovelly and return. It is a very pleasant walk which you can do at your own pace. No need to run like some people! Gordon's Bay is very picturesque and you can often see scuba divers in the water. At Clovelly Beach there is a cafe and kiosk so it is a perfect spot to stop for a drink and something to eat. The views from the footpath high above the ocean are spectacular particularly when the sea is rough.I would highly recommend this walk to visitors to Sydney. Take your time and enjoy the views, it is well worth it. There are spots where it is not an easy walk and in some sections there are steps so it is not really suitable for families with children in prams unless they are prepared to carry them up thirty or more steps at a time. Obviously also it is not suitable for anyone in a wheelchair or with impaired mobility."

One beautiful thing about daylight savings is that the sun rises a little later (than what we\u2019re used to in Queensland) and so despite creeping close to 7am we were able to catch the sun sleepily peak up over the ocean and slowly light up the coastline, burning beautiful pinks and orange.Having only ever visited Bondi during the day, Australia\u2019s most famous beach is usually over run with locals and tourists alike! The iconic beach has something for just about everyone with sun, surf and sand along with a long strip of restaurants, bars and retail stores together with a farmers market, boutique street stalls and scenic running tracks. It was nice to be able to see it in a different light of day, much calmer and quieter than it is normally.We walked as far as Bronte Beach (4km round trip) and stopped at a nearby caf\u00e9 for breakfast. It's a gorgeous walk and a must do for those that are in need of a sea breeze and love ocean views."

We did spend only a few minutes and then sought shelter at a nearby McDonald's. That was last year. This year in mid-January we were there again. Even though it was a weekday it was very busy at Bondi (local school holiday for their summer) it was warm but windy and very overcast. But we still did the walk to Tamarama and then to Bronte beaches. At some point the wind was blowing sand to our faces. But since we could not wait for another time we did the walk with a lunch break at Bronte and walked back to Bondi.. It was still worthwhile and interesting. If you are luck enough to be there on a sunny and warm day then it would be a superb experience. Recommended!"

Bring your runners and be ready to tackle a few steps on the way, but (trust me) you don't need to be fit to complete and enjoy this walk. (For those who are fit, maybe join the impressive bods who run the trail).You'll encounter sculptural sandstone cliffs, surf beaches, ocean pools, long open vistas bristling with mid height apartments and super pads from all eras, 4 Surf Life saving Clubs, folk of all shapes and sizes and hear just about every language along the way as everyone from around the world takes this in.You can take it either direction. Maybe plan a mid-walk stop for a dip at Bronte if its warm - its a pretty beach with a calm pool and a good point break if you're into that and its less crowded and less treacherous than Bondi. Depending on your timing you might be better finishing at Bondi for Lunch - there's more options and generally better fare available there ranging from sushi rolls and smoothies through burger joints and cafes to a couple of reasonable eateries behind Campbell Pde.Or better yet from Bondi you might also think about catching the 323 bus or uber to Watsons Bay Hotel ( 5 or 6 ks) and eating there - right on the southern head of the harbour.  If you're driving detour on the way there (left off Old South Head Road almost anywhere along the way) and meander through Vaucluse and check out the mansions of the uber wealthy around Point Piper. When you get to Watsons bay go to Military Rd and the park there. Eating at the Watsons Bay pub right on the water front or at Doyles next door - each of which boast great seafood for reasonable prices - is highly recommended. The soft shell crab sliders at the pub go very well with a cold beer!Or maybe grab a prawn roll for $10 from Doyle's kiosk and sit under the majestic Moreton Bay figs in the park and watch the boats bob and the ferries come and go. Or Climb the stairs on the headland and check out the notorious Gap - a lethal fall sadly quite often frequented by desperate locals - and the view across to Manly.Then catch the ferry back to Circular Quay ( if you're not driving). You can get a single trip ticket at the terminus for about $6. But make sure you don't jump on the Manly ferry by mistake - then again, there are worse mistakes to make.Just Go"

Getting to Bondi can be a bit of a mission thanks to the Bondi residents of yor whose insular selfishness has meant that there is no train to Bondi, only to the junction and then a tedious bus ride down one of the worst examples of urban infrastructure known to man. Leave early before this road becomes one long car park.Eventually you arrive at Bondi Beach, along with half of West Sydney if the weather is nice. However you can escape the bogan hoards by heading south past Icebergs Swimming Club and along this moderately taxing but very pleasant walk which takes in a number of great little beaches along the way as well as spectacular cliff top views. And there are some good watering holes at the end and a surprisingly short bus ride or Uber back to the city.Highly recommended Sydney experience. Better than the ridiculously expensive and massively underwhelming Sydney Harbour Bridge climb IMHO.Caveat: this walk has some quite steep sections and also a fair few steps. Also it can get very hot on a mid-Summer day and Sydney can surprise overseas visitors by just how hot it can get. Stay hydrated, apply sunblock, and don't attempt this walk if you can't manage a moderately arduous 5km walk."

After walking 20 minutes, I definitely know she was talking about jogging the path, which was a mix of stairs, curves, turns, and stops to take in the view.I visited during the start of a Cyclone, so the wind was intense. There are some points jutting out away from the protection of the rock walls, and you can really feel the strength of nature. Water was churning far below, crashing into the rocks, pulling everything it could reach into the oceans with the waves.There are some areas to sit, take a break and view the ocean--many times, that's about all you can see. There is enough room for jogging, which so many people did as they passed me on the walkway back and forth. There is even a little exercise area to do some sit-ups and pull-ups, etc. I even found the sometimes endless water trickling down from residential and planted areas to be interesting, because all sorts of interesting vegetation was growing there.Also along the path, you'll find stops, like Icebergs with their ocean pools, Mackenzies Bay and Tamarama, ending at Bronte Beach. Tamarama seemed to draw the most surfing crowd, and people were practicing capoeira on the grassy area. More families were at Bronte beach when I arrived.I will note, unless you're walking back where you started, there are some buses near Bronte Beach, like 360, 361, and 440. Just keep an eye on the time, as certain buses stop running after a certain time. It's not far to the other bus stop, but the 360s and 440s don't really overlap. It's a pretty long walk back to the Bondi Junction, just not impossible. So keep an eye on your time. Otherwise, walking back to Bondi beach, might give you more bus options."

Bondi was so beautiful but full of tourists as would be expected but along this walk you get to see a number of other beaches a lot more untouched and just as stunning as Bondi! There are some great photo opportunities along the way and it was just very chilled, free (which is always a plus) and memorable. Its a long walk so I recommend you make sure you have the right shoes but its completely worth it. A number of the beaches along the way have cafes, toilets and other amenities so nothing is hard to find. A must when in Sydney!"

The beach is amazing and crowded with locals and lots of tourists but has a great buzz about it. The bay is surrounded by Art Deco buildings and the walks are full of great views. Easy enough for people with limited fitness"

The walk is a well marked paved trail that goes along the top of the cliffs and then drops down to beach level as you approach each beach. Although the walk is not long in miles, the up and down takes a certain level of conditioning. Its very invigorating and if your a walker it is well worth it. You can catch a bus from Coogee back to Circular Quay. I would highly recommend this tour as a nice day at the beach."

You can easily access any of these beaches directly from the walkway. The walkway hugs the cliff-face between Clovelly and Bronte as you head North with brilliant views. If you're lucky you will see whales and/or dolphin (I saw a pod of over 20 on one occasion).Watch out for the joggers! Be walkway savvy and keep left, and if in a group, don't walk 3 or 4 abreast across the pathway!Turn around after a coffee at Bondi and walk back to Coogee. Its about 10 km return."

            "review": "Worthy of the Hype. From reading reviews on here, I knew this was something I had to do during my visit to Sydney. My expectations were somewhat different from what I actually found upon trying this.Much has been mentioned in prior reviews of how physically demanding (or easy) this walk is, so allow me to first comment on that aspect. I'm far from the most fit twenty-something, but I'm certainly not the most out of shape, either. I didn't have much a problem with most of this walk, but there were times I took advantage of the benches along the walk to cool down for a few minutes and enjoy the scenery. Expect to break a sweat, particularly if you go during the summer months. I might've enjoyed it a bit more if I'd done it in a brisk fall or spring month. Aside from that, this is absolutely worth the effort. Start at Bondi, and walk up to Coogee. Stop along the way at Bronte. I liked Bondi and Coogee, but Bronte seemed to have the smallest crowds and the biggest waves, which was enjoyable to sit and watch. I wished I had gone earlier in the morning (I arrived around 7:30am), because the trail was VERY congested with morning runners and dog walkers. So if you plan to walk at a leisurely pace and enjoy the scenery (as I did), be prepared to feel like you're in the way of the local runners, particularly on the narrower bits of trail. Bondi to Coogee at a leisurely pace will probably take around 3 hours to complete, from my experience. If you're fast-walking and not stopping to take pictures or enjoy the breathtaking views, it can probably be done in much less time.My tip? Go around 5am just before dawn and finish at Coogee around 8am. And definitely go on a weekday, if possible."

The views are spectacular with the contrast of the cliffs and rocky outcrops right on the walk against the housing and amazing views of the sea with the waves pounding in and surfers catching rides. The track and sections of boardwalk are really well maintained. We walked both ways. Took about 1:15hr each way with a stop in Coogee for lunch. A great afternoon. You can walk one way and catch the bus back. Give it a go!"

I'm comparing it to Hawaii, Coronado and Florida that are part of top 10. Bondi beach is iconic and we went for that reason and the coastal walk. Definitely do the walk to see the blue water, take a break or jump in the water of the other beaches on the way. If you get too tired you can always hop a bus at any of them. Coogee beach is just as beautiful as Bondi beach and has a better lookout, more space and is \"newer\". They also have food, cafes, smoothies and ice cream. We thought it was worth the walk to it. Plenty of areas for pictures or just sitting on the cliff along the waters edge to take in the sound of the waves or do some tanning."

Each Beach is very different from the other. The walk provides the opportunity for a great workout or it can be taken at a leisurely pace to absorb all the gifts it has to offer, it is certainly art for the eyes.

A note of warning though, there are a few steep sections and stairs, so not good for prams or bad knees. If you want to run the route, there is a lot of congestion around late afternoon making it difficult. There are a few gym stations along the way and distance markers.

Great walk that takes in beautiful iconic views of Bondi beach and many other beautiful beaches along the way to Coogee which are just as awesome. Great time to go on this walk is when you can take a dip in every beach. Another good time is during Sculpture by the Sea in October-November. So you have the pleasure of the views and the sculptures."

Time taken is about an hour plus to close to two hours depending on how easy you take it. I walked the opposite way, starting from Clovelly beach which is suitable for families with young children, then ending at Bondi. As the path/road walk hugs the coast, its windy and cooling. The only thing you need to think about before starting the walk is how you wanna make your way to the start/end point. It makes a difference if you drive because you cannot walk and have your car followed you to the end point which happens in my case. If you stay out too late, the bus services do not wait for you."

The Coogee to Bondi Coastal walk is one of the most accessible scenic walks traversing a variety of cliff top views and some of Sydney's most picturesque beaches. In the last few years the actual route has been improved with decking along the Southern part from Coogee section going North namking easy to do.

The walk has a perfect view but to be honest, especially once you get to Bronte on the Bronte to Bondi leg it is really, really crowded and the so called 'locals', whom someone like me would call a \"blow-in\" can be especially rude if you are in their way. I wouldn't even consider it on a weekend or between 5.30am - 8.00am with the impatient morning runners on the particularly narrow path. If you are on holidays definitely do it but in the middle of the day Monday-Friday. You will love it, on your own. And, if you dont want to do it all, just do Coogee to Bronte \"God's Country\"."

Along the way you will see a variety of sand wind sculpted beautiful Sydney sandstone natural sculptures and two delightful bays. The 2nd, Tamarama is famed for its white sand and often heavy surf with a big rip so don't go too far in unless you are a reasonably strong swimmer. There are a couple of steep flights of steps coming from Bondi and to a lesser extent when you come down to Tamarama but easily surmounted for even the unfit.

No matter what time of the day you tackle it, the light is always different and there's always something new to discover. I like early mornings and late afternoons for my walks, as long as its not raining!. I often take a camera and over summer will always include a quick refreshing swim in the safe and clean waters of Clovelly Bay, as well as a cleansing ale at the Clovelly Hotel.A detour through the cemetery is a beautiful and humbling reminder of a forgotten age that should not be missed.For some, the bright lights and the action at Bondi will prove to be too much to leave, but for the others, the walk and a refreshing swim and ale at Clovelly is a little slice of heaven that your international guests and friends wont forget in a hurry!"

The relatively new boardwalk off the cliff below the cemetery is fabulous, but the cemetery itself is worth walking through. Avoid Sundays; weekdays best.

The views on this walk and the fact it is healthy and Free make this a MUST DO.There are some amazing views , excellent photo ops and you can incorporate brunch or coffee along the way as well if you like Depending on which end you start at or for an energy buff , do the return journey as well and finish off with a swim after or swim at several places along the way.Take some gold coins in a zip pocket so you don't have to worry about leaving belongings on the beach if you want to get a drink or a bite along the walk .If you're a visitor and find the hotels at Bondi a bit pricey , you could always book a room at the Crowne plaza at Coogee beach and this is on the walk and right opposite the ocean with amazing Cafes as well as a supermarket within walking distance For people on a tight budget or backpacking , there is also a backpackers at Coogee as well as Bondi and there are bbq facilities that are free along the walk , although I did here that may be changing to a gold coin to run the Bbq, still a heap day out though A must do if coming to Sydney"

Bondi is a sight in itself, and the smaller coves around the headland are accessed via green-lined walkways that almost everyone should be able to manage. Being on top of the cliffs, the views are incredible, but turn the other way and you will often also see beautiful rock formations carved out of this towering edifice. There are plenty of benches along the way if you want to absorb the view or rest for a while."

This is not a particularly difficult or strenuous walk and is regularly enjoyed by families and joggers alike. However there are quite a few stairs, so this is not suitable for prams, strollers or wheelchairs. Follow the well sign-posted cliff-hugging path around the magnificent sandstone headland and enjoy impressive views up and down Sydney\u2019s east coast. From mid-October to early November you may encounter especially large crowds, between the Bondi and Tamarama stretch, with thousands gathering for the annual Sculpture By The Sea. This brilliant exhibition has been running for many years and should not be missed. No matter when you take your walk, be sure to wear a hat and sunscreen, and take a bottle of water \u2013 particularly in the warmer months. Consider a dawn visit \u2013 and watch the sun come up over the majestic Pacific Ocean\u2026and head to Bondi Icebergs Club for a hearty breakfast. If later in the day is more your style then you can finish the journey back at the glamorous Icebergs Dining Room and Bar. At Bronte, beach side occupy a strip on Bronte Road (at the southern end of the beach, beyond the park), where you can enjoy coffee or more."

Tamarama to Bronte is about five minutes walk. The track itself can be busy and the start at Bondi is filled with tourists taking photos so just be wary of that. Also it's a hot walk - basically no shade the whole way but plenty of places to stop, take a break and look out over the ocean.

It was a baking hot day and we'd underestimated how long the whole walk would take. Fantastic scenery and rock formations on the way. Because the walk dips into all the bays on the way to Coogee, there's rest stops round each headland and you can also cut the walk short and get a bus back."

Had to visit as its so iconic but I was expecting it to be a lot bigger than it was. However, we walked along the sand and had a paddle. I'd got my swim stuff with me but decided just to have a 'paddle' here and wait until I got to a quieter beach along the walk. The walk was beautiful and well laid out with views of the sea virtually all the way. Stopped at Bronte beach for a 'swim', which was really just dashing in and out of the waves trying not to fall in, which I did! Good fun though and there were changing rooms and showers by the beach. After showering carried on walking and found another beach which might have been a bit calmer for swimming, seemed very popular but not too overcrowded. I think this was Clovelly beach.The walk itself took about two and half hours at very leisurely pace and there are drinking water taps along the way to refill your bottle.Take hat, sun cream and water."

Plenty of toilet facilities and water refill points at each beach. There's shelters for you to take a breather along the way too. If you're tired, you can take a bus from Clovelly beach too.

Can be busy on the weekend so recommend doing a week day if you have the option. Takes about 90 mins from Coogee to Bondi without stopping. You'll want to allow more time for lots of picture taking. :) Not a strenuous walk (few inclines) so most ppl could do it."

It's a great walk you'll never forget.

Was a nice enough day - not too hot- but remember the sunscreen!Two outdoor pools along the way so bring the swimming stuff! And the walk is totally worth it when you stop off at the nearest restaurant when you finish the walk in Coogee. Best fish in chips in town! (Massive portions!) Buses from the city to both Bondi/Cogee no matter which way you want to do the walk!"

Bring some things, gathers & towel in your backpack & take a detour in one of the bays. About half way there is a cove with changing rooms. Australia has it figured out!! Public toilets & handy showers & changing areas! Bring a bottle of water, but not to worry if you run out. Also, along the way are fresh water spouts for you & your pooch. When you stop at the outlook spots, don't forget to look back where you came from. The vistas are beautiful from both directions. A word to the wise on logistics. I started at Bondi & thought I'd just hop a bus back to the start. It's more practical of you leave from Bondi, just to hop a bus from Coogee back to your hotel, in our case Sydney CBD, so I took the bus from Coogee to Bondi Junction (note: Bondi Junction is NOT near Bondi Beach!) & caught train back to the city. The other note about this walk is that it is not flat. There ate hills & valleys, so prepare yourself for a hike. The trail is well kept, so you can easily do in tennis runners, but don't try it in thongs. Wear sunscreen & reapply. There is very little shade. There are plenty of food & drink places at both ends, so no need to worry on that score. It's great to say you did this walk. I've never been anywhere like this!"

The views are to die for and its a great way to get a workout in and see all the beaches on this side of Sydney. We started our morning with breakfast in Bondi and a few hours tanning and swimming there. We then had lunch at the Bondi Icebergs before beginning the walk. Overall it's not too challenging although towards the end there are some more hills and stairs. We stopped and swam at Bronte and Coogee as well to take a break. Overall it took about 2.5 hours to complete including the stops, and then we had a snack at the Coogee pavilion before heading back! It's a must do if you're in Sydney!"

The walk is a mix of footpath, boardwalk, and stairs, with plenty of places to stop along the way. The walk is achievable for all fitness levels and ages but there are some steep uphill sections and staircases here and there.No matter what time of the year, be sure to take plenty of water, wear sunscreen and a hat. Especially in summer you will need sunglasses as the glare off the water is dazzling.This is a very popular track, especially on weekends when it is packed with runners, power walkers, plus family groups. On busy days there will be points of congestion, you just need to be patient. If you want to avoid crowds, you'll need to either be up early or go during the week.Golden rule is to try to keep to the left of the path to allow for people coming the other way and faster people to pass you, walk single-file in busy sections.Be sure to take a camera, the ocean, beach, cliff, and park views are truly spectacular.You can start at either end - Bondi or Coogee - or anywhere along the way such as Clovelly, Bronte, or Tamarama. The full walk at a moderate pace with light people traffic takes around one and a half to two hours."

It's really worth it if you like walking on a track where you have sea accompanying you on one side.It may be little difficult for people with strollers but not impossible as there may be occasional stairs in between.If you get tired or want to take break in between, there will be intermediate beaches between Bondi to Coogee.

Mid morning mid week means you have escaped the weekend crowds and early morning joggers. Be prepared for a moderate level walk with stairways to negotiate. Apart from one small section of road between Coogee and Clovelly, most of the walk is a dedicated walking trail including a cliff hugging walkway in front of Waverley Cemetery. This cemetery is worth exploring for famous burial sites. On arrival at Bondi, you will be greeted by panoramic views across the famous beach. There are plenty of eateries in Bondi, some better than others, but one worth noting is Bondi Hall, 75-79 Hall Street on The RHS heading up the hill. Formerly a St Ali Sensory Lab it has recently changed hands. The same staff still make a great coffee but now also a great pastry and lunch menu at sensible prices."

The scenery as you leave the bustling noise of Bondi and pass the much photographed and famous 'Icebergs' swimming pool, is constantly stunning regardless of the weather conditions. Even as a Sydney sider I always come away realising just how fortunate I am to live close to such a beautiful coastline. Wether you want to run,jog or amble this path is acceptable and you wont be disappointed. Children love it. Go on put it on your list. It's free and the sun will warm your back and the smiles from people you pass will warm the experience along with the photo opportunities every step of the way."

When you get to Gordons Bay it looks like its easy to avoid the steps and walk to the beach across the rocks. Trust me you need to be a mountain goat to do it and it took us nearly an hour to navigate and it invoved a fair amount of climbing. If you end up at Coogee go to the Pavilion for a beer.

Could have been even better if not for the rushed timing as we have to walk to and fro so do allocate enough time for a leisurely walk as the distance is quite substantial.There are lots to see with some interesting rock formations along the way and of course, the timeless past time of people watching haha.

If possible try to go out of season or on a weekday - summer weekends it can get very busy, especially when 'Sculptures By the Sea' is on (October). It's not too far, and despite a number of steep steps at various points, it's a reasonably easy walk - can be done in flip flops. Some people even jog the route. There are water fountains on the way and some lovely viewpoints... Take your camera! Personally, I think the best bit is up until Bronte. The onward walk to Coogee is still gorgeous though. On a hot day, you may want to wear swimmers underneath to go for a dip. Also there are cafes en route at the beaches. At Coogee you can get the bus back to Bondi if you want. Also you can walk it in reverse direction - just as gorgeous! :)"

It can of course be interrupted to sit/lie on one of the natural limestone ledges or at one of the perfectly positioned benches for viewing the spectacular coast and its swimmers and walkers; or to have a meal (I brought along fantastic fish and chips from The Chip Store at Bondi Beach); or to have a swim (in a pool or the ocean ) and snorkel- I snorkeled at Clovelly, (where incidentally you can also watch a game of bowls). Being a very good snorkeling site it was a little crowded but I wasn't disappointed. I ran out of time for hot baths at Coogee so can't comment but hear they are wonderful. You can catch a bus at Coogee that will take you to the train at Bondi Junction and back to the city."

The walk from Bondi to Coogee takes quite a while (because you'll want to make frequent photo stops) but it is absolutely worth it, since it passes through some of the most stunning coastal scenery in Australia. The first part, from Bondi to Bronte, is a very easy walk, but it becomes more strenuous the closer you get to Coogee as there's a bit of an uphill climb and quite a few steps towards the end. The advantage, however, is that you can then reward yourself with a cold drink and a lovely relaxing lunch at the Coogee Pavilion."

I highly recommend the Clovelly Bowling and Rec Club along the path in Clovelly. Trying a new game was a lot of fun, the staff were very friendly and helpful providing a primer of the rules, and the opportunity to throw a few balls while enjoying a beer with the beaches and the South Pacific at one's back certainly blew this born and raised Midwesterner away. Take the time to leave the city and head east to the coast for a third or half day for this gorgeous walk."

The surf and surfers, the rocky windswept cliffs, the beautiful flowers and plants spilling down the cliffs, and the white sand beaches make this a perfect outing. It is an easy train ride from the Sydney Central station and a change onto a bus for a 15 minute bus ride through some interesting neighborhoods.I wouldn't recommend trying to push a stroller because of the many steps and the uneven path surface but my 73 year old husband and I thoroughly enjoyed the walk. There are numerous spots to sit and enjoy the view...and many water fountains with a side tap to refill your water bottles courtesy, I assume, of the local municipality.My advice: Don't miss this!!If you are interested in history, be sure to walk around the Waverly Cemetary, along the way."

Parts are easy, others difficult with steps. There are no toilets or shops available, so prepare beforehand. The coastal seascape is always changing, good or bad weather, it is always photogenic. The area is frequently used by the fitness set, so try to keep to the edge of the path to avoid collisions, partic, early morning or night. Each end has excellent transport and my favourite, a gelato shop ,on the beach at Coogee. I take an hour to do this , dawdling and looking at the scenery. A memorable deviation on any travellers list."

If it's a sunny day, the sparkle on the water adds to the wonder of the view. But REMEMBER, the sun is fierce in Australia and hats, water and sunscreen are essential."

Some good tips are: Try to avoid weekends, there are far fewer people on the trail on weekdays; park your car in Coogee to walk to Bondi and back, the parking in Bondi is very limited. The walk is especially rewarding when Sculptures By The Sea is on, (during November I think), as the whole trail is dotted with entries for this exhibition of amazing talent from around the world."

The walk passes through the best eastern beaches of Sydney, Tamarama, Bronte, Clovelly, together with places such as Macenzies and Gordon's Bay so you might just make the walk from Bondi to Tamarama, or, from Coogee to Clovelly. If you are looking to make a day of it I would start out with Breakfast at Bondi at any one of the cafes along Campbell Pde, have a swim at any of the beaches on the way or in the ocean pool at Clovelly and finish with lunch at any of the cafes in Coogee Bay Rd or in The Pavilion which is the local pub on the beach in Coogee. And if you have come from the city just jump on the 373 bus and enjoy the trip back to Circular Quay."

I'll explain why in a moment).The views are wonderful (which, admittedly, we can sometimes take for granted) and the solitude you find on great swathes of the path make enjoying them that much more magical. The walk is not a difficult one for anyone with even a semblance of fitness - however rather than see it as a race I'd suggest making an afternoon of it and stopping off at some of the fantastic cafes and bars along the way - each enclave has its own 'flavour and flair' and, if you're up for it some friendly locals who'll be happy to have a chat. If you really want to make an occasion of it - pack along some fancy footwear and, once the schlep is over, pop into Icebergs for a phenomenal degustation - which you've certainly worked up an appetite for.

And no matter what beach you end up at it is easy to get a bus back to the city.I would definitely recommend a broad rimmed hat and lots of sunscreen. One water bottle is probably enough because there are so many public drinking fountains along the way. We walked from Bondi to Coogee on a 75 degree late summer day, and by the time we reached Coogee we were pretty cooked. But then we had a wonderful meal in a cafe overlooking a park near the ocean, and had a nice swim before taking a bus back to the city"

It is a MUST DO Experience, at least you should have more than 7 nights as some hotels will give you special price if you stay over 7 nights, and to explore Sydney, 7-10 day are not even long enough, frankly speaking.

We did it the day after Australia Day so there were only a handful people mostly locals walking their dogs or exercising. It's only when we got to Bronte that we met, who we assume were tourists, because like us they were covered up and had backpacks.On the day we walked, it was cloudy. There is a clear footpath and a few stairs and we did the entire walk for 2H and 20 minutes taking time to take pictures, sit on the bench and finish off our breakfast. There are water fountains along the way.Coogee is a nice beach. I liked Clovelly where you can swim laps on the ocean across the two ends of the concrete sides. It seems safe because you're within that bay. There seems to be a lot of seaweeds by the beach though. Bronte was bigger than I imagined. Tamarama also looks nice. This is where we stopped to finish off our breakfast. And Bondi, well, it is what I expected. Thankfully, there were not a lot of people and there were flags up. But, we still didn't go into the water as we felt chilly. We came back on the weekend though for the hubby to run Bondi-Bronte-Bondi. He said there were a lot of people. And we did swim this time and enjoyed the water.Showers and toilets are at Bondi Pavilion and are free. Lockers available for a price.I watch Bondi Rescue which introduced me to Bondi and the other beaches. I was thrilled to see the lifeguards and kinda sad that there were no rescues while we were there and see them in action. The show actually made me scared to go into the water because of the rips. And it was also the reason why me and the hubby didn't go into the water together because someone might steal our bags (it doesn't happen often). Most people though just leave their stuff and go dive into the water."

We were there on a Sunday and there were literally thousands of people there. Bronte was also nice albeit smaller. We grabbed a taxi from there down to Coogee Beach ($12). Coogee is nice and supposedly more popular with the locals. Saw some people jumping off some of the 25 foot cliffs into relatively small pools of water. A bit crazy, but nice to be young and brave.Overall, the walk is really nice and the coastal scenery - water, beaches, cliffs, rocks and houses are all pretty spectacular."

The usual spectacular views in this unique coastal walk along the cliff between Bondi Beach to Coogee, is more than doubly enhanced by the addition of the Sculpture by the Sea exhibition, which I visit annually. The walk for me did stop earlier at Bronte Beach which is where the sculpture stops. I always take photos of each piece of sculpture and also stop for a delicious lunch at the Grounds by the Sea cafe so the whole experience takes me half a day. Well worth investing time to do this walk and you must take your camera. I recommend taking a jacket as it can get gusty along the cliffs and wearing block out lotion and a hat for the sun of course."

I knew Sydney had some nice beaches, but I was completely blown away by the sheer beauty of these beaches and coves (please see my pics). It is not an easy walk \u2013 it's about 5K and a good amount of stairs. But I think it is completely worth it! Even if you don't do the full walk, it is worth doing any part of it as it is really that impressive. I also went to Manly Beach the next day which was also nice, but nothing compares to the variety of natural beauty you see while doing this walk. Highly, highly recommend doing this if you have some time in Sydney."

The good points are lots of beaches on the way to stop at (with cafes, etc), as well as the two busy larger beaches bookending the walk - Bondi and Coogee of course. It's varied - making its way up and down from Bondi around a cliff face, on top of a cliff, through parkland, streets, and even a cemetery. The parts I didn't like so much was that there were lots of people using it so it wasn't ideal for a jog (although it may add to the walking experience). Also there are many parts of the walk which are just along streets so the views are only in certain sections - next to each of the beaches.For those who are visiting, the walk is very well signposted and there are direct buses from the CBD to Bondi and Coogee. You are on exposed cliffs at certain points so it can be windy. At a good pace without stopping, it takes 60-90 minutes (6km)."

I was feeling a bit lazy from the jet lag and thought about just walking around Sydney for my day #2 there before leaving for Melbourne. I am so happy I motivated myself to get out there. The views are outstanding!! Definite Highlight of my time in Sydney. Don't delay in getting out there."

The scenery is fantastic, it's great to watch the surfers or people playing with dogs on the beaches, there are a few sculptures dotted around, some fantastic photo opportunities. The full walk is about 6km, there are a few inclines or sets of steps, but nothing too strenuous. Coogee is a lovely place to finish, thought it was probably the best of the beaches and a nice little town. My favourite day of our holiday."

Not only were the views amazing I thought the layout (reasonably wide paths, many places with handrails) assured the walk was appropriate for almost anyone (seniors, kids, tourists, locals). The breeze off the ocean help you keep cool. There are benched along the way as well as historical and natural history tips posted along the way.

            "review": "Sydney's Coastal Walk Trail. This is a must do! The City of Sydney has made it possible to hike (walk or run) along the magnificent coast line that separates the famous Bondi Beach from Bronte to Coogee Beaches. The entire trail is a long one, and it is workout, but the views are simply spectacular. With Bondi as a starting point, you will travel along the path that is comprised of concrete/rock-like stairs (steep in some areas), natural surface or paved walkways, as well as wooden and metal bridge ways; safety rails as well so not to worry. There are several cliffs and rock clusters that overhang the ocean which are perfect photo staging posts. You will pass magnificent rock erosions, either as side walls or overhead, that are reminiscent of cave interiors; simply amazing rock formations carved by nature. And yes, the sea breeze or spray from the ocean leaping over the rocks is just ideal to cool your brow while you sit on a cliff. The walk is best enjoyed by taking time to stop at the beaches along the the way; there is even a mini gulf/pot pot park! Randwick's Clovelly Bay is along the way too and presents an opportunity to learn about the fish life in the area. The long walk ends with the last beach on the trail - Coogee Beach! A dip is quite fitting at this juncture. I enjoyed this walk immensely!Please note that while I did not time myself, the entire walk took me over an hour to complete. I am runner, and I stopped at each beach, but I found it to be a long trek. I saw walkers of various ages but not everyone should do the entire trail. Tip: Wear appropriate walking/exercise shoes and carry water with you! Also, do the walk early evening after spending time at Bondi Beach."

It was such a fantastic walk, such beautiful scenery along the way to take lots and lots of photos. id recommend to do it from Coogee to because its more exciting when you get to bondi. It was a pretty wet day that we went on and i wouldn't regret it either because it actually kinda cooled us when we were walking.Theres so many things to see along the walk too and the most beautiful was the old cemetery, we walked through it and read a couple gravestones and some of them were from the 1800 which was amazing to see. We were lucky to go and see the sculptures by the sea too. We did the walk in in 1 hour there and 1 hour back. it doesn't take very long at all.Id totally do it again."

Its approx 6 km of coastal path, sometimes very close to the edge as you walk along cliff tops and boardwalks. Start at the iconic Bondi Icebergs, just above the Bondi Baths, the walk takes between 1-2 hours at a leisurely pace, offering plenty to see and do along the way - I suggest packing your swimmers. You can walk either direction and as there are lots of stairs you should have a reasonable fitness. You can also walk back, continue on to Maroubra (another 3km) or catch a bus back to Bondi."

This is a better direction than Bondi to Coogee because:- We wanted to spend a little time at several of the beaches along the way, picnicking at one of them, then ending up at Bondi to spend the rest of the day- it's cool to view Bondi from the cliff path as you approach itTips:- Be aware than most restaurants are closed Christmas Day so pack a picnic- the Subway at Coogee was open- Pack sunnies, SPF lotion, a hat and plenty of water (I wore a hat - the others in my group who didn't ended up with a sunburned face)- Ben & Jerry's ice cream parlor was open at Bondi. Nice place to reward yourself for the hike"

The views were awesome.It really is not an issue whether you start the walk from Coogee or Bondi as both the ways has same kind of incline and stairs .The pathway was well laden and there is absolutely no problem for that 2-3 hours walk which includes few stairs too. Just get some snacks and make sure of sun screen if you are visiting during peak hours in summer (12-3pm). It can get crowded later in the afternoon after 4-5pm.There are safe drinking water fountains to refill your water bottles. There are sit-downs so that you can stop by along the walk and enjoy the views. The coastal walks covers Coogee, Bronte, Clovelly, Tamarama and Bondi beach.This is a must do if you are in Sydney and the views are just wonderful and refreshing."

But once you've seen it, a great route away from it is south along the coast to Bronte and then Coogee. There's a path most of the way, and it's an easy walk - even when the temperature is in the 30s and the sun is beating down on you. There's usually lots of other people around, so if you want solitude, go somewhere else. But if you enjoy walking along the coast, with wonderful rock formations and lovely views, this is a great walk."

It is an extremely popular walk and we were surprised at how many people were on the path.We walked the entire stretch from Bondi to Coogee but there are plenty of points to stop or beaches to visit if the full route is a bit daunting.

The walk is completely paved with railings. I don't hike because there is nothing to see en route and you have to go up hill. This walk is pretty much even, not many inclines, like I said, super leisurely. If you are tired and you don't want to finish the walk, come back the next day, start from the half way point, that's what we did! We walked from Bondi to Tamarama, then the next day Coogee to Tamarama. Coogee beach is alright, there is Wylie's baths or McIver's baths (women and children only), then my favourite spot to swim is Clovelly beach. We stumbled upon Clovelly!

We have taken this walk, often from Bondi to Tamarama beach, but occasionally the full distance walk along the clifftops. All weather conditions are OK, but for me especially when the surf is running and with mild off-shore breeze to hold the waves a few seconds longer. It is a great place to bring overseas visitors or just locals getting some exercise. At times parts of the route can be rather crowded."

We were short in time after we had arrived to Bondi Beach, and I marked the Coastal Walk as a must for me. So my uncle and I did the walk, to Bronte. The walk itself gave me views that I never expected to see, the Pacific waves hit the shores violently and miles of coastal plants guided the path. Stop by in Marks Park and few viewpoints along the way, you'll get to see surfers challenging the tsunami-like waves and headlands. Tamarama Beach was the smallest, but having the lowest crowd. But nothing beats Bronte Beach,the most spectacular of all and also my favorite beach till now, the scenery was indescribable and we got to spend a few minutes at the beach before heading back to Bondi. We wanted to walk all the way to Coogee but the sky was getting darker and darker while we were making our way back,eventually we went back but the views alone were unforgettable. Just one thing to avoid - touching the handle (sometimes there's bird poop and you can hardly notice them) along the way."

Both Coogee and Bondi Beach are easily accessible by public transport. The walk can be done in either direction, but I always start in Coogee. It is easy to follow the path at the North end of Coogee Beach, through Gordon's Bay (a great place for scuba diving), Clovelly (my favourite place to go snorkelling), Bronte, Tamarama and finally Bondi Beach. Most of the path is via a cliff-top board walk and walking path, but even when the route diverts to a road, you can simply follow the other walkers to find the way. The walk itself should take about 2 hours, but I would allow at least another hour to stop off for a drink, snack or swim at one of the amazing beaches. There are some uphill sections and it contains several sections with stairs so you need a moderate level of fitness. My favourite time to do this walk is late afternoon/early evening on a summer's day. It is very popular with tourists and locals, especially in late October-November when the Sculptures by the Sea art exhibition is on, so expect quite a few people to be sharing the path with you!"

Sometimes it takes an outside perspective to help us rediscover what we should have known all along, our beaches are beautiful!My outside perspective came in the form of a travelling friend from the Netherlands. Upon her suggestion we decided to do this walk and see what all the fuss was about. In truth, despite living here I had never bothered to attempt it.It is well worth the time and effort and is not physically strenuous. It really is a walk - not a hike or an uphill battle against your legs. The views are constant and stunning. Additionally, if you are not familiar with Australian beaches or our coastline it is a great way to experience such beauty in under 2 hours or so - maybe quicker depending on your pace. Take a camera - there is so much beauty to see as you look out towards the seemingly endless ocean ahead. Take your swimmer - incase you want to swim at the beach at the beginning or end of your journey.Choose a good time - While there is no ideal time to do this walk, I found going midday / arfternoon had a bonus of being able to see the sun begin to set at the end of the journey. I believe if you have an interest in sunrises, as these beaches are on the eastern side morning sunrises can be spectacular.Note you will be going for the view but there are plenty of good cafes etc around that you should be able to grab a decent meal at the end of the trek. There's also a Coogee beach takeaway shop called 'Chish and Fips' close by the beach towards the end of the walk. I can't remember the quality but don't believe it was a bad eat from memory"

May not be fully accessible to those in wheelchairs, but that still doesn't preclude one from enjoying the views along the other sections of the walk. Very light and easy, suitable for young and old alike, and is also free. You may be tempted to take a detour along one of the beached so bring your swim gear."

This was a nice break during our Sydney travel. Sydney is an awesome city with a lot of things to do and eat and explore. It's great on art, food and views. But Bondi to Coogee is another layer. I went there in the beginning of Australian summer and the walk was very refreshing. Almost all the way just beside the blue water. You can swim for sometimes and relax. You can jog too if you want. Overall, a great walk by the sea that is so close to the heart of the city.My advice will be to take public transport (bus) to Bondi and then walk to Coogee and take a bus back to the city. Because I have seen parking is a big problem around the area."

There are lots of steps in some parts but it is a purpose built walk.The kids were not keen to walk all the way back after a beautiful lunch, so we just caught a cab for about $15. Great day out.

This is a lovely walk where you can admire a nice string of coast.Along the walk you get to see huge beaches such as Coogee and Bondi and some smaller beaches as Tamarama and Bronte and some even tinier ones which look like the ones in the Balearic beaches in Europe.I recomment you reach Coogee by bus from your location and you walk back to Bondi. It's quite a few kilometres but it is definitely worth it! It's a good idea to stop for a swim and for a bbq at Tamarama beach to break the walk before you reach the amazing spot which looks upon Bondi Beach.It's also a lovely walk to spot some of the fanciest villas of the coast! Best walk in Sydney and best way to stay fit while having fun!!!"

Have coffee at one of the cafes in Bronte, then return to Bondi for a swim in the surf. If you're doing this walk in summer - you will need to cool off in the ocean - bliss. If you are in Sydney in October, the Sculptures by the Sea will be on and that makes the walk even more interesting, however it does get extremely busy...Pic below of the beautiful Bondi Beach"

The 333 bus from downtown Sydney gets you there for about AUD3.50 each way and takes about 20 minutes (off at the first Campbell Parade stop). There are lots of beach clothing and souvenir shops along Bondi Beach as well as many neat places to eat. Allow yourself enough time to take the walk and enjoy the beach too.There are filtered water stations along the walk as well as bathrooms at the beach areas. Definitely wear sunscreen, especially when it's windy because you won't realize you're getting sunburned until it's a done deal! We were there around Xmas/New Year's so the walking path was very crowded...a bit frustrating to walk at your own pace.This is a great getaway from the Sydney CBD and doesn't cost much. A great day trip."

We were going to stop for a drink in Bronte but it was so busy we opted to sit on the park area in the shade with a sandwich. We caught the bus back from Coogee. Would recommend doing thus walk as it is easy, good paths etc."

The beaches, the rock formations, the surf, the cliff dwellings, the rock platforms ... it's what characterizes Sydney and what sets it apart from the whole rest of the world. I come from Sydney originally but have lived away for over 30 years now, and I do this walk or one of the lesser-known harbour/ocean walks every time I come home. Start at Bondi (drive & park for a fee, or take a train to Bondi Junction, then a bus down to Bondi beach), walk around to Tamarama, then to Coogee, stopping and eating along the way at Tamarama Beach then continuing on. The take a bus to almost anywhere you need from Coogee. Or just go as far as Tamarama if time is tight, and walk back to Bondi directly through the streets instead of back around the ocean pathway. And if you do take the pathway back again, stop at the Bondi Icebergs and take a dip in their historic pools, or just have a coffee there and watch the waves, swimmers, yoga devotees, or the clouds rolling by."

If all you want to see is the sea, this will get very repetitive- and perhaps you may want to avoid this incredible coastal sea hike- past beautiful surf beaches and scenery at every turn. If repetition is your thing, however, this hike will more than satisfy! Highly recommended."

Take the time to absorb the scenery rather than just to get your exercise, you won't be disappointed. Path is uneven in sections along with inclines and declines. This not a multiuse trail (no bikes). Bring along a backpack with bathing suit, towel, snacks and water bottle and you can stop at the multiple beaches you will pass. Facilities at many of them. Not a strong swimmer? Some inlet beaches are very calm. You can also swim in ocean pools; Bondi Beach charges you a fee but Bonte Beach does not.

This section alone was worth 5 stars and is a relatively easy and quick walk for those with less time (me) and less able. Finished the walk with a lovely breakfast overlooking Bondi Beach. Getting there can be difficult but with 3 people it was worth getting a taxi to Tamarama and a taxi back from Bondi. Don't do the other way as taxis and transport is hard to access at Tamarama. The walk itself is absolutely wonderful - every twist and turn in the walk provides another fantastic vista and photo opportunity with people walking, jogging and generally exercising throughout the walk's length (admittedly we walked on a Sat morning). Walk goes past the lovely ocean pool just as you hit Bondi. Definitely worth doing."

Clovelly is a beautiful little enclosed bay, safe swimming for all the family from either the sand or the Prom. The cafe serves nice food and a great place to break the walk. The walk through the Waverley Cemetery is interesting and very old with spectacular views."

Rock steps, cliffs, lovely coves, hardy headlands, neat and sunny beaches, and water in view almost all the time.The section between Bondi and Coogee is really great for grabbing some fresh air and enjoying some exercise. The path is undulating with some steeper sections but it's manageable for most people. If you struggle with steps or slopes then it may not be for you.I've walked the route in both directions. It doesn't matter where you start. I guess if you've not been to Bondi you may want to start in Coogee so you get the impact of your first view as you turn the last headland.The beauty of the route is you can choose to do as much or as little as you like. Probably 1.5 to 3 hours one way, depending on your walking speed and how often you stop for a rest, photos or refreshments.Take a sunhat, suncream, sunglasses, a bottle of water and some cash for coffee with you. There are drinking fountains at some points along the route you can make use of, too. Take your time, especially if it's your first experience of this route. There are some obvious points where you may want to stop and take in the views of the waves crashing against the rocks below or see surfers in action (eb Bronte).Coogee has one of the larger beaches and it's a gentle starting point for your walk. Plenty of options to get anything you need before you set off. The coastal route is pretty easy to find and keep to. If unsure, just follow the crowd or ask. Past Gordon's Bay, with boats lined up just below the path, it's a short walk to Clovelly.Clovelly has a small beach and a lifeguard-patrolled inlet of water. Very popular with families. It's a lovely little spot. There's a cafe and takeaway kiosk here, too. With toilet facilities. A handy pitstop should you need it.Parts of the path now have dedicated walkways. Less fun than the exposed rock tops below but probably a lot safer.Passing a large hillside cemetery, you reach Bronte. There's a popular beach, some parkland and for surfers some decent waves when the sea is right. Overlooking these is a road lined with cafes and eateries. Take your pick. There are some good ones there, usually pretty busy, too.Tamarara is the next main point towards Bondi. A small beach. Am told the surf can get quite rough here. You may notice that on your wanderings from the safety of the headland. Again, some good cafe choices here.Bondi has a certain kudos and mystique, yet it's not my favourite beach. It is worth seeing. It's a wide sweep of a circular bay with an inviting stretch of sand. A mecca for backpackers from around the world, it's a place heavily geared up for tourists, not always on a budget.A great walk for the early morning or late afternoon. Just be aware that the weather can change quite quickly. Clouds can build up and afternoon thunderstorms in the summer can be short but very sharp, even with hail. Check the forecast before you go."

The scenery was stunning with lots of small bays and inlets as well as costal shrubs. There are great cafes at both ends with some along the route as well. Bringing swimmers and a towel as well as sunscreen and water are essential."

If you consider walking from Coogee to Bondi (or the vice-versa), do it in the early morning or later in the afternoon (read here after 5 pm in summer). In this case you will not be sweating all the time and you will avoid the risk of being sun-burnt. Though applying sunscreen is still a very good idea! The walk itself is not hard at all and can be enjoyed by people of all ages as long as you love the beach, coastal line and the uninterrupted view of the ocean. It is great all year round! Not to mention, that you can enjoy swimming right after the walk or grab some snacks at Bondi pavilion, enjoy a glass of sparkling wine at Iceberg or have a dinner at one of Bondi's cafes :)"

So had half of Sydney by the look of it!! The views were spectacular and got better as we progressed and the weather cleared. Bondi is crowded but Bronte was really lovely. We enjoyed a dip at the end and particularly in the rock pool. Not as good as I was expecting but nice to do"

After getting off the Hop On Hop Off Bus at one end of the Bondi Beach we strolled along the length of the Beach taking in the beautiful Pacific Ocean, the surfers, the sun and the vastness. At the other end, where the public washrooms are located, the Bondi to Coogee Coastal Walk commences. This winding, undulating walkway is a great venue for strollers, walkers, joggers, people looking for some quietude, and even an occasional friends group sitting with drinks on the rocks. The walkway is dotted with several exercising facilities, such as step ups and bars where you could do a host of calisthenics. Nice to see the authorities spend public money wisely for public good. Many countries could learn. The Bondi to Coogee walk is quite long mainly because of the many short climbs up and down the paved way. It's exhilarating and another must-do. We went a little over half the way before turning back to Bondi beach where we boarded a public bus to Bondi Junction to catch a train back to our hotel. A beautiful evening -- exactly a month back to the day as I write this -- when there was daylight until 8 pm."

Just about 10 minutes of walk I arrived at another small but very beautiful beach called TAMARAMA BEACH. The view from Tamarama beach is breathtaking and just after a short walk you will reach another beautiful beach called BRONTE BEACH. There are a few cafes and restaurant if you like to eat and rest. The walk from BRONTE BEACH to COOGEE BEACH is a bit long walk and you will definitely enjoy the view along CLOVELLY BEACH. You can certainly end your trip at clovelly beach if you are tired and catch Sydney Buses to connect to Bondi Junction or Central and Circular Quay in the city. If you are fit enough continue along the coastal walk and you won't even realized you are at COOGEE Beach."

This beautiful paved walkway winds its way from Bondi to Coogee, leading entranced followers around cliffed headlands and into golden sandy bays, wending along the boundary line between high density homes and apartments that cling precariously to the hilly eastern Sydney shores, and the open Pacific stretching to the horizon. The ever-changing mood of the ocean means no two visits are the same - varying from sunrise reds and silvers through to noon-time transparent azure; from millpond calm, through petulent grey, to wild and stormy. Opportunities for swimming, snorkellong or surfing abound; or perhaps picnics under shady gazebos may appeal, or beach playgrounds and rock pools for the kids. If you happen by in November, Sculptures by the Sea, along the Bondi to Tamarama secton, is a marvellous spectacle of the most outstanding of human sculptural art backdropped by the finest that nature has to offer. At one point, between Bronte and Clovelly, the coastal trail even passes through historic Waverley Cemetery, perched forbodingly on the sloping sandstone clifftop. Bus services frequent both the Bondi and Coogee ends of the walk, and various points inbetween."

When we decided to do this walk it was promising to be a very hot day but as this was the only day the two of us could do it together we decided to proceed. So we set off with bottled water, caps and covered in sunscreen. Thank goodness! as it turned out to be a 35 deg C day!!!This is an amazing walk and the only negative I would speak of would be that there was really no shade to speak of along the way. It was a great walking track but no trees shading any part of it. So.....be much wiser than we were on a hot day. We started off at Coogee Beach and walked towards Bondi. The beaches are truly beautiful - and each one of them incredibly different. My particular favourite was Gordons Bay - the water was that rich turquoise colour - so pretty!Bronte Beach was our lunch stop (we had planned to get to Bondi for lunch but because of the heat we really needed a rest and a bit of refreshment before we could continue). There were lots of cute eateries at Bronte and our lunch was yummy.As mentioned we were very glad of our water, caps and sun cream as they were necessary. It didn't take our water long to warm up as we walked but luckily there are filtered water taps along to path so we were able to fill up with cooler water as we travelled along.I would really recommend this walk but make a better decision when you walk than we did. If you do choose a hot day - at least walk in the cool of the morning or the evening."

You will have to walk up and down some steep steps along the way but I definitely recommend this if you are abled. You get to see breath taking views of the beach from a distance and admire the coastal beauty of Australia as you go. There are many seats along the way where you can rest and filtered water to fill up your bottles in case you get thirsty. Do remember you will have to walk back to where you started. There is one or two bus stop at certain beach where you can take the bus if you do get tired but you have to check the bus number to see where it goes. "

There are several stairs and steepish climbs along the way, so pack comfortable shoes and chilled water. If you just need a quick breather, stop off at one of the beaches along the way for a swim or there are a couple of places you can get refreshments, but be advised there aren't that many!Bronte is the perfect point to sit back and enjoy and refuel. You'll navigate beaches from atop beaches, parks and even a massive cemetery plus there are some resting benches along the way.We took it very easy and estimate we took us 3 hours but it can be done more quickly.It's definitely worth and it doesn't cost a cent!!"

My advice would be to start from Coogee and finish up in Bondi, there is something quite dramatic about rounding the final turn and setting your sights on Bondi for the first time. A finish in Coogee is a little anticlimactic. Have lunch or a drink at the Coogee Pavilion and be sure to bring your swimsuit in summer so you can have a dip on Bondi when you finish!"

Take the #373 or #374 bus from Circular Quay to its terminus in Coogee. Get off the bus, walk towards the water and voila` - you will see the path. One thing to keep in mind is that the path shifts around a lot and at times you could end up walking on a street instead of along the cliffs. Just keep your eyes peeled and you'll see the best way to go. And I recommend walking through the cemetery, not around it, it was beautiful and you don't have to walk on the graves in any case. Make sure your camera/phone is charged - lots of great pics to take on this one. It was way empty til I got up to around Tamarama, then it was getting full of tourists going the other way. I highly recommend this for early morning on an overcast or cooler day. I loved seeing how the Aussies utilize the ocean to their advantage by building them right along the cliffs. If I had more time I would have planned a swim! 6 miles, it took about 2.5 hours at a slow-middling pace. If you use walking sticks, definitely bring them. Proud to say I was mistaken for a local twice, mostly because multiple off leash dogs being walked by locals kept running up to me to say hi (this happens to me worldwide), and I was asked \"Which dog is yours?\" both times. I do my best to blend in wherever I go ;-)"

It can get hot in summer so, take water and a hat. If you want to start at Bondi end, there is plenty of public transport to the beach. Head to the south end of the beach. The start of the walk is behind the Icebergs building (large white building with pool in front of it). You can get to it by the footpath on the road or from the promenade behind the beach, using the stairs near the Icebergs building. Note the cafe/bar in the Icebergs building (beside the entrance to the silver service restaurant), you will want to go in on your return. Off you go. Sydney sandstone carved by wind and water. The ocean swell rolling in. Scrub, small streams. Small deep beaches of yellow/white sand. Board riders on the waves off the beaches. The occasional whale swimming north or south with calves, in whale season. After walking, drop in to the Icebergs club bar and cafe for a well earned beer and burger looking out over the ocean.

We took the local bus to Coogee and headed over to Bondi from there.It's a well trodden path so even fairly early in the day there were plenty of people alongside us. It did get busier as we got closer to Bondi where people were headed in the opposite direction.We saw many aspects of the beautiful ocean, the crashing waves, watched the surfers at certain points. I spotted a Kookaburra in one of the trees. We noted the adult outdoor gyms in some of the parks which was a cool featureMy favourite though was the cemetery on the hill, what a view and perfect resting placeI was pretty glad to see the end and the Surf Club Pool at the other end though, nice walk great views sore feet!"

The weather was lovely and the views were just stunning, especially towards the end where most of the sculptures were. Along the way, we past by the famous Bondi Icebergs Hotel which was a truly stunning sight!After the walk, we stopped by at Trio Cafe for lunch, as recommended by Tripadvisor. What a great recommendation that was! The entire Bondi area had a relaxing feel to it. Definitely a must-go!"

I started at Coogee as I wanted to spend longer at the iconic Bondi Beach, but you could easily do it the other way around, or just do sections of it. Coogee has some great cafes and restaurants for a more chilled out vibe if you want to end with a meal. Incredible views throughout, and the walk takes you along five different beaches -- Coogee (chilled, great cafes), Clovelly (sheltered, swimmable), Bronte (gorgeous! watch the surfers!), Tamarama (smaller, right next to Bronte) and finally Bondi Beach. It shouldn't take more than 1.5 - 2 hours and is a relatively easy trek. Factor in more time if you like to take photos or stop off at a cafe (which you should!). I can't wait to come back! :)"

Anyone able to walk a couple of km shouldn't miss out on this urban treasure on the coast, particularly as the beach sculptures adorn what is already a superb experience. Starting from the park adjacent to Coogee Beach, we enjoyed a pathway leading around the many bays and inlets of the southern Sydney coast affording a superb array of coastal views, rocky headlands, lush flora, and pounding surf. And all over a very well constructed path that undulates up and down the coastline. We were amazed by the sheer diversity: beaches, surf, parks, and the Waverley Cemetery which must be one of the most beautifully scenic locations for the dear departed. We saw surfers and snorkellers, sunbathers, swimming and sauntering. The Sculptures by the Sea comprises a wonderful array of modern shapes to challenge our imagination. There are places to stop and just be, see and enjoy. We did the walk on a November Saturday afternoon and it was busier than Sydney airport arrivals' lounge at times, but walking back from Bondi in the late afternoon was much less populous and far more tranquil, with just the company of sea birds and occasional joggers enjoying being here. There are a few places to get refreshments, and if the walking gets too much you can always take a link to the roads and get a bus. Although the 6km out and 6km back was a fair trek, rather than a genteel stroll, we thought it was by far the best experience of many great ones during our holiday here. Well done to the far-sighted community members who created this stunning resource."

I'd recommend an early morning (before 10) or late afternoon if you want to minimize the crowds of families. Whilst there are a few places with steps, overall it's a fairly easy walk.

In Ocotber /early November a significant part of the walk becomes the Sculpture Walk- fantastic, but very crowded.If you feel like stopping for a coffee or bite to eat- there are lots of options along the way, and of course plenty of swimming opportunities.And you can walk beyond Coogee on to Maroubra- you would have to go along a few suburban streets to do this but it is lovely to see Maroubra beach as well.Allow at least an hour to go from Bondi to Coogee- up to 2 to do it comfortably."

Peak time is at the end of October, early November when it hosts Sculpture by the Sea. Fabulous sculptures and extremely busy. It is busier on the weekends so if you have the opportunity to walk on a weekday do it. On the odd occasion we have seen whales. Lovely sandstone cliffs and beautiful beaches Wear sunscreen, take a hat and enjoy the scenery. Have a coffee at Bronte or a swim on the journey. It has lots of steps so leave the bikes behind. Very young children may find it too tiring so just do part of the walk. There is a playground at Tamarama for the kids. Great for jogging or even dog walking. (No dogs on the beach)"

This is a terrific walk - great antidote to my jet lag - as I went from Tamara to Bondi and back to Coogee. Quite a way, 90-120 min round trip. Mostly it has great views - but is not well signed so you have to follow your nose - though I ended up on dead ends a couple of times. Also the hard-core fitness people are pounding the paths and generally manage to avoid you, though it can be disconcerting. I can see why they use the path as it's a stunning and easy walk - though not wheelchair friendly as there are many steps."

Bondi is a popular beach , However to me Coogee is a much nicer beach on a par with Manley and the Northern Beaches."

I thought that this would have an effect on the mood of the area and my attitude towards doing the walk but it ended up making the walk a really pleasant one as it wasn't too hot and the sun was not shining down on us. We started at Bondi Beach and walked for a short while along there before heading to the concrete walking track. It's a really easy walk to follow with the path clearly marked and wide to cater for all the visitors. It's effortless really and leads itself to a nice gentle stroll. I was initially a bit daunted by the distance of the walk when I looked it up on the internet but once you get walking and enjoying the view, you really don't feel the distance.There are numerous places to rest and take in the view along the way. There are also beaches you can stop and have a swim at or shops where you can buy drinks and ice creams too."

However, this also means that the walk is drawing an even bigger crowd than normal and on a sunny weekend day. If crowds bother you, go early and on a week day. While Bondi Beach seems far away on Map of Sydney, it is actually just 4 metro stops from the CBD to Bondi Junction where you switch to a buss that will drop you directly at the beach. It is fairly fast and pretty darn cheap trip to get here and a cheap, but long trip back from Coogee Beach at the end of the hike.The cliffs along the way are beautiful and the tourqouis and teal water is gorgeous.At the end of the hike, here is a quirky, but yummy Coogee Beach Club serving up Aussi style cocktails and Meditteranean food with beach views."

Plenty of opportunities to go into the water on the way, so bring your swim suit (or swimmers, as they say)! Can be done in flip-flops (or thongs as they call them here, cause they have another word for that, too) and it is all under the sun, so have shades, sun screen etc if you go late morning/early afternoon.

Take a 3 hour ticket. Cost is $10.50. Then take the walk to Tamarama where the sculptures begin. Progressing towards Bondi at thus time for us was fewer crowds and better viewing, You will feel the busyness growing as you get closer to Bondi. Don't forget to stop in to the Sculptures Inside exhibition in the park near the Grounds of Alexandria pop up. A great morning out and social media fodder abounds."

Now instead of needing to cut through a graveyard you walk past it on a purpose built walkway. There are two stair climbs on the way, both are quite taxing and definitely not built for wheel chairs or prams. I would suggest stopping off at the Coogee Bay hotel for a cold beer at the end of the walk on a hot day... you may want to take a bottle of water, a hat and some sunscreen too as there is little shelter as you go!"

I recommend to get the right vibe to start at Bondi and make your way to Coogee. Mostly because the beaches at the Bondi end are more active and surf orientated and the beaches at the Coogee end are focused more on relaxation/snorkelling (in the cases Clovelly and Gordon's Bay snorkelling is amazing!); and personally I find things much better when you do the relaxing things at the end rather than at the beginning. If you're a beachgoer and have a day to spare I strongly recommend making a day of this and stopping for a while at each of the beaches on the way down. Great idea to have breakfast in Bondi, stop somewhere along the path for lunch and have dinner as the sun goes down over the ocean at Coogee Bay."

Also happens to be the Sculptures by the Sea exhibition at this time of year when there are an amazing selection of sculptures placed at interesting points all along the walk. The Sculptures by the Sea exhibition is held every year at the end of October to early November. It is extremely popular and thus attracts quite large crowds. Most of the crowd are visiting the sculptures and ice you reach Tamarama walking south most of the crowd starts to disperse and the remainder of the walk is much less crowded. Some amazing vistas looking both north and south taking in both coastline as well as beach views and some amazing coastal homes. The walk is easily accessible by public transport by train to Bondi Junction and then a bus to Bondi Beach. Equally there are ample buses servicing Coogee at the other end of the walk from a number of parts of the CBD. On a fine day it is an amazing day out that is a relatively easy walk."

This will put you on the ocean side, so any stops for picture are easy and you do not have to cross a line of people.We were there during sculpture week, so it was a nice addition to the scenery, with 50+ large pieces of art along the way. If you have the energy, it is a great walk. If you don't think you can make the full 6km, walk what you can and take a bus back home, they seem to be along most of the route."

On such a walk the sheer beauty of your surrounds wakens your creativity, quietens your very inner soul, brings you peace, personal satisfaction. Your senses wake up so suggest no headphones or mobile distractions. Just listen to the birds, the sea, the wind, just look for whales, tortoises, fish, the movement of the waves, the clouds in the sky, enjoy the rthythm of your body whether walking, cycling or jogging, with or without company. Do pack water, wear sunscreen, bring a camera, wear sunglasses & hat, enjoy a coffee/wine/water after the event. Most special time to do this walk is when Sculptures By the Sea are exhibited for extra stimulation, interest. After such a day, you are sure to sleep well with a smile on your face."

This walk was on the top of the list of walks to do in Sydney and I can see why. The surroundings are magnificent. The walk is about 4km and took us 90minutes to complete. I dread walking even a km but this was well worth it. Along the way you'll encounter plenty of people walking, walking their dog, running etc each coast was packed with people swimming, tanning or playing volley/frisbee. Although the sun was hella hot, it didn't stop us the beautiful scenery/views are the things you wanna capture so make sure you stop along the way and take a panorama shot. If you're on a mission to lose weight/stay fit, doing this walk will help you'll definitely be too busy enjoying the surroundings to notice you're 'exercising' lol"

Have done this walk several times and always has been enjoyable.We normally park in Denning Street, South Coogee and walk down the 217 steps ( I think ) opposite Garie Place to join the walkway. The walk is pretty testing at times but the views compensate for this, there are some nice places along the way to grab a coffee and take a break, carrying some water is recommended and the walk can be pretty busy at times. After a nice stop and wander through Bondi we do the reverse and walk back to Coogee giving a different perspective on the views. By the time you have ascended the 217 steps you are able to sit on the bench at the top, gather your breath, have a drink and feel pleased of you effort before heading home."

You can either do the whole or partial walk, and can commence at either Bondi Beach or Coogee Beach, both are easily accessed via bus services to / from the city. If decide to break journey, best to do so at Bronte / Clovelly where bus access to the city is also available. If drive, there is time limit parking at Clovelly and Coogee Beach. Most scenic coastal walk that will connect you to the sea whilst still on land. Rustic cliff rocks, sand, surf, swim, snorkel and kite flying - young and old, couples and families - scenic and relaxing - you can easily be lost in the atmosphere which truly reflects Australians' favorite past time. Walk is generally easy path with some hills and steps. You can however stop and rest at kiosk or seaside / parkland benches to recharge. Best spot to snorkel - Clovelly. Private swimming bath at a small fee available at Coogee Beach and Surf school at Bondi Beach. If visiting in late October, Sculpture by the Sea annual event is a must inclusion at Bondi Beach. Make the effort for this walk to get fit and enjoy the fun day out by the sea."

There are plenty of water stations en route in case it gets too hot as well as nice cafes for a pit stop. You'll also get to see some of the smaller lesser known beaches away from Bondi - Tamarama, Bronte, and Clovelly are all very nice and a bit more secluded.Finish the walk in Coogee with a well deserved drink or bite to eat at the Coogee Pavilion, nicely set on the edge of the beach. It's a big airy venue, has a good drinks selection and the food is pretty decent too."

Along the way you can stop at Bondi, Tamarama, and Bronte for a coffee or more at one of the many cafes or beach kiosks, or have a picnic with a view.

Bondi Beach is incredibly wide from shore to water. We were there on a week day in October and attendance was sparse. We watched some skilled surfers tackling sizeable waves. The rock formations formed by eons of erosion are remarkable. Be sure to have your camera batteries fully charged and plenty of room on the storage card. Unlike the beach walk in Newport, RI, there are no difficult stretches. Every path is smooth and wide. Crashing waves might prompt you to shoot some video. There's even a large plot of land devoted to lawn bowling. You'll pass multiple beaches. This was one of the highlights of our trip to Sydney."

Plan a couple hours to really enjoy, perhaps even stop for a coffee or a swim at one of the patrolled beaches. Easily accessed via public transport."

A remarkably diverse walk; you can watch the surfers at Bondi, see the rock carvings, explore the beaches, clamber along cliffs, see people fishing out on the rocks, watch wedding photoshoots. If you can time your walk to finish at either Bondi or Coogee at sunset, so much the better!"

It can be crowded sometimes especially when there's a mix of people running, families and tourists but nonetheless, it's a great way to get out and enjoy the views and finds along Bondi to Coogee. I would definitely do this walk again with friends!"

We are not big beach people but loved the water views and the amazing way the rocks have formed along the path. I wish we had been able to view the sculptures but there was one from 2012 still standing so I am sure the whole exhibit would be beautiful. The walk took about 2 hours but there are plenty of spots to stop and relax if needed. Please keep in mind there are quite a few stairs and some steeper spots so be prepared for those."

            "review": "Take with you some of the most interesting views Sydney has to offer. If you are an early bird and like walking, the Bondi to Coogee (or backwards) is an amazing way to start your day with a beautiful sunrise.You will have to the east the endless view of the sea, to the north Bondi houses and south Tamarama , Bronti, Cloverlly and finally Coogee. Each beach has its own charm, you will watch the early surfers getting into the water before jumping into a suit to work, many will be exercising in Tamarama, Further on the swimmers in Cloverlly and once you get to Coogee, you get the best views of the endless ocean (the occasional whale or two jumping off the water and the rock pool to the side) that are just breath taking... Many (including myself) go there to take a sit and watch the sun go up for a few minutes.If you are a visitor of Sydney, this walk is delightful. Is not too hard and anybody (regardless of your physical condition) should be able to do it. There are lots of ramps for people riding motorised chairs, so no worries. If you get tired at some point, no worries, you are pretty close to bus stops which are running regularly without delays. Also there're lots of stores/restaurants open from 5/6am to 6/7pm with some (in Coogee or Bondi) opening extended hours.If you planned it correctly, you might be able to come during the Sculpture by the Sea expo (google it as \"Sculpture by the Sea Sydney\"), making the work even more enjoyable (although a tad crowed) and worthwhile. It takes place around late October early November.By mindful, the Aussie sun is merciless and the walk at a relaxed pace will take about 2 maybe 2 1/2 hours... doing it after 10am to 3 or 4pm might be a little extreme on the skin without proper protection; take your sunnies (shades), sunscreen, hat and a bottle of water with you to be safe (regardless of the season). Be extra careful in summer. During winter (Jun to Sept) take a coat with you as it gets very windy around the coast and nobody wants our good people sick ;)As you probably imagined, a two hours walk kind of commands you to wear good footwear. Some of us (locals) might do it barefoot... but we are crazy and like the feeling of the pebbles and sand under our feet but this is not recommended... ever. Hell! we walk barefoot even on winter. Comfy shoes will be the best, no need of boots or similar as that will be an overkill, the entire path is very well maintained.Again, if you are a new around the area (or a visitor), take the train to Bondi Junction then the bus to Bondi (it takes about 10 minutes), don't pack lunch as there are plenty of restaurants from Bondi to Coogee (Coogee being the best place to eat as it has way more variety and quality), a small snack should suffice to get you good to continue all the way to Coogee. There are buses in Coogee that will take you back to Bondi or to the train station (that are many lines connecting everything) so moving around is not going to be a problem.Finally (and again)... bring your bottle of water, sunscreen and enjoy."

What an exhilarating walk, with an ever changing sky of bright sunshine and dark stormy clouds, even the rain did not diminish the dramatic scenery. We parked on the seafront at Bondi (very expensive) and allowed 4h to walk to Coogee, have lunch along the way, and return. You could join the path at other places like Clovelly and Bronte and probably find parking free on the nearby roads. It is up and down - some long stretches of steps - but nothing too challenging - and lots of seats to rest and take in the stunning views. Loved Bronte Baths especially, how fortunate residents are to have this exciting oceanside pool, with waves breaking over the edges at high tide, and free entry. Bronte Beach is charming, and has some nice cafes. Coogee Pavilion is a good lunch stop - it is big, but the formal part of the restaurant gets very busy and booking can be advisable but you can get excellent casual lunch dishes from the general menu and sit almost anywhere. One of the \"must do\" activities when visiting Sydney."

I always recommend this to any of my friends who comes to Sydney as I believe it is one of most spectacular coastal walks in the world. My personal favorite thing is to use this as one of my training paths for my long distance running hobby. The scenery makes the long runs click by much quicker because I am always distracted by wonderful vistas of the ocean and coast. There are plenty of water fountains along the path and also cafes at the various beaches if you need to refuel. Be sure to bring a hat and your sunscreen to ensure you stay sun safe as it is not a shaded walk. There are some stairs and hills and various points so proper walking/running/hiking footwear is recommended."

The walk took us about two hours at a very easy pace, most of it at an easy grade, but there were a few sections with stairs that we took our time to negotiate, whilst admiring the coastline views. Getting too and from is simple using public transport, with plenty of buses from the City to Bondi and the same on return to the City from Coogee. There is a good selection of cafes, coffee shops and public restrooms at each of the beaches along the way, so easy to pull in for a coffee or snack if you have worked up an appetite."

Use a baby carrier if possible and if you have the capacity to carry the child for 3-4 hours (with breaks). If you absolutely need to take a pram, consider (i) giving the walk a miss, or (ii) doing a shorther walk (eg. Bronte to Bondi)"

The walk is full of different features to look at and is just long enough and taxing enough to be enjoyed as part of your day, and suitable for nearly everyone, unless you struggle with steps."

There's beaches, rockpools, parks, and coastal views, strung along 6 km of coastal paths. Buses from Tamarama, Bronte and Clovelly, mean you can start or complete the coastal walk from various points. Hence, if you don't fancy going the path's full length, you can plan a shorter walk. For the full walk start at Bondi Icebergs. You have to make your way up steep steps but you're rewarded by Aboriginal rock carvings in Marks Park. This is one of the highest points on the walk and so you can have a secret rest by whale watching (May and November). It's a good start to the walk. By the time you get there, you have a chance to take stock in one of Bronte's cafes. At Gordon's Bay there is a very steep staircase that rewards the climb with its views. You finish the scenic walk at Coogee\u00a0where you could swim in the bay and take a beverage! With easy transport links by bus."

As time did not permit, we had to just look at the lovely beaches along the way. you have the option to continue past coogee if you wish for a longer walk.

There are some stairs & inclines but overall it's a moderate walk (of about 8kms, one way) but you can do whatever sections you want to. Parking is (slightly) easier at Coogee rather than Bondi so walk that way. There are always buses back to the car if you don't want to walk both ways!

However, if you are looking for a place to relax on the beach, you might try any of the others you pass along the way. Once at Coogee, there are plenty of buses to get you where you are going. If you are a tourist, like me, get an Opal card BEFORE going on the walk, as bus passes can be difficult to find down there."

If you're visiting Sydney or haven't been to Bondi for a few years, I cannot recommend the Bondi-to-Coogee Beach Walk highly enough.The council have done an amazing job renovating/adding the boardwalk and as I write this review, I suddenly realise its been over 24 months since I did this walk. Need to fix that shortly...If visiting and don't have a car, recommend catching train to Bondi Junction and then one of the many buses that go to Bondi Beach. You can start your walk here and take a leisurely stroll to Coogee. Depending when you go (mid morning is best), you can stop for brunch/lunch in Coogee and there are many choices; X74 and Coogee Pavilion are a couple I know of...For the brave, you can walk back and enjoy a swim at Bondi or catch a bus. Buses go straight to Bondi Junction if time is short. NOTE: If you are short of time, this is an activity you shouldn't rush. The walk itself (some 6kms) take approximately two hours excluding travel time and lunch so I would put 4 hours aside if you want to take it all in.The Good:- Fresh Air- Amazing Views- Enough space to walk- Good exercise- Open space- Whales if you are lucky enough- Lunch at the other endThe Bad:- Watch out for the super fit runners who get a little annoyed when you don't make way- Dogs with long leashes- Runners (yes, said that but will mention again)- Windy days. (while still enjoyable if sunny, windy days not fun)- Not wheelchair friendly- Not pram friendly (recommend not taking one)- No water stations (however, that may have changed given I haven't been for a while)The Ugly:- Nothing I can think ofEnjoy. I've walked this track 20+ times and still not sure why I have't been for a while. Maybe having kids is something to do with it..."

It can be very busy on the weekends and when the Sculpture By the Sea annual exhibition is on. Starting from either end, this walk is just over an hour long (depending on how far and fast you walk). Stopping at one end for lunch and then returning the same way is a good way to get a decent dose of exercise.Although it is not a hard walk, there are some very steep parts with lots of stairs, so if you are very unfit you may want to have a look at it before attempting it.Also, if you need to park your car at one end, it is best to park at Coogee as it is very difficult to find any parking at Bondi for a reasonable length of time, and without great cost."

Starting at the Northern end of Bondi Beach, you can walk the whole beach, up the steps past the Iconic Bondi Icebergs establishment with its ocean swimming pool, and continue along up the hill (this walk is not for the faint hearted) towards Tamarama Beach. If you're lucky and visiting in January you will be treated to the wonderful installations and sculptures of the 'Sculptures By the Sea' yearly exhibition. As you keep the ocean to your left you simply follow the well-maintained pathway all the way around to Bronte Beach, passing colourful rock caves, gorgeous beaches, ridiculously picturesque views. This all combines to help you forget that you're actually exercising and walking around 8 kilometres there and back (if you go the whole way). For the more fit ones amongst us, there are many little side options of very steep steps leading up to the suburbs above which can be run up and down. I prefer the more leisurely walk keeping the ocean close, but whatever you do, try to make this walk (or part thereof) a part of your stay in the Eastern Suburbs of Sydney."

Train to Bondi Junction and bus to the beach is your cheapest option especially if you go on a Sunday and use the Opal card which will only cost you $2.50 to travel all day. You can incorporate Sculptures by the sea in this walk which is on the part of the leg from Bondi to Tamarama every year for 2 weeks in late October early November, however if you choose time be prepared for huge crowds especially on the weekends."

It will take about an hour and a half at a reasonable pace along five beaches (Bondi, Tamarama, Bronti, Gordon's Bay and Coogee). There are plenty of places to stop to eat, have a coffee or a dip in the sea so you may want to allow more time. There are also restroom facilities at the surf clubs located on each beach. Dogs need to be on a lead (and take a bag with you - be a good citizen and pick up your dogs poo!)."

Take an express bus from Circular Quay to Congee Beach, grab some snacks and water and head on to the trail back toward Bondi. Take your time to enjoy the scenery and take pictures, there are many spots along the way to rest and restock on snacks or water. Bring a towel and bathing suite so you can make a pit stop at one of the beaches for some swimming to cool off or at one of the nature ocean baths. Have a late lunch or dinner at Bondi, and catch the buss back to the train station for a ride back to circular quay. A day well spent."

The all so famous Bondi is perhaps the least interesting. This walk is easy, forget how many kms it is, it is really easy, a delight with plenty of places to stop off at. Even in the winter months you need to plan on having a swim somewhere or at least stripping off down to a swimming costume and having a picnic on a beach as you simply enjoy the view, the people and the colours of the ocean. The coastal walks cover all of Sydney's beaches and all through the harbour area and are the best way to get a real feel for the beauty of my home town."

The view cant be admired as walkers have to keep their eyes on the path for fear of stepping in dog poo. The Randwick section is great for dog walkers as it is an unofficial leash free path. Rangers wont patrol the area for fear of confrontation with dog owners. Black plastic dog poo bags are supplied by ratepayers, but those dog owners who occasionally 'pickup' tend to drop the bags in the bushes rather than carry them to a rubbish bin or take them home. Stay away from this walk and leave it to the dogs!"

It is one of my favorite coastal in Sydney (Oct-Nov) and every year the event attracts over 500,000 local and international visitors to view the eclectic mix of sculptures and still life artwork under the sun. Sculpture by the Sea is well worth the visit. It is a joyous and uplifting event where you can appreciate some unique fine artworks, enjoy the natural scenery of Sydney's pristine beaches and get fit at the same time. I could not think of any other free event that gives away that much benefits. A must for Sydneysiders and tourists."

Starting from Coogee, near the cliff-top memorial to the local residents (several from the Coogee Dolphins rugby league team who were on an end of season trip) who died in the Bali bombing on 12/10/02 and walking past Gordon's Bay, Bronte Beach, Clovelley Beach and finally Tamarama, one then arrives in Bondi (about 45 minutes to an hour if memory serves) where the first sight to greet you is the huge sweeping arc of the iconic beach. Well worth doing one way and then having lunch and a drink at the end point, and walking back in the opposite direction. A great way to spend a Sunday! PS - please note the date below is inaccurate, and so I chose the furthest from today, but in fact I did the walk much longer ago than was available in the drop down date list.

If you are seeking stunning views and fresh air, this is the walk for you. There are plenty of places to rest, to take in the beautiful surroundings. There's no need to rush if you don't need to. Fellow walkers are friendly and considerate. At either end of your walk, there are many cafes with wonderful beverages and food. This walk is one you will never forget!!"

When you are in Sydney, you cannot miss out on the Bondi to Coogee Beach Walk! The views of the ocean, nature, the beaches and surfers are well worth it. I would not recommend this walk to people who have problems walking stairs, since there are a lot of those on the route!"

It is something of a demanding walk with lots of elevation change. There are limited places to grab a cab or bus if you can not make the walk, so be sure you are committed for at least 1 hour of continuous walking. Would not recommend doing the full walk with young kids. Just go to Bondi beach and walk along there if you have young kids or health limitations.Highly recommend as this is a good way to see the coast and is free (small bus cost notwithstanding)."

I particularly love how the development made walking along the coast a wonderful experience. You can walk along the beach and let the sand slip between your toes or tread as if time did not exist in a paved pathway nearby. In either case, you can savor the sound of the waves as it crashes into the rocks and beach. The winds never stop tossing your hair and by the time you get tired of walking, all your problems would have been blow away!"

Must wear decent shoes or sandals and take a water bottle - there are fountains to refill along the way. There are lots of steps up and down and it is not wheelchair accessible, in fact if you are unfit the walk may be too much on a hot day. We ate at Bronte beach - lots of little restaurants along the road. There are plenty of sites for picnics if you take your own food. Lots of lovely beaches and coves, each seems perfect for a different purpose - surfing, swimming or some that are best for small children. The scenery is lovely, we saw a seal and plenty of birds. It's about 6km but takes a while with the ups and downs, and stops for photos. Well worth doing."

I don't know what kind of parking fees there are, but the public transportation is great! I did the walk from Coogee to Bondi because I wanted to spend some time in Bondi at the end instead of the beginning. Ending in Bondi was pretty cool beacuse you come a corner, and you can see the whole beach in the distance. I stopped at Iceberg's for a coffee, and looked out over the pool and beach while drinking it before making my way down to the beach. There are only a few somewhat steeper parts (due to stairs), but most of the walk was pretty easy. There are water filling stations, bathrooms, benches, and places to buy food and drinks along the walk. The views are gorgeous, and I will definitely do it again the next time I am in Sydney."

They loved watching the surfers along the various coves and amazingly didn't complain. Without kids this would be an amazing run. We made the day trip from Manly just to do this hike (although more of a semi-paved walking trail) and it was well worth it!"

The walk can be a little difficult at times, but nothing too hard. The walk does go a little beyond Coogee, but ends randomly. If you do go all the way to the very end, just note you will end up in a neighborhood. It is still possible to hope onto a bus from this main road back to Sydney CBD. Be warned, check the bus route."

Warning - I had to ask a local re part of the track, as not all (but most) of the coast is park. You need to walk up a street, along a main road, and down again to rejoin the coastal track! Also - scrambling over rocks is OK if you have the right footwear, and are comfortable in doing so. Not for everyone, though - and watch the tide!! Kind regards, Robyn"

This did not detract from the beauty of the walk but we did not find it quite as enjoyable. We had intended to take advantage of some of the eating places around the track however after the first few with very long queues we abandoned the walk in favour of getting back to a place to grab a bite to eat. It was all new and all very pleasant. One note would be that at this time of year, head to Coogee from Bondi as the sun will be at your back instead of in your face which suited hubby perfectly as he had endured a bit of sunburn already and did not have his hat."

            "review": "Best enjoyed in Spring and Autumn. It's no secret that Summer can be very hot in Sydney. (But at least there isn't the awful, energy sapping humidity of the tropics! ) Of course, any time of the year is lovewly for walking from Bondi to Coogee: the scenery is stunning, the topography challenging, and there are many places to stop, rest and refuel.Like other walkers, I usually do this walk in reverse- from Coogee to Bondi, or even from Tamarama to Bondi during \"Sculpture by the Sea\" (which is on this year from 22 October to 8 November).If you , like me, don't enjoy walking in the heat, then the best seasons to go are Spring, Autumn and Winter. Even Spring can be unpleasantly hot if you start after 10 am. This is especially so during the aforementioned \"Sculpture by the Sea\" : \" a 2 km long temporary sculpture park featuring over 100 sculptures by artists from Australia and across the world\" set up from Tamarama to Bondi along the clifftops. As well as the hot sun, there are thousands of people on the path admiring the sculptures. Don't be put off though. If you start at 8am, you can beat the heat and the crowds.My favourite spots on the walk are the cafe at Tamarama beach, recently relocated and renovated, and anywhere with a view from the cliff tops and a cooling sea breeze.A word about getting there. Unless you are prepared to park a long way from your starting point, I suggest using public transport or going mid-week only, and not on weekends. Watch out for parking meters in the shopping streets close to the beach. There are residents parking schemes in most streets which limit visitors to 2 hours.

It gets busy particularly on weekends, public holidays, or sculptures by the sea (end of Oct/early Nov) but still worth the crowds; just ignore others and inhale the salt breeze, you'll feel like you are alone. Suggest (as others) doing it 'backwards' from Coogee to Bondi. Or start 1/2 way from Bronte with a yummy breakfast. Slap on sunscreen and a hat on sunny days, take an umbrella when clouds look threatening. There are some stairs, prams/wheelchairs will need to be lifted in spots and it can be difficult for those with a lower limb impairment. But there are many spots where you can stop, sit and soak it all in."

The salt air, cliffs, blue seas, and clean beaches. Depending on the time of day and time of year you could see surfers riding the waves, scuba divers prepping/recovering from a dive, swimmers, walkers, runners, and people playing on the beach. You might have calm seas or high winds. Cool or heat. So bring your camera (or smartphone) and be prepared.Many times I've run from Coogee to Bondi, and back to Coogee, taking care to run on the Coogee and Bondi beaches, often barefoot. It's about 7km one way, 14km from south Coodee to north Bondi and back. There's water fountains along the way, and a few restrooms. If you're into gothic funerary architecture, walk through the cemetery about halfway in between and notice some of the older tombstones.There's plenty to eat in Coogee and Bondi, after you've finished your run. There's buses that get to Bondi and Coogee.There are a few events there which make running difficult. City2Surf and Sculpture by the Sea come to mind."

It's not really open, as there are fences and signs to try and stop people entering, but the fences are pretty quickly opened up, and the signs ignored. There not a lot that will stop rock fishermen getting to their favourite spots.The major issue is the continuing presence of the rifle range, however nobody was shooting on Sunday so it wasn't a problem. They need to be a long way off target to bother anybody doing the walk anyway, but it would be much better if they could find somewhere else for the shooters to play. The most impressive thing about this area is how remote it seems, even though it's quite close to a huge city. The scrubland seems much as it would have been before European settlement, with the exception of the privet and bitou bush which has infiltrated.There are some interesting remnants of the observation posts, gun emplacements, ammunition stores and barracks which were built to repel the Japanese in WWII. Sadly neglected, but worth a look.The view over the cliffs onto the wild coastline is spectacular. At times you could swear the nearest civilisation was many miles away. Just hard to believe it's so close to Sydney."

But you can start this at different points on the route, so GOOGLE options to pick up the walk.There are lots of beach spots to picnic at, and swim from. Water fountains on the walk.Heaps of stairs, and spetacular ocean views. Clear ocean water on a good day, and on a wild storm day, completely different perspective. I've done both and it is worth the aching limbs.Watch out for the runners, who shoot past and <sigh> at those who stop to marvel and sniff the breeze.Advice fo tourists, start at Bronte Beach and end at Bondi Beach."

The walk took us about 3 hours with short stops along to enjoy the view and take pictures. There is no way to get lost along this walk, as it is well marked and well traveled (although the further north you go the fewer people are on the path). Not only was the scenery amazing, but it was fun to see school groups at the beach, surfers in the water, coastal pools and lifeguard buildings, and read some of the tombstones in the cemetery. Our kids were a little tired by the end (or maybe just bored waiting for me to take pictures), however, you can start and stop the walk at any point along the route if you are limited by time or energy -- it is all fantastic. If you only do a portion, try to include the cemetery. It is so unusually striking set against the coast, and the boardwalk along the cliff at that section is particularly scenic. Bring your water bottle, as there are city-sponsored water bottle stations to refill along the way."

You can do it quicker though.You take in Coogee Beach, Bronte, Clovelly, Tamarama and if you're doing it Coogee to Bondi you can always glimpse Bondi in the distance. It really is how you imagine Australia - miles of golden beaches, big surf! I did this walk on a windy day and there is a particular stretch on the top of the cliff where it was literally gales and it was a little hard to stay on your feet so bear in mind weather conditions because when you're higher up the wind will be stronger. There are lots of points of interest along the walk and lots of water pumps if you're thirsty. There are also toilet facilities along the route.The walk seemed to me to be very safe, lots of people around, and there are railings along most areas at the cliff edges.It is paved throughout so you're not hiking over bare grass and it is not overly strenuous though there are a few hills.If you're in the area it's one of the walks you should definitely undertake and if you've walked one way and can't face the return walk there are buses along the route and they are extremely cheap!Great walk for exercise, to catch a tan or even practise your photography skills!"

The 50 minute bus ride from Circular Quay was not nearly as enjoyable as the ferry rides we took to Manly and Watson's Bay. I'm glad we saw Bondi and did the walk, but I don't see how it's rated above so many other things. Tip - If you are going to see both Bondi and Manly, go to Bondi first. That way you won't be disappointed at all when you do the Bondi walk (because Manly is so much nicer)."

Took the 333 bus from circular quay to bondi beach, and walked to the right hand side of the beach( as you look at the sea) to start the walk. It is About 6km, then when you are a Coogee take the 380 back to circular quay. So the walk is interesting with ups and downs with steps, not really suitable for the elderly especially with walking sticks, and it you have a pushchair you will be lifting it up and down stairs a bit. But anyone else will be fine. Anyway to the walk. It covers about 6 bays and is stunning, sometimes along by rock pools and sometimes the path is up high, but at every corner there is another stunning view. there is the occasional cafe along the route and public toilets. The vegetation is lovely and there are seats along route to take in the vistas. Well worth the effort of getting there, really- don't miss this."

In Summer - blockout is a must, a hat if its not too windy. Explore St Marks park, between Bondi & Tamarama, seating facing north & south are there. Good for a quiet meditate. There are also toilets and fresh drinking water available. For those looking for a good set of stairs to test yourself on, find your way to the back of Tamarama Gully, a beautiful hidden valley, there is a challenging set of steep stairs that lead up to Birrell St."

We then continued the walk around past the Waverley cemetery- a great spot to take in the views out to sea- and then on to Bronte beach where there are a number of gorgeous little cafes where we stopped for lunch. From there we continued to Tamarama beach and on to Bondi. Walking around past Mark's Park is a great first view of Bondi for those who haven't seen it before. At Bondi we hired surfboards and introduced the in-laws to surfing. After this we headed up to the Bucket List for drinks right on the beach front. The Brits all said this was their best day in Sydney- I can't recommend it enough!"

The stretch of water which lies in front of you makes you feel to sit and relax and let everyone else pass by.Initially when you will start the walk from Bondi, there will be more steps but afterwards it is mixed.I will highly recommend this walk if your health allows.If I ever go to Sydney again, I will sure repeat this walk."

This walk is one of the great coastal walks of Sydney and in summertime you can stop at any of the beaches along the way and refresh yourself with a dip in the ocean. Simply catch the bus from the city to Bondi Beach and catch the bus home again from Coogee. All beaches have changing facilities. Both Bronte and Clovelly have cafes where you can sit and eat close to the water and watch it sparkle."

In May - July and October / November you can see whales on their migration.

Sculpture by the sea is usually held last 2 weeks of October and 1st week of November. It is a magnificent event with many innovative and artistic sculptures dotted along the 1st part of the path between Bondi and Turramarra. However, because of its popularity, the walk can be quite congested during the exhibition period. One does not have to finish the walk and can stop at any of the beaches along the way.

I guess they aren't serious enough to run in the morning, or they just want to photo bomb the tourists with oiled up abs.Go when the weather is nice, go early before the crowds, then have breakfast in Bronte."

This is a regular haunt for me - You would have found me along this track at least once per month since the year 2001\u2026 I start from and return to Clovelly, where it's usually easy to find free parking, even if you are not there as early as me. This is my regular exercise venue - I run to Bondi, touch a foot in the sand and then return. If I'm really energetic or training for the City to Surf, I might tag on the length of Bond Beach as well. In summer, if you don't start early, there are too many people for running safely (so I start around 730am). It's OK for walking though. It's different every time with dramatic clouds, watching the surfers out on an exhilarating break, whales and dolphins, white foam smashing against the rocks. Usually I don't even notice the exercise, including stairs and slopes en route. There are plenty of bubblers and toilets along the track as well. My only warning is to be careful on the boardwalk around the cemetery at Clovelly. It looks harmless enough but a jogging friend took a tumble on it and it tore his hands to shreds - long deep gashes, down to the tendons and muscles, requiring a visit to the hospital emergency department and loads of stitches."

The sculptures are on the coastline between Bondi and Tamarama from 22nd October to 8th November 2015 and around this time each year. You can make this trip at any time but the sculptures just make the trip a little more interesting. Probably best to take a bus which can be boarded from Circular Quay to Bondi. The bus drops you close to the pool in Bondi, where you can take the path and begin your walk up the hill and then South. Take the opportunity to use the ammenities or go to the shops at each place as you travel. Don't forget water and sensible shoes. No Heels. Some surfaces are rock and sand not just a boardwalk. Take a bus back from Coogee. Don't forget your camera!"

Take in Tamarama Beach, a secluded small sun-drenched inlet patronized by Sydney's famous & glamorous bikini set. Squeeze a swim in as there are showers available. Then onto Bronte beach for NSW's best brunch cafe's. They are all good so you do not need to be fussy. Continue past Clovelly & the famous swimming club that has fostered many an Australian Olympians including Graham Thorpe. If the legs are tiring stroll amongst the early settlers tombstones and take the time to read some. It's historical bliss and very interesting. You are almost in the final staright? As you round the last bend Coogee stands out like an oasis. A beautiful beach, pristine azure surf washing against crystal white sands with the Cliff backdrop amassed with apartment buildings of every shape and size? Somehow and regardless of the lack of council planning this mess of buildings almost akin to the appearance of a Brazilian favela, is quite beautiful in itself. The home of Mel Gibson for many years Coogee is a minature version of its Big Brother, Bondi. The Bondi to Coogee walk is up and down hills and stairs so exercise, fatigue & sweat is guaranteed. However, all can be remedied in the beer garden at The Coogee Bay Hotel with a large jug of cold local beer or a resort style cocktail in a friendly, jovial, 'chug-a-lug', noisy, but very aussie atmosphere! I suggest taking the bus back to Bondi which is only a 20 minute trip. Take your block-out, shades and a hat. Have fun! It's as Australian as you can get! ..... Pick a fine weather day. .... You will recommend this one."

STARTING by the iconic Bondi Icebergs, just above the Bondi Baths, the walk takes between 1-2 hours at a leisurely pace, offering plenty to see and do along the way. Make your way up a set of steep stairs near the start of the walk and marvel at Aboriginal rock carvings in Marks Park, one of the walk's highest points and a prime whale watching spot during the migration season between May and November. Heading towards Tamarama you'll pass by Mackenzie's Point Beach, one of the smallest beaches in the State which is only ACCESSIBLE at low tide. The beach is not suitable for swimming, but is a popular surfing spot and a great place to relax by the water.Follow the coastal trail towards Bronte Beach and once there take the stairs near the rock pool to the cliff top board walk for postcard views of Tamarama, Bronte and Bondi to the north and Malabar Headland to the south. Recharge at one of Bronte's charming cafes, or find a shady spot for a rest.CONTINUINGon from Bronte, the walk passes by the beautiful historic Waverley Cemetery on top of sandstone cliffs and rock platforms. Follow the cliff path to reach Clovelly Beach, a popular swimming and snorkelling spot nestled in the narrow bay between Bronte and Gordons Bay. The walk to reach Gordon's Bay features a very steep staircase that challenges but REWARDS with its clifftop views.COMPLETEthe scenic track from Clovelly to Coogee and unwind with a picnic at Coogee's shaded parklands or enjoy a BBQ using the public facilities. Cool down with a swim in Wylie's Baths, take a dip in Coogee Beach's protected bay or enjoy a drink at one of the many cafes and bars in the area.and then you turn around and walk back it is just wonderfulit is good for all ages just do it at your own pace you will not regret it"

I like it easy in the morning around the sunrise most. Even if it is busy at this time especially in the summer the time stops for a brief moment until the sun has raise out of the ocean. If you wanna avoid the early morning fitness traffic you should start past 8 am when everyone is already heading to work...By the way...Coogee is not the end of the walk, you can continue to Maroubra, one of the more local beaches and it gets more quite between Coogee and Maroubra....The whole walk will take about 3-4hours...depending from speed and the frequency of the coffee breaks in between !"

This is a beautiful area, and the walk can be done in total, or piecemeal, just a small section, then off the track to enjoy a local watering hole...This place has special memories for me, as it was on the boardwalk that my husband proposed to me one night. In the daytime there's lots to see, but at night it's ever so special, as the sound of the waves crashing seems amplified and there are lots of quiet spots to enjoy the moonlight on the water. A must try when visiting Sydney's eastern suburbs, and a regular exercising route for locals and visitors alike. Often there are sculpture exhibitions to enjoy and much beauty for photographers to snap, and can be enjoyed at your own personal pace."

During whale watching season you can occasionally catch a glimpse of whales breaching in the distance, but that's not necessary to make this a great couple of hours.The most difficult part might be transport - park the car at Bondi and catch the bus back from Coogee.

It's so spectacular, the beauty of nature is almost overwhelming,, the colours of the sea and sky, the curved beach, the white and blue waves and then the wide walk way stretching out ahead of us towards South Coogee and beyond. There are lots of other people walking and cycling too, but somehow it doesn't seem crowded, there seems to be space for everyone and people are so polite. Step by step we keep walking, both speechless in the uplifting surrounds. We walk on, to the peat area - an amazing piece of land history by the walkway - and then turn around and return.

The walk itself is fantastic in either direction and there is bus transport at both ends, but the lure of the Icebergs bistro and bar makes the journey worthwhile for me.The walk is an easy one with small hills and steps along the way. Great views of beaches, homes and the ocean and an iconic cemetery makes this one of Sydney's great short walks."

            "review": "This one of the most beautiful coastal walks worldwide. This is a spectacular walk along the clifftops starting at the classic Bondi beach. It wends its way to Tamarama beach first, then to Bronte and finally to Coogee. You can just do one section and then return or walk through from one end to the other. I live in Sydney and it's still something I love to do on a regular basis. Every November,there's a fantastic event called Sculpture by the Sea for 2 weeks. Artists do installations on both sides of the path and in the parks above and on the beach at Tamarama. It just goes for that first leg and it truly worth planning a visit at this time."

When you reach Coogee, walk along the promenade past the Life Savers' Club and continue along the path. It takes you over the rocks and seems to end at a cul de sac high above the ocean. Don't go down the stairs, instead go straight ahead on a path between two houses. On the other side, turn right and walk up the street, turn left and left again to go back down to the sea. This road bends to the right and straight ahead are wooden stairs to the rocks below. Scramble over the rocks (pensions do it) and rejoin a path on the other side. Follow that all the way to Maroubra Beach (and beyond if you're energetic). There are cafes at Maroubra Beach. If you're tired, you can take a cab back to Coogee and a bus to Bondi Junction."

So you can imagine my amazement when we visited Bondi Beach on Christmas Day and found the beach literally strewn with hundreds of sun worshipers wearing Santa hats. And, in the centre of the beach there was a giant blow-up trio of a snowman, Christmas tree and Santa; I thought I was seeing things at first.After a leisurely stroll along the soft sandy beach we had lunch at a neat little Thai restaurant that served wonderful pad thai. To walk off the calories we took the coastal walk from Bondi towards Bronte. The coastal path starts beside the iconic Bondi Icebergs, just above the Bondi Baths, the walk takes between 1 hour at a leisurely pace, offering plenty to see and do along the way. There were rock pools galore and gigantic rock formations, some with caves, others jutting into the ocean like giant buttresses. The waves were spectacular, crashing against the rocky shoreline offering great surfing for the fearless. Heading towards Tamarama we passed by Mackenzie's Point Beach, one of the smallest beaches in the State another popular surfing spot and a great place to relax by the water. I know the path continues to Coogee, but we headed back to Sydney after Bronte."

It's easy to reach by bus from Central or Wynyard( the two main train/bus terminals in the CBD) and everyone knows Bondi Beach!! You start the walk from the Southern end of Bondi Beach, walking down a small road past a modern apartment block ( which is the home to a few A listers!) and the famous Bondi Icebergers ( a club for swimmers who swim everyday of the year at Bondi) then you'll find the path heading south along the headland. The views are spectacular ...I particularly like the section from Bronte Beach south to Coogee as you walk on the boardwalk past the Waverley cemetery... There's a seal colony , and if it's whale migration season, you'll see them as they head north!You pass a number of beaches on your way south, and it's ok to take your time to watch the surfers catching waves...especially at Tamarama Beach, a small indent in the coastal map. There are plenty of really good coffee stops/ caf\u00e9s along the way...so take your time! It's a good two hour walk at a moderate pace.....and you can choose to walk further south along the coastline, but it's not the dedicated boardwalk, it's more finding your way through streets... But it's doable!"

It's a very scenic walk and provides many opportunities to stop and enjoy the view, take pictures, swim, and have a picnic. It was a little crowded at certain spots but nothing that was too much to bear. There were 5 of us on the walk together, and we all really enjoyed it, including a teenager. Highly recommend this walk. It was cold and sprinkled on us a little, but we were prepared for that. We actually cut the walk short because of time, so will have to return one day to do the whole walk."

The walk is approximately 6 km long and very scenic, and there are many spots where the views are stunning. The first stop - Tamarama beach - is a small nice beach and less crowded, next stop Bronte has a ocean pool open for all, next stop Clovelly is a good spot for relaxed swimming and snorkeling - it was full of families and kids as it is a calm and quiet beach. Just before reaching Coogee there is a small bay - Gordon bay - which appeared to be a good snorkeling site as well."

But seriously, it is sooo long. If you are a local, it'd be a great place to spend some time to get out and get some exercise. There are a lot of people out running and walking their dogs. However, from a tourist perspective... it is too long to spend time doing the whole walk when you have limited time and so much to do in Sydney. I would suggest just doing a segment of the walk, like Bondi to Bronte or Coogee to Clovelly. And then just split it up instead of doing it all at one time. Another good portion to walk is Maroubra to Coogee. Anyways, it's beautiful! And do it if you are a local or have a lot of time... but just do a portion of it if you have limited time."

The stretch between Bondi beach and Coogee Beach is a three-mile trail that\u2019s pounded by locals and tourists alike, enjoying Sydney\u2019s wild coastal beauty, as the waves break below the path. It\u2019s also a mild pre-breakfast workout with some swooping up and down gradients and the perfect way to build up an appetite. Stride halfway and then head back for a great start to the day. The Bondi to Tamarama stretch of the walk also becomes a one-and-a-half-mile outdoor art gallery from 22 October to 8 November, with the Sculpture by the Sea event featuring 100+ art works dotted along the length.PS I wrote a whole article about this and other suggestions for 24 hours in Sydney on the Australian Times which you can visit here: http://www.australiantimes.co.uk/norman-peires-perfect-24-hours-in-sydney/ Thanks for reading!"

Some of the slippery, awkward pathways have been upgraded so the full walk is now much more comfortable, particularly around the cemetery. This makes it easier to keep up the walking and talking and still let you admire the fantastic scenery. Some sections have stairs so it is not pram friendly. There are a few points where a little signage would be helpful so you know you are going on the through pathway and not up a dead end. If it's a busy day just follow the crowd. There are plenty of points along the way where you can top up your water bottle. Plenty of restrooms too. If you want to park a car while walking it is best to get an unrestricted time spot. You won't find one of these near the beach but about halfway along Bondi Road some of the side streets offer good possibilities and won't add too much to the distance you'll cover. When you are walking try to remember to keep to the left of the path to let the faster walkers and runners get past you."

There were not many people on the track then. The second time around I was joined by a friend and we walked it on a weekend, when it was sunny and busy. The last time was in November 2014 during the Sculptures by the Sea. This was definitely the most crowded occasion. The walk in itself is very pleasant with lovely views of the ocean, the beaches, the rockpools, the eastern suburbs coastline, the many ocean front dwellings and the cemetery. The walk winds its way between Coogee and Bondi and finds Tamarama, Clovelly and Bronte on its route. The length of the walk is approximately 6 -7 km long and gently slopes up and down and around the different coves. There are plenty of cafes, toilet facilities and playgroujnds along the route. It can be started anywhere along the route. Parking is available but sometimes hard to come by or at a fee. This walk can be done by people of any age, family groups and there is wheel chair access as well.It is a good way to get some exercise in, while enjoying the scenery.mmshiri"

Then skirt around more rocky headlands.Clovelly Beach. Walk along a couple more rocky headlands with good views then you are at Coogee Beach, the end of the walk and time for a coffee or a meal. No shortages of places to dine here. Walk up the steps to Coogee Bay Road and to the left is the beer garden - great for a drink or a good meal. The walk has many ups and downs including steps but a great walk and amazing homes built on the edge of the sandstone with commanding views across the ocean. This is one of many Coastal Walks around the Sydney coastline. This walk can also be contiunued along to Maroubra making it a 10km walk from Bondi"

It's such a great chance to get out of the city and stretch your legs. I personally think the walk is better done in reverse from Coogee to Bondi for 2 reasons:1. There are more buses from Bondi back to the city so no need to wait too long when you're tired.2. The views going this way are I feel a little better.The walk itself is beautifully maintained and well sign posted. Do not be put off by other comments about the number of steps etc. it's a gentle incline nothing more and well within the reach of most people. Only the infirm should be wary.Do take a camera and some water."

We started in Bondi and made our way to Bronte where we made a pit stop for a swim on Bronte beach and the pool there. We then continued onto Coogee where then made our way back around to Bondi and ended our walk with lunch at Icebergs. The whole walk is quite easy, paved all the way with slight hills and staircases so even if you are not fit, you will be able to walk along the paved paths. We did try our hand at being a bit adventurous, opting to make detours onto the rock pools from Mackenzie's Bay and treking it along the beach through the rock and towards Tamarama before joining the footpath again to Bronte. There are many other walkers on the path but as it is quite a long walk, everyone is spaced out so the path didn't get too crowded. As it passes various beaches, there are many toilet facilities along the way.I highly recommend this walk. I listed it for more than 3 hours because it's best enjoyed at your own pace, though if you were ambitious the walk probably would only take somewhere between an hour to 2 hours."

Sometimes the boardwalk was right next to the roads and houses. It felt a bit unnatural. Nevertheless, the views are terrific. Our favourite part was the cemetery on the cliffs."

I was expecting there to be little stores and restaurants accessible from the path along the way, but unless you ventured off and detoured into one of the towns there wasn't anything until you reached Coogee so bring snacks. We had lunch at the Coogee Pavilion which was incredible. There's a great variety of seafood, salads, and wood fired pizzas to choose from. We had pink snapper sashimi that was to die for. I was tempted to order 2 more servings! The kingfish poke was delicious as well - very lemony. The gnomo pizza was tasty too. The desserts left us wanting more. I had the rhubarb sundae which was light on rhubarb and lacked flavor and I wish they'd included more of the delicious merengue. My husband had the marshmallow chocolate chip cookie ice cream sandwich but the cookies were hard and the marshmallow was non-existent. Overall, tho, I would return and recommend this place to others. There's also a great area in the back where you can play ping pong and other fun games for free."

Advice for others doing this: - wear sensible shoes. Some of the steps are narrow and steep and there's about 6kms of walking to be done.- wear layered clothing and unless it's incredibly overcast take along a cap and wear sunscreen too.- bring along a bottle, there are plenty of places to refill along the way."

The water is very cold, so swimming might be very difficult for most people, however there is a sea water pool on the side that I have not gone to but it looked very nice.The restaurants and bars over looking the beach are very nice and have balconies over looking the water."

I knew the walk would be a challenge especially since it was hot and sunny. The views were beautiful and well worth the effort. Right before you get to Coogee is the most difficult part with a huge flight of stairs and steep pathways. Some of the walk is very flat and easy to do. There were many joggers running past which was great for the breeze! So, if you are older and out of shape I still would recommend this walk. Take water, a hat, apply sunscreen and just take your time. If possible, chose a cooler day. There are little towns along the way for food, restrooms and where you can stop your walk if you can't make it to Coogee. It was beautiful and highly recommended."

Tamarama is a seriously sheltered beach and has some great rock pools and places for kids to play. On the return walk to Bondi, you have the wonderful vista of the legendary Bondi beach.If you are going to be in Sydney during the last week of October through to the first week of November there is the added attraction of Sculptures by the Sea and it is FREE.There are a lot more people on the walk when this festival is on, but you have the added benefit of some fun and sometimes quite wonderful sculptures."

Tamarama is a stunning small cove, then leading on to Bronte, a family beach, with cafes strewn along he street leading from it. Onwards to Clovelly, passing a beautiful cemetery, hen up some steep steps to Gordon's Bay, which is a tiny fishing bay. Finally Coogee.... Take a rewarding drink atthe new Coogee Pavilion, very cool place that carts for the smaller kids as well as the bigger ones."

From the famous (for unknown reasons) Bondi through to the pretty Bronte and on to Coogee Beach. Take your time, stop at a cafe or swim at each beach. Crowded in summer and busy on the weekends, a warm mid-winter day is perfect for this week.A must for every visitor to Sydney."

If there is a more beautiful location to play lawn bowling than Clovelly Bay Bowling Club,I have yet to have the pleasure of coming upon it.The welcome provided by them suggests that the Australian bowling community are imbued with the same spirit of cordiality and fellowship as in my native Scotland.Perhaps the greatest aspect of the walk is the love of the local community for their beautiful surroundings which they embrace with gusto and in full measure.Try to ensure you do not miss your opportunity to share if only for a short while,in their bounteous good fortune."

June '14 the last time I've done this walk in whole, though ive walked it in parts heaps and in whole-meaning from bondi to coogee a few times.a great walk can be done by anyone who can walk. Even the stone steps which there are a few aren't aa problem you just walk at your pace . The path is as easy as to walk and the view is magnificent like the end of the earth and factually you are on the edge of the earth. Seeing no end to the ocean yonder. A great day out and makes you feel alive. If the walk isn't enough well along the way there are exercise implements if you want to stretch or pull your own weight. You can stop off at the beaches in between from Bondi to Coogee for a rest, coffee or a swim & icecream if its hot. And there's a cafe restaurant at Clovelly-you can feel you're somewhere else rather than just in Sydney. Those beaches are Tamarama, Bronte, Clovelly then Coogee. Where you can get the bus back to Bondi Junction. If you walked the walk without stopping it's about a 40 min walk..it just depends how often you stop-to take photos perhaps or what pace you do. A visitor should do this and see our beautiful land and if you live here its a must. And be proud of our beautiful city."

The views are just as beautiful as everyone says. The one drawback, if you can call it that, is that I thought it would be much easier to stop for food and drinks, but with a few exceptions, that really involves leaving the walk and going into nearby towns. Not that that would be at all hard to do - i just mean you aren't passing cafes as I imagined might be the case. There ARE are plenty of places along the way to get free filtered water.

As we do not live in Sydney we generally book into the Coogee Crowne Plaza for a couple of nights as our focus centres around The Sculptures By The Sea exhibition, which I feel enhances the overall impact of this walk. Admittedly, there are far more people on the walk during this time of year, but obviously the crowds are between Bondi and Tamarama.Irrespective, the walk itself affords spectacular views, it is not difficult, with well constructed walkways, very safe to negotiate. Whilst there a few reasonably steep gradients, the key is to take your time and soak up the magnificent scenery.Numerous places to refresh yourself at either end of the walk. Additionally, as we have done we stop at the Seasalt Caf\u00e9 overlooking Clovelly Beach. Alternatively, Bronte offers plenty of options for food and other refreshments.For anyone visiting Sydney, this is a very worthwhile experience to enjoy. Public transport from the city is easy. The Coastal Walk is well worth the effort."

The route is easy, with some stairs, but nothing serious. I walked it easily less than 2 hours with many stop in between. This was my route (take around 4hours in total - exclude lunch and bus waiting time): 1. Go to museum station (one of the station in SYD CBD area), get out at liverpool street and wait for the 373 bus to Cooge beach - you can't miss the beach, it's huge, take appr. 30 minutes (cost around AUD 3.6 - please check if you need to buy prepaid card first on weekday)2. Walk down along the coastal walk - you will start from \"east coastal walk\" in Cooge, all the way to Bondi (stick to the path, you wouldn't get loss), take some stops, especially at the cemetery, the view to the beach is amazing. The weather was a bit chilled, and the water is freezing, but there was a lot of sunshine with no clouds at all. It's Sydney at it best. Arrive at Bondi, you can try the legendary \"Hurricane\" restaurant, the most delicious rib in Sydney (even Australia, or possibly the best in the world :))3. Take bus 380 to Watson Bay - make sure they go to Watson Bay, as not all 380 bus go there - walk a bit, have a fish and chip, visiting library and church. It cost you around AUD 3 and appr. 15-20 minutes from Bondi beach to here4. Take ferry back to Circular quay - around AUD6, 20 minutes - if you can stand the wind, stay outside of the ferry and take a lot of picture for Syd Opera house and harbour bridge. Alternatively you can take bus back, but it will take longer with the traffic (could up to 1 hour)5. Get off from Ferry and walk to the Sydney opera house and botanical garden all the way to Macquarie chair, domain, hyde park and finish either in St James station or Museum station. If you art lover, you can visit \"art museum of NSW\" at the domain, I skipped it this time. Enjoy beautiful Sydney."

Walked just half an hour or so to Sea Salt Caf\u00e9 (that needs a separate review!!!) and then continued the next 90 minutes to Bondi. Not the bluest or warmest day but the coastal walk was stunning nevertheless. Had planned to cab it back to Coogee Beach but walked the back roads instead. Although shorter and quicker going back it was up and down so pretty stuffed that night. Slept well though!"

Bondi to Coogee is exceptional.The views are consistently spectacular. You walk from one beach to another to another to another. Each is just as spectacular as the previous one with its own distinct feel/character. You also pass by some pools, which are beautiful and open to the public. The terrain involves some moderate ups and downs, but it is not overly strenuous. You could probably complete the entire walk in a few hours, but I took a more leisurely pace. It took me all day because I stopped at each beach, had lunch, and swam in the pool beside Bondi Beach. The \"trail\" is mostly paved or otherwise improved. It's easily accessible from Sydney, and I highly recommend doing it. Everwhere you turn, you get a beautiful view."

We caught the train to Bondi Junction then hopped on a bus to Bondi Beach. What a beautiful beach - it was a lovely warm sunny day and the beach was packed! We walked down the end and climbed over the rocks - stunning views! Then we went for a swim - just gorgeous! Great facilities - large changing rooms/toilets and lockers for hire. Lots of cafes and outdoor eating. This is where Bondi Rescue (TV program) is filmed so was great to see where it was filmed. Then we started the walk. Wow where do I start - the walkway itself is great - and the bays and beaches just beautiful. But the stunning coastline just takes your breath away - looks just like the Mediterranean! It takes approximately two hours - 6km but longer if you stop for lunch or to swim along the way. Great facilities - toilets, cafes.....the iconic old cemetery on a cliff overlooking the sea is priceless. The track can be difficult in parts with lots of steps - no good for wheelchairs or pushchairs unfortunately. We did see a few pushchairs but what a pain! It's an extremely popular walk - lots of people walking both ways. We were lucky with the day - it was just stunning! We finished off at Coogee Beach - another beautiful beach - and had to have another swim as soooo hot! Then we caught the bus back to Bondi Junction and the train back to our hotel. Can't recommend it highly enough - do it!!!!"

A beautiful iconic beach with paved and grassed areas. The coastal walk is signposted but hard to miss anyway, looking directly at the ocean, head to the left and up over the hill. 6km of up and down, around into small bays each unique and charming. Bondi beach is another beautiful bay with sand, surf and lifesavers.From the beachfront(on the shops side of the road) we caught the 380 bus(not all 380 go to Watsons Bay,so make sure it says Watsons Bay on the front) and headed for Watsons Bay. I was told you must have fish and chips at Doyles Watsons Bay. Looking at tripadvisor it gets mixed reviews and wonder if its because there are 2 locations. Doyle's on the wharf and Doyle's Restaurant on the beach. We went to the restaurant (hopping off the bus at the terminus we walked down towards the water, turned right at the beachfront. We had a lovely meal with a fantastic view of Sydney across the harbour.From there we walked down to the wharf and caught a ferry back to Circular Quay, enjoying another view of the harbour. It was a lovely way to do our own tour, with many highlights."

Would definitely recommend to anyone visiting Sydney! Was pretty pooped by the end of it though, so make sure you're prepared. Wear comfortable shoes, bring lots of water (though there are plenty of water dispensers along the way which was very convenient) and make sure you use sunscreen if you don't want to end up looking like a boiled lobster at the end of it. A cap and sunglasses won't hurt either."

The bus got quite crowded along the way. We stopped to eat lunch at Pompeis first and then walked a few blocks to Bondi beach.We took a dip in the water (surprised the water was quite cold), and continued on our walk. I was glad the sun wasn\u2019t out as it was very hot the day we did this walk. We stopped again at Bronte Beach to take a dip in the water to cool off and to grab a quick snack. We took our time walking along the path stopping countless times to take photos. The views are gorgeous and I was surprised the walk was not crowded (this was about 2pm on a weekday in February) We even walked past the cemetery and I joked that I wanted to be buried there overlooking the ocean. There are many steps along the way but it is not a difficult walk at all.We didn\u2019t make it all the way to Coogee but stopped at Clovelly beach and took the bus back to Circular Quay from Clovelly due to the fact we were having dinner with relatives that night and it was starting to get late.Highly recommend this walk for the sheer beauty of the cliffs and beaches."

So we finally took our chance on a mild April day with our 13 and 10 year old kids. We loved the walk, from the wild sandstone formations and colours crafted by the ocean and the wind, the waves crashing onto the craggy rocks, the peaceful rock pools and calm waters to be found at low tide, the beachside baths that had been built so long ago, the architecture and occasional artworks that can be spied along the way, the stunning vistas up and down the coastline, the footy ground and bowling greens seemly on the edge of the cliffs at Clovelly and the wide choice of places to stop for a swim or refreshments. Wear a hat and sunscreen, and take a bottle of water and enjoy the walk for as little or as long as you choose.

I am never going to forget this walk, obviously because it was insanely beautiful but also because this was my first ever solo traveler experience in a foreign land...the walk is very scenic to say the least, but it consists of random inclines and stairs, so make sure to wear comfortable shoes. Also, the blogs will tell you that you need 3 hours but if you really want to take in the experience, keep a good amount of time on your hands because it might look like one long stretch, but you will be amazed at how many different wonderful sights you will get to see throughout the walk. i started my walk around late afternoon so I had the privilege of seeing the colors of the sky change every few minutes. i bet this walk will give you an experience you will never forget"

Railings all the way but quite a lot of steep steps coming from Coogee which can be a bit slippery with leaves in Autumn. At 70 years young managed it quite easily but people with a disability or difficulty walking might find some parts a bit tricky. Well worth the walk, magnificent views all the way along and easily managed cement paths the whole way."

The coastal walk between Bondi and coogee is one of the most breath taking views of Sydney and sure one fun experience for tourists. Bring your waterbottle because there is places to fill them during the walk. And even if you are not very fit and are not able to go all the way, you can stop in one of the many beaches in the way to chill and catch a bus back to Bondi Junction.Its a must do."

The swim club offers a nice vantage point for watching surfers and taking pictures of the beach. It also provided shelter from a storm that came and went quickly but I passed many soaked hikers later. Tamarama beach is also quite stunning. There are steep uphill climbs that may tax some folks but overall the walk is relatively easy and there are lots of benches for taking a rest if need be. (Total length is 6km/3.6mi). When you get to Coogee beach, there's a pavilion where you can get food and drink, and nearby is the bus stop. #373 is a fast bus back to Oxford St and Circular Quay.

It is the opposite of secluded given these beaches are in the densely populated Sydney Eastern Suburbs. But the walk is rustic and the path is in very original condition. You get a great view of the beaches, rolling surf and surf action which is ALWAYS happening. Take your time for this walk and I would recommend timing the walk so that you can have lunch at Tamarama or Bronte. Tama has a good place just off the beach and Bronte has a famous cafe strip of some 6 or so good places. Then you have plenty of energy to tackle the slightly harder part of the walk (not challenging really) up to Clovelly and then Coogee via Gordons Bay. Never heard of anyone who did not love this walk. During busy times (weekends and public holidays) it can get a little crowded."

We have been staying in the city and had all the depressing Easter weather but still wanted to experience some of the great beaches - we left the city in torrential rain prepared for dreadful weather but by the time we got to Coggee the rain had more or less stopped. I would advise you to start at Coggee and walk to Bondi the scenery, beaches and coves are amazing and after lots of expensive excursions this one is free If you are going to do one thing make this top of your list"

Given the right weather ;which I had the good fortune to have,this was a wonderful way to spend an afternoon.The walk is accessible and not difficult to do. Although there were at certain parts where, I found identifying the specific path a little less obvious. Having said that , it is a coastal walk and all paths lead to your destination whatever the case. You can start the walk at either end and to get there you can catch a bus from Circular Quay at bus stop 'E' . Great vistas and an easy ,well laid out path. I did this on my own during the afternoon and did not feel my security breached whilst walking along. Obviously be street smart anyway. There are public amenities along the walk and given a warmer day would have thought about a stop for a swim or a snooze on the beach. It does get blustery in parts so do bring along all the necessary paranephalia one needs when doing walks. There are limited water fountains along the way too.I so enjoyed this walk and was a wonderful reprieve from the city.Just a note to add this is not a wheelchair or pram friendly terrain as there are stairs and one fairly steep slope to contend with."

We took a bus from circular key to Bondi then walked to coogee & bus back to circular key."

Grab your walking gear and some water and enjoy the variety of sights along this coastal walk. Beautiful beaches, vast horizon, several spots to stop off and enjoy a drink / snack and/or ice cream. For visitors (or early arrivals) to Sydney this walk also provides a good perspective of the Eastern suburb beaches, their individual 'falvour' and how they flow from one to the next. The contrast between Bondi (large, mainly tourist beach) to Clovelly (small, mainly locals, narrow swimming 'channel') is telling, for example. The coastal walk is popular, of course, so weekends can attract busy foot-traffic year-round. If you are hoping for less people, I would suggest aim for a weekday, if possible. Buses run to every beach so, if you are staying in the city, for example, it is a ~25 min ride to Bondi (it;s also possible to catch a train)."

            "review": "If you only have three things to do in Sydney this is on the list!. Sydney has a terrific number of coastal and bush walks. I recommend this one if you only have one or two days in Sydney as it captures so much that is special about Sydney. People talk about the iconic Bondi Beach and so why not factor it into your day. I recommend starting at Bondi....North Bondi in fact, where you can walk around the rock pools before doing the broadwalk where amazing street artists turn over the long mural wall every three weeks. You pass the skateboard park which is fun before ascending past the iconic Icebergs swimming pool. Make time to pop into the waves or the pool if you can. Thewalk then proceeds along the coast line with beautiful views, so invigorating and a great way to walk out your jet lag and get some heart rates up.Strongly recommend you do this walk on weekdays as weekeneds are full of weekend warriors...the boot campers and joggers who will push you aside. Also consider starting at sunrise or ending at sunset so you get an extra dimension to your visit. We walk in the morning and drop into beautiful Bronte for breakfast. A small stretch of great cafes with great juices and wonderful breakfasts. Continue to Coogee to fully enjoy the cliffs and formations with historical Waverley Cemetary on the way. If you tire there are buses at every beach that quickly take you back to the city.If you love life you will love the fresh air, big sky and sunshine. We usually finish it by 930am which leaves you a full day of sightseeing."

A brisk summer morning with the breeze just ruffling your hair and the beauty of the ocean breaking against the coastline. What mor is there to say. The coastal walk offers the best of the Sydney eastern coastline as it weaves around the beaches of Bronte, Tamarrama and Bondi however there are things that need to be taken into consideration. There are often runners and while most of them are reasonable about sharing the walking path some are not. Chatty walkers like to walk abreast and can be loathe to let you pass if it means breaking the line and probably the conversation. The are stairs of varying heights and while I don't think the wall is overly difficult it does require some negotiation. While most people might head to Bondi for a coffee I still prefer the quieter atmosphere of the cafe at Tamarrama."

Sunbathing & swimming continued along the way, please beware that Rip Tides are very strong at times on many of these beaches & follow the rules set out by the lifesavers. Bronti is probably my favourite & cafes that serve healthy options & veggie juices that taste oh so good. The next stage of the walk from Bronti to Coogee is tougher on the knees as there are a few steep hills and steps, but the walkway that has been built in the past few years makes life much easier & offers outstanding views.

You will see lovely beach houses along the coastal side. You will also come across the spot where it used to house a tiny timber residence of Nosey Bob, who is the first salaried hangman in the 19th century. As you enjoy the cliff walk, you will come to see the Waverley Cemetery, established in 1877 which houses graves of many famous Australians.

The scenery is spectacular, and shows off this Sydney Gem in all it's splendour. Sometimes we stop at Tamarrama for a coffee, or just continue on and return to Bondi for a well earned burger at Moo Burgers, Bondi Beach.You need a reasonable level of fitness to enjoy this walk, and don't forget the camera as the photo opportunities are endless :)"

We caught train and then bus from the City to Bondi Beach, had coffee overlooking the busy beach and then set out on the walk to Coogee. On a beautiful, sunny and warm late summer day it was an enjoyable walk followed by a well-deserved swim and lunch at Coogee before catching the bus back to the City. The views are wonderful and well worth it."

One of the highlights for me was the cemetery - if you don't like taking a stroll through the graves, just walk past.

After a day tour to Blue Mountains from Dingo Travel, I got off from the ferry at Circular Quay(5:30pm on Sunday Feb 8 2015), took a bus 338 (or take #333 displaying North Bondi for $3.80 one-way or buy return as #333 is pre-pay ticket only). I asked the driver for Bondi Beach and had only $3.60. She was generous and allowed me to ride the bus. I had the google maps print out and also asked a lady where to get off for Bondi Beach, I got off at Hall St, walked 5-10mins through the market and was at Bondi Beach in 45mins. Spent little bit of time at the beach and then made my way to the famous coastal walk. It had amazing and breathtaking views, specially the Icebergs Club with an outdoor swimming pool. I wish I had time to swim there as it was open to public (with some charge). The walk was amazing, with ups and downs, stairs, steep walk etc. Saw a lot of people walking, running, jogging, strolling with dogs or families. Even after 6:30pm it was hot and humid with 30'C and I was exhausted after a long day. I walked upto the Tamarama Beach, which was the first beach on the way. My plan was to walk upto the Bronte but couldnt. Still it had amazing views and I enjoyed a lot, took lots of pics n videos. I exited from the walk pathway, climed the stairs. and waited for a bus. It was Sunday and already 7pm, so had no buses but only 1 bus going to Cogee Beach. I had to go back to CBD, so my only option was to walk back the coastal walk and take a #333 from Bondi. So I walked back and was lucky enough to catch the bus. I tried to pay the driver but he said its a pre-pay only bus and I should have my return ticket. But the driver was friendly (yet again) and he allowed me ride for free :). If you have time, spare atleast half a day for Bondi Beach and the Coastal walk. I would prefer early morning or late evening, so as to avoid heat and sun but make sure you have enough sunlight to take amazing pics and enjoy the views."

Take your togs, along the way there are fantastic salt water pools to cool off in, the one in Bronte is the best. On a hot day it feels a bit further than 6kms but its really worth it. Coogee beats Bondi hands down as far as I'm concerned. Everyone talks about Bondi but Coogee is quaint and beautiful. Don't miss walking out to the Baths Point - now called Dolphins Point where sightings of the Virgin Mary were reported in 2003 and 2007. There's a little shrine to the event which is quite interesting even if you're not a believer."

The views are superb, there are points that walk along the beach promenades, cliff top views and even bits that go through dirt paths and trees. Along this path around october each year they have \"Sculptures by the Sea\", a sculpture art exhibit that runs for a fortnight. It is very busy at this time so running is an issue but going for a stroll/walk is very fun and interesting to see the art on display. You could walk this path every day for months and never cease to have a smile on your face as you breathe the fresh ocean air and have the beautiful auusie sun beam down on your face and skin."

Who like us were enjoying the sun.There are plenty of benches on the way to rest on. And the walking is easy, so it'll be child friendly. BUT don't take the buggies, as you will be climbing a few steps.We celebrated the end with a lie in the sun on Bondi. The sea was quite choppy, & the lifeguards are brilliant at looking after everyone. If you want a safe swim, there are other smaller beaches on the way there.

A meal of your choice before you begin, overlooking one iconic beach, makes a good start.The sight of the sandstone headland above the spectacular waves and beach which is never bereft of people. - it's a great sight.As you walk around the paths, hewn out of sandstone, the salt sea air clears the head and the enthusiasm of the youngsters who have come for a daytime school excursion abounds. People of all ages, of all kinds and in amazing variation in attire surround you. It's not a place for you if you have a joint impediment, but there are many who manage it with a walking stick.A must, each year!"

There are a couple of nice views, but there are a lot of people on the path at all times and I can't say that there's anything to recommend it over picking one of the beaches and going for a swim."

The bus 333 from the city brings you directly here however rather than sitting for a longer time on the hot bus (today was boiling hot!) we opted to take the train from Town Hall to Bondi Junction (air conditioned!) which is fast then take the 333 bus from Bondi Junction station which is really easy to find as large signposts everywhere showing you the way to go. Then 5 minutes on the bus and arrived!I loved the walk for the amount of photo opportunities there are , really so many! Even though it was a hot day today being on the coast you get the sea breeze and that really makes a difference.If you are in Sydney or coming I would definitely recommend this for an afternoon out. We arrived at Bondi around 11am and after exploring the beach and taking the walk we were leaving by about 2pm.I would suggest to take water with you though at various places during the walk there are snack shops/cafe when you arrive at the beaches during the walk and also water fountains with fresh water.It's the kind of thing I would only do once in the daytime (unless I was a fitness fanatic and lived in the area as many people looked to be using it as their workout route!) .. however possibly another perfect time to do this walk for me either sunrise or sunset, I can imagine how nice that would be.Definitely give this a go in Sydney. I've lived here for many years and thanks to tripadvisor I am discovering my own city, and it's amazingly beautiful!"

Three of us set off from Bondi Beach at 9:30am on a humid March day. It was already warm, and as the morning progressed, it seemed hotter than the 29-degrees predicted for the day. It is a superb 6-kilometre walk along the cliffs and headlands, from Bondi to Tamarama, Bronte, Clovelly and finishing up at Coogee. The track is what we refer to as \"cut-lunchy\", meaning paved, even and wide. There are some hilly sections and stairs but nothing a fit person would baulk at. We are in our 60s.We stopped for a coffee at Bronte Beach, where a strip of cafes offers about 6 choices. Cafe choices at Tamarama and Clovelly are limited, and Coogee is too bustling and massive to offer cafe intimacy. We didn't time our walk but the actual walking was probably about one hour 20 minutes. We caught a bus to Circular Quay from Coogee Beach after the walk, a trip of about 25 minutes. The buses run every few minutes. Recommendations for this walk are to start early if walking in summer, wear sunscreen, and take your cozzie for a swim if time allows. Lots of fitness freaks were in evidence, as were some very cute and well-behaved dogs. Highly recommended."

It was an overcast day and that was actually nice as most of the walk would be in the sun if it would have been out. The breeze off the water cools things down a bit, but it would probably still be pretty warm in the midday sun.The path itself is very well taken care of. There are drinking fountains along the way and that was great to either have a quick drink or fill up my water bottle. The shore is striking with a great variety of rock formations and the beautiful sea. It is quite hilly and there are many stairs up and down throughout the walk, so you should definitely go prepared for exertion. I had walking shoes on and was glad I did--some folks were walking around in flip flops and I don't think that would be the best, especially if you plan to do the entire walk. It is possible to shorten up the walk at many points along the path, so there's no need to go all the way to Coogee if you don't want to."

Most people start from Bondi Beach to Tamarama Beach, to Bronte Beach, to Waverley, to Clovelly Beach, to Coogee Beach and lastly, Maroubra Beach. It's a looong stretch, so be ready for a looong walk. Bring water! We packed lunch and stopped repeatedly, swam in the ocean and pools, ate, took lots of pictures---and chatted with friendly folks along the way. Like us, people without selfie-sticks were more than glad to play photographer-of-the-moment, kindred travelers doing a good deed for the day:)Besides, there's always the bus! Make use of your Opal card. From Bondi Junction, take the #353 bus to Maroubra Beach; this will also pass Coogee Beach. Just tell the driver where you want to go and he'll tell you where to hop off. Walk as much or as little as you want, and find the next bus stop.From Bondi Junction, #378 goes to Bronte Beach. Do know that from Bondi Beach to Bronte Beach is 2.5 kilometers via the Coastal Walk. The path goes up and down and there are stairs, too.From Bondi Junction, #333, #381, and #382, all go to Bondi Beach. Bus #380 goes north towards Watsons Bay.Warning: while enjoying the vista, it's easy to forget how long you've been in the sun. You'll get sunburned even with suntan lotion."

If you only have limited time in Sydney and want to explore the great outdoor sunny lifestyle that the Sydneysiders enjoy then you should definitely do this walk... There are ocean lookouts and places to rest along the way, and it's definitely pedestrian friendly.. There are some stairs and uneven pavements to walk through, but you're definitely walking along the beach trail pretty much the whole way.. One of the highlights is actually walking through one of Sydney's most scenic and eerie cemeteries along the way at Waverley. You could do the walk in both directions, roughly 2hrs each direction.. Treat yourself to a nice beer or coffee at the end of your walk or along the way.. Stop over for a swim at one of the beaches ... Definitely great for some exercise with friends and family..

We went from Bondi to Coogee and returned to Bondi Junction via bus. We ate lunch at the Coogee Pavillion which was average. If I was to do it again, I would stop at Bronte and either return to Bondi via the coastal walk or get a bus at Bronte. The walk from Bronte to Coogee was not as pretty and had a lot of elevation change."

The entire walk took us 2.5 hours and it was glorious with the morning sun and ocean breeze. We passed 4 beaches, the Waverly cemetery, and one bay. There are places to fill up a water bottle, use the washroom and change into a swimsuit along the way. Do it during the week to avoid crowds...we were fortunate as it was also low season (February)."

For budding photographers, it is a dream: at every turn an idyllic vista smacks you in the face. For the health conscious: I can think of no better environment for a run or brisk walk. Our entire trek was paradisaical, and if we had had the time we'd have hiked the whole trail. Kudos to Australia for constructing this public walk! Well worth an afternoon."

It is a great walk with ups and downs and even a cemetery to walk past. The day we did it, it was cloudy so the sun did not beat down on us, imagine on a sunny day it would be very different. We went through all the beaches and every on was slightly different as if their own personality. I enjoyed it immensely, there are even places to sit for a bit, and you can even wade through the water at each beach. If you are into photography, there is a lot to photograph because each beach area is different. I even got some shots of flora that is unique to Australia. There is a house just past Coogee that has some unique windows all to take in the light and probably nice to look out from. If you are into the scenery and just being outdoors this is a great experience. We did it in 4+ hours just sauntering and taking pictures and enjoying the scenery. It is about 5K so you can do it in a number of ways, there were some jogging and walking fast etc. Enjoy."

In November the sculptures walk is very popular and many people get their artistic fix as well as the exercise. It is recommended that you drop into the Icebergs Club soon after the walk starts or at the end if you start at Coogee. You can have a welcome drink and/or something to eat and take a seat looking over iconic Bondi beach.There are some steps at various places so you need to be aware of that.

Note that the track can get busy on the weekend and can get very congested at peak times. Best time to go is week days during working hours when you can enjoy the view, stroll at leisurely pace and stop and try some of the great local cafes -tip- the coffee is always good!"

Not for wheelchairs & never will be because there are too many steps. This is where i live & love it. If you do the walk in November you will see sculptures by the sea on your walk."

Take your pick, in either direction, or walk it all. Half an hour - or a whole day of walking, swimming & eating. Do it !"

Being a coastal walk there are plenty of opportunities for you to to stop and take a swim in one of the many beaches, or to stop at one of the beachfront cafes. This is a very popular walk for both tourists and locals, so the track can get very busy, especially on a hot summers day.

Easy to get good food for lunch there, then you can either catch a bus on or retrace your steps to Bondi....."

The service is frequent and cheap. During the busride you get to see part of the city as well, so it is a win-win.What to bring: If you, like me, want to take your time to enjoy the day, then bring something to drink, sandwishes and enjoy your lunch with a scenic view. Besides that: Sun cream, cap, camera and good walking shoes.Conditions: The walk is about 1,5 hours and it is a bit up and down. Stairs are frequent, so if you suffer problems with your knees, etc....then maybe only to a part of the walk and then take a bus from there to your next destination.Absolutely recommedable."

I'll say this much - it doesn't disappoint! My husband and I walked the reverse (Coogee to Bondi), only because we live closer to Coogee so started on our end. Things to know:* The cliff-top coastal walk takes you through Coogee, Clovelly, Bronte, Tamarama, Bondi* The total length is approximately 6 km. We walked it in about an hour and a half, stopping to take some quick photos. You can really take as long as you want, depending on what you're in the mood for. You could easily make a day of it by bringing a picnic or stopping for a swim at any of the beaches* There are lots of stairs. The terrain is well-groomed, so it's not a difficult walk; however, be mindful that there are quite a few stairs along the way. We saw plenty of kids finish the hike, so it's not that bad :)* Bring water! It's a decent length walk and can get VERY hot - not a great deal of shade, as you're walking along the cliffs"

This was our second time in Sydney with the firm intention of going for that fabulous coastal walk.It is indeed scenic.But we believe having found an even better way to do it!You should start at Coogee Beach. Sydney public busses go there.Then, you walk from Coogee towards Bondi.There are two significant advantages:1 - There are more steps going down than going uphill. After 5 km your legs will be much more relaxed than climbing the other way round.2 - The arrival at Bondi is beautiful. If you are walking to Bondi you have plenty of time to enjoy the landscape.If ever we go back to Sydney, we will walk from Coogee to Bondi.An useful practical detail: there are quite a few public toilets along the coastal walk."

It's really a must for anyone who enjoys coastal walks, especially if you come from somewhere where such scenery is rare. The sandstone cliffs give you an up close look at the rock much of early Sydney was built from and if you are around in spring or autumn the chances are good you will spot some of the migrating whales heading to or from their breeding grounds. Dolphin pods might be seen any time of year.BUTevery time I take this walk it seems to be more crowded. Maybe it's just me getting older? I am sure there are more prams out there, because people seem to hate letting their preschoolers walk anywhere these days (see, I am turning into a grumpy old woman!).The joggers have always been rude on this walk - they are out there all day and evening and god help you if you get in the way of one of the manic merchant bankers listening to motivational podcasts while he pounds his warrior spirit into obedience along the cliff paths! I've seen joggers spit on people who were too slow and swearing, huffing heavily and deliberately shaking head sweat onto others are not at all uncommon.Anyway, if you only have a short time and want a bit of exercise while you soak in a spectacular aspect of the real Sydney, do this walk and don't let anything stop you. If you hate crowds, try starting from the southern end (Coogee) and maybe turn back if the scene gets too busy as you near Bondi.Whatever you do, though, get out of the way when you hear heavy breathing and a Nike thud!"

You will not be disappointed.The views are amazing.The path is very easy to follow so you just can't get lost.There is always a lot of people around, unless you are running/walking early morning or early evening.There is water available when you approach Bronte (at the top of the hill coming from Waverley Cemetery. There is water available along the way like at Coogee, Bronte SLSC, Tama SLSC and again when you get to Bondi. Naturally you can do the walk in reverse.How hard is the walk?There are quite a few stairs around Gordons Bay and South Bondi so if you struggle with stairs then you can always take the streets around.You can break up the walk with a number of cafes to choose from in Bronte and Coogee.The walk also extends another 2kms south of Coogee towards Lurline Bay."

We caught the bus from Sydney's Museum station to Bronte and started our walk through the cemetery where Henry Lawson is buried (although we didn't see) to join the coastal walk at the bottom of hill. From there we continued along the coast past wonderful houses and cute picturesque beaches. It was pretty warm and the kids appreciated drink and ice cream stopovers at various beaches and we're just starting to complain when we hit the view of Bondi beach.

We always manage to find parking along the side of Waverley Cemetery and enjoy the walk around Bronte and Tamarama beaches into Bondi. The beaches are glorious and it's always a joy to walk along the cliffs overlooking the Pacific Ocean. After admiring the view as you turn the corner and first glimpse Bondi Beach, we often walk to the far end of the beach for a cool drink at the North Bondi RSL Club which has a magnificent view of the beach. Then up Hall Street to one of the many cafes for lunch, before walking back to the car. A very pleasant way to spend a few hours - and get a bit of exercise too!"

Stopped for a coffee at Bronte then lunch(take away fish & chips) at Coogee, then continued on to Maroubra, just under 9kms in total. The stretch from Coogee isn't well signposted as you need to walk some of the streets instead of following the coastline. We ended up walking the rocks of Lurline Bay - lucky it was low tide!Our ciders at the end were very refreshing! If doing on a sunny day make sure you have plenty of water & hat as there is no shade and could get very hot, we were lucky to have an overcast day."

Every visitor of mine to Sydney either asks to go on this walk, or discovers a true beauty of nature. The walk is along the cliff top overlooking the coastline. There are many stairs hence it is fairly challenging but extremely rewarding. Along the walk one encounters a few smaller beaches along the way that one can walk past or through. At the end of the walk as far as Bronte there are numerous cafes and restaurants to relax and catch your breath. At this point one can continue along to Clovelly beach which is another beautiful and busy beach. I always feel highly envigorated by this incredibly beautiful walk and and enjoy it each and every time. The rock and cliff formations are amazingly beautiful. Once a year there is an sculpture show along the route - well worth the trip."

If you are not zooming through Bondi, if you have spend the day at the beach, done a few of the restaurants on the main road, I do suggest this walk as it is a great way to see all the other smaller beaches as well as lend some spectacular views.When they say 6km it doesn't take into account steep descents and climbs so be aware of that. Take your time, there are plenty of rests, cafes and even toilets to break your journey. Take in the views and get inspired by the hundreds of joggers who make this trek seem so easy.Plan it such that A) you have sufficient energy and time to get back to Bondi the same way or B) you head out of Coogee to wherever you need to go to next as there is no bus directly on weekdays from Coogee to Bondi. You will have to go Bondi Junction and the come back to Bondi if you are tired."

There were more options to take a bus back to (if I recall correctly) to Circular Quay which would have been fine for us. Of course traffic might have made the route by bus longer in the end.We enjoyed stopping at a couple of spots along the way to swim."

The day we took the walk, it was sunny with temperatures 35 C or 91 F, so be sure to take a bottle of water, some sunscreen and a camera to capture the beautiful scenery.

Since it is a combination of several walks, you can start and end in between without going the whole distance.Bring your swim clothes as you will be walking by beaches with waters that seem to invite you in. I was most impressed with The Bath. If I had the time and proper attire, I would have gone in for a dip.Water fountains are available throughout, bring along your water bottle to refill. Public toilets are also available but will close after a certain time.Certain parts of the walk will take you to the edge of the cliffs. Stay inside the fence to avoid accidents. Winds are strong and sometimes sand particles could end up in your eyes.Apply sunscreen, put on your sunnies and a cap/hat. Wear proper shoes although I did see people with flip flops.For pictures, visit Lyn, Life Explorer: Bondi to Coogee Coastal Walk (http://arazlin.blogspot.com.au/2015/01/bondi-to-coogee-coastal-walk.html)"

The beach is expectedly lively with ppl sunbathing and surfing and relaxing. From the information we've gathered, the walk from Bondi to Coogee was straightforward. Undoubtedly, this coastal walk is one of the best and most popular. We have visited most part of the city but nothing beats this one. The route has well guided signs and map points. Starting from Bondi Beach, walking South you will see cliff top trail with sandstone cliffs and endless spectacular water of the ocean. Next, there is the Tamarama Beach which is smaller but still beautiful with surfing lovers everywhere. As we did not have enough time so we had lunch in one of the cafe in the Bronte Beach area and backtrack our route back to the Bondi Beach. With what we have seen and walked, the view was truly amazing. you simply have to come to see it for yourself."

We cannot believe that we lived in Sydney's East for so long and never encountered this gem.The walk from Coogee northward to Bondi was a highlight of our recent visit. Beautiful bays and beaches, stunning rock formations, a cemetery filled with history, great people watching,... and the list could go on. The walking tracks and facilities are well maintained and make it easy for all ages to enjoy some or all of the walk. We started with excellent coffee at one of Coogee's many fine cafes, then ambled to Bronte beach where we stopped for the mandatory fish and chips, enjoyed in the shady beach park. We finished with the best part, and I do recommend a South to North walk for this reason! The final part of our walk from Bronte around to Tamarama and Bondi was stunning. If you have limited time, or have younger or older walkers, this is the part to try. Short and easy, but the best of the views.Public transport to most places, especially Coogee and Bondi, is easy to negotiate from the city and tourist hotels. But we were so in the groove, that we then walked across from Bondi to Rose Bay and around the waterfronts to the city. We agreed that this burned off the calories from the fish and chips, and ensured a good night's sleep! Don't wait as long as we did to discover this Sydney highlight."

The walk is quite an easy one for any able bodied person. Especially if you need a regular break, it's easy to stop and just soak in the view. We always take overseas visitors on this walk and they are always in awe of the beauty of our coastline. There are better coastlines in Australia especially in WA. This walk however is great though."

If you would like to immerse yourself into the local lifestyle and do what many Sydney siders do every day then head over to the Eastern suburbs and walk the coastal trail from Bondi to Coogee.It's a path that takes you through 5 beaches plus Gordon's Bay which is a great spot for snorkeling and diving. If you don't mind getting up early (before sunrise) it's probably the most rewarding time to start your walk on Bondi beach.Bondi is frequented by a lot of fitness enthusiasts and you will see many of those working out in the morning just before sunrise and after. The sun rises up from the ocean and often times colours the sky in bright orange and red hues. Prime photo opportunity...The walk itself is fairly easy eventhough there are stairs and up and down sections through smaller hills/cliffs etc. Set aside 2 hours one way if you stop for photos and walk with a moderate speed. I'd recommend having breakfast at Bronte beach as a bit of a pit stop. Any cafe just up from the bus stop will serve up one of the best breakfasts you have ever had. As a local, I always take my visiting international or interstate friends on this walk. It's a must do when in Sydney regardless of season."

The walk is very scenic with cliffs and waves crashing and surfboarders. The wind can be chilly so be sure to bring a jacket. We also carried water and snacks.

It's about 4 miles in total and is quite up and down but not a problem for most people and there are plenty of places to stop along the way for a swim etc. if you do it on a hot day make sure you have plenty of water and sun cream! There are water stations through the the walk where you can refill your drinks if necessary."

Stunning scenery, plenty of places to sit down if you need a rest and loads of places to refill water bottles. We were surprised that Bondi Beach was not as commercial as we expected and the bays and beaches we walked through we're just lovely. We ended up eating lunch at a cafe called Little Jack Horner in Coogee which was great. Definitely do the whole walk rather than stop at one of the earlier bays. We are in our late 50s and it wasn't a hard walk. We spent roughly 3 hours walking because we stopped for photos etc. fit person could do it in just over 1 hour without stops."

This walk is one of three \"must do's\" in the Eastern Suburbs of Sydney, along with visiting Watson's Bay/South Head and taking in the harbour/city views from the top of New South Head Road. The views are second to none and it's a great way to catch up for a chat with someone while also getting some exercise. In October every year, this walk hosts the \"Sculptures by the Sea\" art exhibition which is becoming a Sydney favourite.It takes approximately 1.5 hours one way at a leisurely pace. Be aware that there is no shade on this walk, there are several sets of stairs (so not wheelchair friendly) and given the clifftop location, it is very exposed to the wind. For these reasons, I recommend doing the walk early to enjoy the sunrise over the water or towards sunset when the weather is cooler. At the Bondi end, Bondi Trattoria, Icebergs public bar and North Bondi RSL are good spots to have a drink and some food at a reasonable price. At the Coogee end, Barzura, Tropicana Caf\u00e9 and Coogee Legions Club offer drinks and food at reasonable prices.This walk can be extended to the north by continuing to Watsons Bay and to the south by continuing to Maroubra.Enjoy the beauty that Sydney's spectacular coastline offers."

Some of the climbs at the Bondi Beach end are quite steep, so be prepared to hold on to the rails and pace yourself, despite a fair sprinkling of runners in just a bit too much of a hurry. If climbing stairs is a problem, sadly this walk may be just too taxing. This walk will connect you with wonderful sandstone folds, breathtaking headland views, and reward you with fine caf\u00e9 refreshment once you reach your destination, or pause at Tamarama on the way. As a photographer some of the intricate details of the rock formation are a constantly changing mosaic, best viewed from sun-up to 2 hours afterwards. The clarity of winter skies can also enhance the experience. Wrap up warm if it's a howling south westerly in Winter, dress lightly if it's a warm north-easterly in late Summer, bringing onshore humidity. No matter how many times I've done this walk, it's a joy. The parking fees at Bondi are steep, you'll pay $12 or more if you make the return walk. But the uplift in spirit is worth every penny. And in the Sydney Spring, make sure to look out for Sculptures by The Sea, a magnificent collection of sculptures arrained along the coastal walk. 5-Star walk in every sense."

You could catch a taxi from your hotel but it would be very expensive with a lot of traffic in this area at all times of the day! I recommend the train and bus option to get here. The walk offers outstanding coastal cliff scenery, lots of million dollar mansions of the rich and famous types and I guess another benefit is you get some exercise to go with the views. If you have already seen the main tourist attractions in Sydney and are looking for something else to do then I recommend this attraction"

Approaching/departing Bondi you need to time one brief section at high tide between breaking waves. Sometimes on concrete paths, other times on timber walkways anchored above rocks, with every turn there is a vista demanding attention and photographs.Hats off to those that planned and built this wonder. And best of all it costs not one cent to enjoy it.

The temperature on the walk gets from chilly to hot and back consistently an the water is around 17 - 20 degrees depending on the beach in the summer! Coming from Jamaica this is crazy cold beach water.

The pathway is excellent and far better than anticipated making the walk much easier than I would have thought, even on a hot sunny day. There is some uphill walking but that means you get to walk downhill as well. There is the opportunity to stop for refreshment if required while you admire the great views, especially the bizarre cemetery half way along the walk."

Then you walk with astonishing views, no matter if you are coming or going. Then, you stop and take your time on sandy Bondi beach, a lively neighborhood, with options of restaurants and stores. And wi-fi on the beach! It's not a very long trail - 6 km - but be prepared cause you'll find some ways up, some down and some stairs. But locals use it to run. The views are a reward. Coogee, Tamarama and, finally, Bondi!"

The trains and buses run very regularly and it's easy to get to. The walk starts at the end of the beach in bondi you just follow that walking path all the way too coogee. Lovely views, stunning clifftop scenery, lost of amazing big mansions (must be a lot of rich people here in Sydney I think) and you also walk past some lovely little beaches.

Stop at Clovelly or Bronte for a swim if it's hot, and have lunch at one of the number of cafes at Coogee. Then, if you're keen for more, continue the walk on to Maroubra. Different coastline, less touristy, and after that good walk a beer at Maroubra will be really welcome.it follows the coast so it's mostly flat, so there are some stairs and couple of hills.

I began my walk with lunch in Coogee, where there are quite a few restuarants to choose from.From there I headed north along the coastal walk towards Bondi. In total, I think I took around 2 hours to get to Bondi, but one could definitely do it quicker with less stops to take photos. Note that the walk does involve a lot of stairs and isn't really wheelchair, bike or stroller friendly. Bike and strollers are managable (I saw a lot of both), but you would be carrying both up some sections.I finished my walk at the Icebergs at the south end of Bondai. If you don't live in the immediate area, you can go into this member's club for free to have drinks. I stopped and drank a flat white over-looking the beach, which was a nice finish to my walk.I'd also recommend you go when the sun is out. I felt my experience was a bit muted by the lack of sunlight, which would have made the colours \"pop\" a lot more.I didn't find too many places to stop for coffee along the way, but apparently there are some. Also, importantly, there were quite a few toliets along the way...All in all, it was a nice way to spend Saturday afternoon and I'd gladly walk it again in better conditions."

It is one of Sydney's great gifts to its locals and visitors. It never fails to impress and inspire. You can start at many different points and continue on past Coogee where it is quieter as most people tend to stop once they get to Coogee Beach. My favourite spot is Gordons Bay where the the deep turquoise colour of the water is magical. It can often get busy especially on the weekend or in good weather - so my suggestion would be to go early or later and on a weekday if possible. And please don't not go if the weather is not great as this if often the best time to view the atmospherics and the drama of the ocean, the sky and the cliffs. There are so many places to go in for a dip and to stop, rest and have a coffee. There are steps in places so the whole walk is not very accessible for wheelchair-bound people so this is disappointing. However, there are sections of it that would be most accessible for those people. Definitely one of my favourite spots and believe me there are many to choose from!"

Breakfast at Bill's, yes the ricotta pancakes are awesome, then a walk down to Bondi Beach. Our group (about 9, ages 26 - 60) began the walk to Coogee. We planned a one-way walk with a bus ride back to the train station. It turned out to be the perfect plan.I think its about a 6K walk, up and down the bluffs of the coasts, and the overcast day did not spoil the magnificent views around each corner. Easy to talk and walk, plenty of water and other refreshments along the way as well as restrooms. Arriving at Coogee, we stopped in at the pavilion and were surprised to find an amazing restaurant, bar and other things as well. I think we spent as much time at the pavilion as we did on the walk. The morning walk turned into a day on the coast and we were glad we did not plan to walk back.Highly recommend this attraction!"

That's where I take my overseas guests, if they are here on a weekend in our Summer (October to April). It also coincides with our 'Daylight Saving time' when sea breeze can be very refreshing, morning or late afternoon.Along the way you will enjoy magnificent Ocean views and delight in watching the many surfers on the smaller beaches - particularly Tamarama Beach or Bronte Beach. Obviously the preferred times are in Summer, however even during our Winter months the surf is up, the sky is blue and the sun still shines. Come on, put on your best walking gear and enjoy the walk - jogging is allowed, at your own pace! You'll just have to watch out for the slow tourists and the locals enjoying the view, with a freshly brewed cup of coffee."

But this time a meandering look at the sculptures made the experience longer but no less enjoyable. We decided to lunch at Coogee fish and chips on the grass overlooking the beach. A great day, family friendly, spectacular scenes at every turn. Sydney is such a jewel."

Someone told me its an easy walk and I would say its a moderate walk takes about 2hrs plus depending on how many times you stop to take in the breath taking views.There are plenty of cafes you can stop at along the way. The walk has steps, hills, road walking it is all in good condition but takes all day to go there and back. We loved it, however the day we did it (Sunday 23/11/14) it was a very hot day and had a weird fog hanging around interrupting some of the views at times, although naturally beautiful in its own right. We got to the end and could not see the view of Bondi through the fog. We didn't go right to the end to go to Bondi Beach as we wanted to get back to Coogee Pavillion for lunch. Definately worth putting on your bucket list of things to do in Australia. We also swam on the way back at Clovelly which has alot of history but its like you are swimming at the barrier reef."

There are buses available at Bondi/Bronte and Coogee if you did not want to take the whole walk........which by the extends further south to Maroubra.Plenty of cafes and restaurants at Bondi and Coogee with less at Bronte and a small one at Tamarama (between Bondi and Bronte). There are steps naturally as the path hugs the coast.Take a bottle of water and wear good walking shoes. Remember your camera and have a swim along the way - the surf can be dangerous so BATHE BETWEEN THE FLAGS always and check the beach is open first and patrolled by our wonderful lifesavers many of whom are volunteers.It will be a day you will always remember and will certainly lift your spirits for your travels ahead."

I'm definitely glad I did this walk the views were wonderful, you will see beautiful coastline, cliff faces, beaches and of course multi million dollar homes of I am guessing the rich and/or famous of Sydney. As a benefit you get some fitness while on holidays hahaha! Please note that to get here you must either catch a taxi (can be expensive) or do what I did and get a train from the central train stop in the city to a place called bondi junction then from there you can catch any number of buses to bondi beach where the walk begins. Definitely recommend and best thing is that it is free!!!"

It is about 6 km in length but can take you anything from an hour upwards depending on how long you stop. If it's your first time i recommend taking a picnic at stopping at Tamarama on the way - it's great to take in everything at a leisurely pace. I enjoying running this route and there are a few 'outside gyms' on route to bump out your workout. Beware though this route gets very busy in summer and on weekends - I love going for an early morning weekday run when there are few people. It really can be difficult to navigate at peak times. There are plenty of great places in Coogee to eat and drink after, i love the Coogee Bay Hotel and some of the smaller cafe's further from the beach.You can get a bus back to the city fairly easily from just next to the beach. The 'M' express buses are great and one goes through Newtown which makes a great stop off if you have never been and want to explore.Enjoy! :)"

This is a stunning walk around the coast, with beaches, cliffs, waves, surfers, blue water, yellow soft sand, and little cafes and restaurants to stop at before, during and after for a drink, coffee or a bite, or a cold beer or a glass of wine.catch the bus to South Bondi, have a coffee or have a meal overlooking the beach at the Iceburgs restaurant. Walk around the stunning cliffs, pst little bays and great views to Tamarama Beach, have a quick swim or a coffee or drink then continue on to Bronte Beach. If you missed a swim/drink at Tamarama, then take your pick here at many cafes and little restaurants full of the locals. Either finish here and get the bus back to the city or continue on to Coogee beach passing the old and interesting Waverley Cemetry and again the views are amazing.If you are there in October then the sculpture by the sea is a must. It is one of the most spectacular venues for the fascinating and beautiful sculptures with a background of blue sky and water, with some of them covering Tamarama Beach. A photo opportunity at every turn. On a lovely sunny Sydney day, whether it be early morning, throughout the day or late afternoon, this is the place to be and not to be missed."

The Clovelly Bowling Club sits on top of the cliff top with great views but typical club food. End up at the Coogee Bay Pub.

There are some very steep steps in places so you you need to be reasonably able to do this walk.

I've done this walk twice during my 2 weeks here in Sydney... once was during the annual Sculpture By the Sea exhibit along the path, and the other was a few days ago on a rainy day. First of all- this is a beautiful walk. Nothing beats the fresh air, scenic overlooks, and being able to explore several beaches along one path. I haven't gone on a weekend, but I imagine it would be pretty crowded, as the trail isn't terribly wide in some areas. Bring your swimmers along and some snacks, as a lot of restaurants are closed after 5pm on/near the smaller beaches. There are a few points along the trail where you can refill your water bottle, which was a life saver! Overall, a beautiful walk and FREE, which is super rare in Sydney. Go on an overcast day- the views are still beautiful and it's not as crowded. :)"

The Eastern Coastal Walk from Bondi to Coogee, if you do it, will be one of the most spectacular walks in your life. Don't stop at Bronte Beach; the Bronte to Coogee stretch amply rewards the additional effort. Spectacular seascapes, amazing rock formations, some of the best-engineered walking paths anywhere, scenic beach communities; wild waves crashing against headlands: what more could you ask for? Well, OK, if you're lucky (I was), some fashion photographers will be doing a bikini photo shoot on one of the beaches, but you can't count on that.  If you go the whole length, do stop for a few minutes at the Bali Memorial. I'm betting that each one of the 43 NSW victims of the Bali terrorist attack was in Kuta because they loved the ocean and loved beautiful places. I'm glad the memorial was placed where it is."

The entire walk was rather leisurely, several sets of steps and slopes along the way. Definitely a beautiful view! We preferred to start from Coogee as it is relatively less crowded as compared to Bondi and hence didn't get caught in human traffic that much.Do remember to apply copious amounts of sunblock before doing the walk especially in this season as the sun is scorching. The cooling sea breeze does help a lot though. We took about 2 hours to walk from Coogee to North Bondi. There was a bit of human traffic between Tamarama Bay and Bondi due to the ongoing Sculptures by the Sea exhibition but in generally there is enough space to walk leisurely. There are some benches, lookouts and every outdoor gyms along the way if one is keen.Would definitely love to come back here for a run in off-peak timings though! Highly recommend!:)"

We were staying in Coogee for a few days in the middle of this year with some friends, they recommended that we make the walk to Bondi, and have a few beers down there, it takes around 2-3 hours to walk it at a slow pace, but the views you get are incredible, rocky at some points so if you like to live dangerously the path can get good! Fantastic graveyard to walk past, which has this surreal setting, when you get to the end and you can see Bondi, the view is breathtaking, you can see the long sandy beaches and the beautiful blue ocean combined, Just the Best views in Sydney by a long way A+++"

The beaches themselves are not extremely large but they are visually unique and interesting with beautiful rocky cliffs, green pastures, great sand and of course that turquoise Pacific water. The walk is really well manicured so it is simple to follow with neat steps and hand rails along the way. It is also a great workout - you will walk and climb a lot and depending on the temperature it can feel pretty vigorous. When I was there the \"Sculptures by the Sea\" exhibition was on so we took frequent detours onto the beach to see the sculptures. As another reviewer noted these beaches draw crowds so the walk can be clogged at points, but we managed to walk around people without incident. A positive side effect of the crowds though is that you can stop and take scenic photos without bothering anyone behind you!"

It started well with great views over the ocean and the sight of many dolphins frollicking in the shallows. On the section from Bondi beach to Tamarama they are currently displaying the \"Sculptures of the Sea\" exhibition which was certainly drawing the crowds on the Saturday that I was there. The raised path close to the large Waverley cemetery was particulalry interesting - they say that this cemetery is the most scenic burial ground in the world. There is something quaint about a bowls club up on the cliffs and each beach community seemed to be doing something special in the way of events, BBQing etc. In total this walk runs over 6 km and I took ca. three hours to amble along it. It covers six beaches (with lovely names like Clovelley & Bronte) and a number of coves and bays. After a week of business meetings this was the ideal way to get a bit of exercise, explore the real coastal around Sydney and blow away a few cobwebs without getting cold."

It has great paths that are easy to navigate. For those who are fit, do one end to the other and return, for those less able, do one way or just one section. There are fountains to refill your water bottles along the way. There are plenty of spots to stop for a coffee along the way and opportunity for some great photos. My favourite time is early morning or near sunset. Take your swimmers for a dip at one of the beautiful beaches along the way. At the end of October and early November, the free annual Sculpture by the Sea is held which is worth a look."

It is indeed a pleasant walk from Coogee Beach to Bondi Junction and all the way to Bondi.Along the way, you get to see many people, young and old come here for a relaxing time. There are many clean public toilets if you need to run to the washrooms. There are also many places you can drink water for free. It is common for people lying on the grass sunbathing or reading a book or chit-chatting with friends. The birds flew freely there, not afraid of human being. Overall, the whole place has a positive vibe. The ocean is beautiful, the water is very clean, surfers are having a good time and i got to see seals playing in the water. The coast is dotted with sculptures that are cleverly crafted. I would highly recommend this place to anybody that comes to Sydney."

You get to experience a very pleasant walk at your own pace and at your own time along the picturesque coastline which incorporates some the best beaches in Sydney's eastern suburbs. Locals say whales can often be seen breaching only metres from the coastline.as they make their seasonal journeys up and down the eastern seaboard. Although there is easy access to shops and amenities along the walk it is advisable to take water with you as well as covering up with sunscreen.. Coogee Beach is a lovely place to end the walk. It is so alive and spending time there was great and we went back there several times to take in the leisurely lifestyle enjoying the beach, cafes and the local hotel which has a sociable beer garden in which to relax. I would recommend the walk and a visit to Coogee Beach to anybody holidaying in Sydney"

But once you've been there you will realise that unless you are swimming, sunbathing or playing in the park, there's not much else to do. Bondi is a bit overrated. However the walk from Bondi to Coogee is sensational.There is a wonderful walkway that follows the ocean, providing you with sensational views, wonderful clear, clean air, the smell of the sea and the sound of waves crashing. See the sun peep over the horizon saying \"Good morning Sydney, it's another wonderful day in paradise\"BUT YOU MUST GET UP EARLY TO ENJOY IT! This walk is very popular and unless you get out of bed early, you will have to navigate your way through the madding crowd. Enroute you can walk, you can stop and have a swim, you can snorkel. There are plenty of drinking fountains along the path, so no need to take loads of water. For those who love a longer walk you can go all the way from Coogee to Watson's Bay. Stop at the pub for brunch.Its a great way to spend a morning.Of course if you are an evening person, you can do the walk in the evening, again avoiding the crowds."

Can be very busy at weekends, making dodging the crowds a bit frustrating. If walking with infants, avoid taking a pram as there are plenty steps en route. Along the way a coffee stop at Tamaramma or Bronte is a sheer delight. Look out for dolphins and seasonally even whales. Recommend hats and sunscreen."

It can get a little crowded on this track on a sunny weekend, but if you head out in the morning or evening during the week there are wonderful sights all the way along the coast. In November the Sculpture by the sea is on (usually last week oct/first week nov) so worth trying to arrive during that time if you can. This is one of the great coastal walks like the Cinque Terre in Italy so do not miss it!"

There are some steps along the way. My suggestion is catch the train to Bondi Junction, then the bus to Bondi Beach. Begin the walk at the south end of Bondi Beach where Bondi Baths are. Have a drink at the bar of Bondi Icebergs where you will take in a fabulous view of the beach and all the activity, including many surfers. On the walk you will come across Tamarama, Bronte and Clovelly Beaches plus more secluded bays. Remember a hat and sunscreen. Finish the walk with a swim at Coogee Beach. Return to Bondi Junction by bus to connect with rail services. If you are lucky enough to be visiting in October/November you might catch the annual Sculptures by the Sea."

You can do the whole walk in approx. 1.5 hours (if walking only) or cut it short in Bronte or Clovelly. If you are doing it in hot weather, the beaches are at your service with all sorts of facilities. You will not only get to see #1 beach (Bondi) in the whole country for its global reputation but also see (and experience if you like) #1 and #2 roughest beaches in the whole country with their dangerous rips and current (Bronte and Tamarama respectively). If you don't like waves or rough surf or even deal with sand, you can still swim and/snorkel in crystal clear waters of Clovelly, and sunbath on warm concrete on both sides of the beach (personally my favourite). The aquatic reserve inhabits plenty of species of fish including a few big resident groupers. You can pack your own lunch or nibble on what cafes and kiosks around have to offer.A must do walk and experience for anyone who's in Sydney even for a day or two."

I do this walk for exercise once a week - Coogee to Bondi and then back again - which takes a bit over two hours at a fast walk.Really you can take as long as you want - but don't attempt it one way in less than 90 minutes unless you really are just doing it for the exercise.Personally I think the views unfold better walking from Coogee to Bondi than the other way - but there is not much in it!Is it hard to follow the path? Not at all - just keep close to the sea and its obvious where to go. Sometimes it dips inland through a park - but not very far. In summer its much better early morning or late afternoon once the sea breeze has come up and cooled things down. In winter its the opposite - middle of the day is best.There are lots of steps - some quite steep -so if mobility is an issue this is not for you. As \"easy\" section if you are time constrained is Bondi to Bronte - which is less than half way.Parts of the walk are quite elevated and if its whale migration season then there is a chance of spotting one or a few - they rarely come in any closer than a few km's offshore but even so its an awesome sight. How will you know? Don't worry plenty of people will be standing around pointing. Is it every day? No - but its common enough that the locals glance and then keep walking.On the way Bronte is renowned for lots of cafes (opposite the park), there is a good pub at Clovelly and lots of cafes and bars at Coogee.If you want to swim - the first two beaches you come to - Tamarrama and Bronte are both picturesque but dangerous for the inexperienced - stick between the flags. Clovelly is really an enclosed bay rather than a beach and generally calm. Coogee itself does not have a big surf, but does have a dangerous shore break sometimes - again stick between the flags.Finally if you are super ambitious the walk keeps going onwards from Coogee - just keep following the path. You can get to Maroubra (another 30 minutes) but about half way there the path takes a detour via some suburban streets that is not well signposted and then you have to rock hop around Lurline Bay (not advisable at high tide with a rough surf)."

Bring your cossie, there is a great sea pool/swimming beach at Clovelly in particular. Best eating is at Bronte, or at the end in Coogee. A tip - end in Clovelly, walk up the hill to the village to eat at the fantastic Darley street bistro (book a table), and then get the 339 back to central!"

Parking at Gordon's Bay could be difficult in peak times. Definitely worth the effort though."

Bronte also has nice cubicles for under cover lunch in a big park by the beach.. If you can walk in (October I think) you will see the famous sculptures by the sea which is amazing and features hundreds of modern sculptures along the walk// Tamarama beach is a good stop along this walk.. Just after you leave Bondi and reach the top you will have a great view from south bondi across the whole beach, this area was where gun turrets were erected originally for the russian scare in early 1900's and then the Japanese in WW2.. Bronte has a good bus service back to city & Bondi Junction..Enjoy this is a classic.."

Coogee is super relaxed and sets the tone for your walk, We had a great great meal at the Pavilion restaurant to fuel us before we set off (will talk about that later). The views along the cliff tops are amazing, it's a 2hr walk including all the time we stopped for photo's which was a lot. Give yourself time and just take in the amzing sights and sound of the waves crashing againt cliffs beneath you. When you finally see Bondi as you turn the corner atop a super windy cliff it will take your breath away, its truly amazing, and as you walk pass the iceberg swimming club you will see the coolest swimming pool ever set right next to the sea with the waves lapping in. Awesome!!!"

I went to Clovelly Beach and decided to walk along the shore and the small path which actually didn't know where it gonna lead me to. But luckily I decided to do it. It was a lovely mid day where the sun was shining not too bright where you might get a sunburn or something. Walked pass the cemetery where you can see white tombstones facing the ocean and you can see the cliffs and ocean beneath your feet. The breeze blows your face, quiet place, not too much noises like you can find in the city life. It was a nice feeling when you can see the ocean and how blue it is. I recommend you to do this and it can consider as an exercise with a bonus of the coastal view :)Happy exploring ^__^But make sure before doing it, go to the restroom to do your \"stuff\" and have foods and water in your bag (just incase)."

I'm a Bondi local with no affiliation with the exhibition, so I thought I'd post a little information about this imminent event based on my experiences : I've visited the exhibition the last several years and it is always great.In 2014 Sculpture by the Sea will run from 23 October to 9 November with open-air exhibits all along the Bondi to Tamarama section of the Bondi to Coogee coastal walk as well as more sculptures in Marks Park above the South Bondi headland.This is a fantastic experience and adds a special dimension to this already spectacular walk. The sculptures are a range of sizes and materials and are placed sympathetically/humorously/synergistically in the natural setting including several on Tamarama Beach. In 2013 the two-tonne, 1.5-metre diameter, transparent, water-filled acrylic sphere \"Horizon\" near Tamarama surf life saving club was amazing!Be warned that it will be extremely crowded during the weekends so a more relaxed experience can be had during the week or very early on the weekend. Best starting point is the southern end of Bondi Beach in Notts Avenue where you can buy an official guide. In my opinion the path is not really suited to prams or strollers when it's crowded. Hot tips for an enjoyable outing: - catch public transport to Bondi Beach as parking will be difficult- travel light but bring a hat, sunscreen, water, camera and patience- keep left on the path- smile !Google Sculpture by the Sea for more details."

On a crowded Sunday, the paved path is fairly crowed, but there are many opportunities to sit on benches, the laws, or the beach and people watch.There's plenty of water fountains and bathrooms along the way, as well as many opportunities for eating.It tends to get pretty crowded at Bondi, and getting a cab back to your hotel can be a bit of a challenge (one we solved by walking back - up a hill - to a spot above Bondi where the cabs seemed more plentifyl).Bring your camera and be ready to shoot some spectacular, picture post-card views."

Several places to stop for rest room breaks and places along the way to re-fill a water bottle. don't forget your camera, the views are amazing.I had planned to take a cab from hotel in the CBD, but my hotel suggested the bus - which was very easy and cheap. And it was easy to find a bus headed back to Circular Quay once I reached Bondi. Lots of weekend beach goers on the bus. If you're doing the whole thing I would suggest comfortable shoes.

If you are fortunate enough to pick a day with nice weather it will be the highlight of your Sydney visit.You can have breakfast in Bondi and finish with lunch on the beach in Coogee. We were lucky enough to spot a dolphin frolicking while passing one of the smaller beaches along the walk."

Takes about an hour each way and there are some steep steps at the Coogee end which are a good work out on the way back. It's beautiful on a sunny Spring day, can be a bit windy at times but always gorgeous views. Best during the week as can get really busy on weekends. Take sunscreen!"

To add to the stunning beaches, views and rock pools there was big pod of whales showing of their tricks not far from the coast.This is a must do walk for everyone who visits Sydney.

There are several beaches along the way if you would like to get some sun or swim a little. It's somewhat hilly, so I would recommend a bottle of water.

You get to see a bunch of more laid back 'locals' suburbs and also the opportunity to spot the rich and famous as its a favourite activity for local and visiting celebs alike. You'll pass what must be the most scenic cemetery in the world and maybe get to see whales and dolphins along the way.We went with our 5 year old and at 6km it could be a bit far. But with a bit of imagination there is plenty to keep them interested along the way (and the promise of an ice cream at the end helps!)"

Don't just stop there - the walk along the cliffs to Coogee is well worth it. Sandstone cliffs drop into the ocean, waves crash into the shore, and around each headland is a beach as nice as Bondi and often clearer and more space. Surfers have four beaches to choose from, Bondi, Tamarama, Bronte and Coogee, all with their own surf conditions. For the fit, try running, there are enough hills and steps to challenge, and the track is frequented by locals. for the culture buffs, try the walk in October to coincide with Sculpture by the Sea, when the walk between Bondi and Tamarama is dotted with sculptures by local and international artists presenting works of whimsy and beauty. On a winters' day it's bluff and blustery, on a summer's day, take your \"togs\" swimming costume and cool off at any stage on one of the beaches - but beware of the rips if you're not experienced; many an innocent has needed to be rescued because they went swimming away from the flags."

By the time we reached Bronte it was twilight so we had to call it a day and decided to come another day for the rest of the walk.

They brought our little dog a bowl of water and she made lots of friends :-) you can't beat the feel of the sea crashing onto the rocks, the amazing little sandy beaches, and the surprising green down to the water in places. Walking back when there was a break in the rain we stopped at a very small Tamarama beach (with a growing crowd) to watch a love struck dude scratch a big \"marry me\" in the sand...then a young lady walked around the cliff top and looked down - and the whole beach erupted in cheering and clapping as she ran down the stairs, across the grass, onto the sand and the big hug :-)And then....without a word of a lie - a rainbow.

Best way to do it - plan a little ahead - check the weather forecast a night before for the next morning. Start the walk from Coogee instead of bondi (the sign boards at coogee will get you on the walking trail)Start the walk around 9 ish after a little morning snack so that you reach bondi just in time for brunch. Also, bondi has some great options for food, hence the advantage of doing it from coogee to bondi.I ate my lunch at this really well located cafe in the icebergs club, called the icebergs terrace cafe. The food tasted even better after the coastal walk, and I would definitely recommend that place!!"

Be sure to arm yourself with water, but if you forget, there are lots of charming coffee shops en route. Heading out of Bondi there is a bit of a climb, but quite manageable. You will go past the Bondi sea pool there, where you will see swimmers enjoying the experience of ocean water in a pool environment, and maybe enjoy a swim yourself! The more ragged parts of the walk are fenced off for safety, but there are plenty of places where you can walk right along the cliff top. Sturdy shoes are a good idea. There are often runners doing their thing along the path, but there's plenty of room.The next bay is Tamarama, and it's easy to stop for a paddle here as well. The path continues past the surf club and on the Bronte. Bronte is a good spot for a snack or a coffee. A few iinteresting shops there too. Coming out of Bronte you walk past the Waverley cemetery, a wonderful last resting place with a fantastic view. Throughout the walk there are several areas with steps, but not too many. Obey the road rules and keep left to avoid bumps and collisions! Clovelly Beach, like the others on the path, provides an opportunity for an ocean swim. As always, obey the surf life-savers to be safe. Again coffee shops! Arriving at Coogee, you will be surprised at how quickly the time has passed, unless you stopped at every bay, as I did! Allow between 3 and 6 hours, depending how many photos you take of the outstanding scenery, and how many shopping stops you make!If you run short of time, there are buses from each bay for a quick getaway, but it is such a nice part of Sydney, that you probably want to make a day of it anyway.

The past few weeks have had rare sunny days but on this one the sky was a bright sunny blue and the sea reflecting the calm. perfect day for Bondi to Coogee especially since its a week day. If you take this path on weekends, especially in summer, you will need to negotiate your way past the thousands that flock to take advantage of fresh air, wonderful views and exercise. Try to visit midweek when it is less travelled.I began the path at the North end of Bondi Beach early in the morning. A level 1 km walk on the promenade of Bondi Beach will bring you to your first set of stairs to the road leading down to the beginning of the coastal track. It is possible to short cut through Icebergs and experience the panoramic and iconic view of Bondi Beach. The path meanders around, skirting a rock platform and reaches the next set of stairs at the top of which you will be able to see down the coast line and the majestic cliffs along the coast. Continue on following the path to Tamarama and stop for a drink or continue on to Bronte by either following the road or once again taking a short cut across the park at Tamarama. You can not get lost on this walk. Once you reach Bronte you have a choice of lots of great cafes or you can just sit on the beach or in the Park and rest up for the return to BondiTake sunscreen and water. There is no shade."

Joggers and runners can be quite a hazard if you're not paying attention, they duck and dive round you as if they have the right of way and can be quite rude if you don't get out of their way quickly enough. Each beach stop has a cafe with reasonably priced food and drinks and the bus runs along the coast so if you tire, you can always jump on one of those.

It did take a little effort to get here as I didn't have a car, but the bus/train schedule was convenient from downtown, and all told was no more than 30 min via public transport. The walk itself is fantastic, a little hilly in places, but completely paved. I got a map from the visitor's center, and planned to do it all the way to Coogee, but you can go as little or as far as you like. I'm not sure you would want to do this walk/hike with a stroller - it's very walkable for all types of folks, but the path is along the coast, so you have narrow parts, steps and some hills. I ran all the way to Coogee which is probably one of the most beautiful, scenic runs I've ever done anywhere, and then I walked back to Bondi. I spent all day on the path and opted not to shop in town - although there are plenty of shops and restaurants too. The path has many wonderful look outs and benches on which to just enjoy the views and take pictures. At many sections, you can walk onto the rocks where the waves crash right around you fairly close up. Be careful. I happened to visit on a blustery day, which was cloudy and dark (winter time in July), and this provided incredible wave activity. Take your best camera with the extra lenses. You just feel the power of the ocean. Stunning scenery. I'd like to come back in the summer and spend more time on the beach itself, and in the town shopping. Don't miss this."

I did the walk from Bondi to Coogee though i feel the other way round would have been better,so that once you finish the walk you have more eatouts and options at Bondi. There is not much shade through out the walk . So a hat/cap would be a good idea ..."

Getting to Bondi Beach, and back from Coogee Beach on public transport from central Sydney was extremely easy - the signs at the Bondi Junction train station for the bus could not have been bigger!The paths are very well maintained, and the sections without steps would be fine with a buggy, wheelchair or walking difficulties - when the directions say steep stairs though they mean it, the ones near the end are very steep.We had a grey day for our walk, so the views were good but not as beautiful as blue skies & sea and sun would have made them. The rocks though are spectacular whatever the weather.You can divert off the path to get food & drink in the villages you pass by but as it's a long walk it's still a good idea to take some water with you. We took a picnic and stopped in one of the many beach-side parks along the way."

Approx 6km in each direction, it takes you on pathway passed 4 beautiful white sand beaches, 2 small rocky bays and a graveyard. One small section is on a road but its usually not too busy. If you are staying in CBD, its only a short bus ride to either Coogee or Bondi to start the walk. You can also continue the walk passed Coogee and head further south to Maroubra however there are some road passages to negotiate. Plan to do it midweek, after the dog walkers and the joggers have finished from about 8am otherwise you will have to move over all the time to let them pass. On weekends the path can be very busy."

Watch surfers duck and dive off the rock pool into the swell.It is not legal to drink Alcoholic beverages in public, but a paper bag covered bottle of wine or beer, discretely enjoyed with your F&C is just almost too perfect a Sydney casual lunch.(Stay away from iconic Doyles it is a rip off)Walk it all off as you hike back around the cliff faces and re-enjoy the sculpture.Do Not attempt this on a weekend!Go week days late morning so you arrive at Bronte hungry for lunch. The only other time is late afternoon, being mindful of joggers but well worth it for watching the long shadows start across water, beach and sculptures.(Wear sun screen on your nose and lips, the rest of you is going to tan just by walking and being outside.)"

There had been a bit of rain and it was fairly chilly and very dull when we set out from Bondi Beach at 1100 on a Saturday.The unattractive weather kept the crowds away so there were not too many doing the coastal walk.I especially enjoyed the heathlands with their boardwalk. The coastal views were terrific while even on a dull day, some of the quieter sea near rocks was almost turquoise in colour - by no means as visually stunning as on many Filipino white sand islands such as Malapascua off Cebu Island, or Boracay - but quite impressive nonetheless.There are many steps to climb along the way but that adds to the fun. There are toilets about every 1.5 to two kilometres which is very good. The rocks throw up unexpected surprises such as exposed white as a feature to photograph.Later, walking around Coogee, I came across a kookaburra on an electric wire. One wouldn't normally see that in Melbourne.I used a MyMulti2 weekly to get around: train to Bondi Junction, bus to Bondi Beach then back from Coogee."

If you take the train to Bondi Junction, hop a bus to Bondi beach other wise its a fair walk before you even start the coastal walk. The beaches on the walk were mostly empty in late July but there were many people walking and running on the path, looks like a great place to exercise. The coast was beautiful, the blues in the water and green of rocks with algae was a great contrast. Many houses along the path were nice to look at. We saw some whales as we were alerted by the presence of whale watching boats off the coast. It must be great to live near by and have this beautiful place to walk and run on. The path was generally in good shape and wide, only occasional unmarked dead ends that were easy to back track on and figure out the correct path. Prepare for some stairs, its good hike."

We were a little nervous of being on the path once it was dark as there is no street lighting, but with lots people around and never being too far from human habitation our fears were unfounded. Stunning views and charming little beaches on the way."

There were many great views along the way. The entire walk is on sidewalk with some stairs, mostly climbing up from Bondi. Bring your sunscreen.You take the 333 bus from the CBD. You need to buy a prepaid ticket, which are available at most convenience stores. You cannot buy a ticket on the bus.

My friend and I did the coastal walk from Coogee beach to Bondi, the other way, as our direct bus from our B and B ended in Coogee.I quite liked ending in Bondi as we got to reward ourselves with a great lunch, gazing out at the famous Bondi beach!Since there wasn't much going on during winter at Bondi itself, this walk really added to the experience.There isn't much signage or maps of the coastal walk at Coogee, which threw us off. But I looked at the Lonely Planet guide book and figured if we hugged the coast, we'll be fine! The walk isn't always exactly hugging the coast so don't be thrown off if you have to walk inland on the pavement, now and then.Along the way it's all very urban with public restrooms and cafes. People are all around so it's very easy to do the walk on your own."

The walk takes you past an outdoor cliff side swimming pool which is filled with sea water and occasionally the waves crash over the wall and fill up the pool. People are once again swimming lengths and children are taking their swimming lessons there and it is such a joy to watch. The views from the cliff walk are amazing and you pass lovely coves. It is lovely to take it easy and just stop for a tea in the lovely little cafes along the way. A long but lovely and enjoyable walk and definitely recommended."

I'm in my 60's and found this to be a very enjoyable day with breathtaking views of the coast, great coffee shops and cafes on the walk.We stopped at Tamarama Beach on the way back for a swim\u2026(I also do some ocean swimming as well as walking) but this is not a safe beach. Coogee or Bondi are much better if you want a swim. The people walking the same walk are all friendly and it is not a hard walk at all.Another spectacular walk to do while in Sydney is Taronga Zoo to Balmoral. Wow!!! Each time the track took a turn the view, you would think, could not get any better but it did. With each turn in the track my jaw dropped further. What a beautiful city we have in \"Sydney\". It doesn't get any better. When you arrive at Balmoral Beach that will blow your mind also, how lovely. Great restaurants, cafes, coffee shops and any thing else you heart desires.Julie RP.S.

We started this walk around 3pm during winter. bondi is just a ashort train and bus trip ceom Sydney central and this Costal walk is definitely a must do for those spending a few days in Sydney!Our walk took us from Bondi - Tamarama - Bronte - Clovelly - Coogee. I would think that it's even better when you do it in warmer months as I would've really wanted to take a dip at the beaches as we walked along. You could easily spend a day doing this if you hang out in one beach before moving onto the next! though I'd advice to bring a good wind breaker if you plan to do it in Winter as the ocean winds get really chilly (in the afternoon anyway).The paths are paved, with some long slopes but easy enough if you're not planning to run it. It was pretty crowded with families and runners alike on a Saturday noon. There are enough toilets, food places on most beaches. Dont forget to bring a beach towel!"

Beautiful scenery and stunning views make this really worthwhile. If you can avoid having to find car park, it's better as most of Bondi has a 2 hour car parking limit so not very practical - this walk is fairly long (I think roughly 5-6kms) with a few steps along the way. If you can, pick a day outside the weekend as you will avoid lots of dogs/ runners and other people who make this path extremely busy. I highly recommend doing it when it's the Sculpture by the Sea expo so you can make the most of seeing the sculptures (although if you just want do do a straight walk avoid that time of the year as the crowds will be massive!)"

My husband and I were staying in Sydney CBD, so we got the Bondi special return train ticket, which gives you a train to Bondi Junction and a bus to Bondi Beach. When we got to Bondi Junction we got a bus to Coogee instead. All buses are prepaid and we bought a ticket from a 7-ll in the city. You need one for 3 - 5 sections. We set out from Coogee on the walk. It was a beautiful sunny but cool day - perfect walking weather. The walk winds around the coastline - up and down cliffs and around the small coves that dot the coast. It's a walk of about 6 kilometres in all and I think you'd need a certain level of fitness. It wouldn't suit those who can't handle stairs as at the Bondi end there are quite a few that some people seemed to be having difficulty with. I'm also not sure how you'd get on with a stroller the whole length. The views are stunning. At certain points there were groups of people staring out to sea, whale watching. If you're lucky and patient you may see some at this time of the year.The communities around the coves look amazing and provide something else to look at as you wind your way along. Doing the walk from Coogee to Bondi leaves you at Bondi at the end, which has a large selection of eateries in which to rest your weary feet. From Bondi you can use your ticket to get the bus and train back to the CBD. This walk was one of the highlights of our trip to Sydney."

That said, you could just walk from Bondi to the next bay at Tamarama Beach if you don't want to do a long walk. Our family (mum, dad, teen boys 12 & 15) walked from Bondi to Coogee on a beautiful (if slightly windy) Sunday morning. This is a very popular walk on Sunday mornings! We started late morning, the 6km took us at least 2hrs, and it felt a lot further than 6kms! You start the walk at Bondi Beach (I was stunned at what a beautiful beach it is, the sand is so fine and white, no wonder it's popular) near Icebergs Swimming Club and follow a winding path along the coastline with spectacular views (very bracing in parts as it was quite windy). After Bondi, you walk past Tamarama Beach (my favourite, cute and great caf\u00e9 kiosk), Bronte Beach, Clovelly Beach, and finally arrive at Coogee Beach. I particularly enjoyed the boardwalk section alongside the very old Waverley Cemetery and overlooking the ocean.By the time we got to Clovelly Beach, our teenage boys were complaining \"How much further?\" but they soldiered on and I felt quite a sense of achievement when we got to the Coogee Foreshore - hooray! Lunch at Yeeros Caf\u00e9 overlooking the foreshore area was delicious - authentic Greek yeeros (souvlakis) - and it was very pleasant sitting in the undercover outdoor area. My advice is to do this walk on weekdays if possible as it is very popular on weekends with both walkers and runners. I actually didn't mind the 'busyness' but some might find it annoying or less than tranquil."

The trail was perfectly maintained the entire way with steps and handrails where needed. It remained right on the edge of the cliff or along the beach almost entirely, It was an easy walk even for us seniors. I would recommened it highly. Se were staying in Sydney and were able to get to and fro the hike on the local bus."

Tamarama and Bronte also boast beautiful beaches and coffee shops with lovely views. We walked from Coogee to Bondi having to shelter from the rain at Clovelly for 15 minutes. One highlight was the cemetery perched on the cliff with the residents occupying some of the most expensive real estate on the coast. The path ranged from concrete steps and paths to steps and boardwalks. Lots of walkers and joggers added to the experience."

Trust me, the sights are so beautiful, you'll never feel tired. I took 3 hours to cover the entire stretch but only because I spent 45 mins sitting on a vertical cliff face, soaking in the sights, the calm and the serenity.

I went on a weekday and there certainly was a number of users but plenty of time for finding your own personal space. absolutely must do.

This walk is crazy amazing and I recommend doing it both from Bondi Beach to Coogee and then Coogee to Bondi Beach on another day. The views are stunning especially on a clear blue day \u2013 the shades of blues in the water marrying with the blues in the sky is breathtaking. Then you look towards the land and be amazed by its rock formation \u2013 it is like natures priceless art. You can also smell the ocean and the sounds of the waves are calming and soothing. It takes about 2 hours one way.Check the bus timetable and bus stops on the Internet and plan your trip. http://www.sydneybuses.info/routes/timetables-route-mapshttp://www.transportnsw.infoAs you walk, you will pass the following beaches \u2013 all of which are uniquely beautiful:Bondi BeachTamaramaBronte BeachClovellyCoogee BeachStop for a swim, if that\u2019s your thing, however beware of the rip current, especially if you are not a strong swimmer. A piece of advise to people coming from the topics - the water is cold even on a hot day. It is so refreshing though.There are places for you to sit and relax or even mediate. Plan your trip such that you have a meal at Bondi Beach or Coogee Beach to catch a breath, soak up the views and top up on your energy levels before you head back to your hotel. Or you could take a break halfway at Bronte Beach. There are pretty nice cafes and eateries along these beaches.I am bias with this attraction because of all the things I have done \u2013 the Bondi to Coogee Beach Coastal Walk is one of my favourites.

When visitors come to Sydney then this is one of the best things to do and most would agree it's on the top 5 walks you can do in Sydney.Start in iconic Bondi and head south along the coastal path and you'll be treated to some stunning ocean views and pass some fantastic swimming pools and people performing surfing stunts for your viewing pleasure.Check out Bondi icebergs which has a great pool for public use which include the use of a sauna and has a small cafe downstairs. In the middle section this place has a club which you can sign yourself in for free (if you live further than 5km away) and get a balcony seat at the best view of bondi beach and surfers and the 50m pool below bar none!The walk takes in various beaches - Tamarama (or Glamarama as the locals call it because many of the 'beautiful' people like to hang out here) - This has just been renovated with a new cafe and park with childrens play area and free bbq facilities!Next beach along is Bronte which is like a mini Bondi with a smaller arc of sand and a more cosy feel. This has a great park with childrens train and play area with coin operated bbq facilities too.Try out one of the 10 cafe options behind the park too - they are all pretty good since they have to compete for the custom but they have different owners and styles.At the south head of Bronte is the fantastic ocean pool. WARNING - if you walk past this pool you're going the wrong way for the coastal walk since it leads to a dead end! However it's a great diversion and you just have to backtrack to the stairs near the changing rooms.Up the hill you'll see a cementary in the distance as you head to Gordons Bay and Coogee. There's now a metal coastal walkway ocean side which means you don't have to be up close and personal to the stark reminder that life is short. Enjoy life and walk on by to Gordans bay popular with snorkelists and scuba divers before you come around the headland to the fantastic Coogee beach with numerous eating and drinking options - it's like the slightly smaller brother of Bondi beach. It's Icebergs swimming pool is called 'Wylie's baths' and although it doesn't have the glamour of icebergs it has it's own charm which is more secluded and hence less well known."

There's training stations if you feel like getting down and sweaty, or outcrops to sit upon and soak up the views. If crowds are really not your thing, go on a weekday. But, for my money, if it's a one time only adventure, go on a weekend and watch the locals strut their stuff. There possibly isn't a better place for people watching!"

After Marks Park comes Hunter Park and then the edge of Bondi Beach can be seen. Before reaching it you pass the Bondi Icebergs swimming club pool. Fascinating history of the area. Then the broad sweep of the scimitar shaped Bondi and the famous beach. All along the route are water stations. Not just to drink from but to fill your water bottle too. Great cafes are available. Each beach has its own lifeguards and of course the famous Bondi Rescue are in evidence. We watched while an episode of the programme was being filmed. The great thing is the many people from all over that you meet and chat to. Everyone has a reason to be at Bondi. There are busses to and from each beach if that is what you want.

Start out on your walk from Bondi Icebergs watching the swimmers in the sea pool doing their laps.The swimmers are year round so even on the chilliest days they are there to be seen. continue up the path, keeping left to allow the joggers and fast walkers to pass. the coast line is beautiful and the rock formations are great. after 15 minutes you will reach Tamarama Beach, either walk down the steps and cross the sand to the other side if the beach is relatively clear. If not take the high path as the beach can get very crowded on nice days. This beach is also called Glamarama so the view from on high can be spectacular.Keep walking and the next beach you come to is Bronte. A beautiful inlet with a great park for a picnic or cross the road and get a fresh juice or coffee Continue on the coast you come to Waverly cemetery. This is a beautiful cemetery with the best views in sydney. Recently renovated take a while to walk around and discover who is buried there.Continue on round the corner to Clovelly, very much a family beach with protected areas for light swimming.keep on and you come to Coogee. After your walk you deserve a cold beverage in the beer garden of the Coogee Bay Hotel and watch the holiday crowds wander by."

If you do one walk while in Sydney, this is it!It is frequented by tourists and locals daily of all levels of fitness and ages - busier on weekends. There are lockers at the South Bondi lifesaving club for hire if you need - or at the various other clubs along the way. Bondi Beach to Coogee Beach and back jogging and walking will take you 2 hours.The order of the beaches is:- Bondi (Sydney's most famous beach with cafes with great people watching - South Bondi has the famous Icebergs Restaurant and Bar, stunning ocean pools and North Bondi with is more a family scene with smaller ocean pool and restaurants and cafes overlooking it),- Tamarama (which is a smaller boutique beach with a life saving club and a lovely cafe and kids playground), - Bronte (a 'cousin' beach to Bondi with lots of lovely cafes facing it, ocean baths, a life saving club),- Clovelly (which is a little cove that's family friendly with a shaded pavilion, cafe, life saving club and ocean pool), - Gordon's Bay (a very small bay dotted with little row boats on the beach), and - Coogee (another stunning larger beach with all the services).Take a hat, sunscreen, comfortable shoes or sneakers and enjoy the fresh air, and stunning cliff and beach scenery. Recommended for couples wanting a romantic walk, active families, travelling friends or solo. If with young children you may have to carry then for some of the steps - in between Bondi and Tamarama there's Marks Park with amazing views but also a huge grassed area for little ones to run around and a kids playground to one side - note that it is also a dog park meaning that dogs are allowed to be off the leash but the dogs are friendly ones and are too busy running around.If you're after a shorter walk I recommend Bondi to Tamarama or Bronte.If you need wheelchair access I recommend the beach promenades at Bondi or Coogee - great people watching and fresh sea air.Just do it! It'll cost you nothing and you'll remember it forever!"

The views across the sea are amazing, and there are ample opportunities to climb down some easy rock formations and dip your feet in the water.I did get worried on one occasion when the trail became more of a pathway through grassland, where people take their dogs for walks, and they are not on leads.

We started out taking in the beach and looking around the bather's facilities. Next we walked along the beach toward the sidewalk that would lead us on the walk to Coogee. I could see this amazing looking pool in the distance and I wanted to go check it out. It was the Bondi Icebergs pool. We paid the $5 admission and decided to go in and check things out. We thought ahead and brought our swim suits and towels. We found the changing rooms and put our suits on. We went down and took the plunge into the cold water of the largest pool. We swam a few laps and then went and hung out in the lane that is closest to the ocean where the waves would smash into the side and come falling into the pool. It was awesome! We then showered off the salt water and sat in the sauna for a bit. After we were good and relaxed we showered again and put our things in a locker so that we could continue the walk to Coogee, which picked up right outside of the Icebergs. It was a beautiful scenic walk. The views were breathtaking. There is a bit of stair climbing and walking up steep sidewalks so be prepared for that. Not ideal for folks with mobility problems nor for small children. Active kids with lots of energy will have a blast! It was all paved and very safe. On our return trip we stopped again at the Icebergs to get out stuff (readmittance is free) and to eat a bite at the cafe inside. All the while we enjoyed the beautiful fresh sea air and the billion dollar views. Just above Bondi, along the street, there are tons of cafes, shops restaurants. This was one of my favorite days in Sydney and this should NOT be missed!"

At Bronte it is suggested you try one of the many food shops, great smoothies. A favourite stop of mine, you can see the sea from the shops and sometimes dolphins or whales pass by. The next stop is Clovelly a safe still water swimming spot, you could take lunch at the hotel. Following that is Thompsons (sometimes called Gordon's) Bay a quiet scuber diving spot and finally arrive at Coogee. There is a substantial beach shopping area. From there you can catch a bus to Oxford Street at Taylor Square then catch a Bondi Beach bus back to Bondi if that's where you're staying."

Given the duration of the walk, I chose to take the bus back to Bondi, where I was staying. During the weekdays, the bus only goes to Bondi Junction, which requires a connection (380 or 333) if you're going to Bondi beach. During the weekends, there is direct bus service back to Bondi beach if you decide not to make the trek back along the trail. As far as difficulty is concerned, it's a moderate walk. There are a few areas where the steps can be quite steep, though there are numerous benches located along the route for those need a little time to rest an relax. "

I enjoyed wandering around the Cemetary that takes up acres of prime coastal land, giving the 'residents' the best views in the world! I stopped to watch swimmers in the seawater lap-pool and was impressed by the exercise equipment provided along the way (near the beginning). But the best was arriving at Coogee and finding a very reasonably priced caf\u00e9 with delicious food right at the end of the walk. There's also a shop that sells delicious ice cream, right next door, to that was lunch sorted - bought as takeaways and eaten overlooking Coogee Beach from the grassy hillside.What a satisfying morning!

Walk was easy to moderate in some sections..we started with brunch in Bondi, completed the walk over a few hours stopping for photos numerous times and went for a beverage in Coogee upon completion. An really enjoyable way to spend a day in Sydney!"

We started mid-morning, stopped at the Bronte cafe strip for excellent coffee and stopped at coogee for water and a breather before repeating the walk back to Bondi for lunch. Weather was great, 25 and sunny, and the only negative was the runners - some of whom think they own the paths and everyone should move for them.Just over two hours each way for us but stops for viewing the sites and coffee could add another hour.One of the best things to do in Sydney and free."

This is a really really nice walk, it isn't too taxing, a little uphill but very few actual stairs to climb, what little effort it takes is far outweighed by the scenery itself, beautiful panoramas over the Pacific including a load of good angles over Bondi.Some of the beaches are nice, others are lovely but all have something of their own purpose, some very much surf orientated, other geared best for families and the odd one where it is just the place to be seen! You can go for a dip or a surf as you wish, or just sand hop and top your tan up a little at each one. There are plenty of toilets and water fountains on the way so bring a bottle and keep hydrated.Ideally do it in nice weather (of course) but also I'd do it during the week if possible, Bondi isn't so packed and you have fewer people crowding to get the best views of the vista."

Great for people watching, photo shoots, landscape artists to paint and bird watchers to check out. Dogs of all sizes love this playground as much as do the children. It is so close with easy public transit access and all amenities surrounding it. The perfect mix of a resort with city life. Bring a picnic, a bottle of wine and find a cave or tree for shelter. Enjoy the public pools for safe laps or try the waves for surfing. Lots if ice cream stands too."

It's not just a plain path, sometimes it's rocks, sometimes steps, sometimes almost seems to disappear and then reemerges a few meters away. There are lots of special little beaches to discover along the way. You could easily stop for a dip during the walk. The cemetery on the sea cliffs when about 3/4 the way to Bondi is a sight t see.

The views are awesome, perhaps does help motivate the runner to complete the distance.If you're not exercising, taking this walk is still worth while and there are ample of opportunities for picture taking. Along the way, there are also informative boards regarding the history of the place, local conservation efforts, flora & fauna etc.In the event you are tired or short of time, you don't have to complete the whole distance (about 6km long). Just take one of the many exits and you are free to head back home (via public transport) or head to the shops nearby for a cuppa.Don't forget your sunscreen, sunglasses, a cap/hat and an umbrella/raincoat in case it rains.For more things to do in Sydney, visit my blog Lyn, Life Explorer (http://arazlin.blogspot.com.au/)"

You know your alive when you are walking/ running Bondi to Coogee, The sun is shinning (you hope) beautiful views as far as you can see and a Cemetary thrown in the jagged coast line. Weather you are a social walker, jogger/ runner or a photographer this is a great walk with many points of interest along the way. One major piece of advice, if its a lot of people or runners you are not keen of then walk it out of busy periods because this can at times take over some of the paths. Once at Coogee you can either have a swim or enjoy some food at one of the many cafes."

I managed to catch views of dolphins in the sea. Bring your swimmers as there are wonderful rock pools to dip in if you feel too hot. Unfortunately, it was too rainy for me to jump into the pool as there aren't any lockers so I didn't want my bag to get soaked.Stop by the cemetery to look at tombstones that date back to the 1920s. I thought it might be creepy to walk by a cemetery but when I got in, it ignited more of my curiosity then fear.Bring your camera and be prepared to snap plenty of superb pictures along the whole walk."

The morning I woke up & it was a gloomy rainy day :( I still decided to go on and do this walk. I was staying in CBD and took the train to Bondi. Then a bus ride (10 mins) from the station. Luckily, it was only a drizzle. The coastal walk is probably a two hour walk, I was glad that it wasn't sunny :) The weather was amazing. Do wear walking shoes because it is really a very long walk. There are loads of places where you can stop and just admire nature. One of the most beautiful pools that I have seen is on the way, where sea water comes in to fill in the pool. Unfortunately, I could not get into it, but I am sure, on my next trip, I would do this walk only for this beautiful swimming pool. Further, there are few restaurants where you can decide to eat. Before you reach Coogee, you would cross a cemetery (one of the biggest I have seen) and it is by the coast. It is a tiring walk, but one of the most beautiful walks I have done. There are great places to eat in Coogee making the walk a memorable one."

It's a very relaxing walk, it's mostly flat or downhill so not very strenuous, so it can be done in flip flops. There is a nice breeze along the water as well, but be careful with the sun as it's quite strong - so slap on lots of sunscreen. It's possible to stop and swim at every beach along the way, and there are tons of little shops and restaurants where one can have a meal or coffee and relax before continuing on. Some beaches are better than others for swimming - strong currents make swimming in some places quite a challenge, so you may see lots of surfers instead. Still, there is plenty of space on the sand to lay down and enjoy the scenery before continuing on the walk. This is a must do on any visit to Sydney"

            "review": "Coogee to Bondi. This is a very scenic walk and well worth the effort. We took bus 373 from Circular Quay to Coogee Beach. The bus dropped us off right at the beach. Although several people have said that you can do the walk in 1-1/2 hours, we took our time and spent over 3 hours on the walk. We stopped several times to enjoy the views. There were also a number of places to have a picnic, which I highly recommend. There are restroom facilities and water fountains at each of the beaches. I really believe that this walk is worth a little extra time.We did the walk on a weekday, so there weren't as many people on the path as there might have been on the weekend. There was a light mist in the morning with overcast skies the rest of the day. But that all worked in our favor because there aren't many shady places to protect you on a hot sunny day.Even on the weekday there were plenty of joggers, so on the narrower sections of the path we spent a lot of time trying to stay out of their way.Although the path isn't extremely long (6 km or about 3.5 miles), it does have some steep sections.After we had walked to Bondi Beach, we took bus 380 to Watsons Bay for a ferry ride back to Circular Quay. Be careful about the ferry from Watsons Bay. It doesn't operate very frequently (about once per hour) and the last ferry leaves at 16:45 (weekdays). They run later on the weekends. But there are several places at Watsons Bay to sit and have a drink or a meal while you wait for the ferry."

We visited Sydney in July, mid winter, when the usual beach activities were not on offer, but we wanted our two kids, ages 5 & 7, to experience the spectacular beaches somehow. I had lived in New Zealand and had visited Sydney several times, and my husband had attended New South Wales uni in Coogee, so we had seen the usual tourist attractions many times over. We stayed in Coogee and started the walk from there. The girls were thrilled to walk along the paved path, and we couldn't get over the jaw-dropping views of the raging winter surf. The path is varied, we went through a graveyard and marveled at the statues and monuments, stopped for ice cream at Bronte, gawked at surfers riding huge waves at another beach, walked up and down steel stairways bolted to the cliff sides. At each of the five beaches along the way, there are facilities and usually a playground. When we reached Bondi it started to rain (as it does in winter) and we took shelter under some limestone cave overhangs, where we enjoyed the pic nic we had packed , and watched the scenery, while the girls made 'cave paintings' on the limestone with the ochre-coloured water in the puddles. We waited out the rain under cover, then poked around Bondi shops, and hopped on a bus back to Coogee. I recommend this walk to all non-summer visitors, who are looking for something active, and off the beaten tourist track."

I'm from the Gold Coast, so in no way am I deprived of beautiful scenery on my morning beach walks..but there's just something different and unique about the Bondi to Coogee walk. I go on this walk every time I visit Sydney (probably five times a year on average) and I never get sick of it. There are a few steps and even I get puffed after a while but it is very enjoyable. Despite there sometimes being huge crowds on the walk, you are walking alongside the beach which is very calming. I've taken a friend's dog on the walk and he absolutely loved it...even climbing down to the little rock pools for a swim. Plenty of cafes to stop off at and I'm not sure if it's still happening but Sculptures by the Sea were pretty great! Highly recommend this walk as it is very refreshing and doing it first thing in the morning is a great start to the day!"

Our last day in Sydney, so after 4 weeks of eating and drinking what better way is there to endeavour to get into shape for the long flight home than a good walk. And what a walk. 6kms of coastal path passing a variety of coves and beaches, all packed with people enjoying themselves on the beach or in the sea. I just wish I had packed my swimming trunks and taken a towel. Do so to get the most out of this walk as you pass within metres of the sea. Bondi is well known, some of the other coves and beaches less so, but all have something to offer. The path does have some steep climbs and steps so one needs to be ambulant. Take the bus from Circular Quay to Bondi remembering not to get off at Bondi Junction, finish the walk at Coogee followed by a beer or two, then hop on the bus back to Circular Quay.Whether the extra calories are lost is a moot point, but this doesn't detract from a really good walk"

Alternatively the pool is safe for all ages. Really pretty area. Continued onwards taking in the rugged ocean scenery until Bondi beach reached and then went for a swim between the flags.

Early mornings and weekends it tends to get busier, as well as afternoons during summer daylight saving times.If you are here in November there is the Sculptures by the Sea exhibition. This has artworks of all different kinds line the walk and beach areas from Bondi to Bronte. It has been going for about 10-15 years I think, and just keeps getting better.This is a must do, and great for lots of photos."

Some portions had some steep stairs as website suggests (http://bonditocoogeewalk.com.au/the-walk/), but overall it can be a manageable walk if you are in relatively healthy condition.I recommend you take water and snacks (if desired) if you go because there are not many places along the way to purchase food and drink.

There are numerous beaches you can stop at and some have swimming pools built into the cliffso if the surf is to high you can still cool down in a pool.Clovelly has a great Bowls Club perched on the cliff with great views to sea as you bowl and a very unusual beach which is very user friendly. All the way along the route are areas to BBQ and picnic and plenty of watering holes ! There are numerous water fountains to refill your bottles for free.Once you arrive at Coogee relax and pat yourself on the back as on a hot day it is tiring but well worth the effort."

The walk is indeed amazing. Prepare yourself with water, a hat, and comfy shoes. There are plenty of places to sit and rest, but it is a 3.7 mile walk in one direction. There are also a lot of stairs. I would not recommend this with a young child. We brought our toddler with us, and sure enough, we had to carry her for much of the walk. Strollers would not be possible on this path. We got a cab from Bondi back to our hotel at Circular Quay."

We took about 2.5 hours completing the entire distance from Bondi to Coogee, stopping quite frequently to take pictures and enjoy the views. At some places the walk can get a bit steep, but there are several places to stop and rest along the way. The weather was very good during our walk - you might want to start a bit early if you want to avoid too much of the sun (the waters look gorgeous in their blue-green colors in the morning sun) and take some sun-block as well. The entire walk is along the coastline and there are several places where you can easily walk down a few rocks to get to the water and yet, its only a climb of a few steps to get to the road. There are several park benches and lookouts for some great picture opportunities - make maximum use of these. If you have a lot of time in your hand, you can always stop by any of the beaches for a swim and take it slowly. There are quire a few nice restaurants along the walk where you can have a quick breakfast / lunch if required. Several good restroom facilities are available as well."

Each of the beaches offered its own perks and the views were spectacular. There are ample water and rest stops at each of the beaches along the way and I would say this is appropriate for most fitness levels. Also, take a hat and tons of sunscreen as there is very little shade or cover throughout. We started from Bondi and finished at Coogee - in our opinion, Bondi was the prettiest beach - gentle waves, clear aquamarine surf, no seaweed and although busy, there was lots of space in the sand. Coogee was beautiful as well but at the time we were there, had significant seaweed both on the beach and within the water forcing hundreds of people to swim in the small area where there was none. If you were to choose only one spot to swim, I would suggest starting the walk at Coogee (arrive by bus) and walking toward Bondi to cap off the afternoon relaxing or swimming at Bondi (and bussing or training back from there). A fantastic day trip and choose a sunny day if you can!"

Absolutely incredibly beautiful, easily accessible with a stroller (not wheelchair friendly though unless someone can lift you up and down a couple of sets of stairs). Would advise 1) that you do this early in the day or later; very hot this time of year, not much shade; and 2) prepare to fall in love with the beaches along this walk MUCH more than Bondi.

From pounding surf on ragged rock shores to rolling surf on pristine beaches, the views were stunning. The path was not busy (Tuesday)...most people strolled along, and there were a few runners. A pod of dolphins was clearly visible during much of our time on the path and there were surfers, snorkelers and a few people fishing from the shore. We stopped at Jenny\u2019s Cafe at Bronte beach for a \u2018long black with a side of milk\u2019 (the Australians sure do coffee right), and at the Lamrock Cafe in Bondi for lunch (good pasta and cold beer under the street umbrellas). The picturesque main boulevard of Bondi (Campbell Parade) has many shops and eateries for those so inclined. Definitely a half-day must-do excursion in Sydney."

Even on a cloudy day after a rainstorm this was a very scenic walk. You can get plenty of pictures out on the rocks, just be careful as you do so. While you are on the walk, make sure to keep a look out for the Aboriginal rock carving that is just north of Tamarama beach. There is some up and down elevation during the walk, but we found our walk from Bondi to Tamarama easy enough and that is with having a recent ankle injury. After some wait, we then caught the bus at Tamarama back, but had to transfer to get back to our original spot."

Then make your way to Iceberg's at the Southern end of the bay. The walk commences there and works its way around headlands, bays and suburbs. It takes about 60-90 minutes depending on your pace and is a great way to see and feel the coastline. The Sculptures by the Sea Exhibition is on in November too so beware of big crowds with that.Finish up at Coogee with a beer at one of the famous hotels (pubs) along the seafront or have a simple coffee and then head back to the city via one of the buses or another taxi.A great way to spend a morning walking and you'll really get a sense of attraction of seaside living in Sydney from the walk!"

I've been to many countries and several beaches, Bondi, while looking typical, is somehow very different to the others.It has a very unique culture attached to it, which can be seen in the vibe around the area, type of people that hangs around and the activities that people do when they come.If you want to surf, there's plenty of sunshine and waves, and if you don't like the water, the coastal walks are beautiful too. If you hate both, then go to the center of Bondi and enjoy good food and do some shopping."

Took a bus to Coogee beach, hung out at the beach for a bit and then started our walk.We realized that the reverse walk had more of walking down stairs than up - so if that's important to you, consider doing the reverse walk.Give yourself at least 60-90 minutes more than you'd estimate - you need the extra time to a) ooh and aah over some distinctive scenery b) stop very frequently for pictures c) linger at an unexpected spot.You will encounter lots of lovely beaches and rocky outcrops until you see the distinctive crescent of Bondi beach.Dress in layers - we did the walk in winter, but were soon stripping down layers as we walked.Carry water with you - some if the beaches have outdoor showers and water fountains, but there are stretches where having your drinking water source would be helpful.The path can get really crowded - if possible go early in the morning or later in the afternoon. Finally, don't forget sunglasses and sunscreen. "

The works are on the walk from Bondi Beach towards Coogee, original, clever and sometimes witty.This walk is easy to follow, but has some steep sections, and also some stairs. There are stunning coastal views to be had, but try and avoid windy days as it is very exposed. There are plenty of places to swim, from the icepool in Bondi, to the pool at the side of Byron, as we'll as the beaches themselves. Our favourite was Byron. There are also cafes on the way."

Sculptures By the Sea is fantastic. Cliff at the point impressive and provided quite the adrenaline rush for one of our friends as he sat out over the water on one of the ledges.Wish we could have gone back for sunrise too.

Carry a light jacket in your rucksack as it does get windy in some parts and towards the end of your walk, around dusk it gets chilly here specially during this time of year :) 2. Carry your own water bottle. There are filtered water refill pts at every beach/along the way 3. Carry your own food as you can then walk at your own pace (& not hurry to the next beach for food) & there are some gorgeous private spots you can find :) 4. Keep aside 4.5 hours for the walk alone. 5. Easy to walk but those with knee problems may want to wear knee pads as going downhill will pose a prob during the end of your walk 5. Take some time out at Coogee if that's your final destination. We chose to sit by the sloping hill on the grass overlooking the beach below :) 6. There are couple of free pools along the way so if you want, you could carry your swimwear though we just stuck to the walk. 7. Needless to say, carry your camera. I clicked most shots from my iPhone 5S and they came out great so if you don't want to carry your heavy SLR, you can do with a good camera ph Over all one of the best experiences you'll have in Sydney. And it's a rarity to find something that's FREE here :P so enjoy every minute of this walk."

Indeed, you don't have to do the full Bondi to Coogee Beech walk to experience one of the best walks in Australia. For example, Bondi to Bronte can be done at a leisurely stroll in two hours. You'll experience coastal cliffs, views of famous Sydney beaches, historic beach baths, and trendy cafes. If you are fortunate to be in Sydney during the sculptures by the sea, then this is an added bonus.  The Bondi to Coogee beach is the most famous, most walked track in Sydney for good reason. It\u2019s easy to get to and there are many vantage points to take photos along the way. It's an easy walk but do but be aware that there are some rocky patches and some steep sets of stairs."

It has a very varied flora and fauna and look out for the pretty fairy wren, a flash of blue and the gulls soaring on the updraughts from the ocean. Each bay has its own beach, surf live saving station and cafe, many of them providing excellent snacks. Walk north to Bondi for lunch ( so many choices it will be difficult to choose) and either stroll back afterwards or take the coastal bus. An excellent and exhilarating day out."

It was a lovely walk with beautiful bays where we stopped for a quick swi m occasionally, or just a rest. There were sea-water swimming pools too in a couple of bays. The views were stunning and there were many opportunities to sit and admire them. Most of the route was reasonably easy, but there were some fairly steep steps at one point. There were few opportunities to buy refreshments en-route, but once in Coogee there were numerous chafes and bars.

The walk itself is about 4 miles along a paved/planked path. While it is not difficult, there are a lot of stairs and hills which might be difficult for some. Accordingly, I would recommend wearing sneakers and appropriate clothes. If you feel like 4 miles is too far, you can always stop in Bronte and enjoy lunch by the beach. The view along the walk is amazing and seeing the different beaches along the coast was really neat. Next time we will bring out bathing suits and enjoy some of them. Once we arrived in Coogee, we had lunch and a drink at one of the beach cafes. All in all, a nice afternoon out and about!"

The coastline is beautiful and it's a nice way to see it. There are stairs and hills so a little fitness is needed, though if I managed most could. Although there aren't many places to stop for refreshments along the way (probably different in summer) you can take the walk at your own pace and there are plenty of stunning views to be soaked up."

Once we got there, I felt an immediate change of scenery and this place was just very chill. The path was easy to follow. There were 5 beaches we visited. We took our time to take some pictures. It's such a scenic walk of the Sydney coast and it was breathtaking. Then we treated ourselves to lunch once we reached to Bondi beach and watches some surfers riding the waves. Next time we do this, we'll probably bring a beach towel and a picnic bag. It's a great place to spend the whole day by the coast. P.S.Make sure you wear comfy shoes and bring bottle of water as well. Oh and there are toilets between the walk paths so not to worry."

We then took the walk to Coogee, and although we started in the warm sunshine, as we got deeper into the walk, we were confronted gale winds and darkening skies that hit the city by surprise (don't worry - this is not typical of this area; it just happened on our day). Despite the winds, our walk was heavenly. As you walk along the cliff, you see panoramic views of several small, lovely beaches. Truly, this was one of the highlights of our trip, even with the threatening skies. Anyone who loves beautiful beach views and enjoys walking (it is easy walking with just a few staircases) will love this walk. It took us around 2 1/2 hours, after which we caught a bus back to the Circular Quay in Sydney."

A lot to take in.There are also plenty of cafes around the corner (I went to cafe bondi at 97hall street and had the best pumpkin soup & pancakes) and started the walk right after breakfast.

Some are large, some tiny, some very deep, some even no sand - just inlets. All have beautiful clear water and by the signage, support some amazing sea life. There is even a dive/snorkel \"path\" at Clovelly. Surf was picking up by the time I reached Tamarama. Her I was able to purchase a bottle of water from the kiosk. There are lots of benches along the way from which to admire the scenery. I even passed a plastic bag dispenser for dog owners to access for cleaning up after their pooches. I was impressed with the whole walk's cleanliness - no litter or graffiti - certainly well maintained with pride."

Sydney is a very young city compared to those in Europe, so I think it is always better to explore the natural wonders of such a city. We spent a few hours on the Bondi to Coogee Coastal Walk. We commenced at the north end of Bondi Beach & walked along the beach to the first set of steps, near which is the Bondi Icebergs swimming pool where we also saw a Yoga class in session. We walked along the coast & stopped for morning coffee at Tamarama before heading off to Coogee.It was winter however Sydney is having an unusually warm winter & so it is best to wear layers & take water (although there are public filtered water stations along the walk). The walk has sections with many steps & steep inclines however there are seats placed along the way, & many flat sections.It was a great walk & we will definitely go back to do it again (we might start at the Coogee end next time)."

This invigorating oceanside and cliff top walk will get you into a spiritual high. You observe the beautiful shoreline and world's best surfing beaches of the Eastern burbs. This is an exceptional walk. Be advised, its totally open space ...... sunscreen and appropriate clothing is advised Assuming you have investigated the Beach already,walk to the Bondi Hotel,turn right into Elizabeth Drive,leaving the noise of the beach behind. Start at the iconic Bathers swimming pool which is a great place to dine or while away the afternoon and head down Nott street to the path which drops down and skirts the rock formation. Careful strides as you take the steep steps to Mackenzies Point Lookout, on the headland. Sit down, to allow the vistas which stretch 180 degrees from Ben Buckler in the north to Malaber in the distant south. Resume walking to the next headland and down to Tamarama beach wher less clothing is preferred. Skirt the sands to the Marine Drive which you follow around the slope of Bronte Park. After passing Bronte Beach,refuel with caffeine and refreshments at the local cafes overlooking the sea and headup to Calga Reserve. Walk down Trafalger avenue to the historic resting place of Sydney's citizens at Waverley Cemetery. Then follow the coast through Clovelly to Coogee Beach,where entertainment cafes and superb eating options await you. Bus or taxi back to Bondi or the city. But,why leave paradise, you ask?"

The walk from Bondi Beach to Coogee Beach is an easy walk up and around the area. I suggest good walking shoes. Leave the fashionable heels for later. The view from the highest point is worth the walk.We've visited during the winter, and it was a bit chilly and windy. That didn't distract from the beauty at all. If you want to take the bus, take the 333 from the Quay. It's not quite a non-stop, but it has the least amount of stops. Take the same one on the return."

There are plenty of great cafes at Bondi and Bronte and the other suburbs along the route. Its great for families and kids as well. Perfect for photos. You can get a bus from the city to Bondi or a train to Bondi Junction and then a bus to Bondi Beach. Parking can be difficult at all these beachside haunts.Look out for Sculpture By The Sea in the Spring when the path is transformed into an outdoor sculpture park - crowded but worth it!"

I am thinking of Tamarama, Bronte and Clovelly; so be sure to have your cosies with you!There are cafes and restaurants at those beaches too, so if you get hungry, you'll be right!Of course you finally end up at Coogee Beach which has undergone extensive development in recent years to become another tourist mecca.Be prepared for spectacular ocean views and clean green grass as you walk along the cliff tops.When you reach Coogee there are heaps of restaurants, bars, stalls and cafes.

Along the route there are plenty of lovely parks for a picnic, a couple of rock pools for swimming and places to buy a coffee or snack. The path has some steep stairs in it, so it's also favourite for some exercise. My last visit was yesterday (Monday morning), and is was pretty busy with tourist and runners/walkers. If you don't like crowds, don't go on Saturday/Sunday morning. If you are in Sydney for only one day, and you love the ocean and beaches, you should fit in this 6 km walk. It's worth it!"

We took the Watson's Bay ferry from Circular Quay then the 380 bus to Bondi before we started the walk.The first few hundred metres set the tone for he rest of he walk - a view of the coastal swimming pool below, surfers in the waves and a lovely coast line to look at. It's a great walk throughout as you go through a number of bays and beaches. It's a little up and down so you need to be reasonably fit though there are super fit people everywhere running along the coastal path.It was great to arrive at Coogee after a brisk 90 minute walk and had a well deserved drink at the Hotel before boarding the bus back to Sydney.

Theres a few stairs along the way, naturally a couple hills to go up and down but nothing to steep. the advantage is, theres severla beaches along the way to stop at, all with pubs, cafes close by. its popular for runners, but just keep walking as normal and they will find their way past you. dont try to get out the way, it will only cause chaos. bring your camera, plenty of amazing photo opportunities and woth doing a quick google search of the route as theres a few famous sites along the way for one reason or another...some good, some not so good. but all interesting all the same"

At this time of year, it is a bit brisk, but the walk is a superb way to watch the sun rise over the east and the Tasman Sea/ Pacific Ocean and to look at the extraordinary collection of humanity out for their morning exercise. Most people go 'there and back' so there is no particular advantage in which end you start. Good cav\u00e9s at both ends and the best at Bronte, in the middle. Guests from the \"Admiral Collingwood\" hotel catch the M50 to Coogee and start there. If its a stroll, rather than a brisk walk, the Waverly Cemetery is well worth a bit of time, marveling at the tombstones and sepulcres. We even saw an Priest celebrating a dawn wedding on one of the small parks along the way. What a way to start a marriage - and gives new meaning to the \"Wedding Breakfast\"."

My wife and I visited Bondi while in Sydney during June 2013. We enjoyed the energy of all those in Bondi so much, we returned the next day too. There are runners, walkers, surfers, swimmers, etc everywhere and just inspires you to be active also. Admittedly both my wife and I are active triathletes, so the athletic environment certainly appealed to us, but we enjoyed just relaxing, strolling the coastline, watching the surfers and those practicing yoga on the rocks, we spotted a whale, watched those swimming in one of over half a dozen sea water filled pools right next to the sea, etc. In fact, my wife and I took surfing lessons while there too. But one of the main draws is the view. The coastline, rocks, surf, beaches, a beautiful cemetery on the hill, boardwalks, etc are really just amazing. For those active folks, you can get a guest pass to Bondi Icebergs pool, and swim in one of the most iconic pools you will find. Also there are some great places to grab some lunch (se review of Trio). There are some steep climbs on this walk, and quite a few stairways, so might not be perfect for those mobility challenged. Also there is a lawn bowling \"field\"(?) on the path. (Sorry, but being from the US, not sure if I know all the appropriate lawn bowling terminology)"

You can stop for lunch at any number of places (we went to Trio for breakfast and Icebergs for lunch), the views are fantastic, and there are interesting plaques explaning different features of the ocean and shore along the way. A tip is to follow the runners along the path as then you won't go on as many \"dead ends\". We walked on this path for a few hours to get to the end but had a great time. There are only a few steep parts and not many stairs."

Start at Coogee Beach (374, 373 or M50 prepay bus from the city - takes about 30 minutes) and fuel up with a coffee from Gusto on the cafe strip near the beach on Coogee Bay Road. The walk to Bondi is signposted and will take you about 2.5 hours and if you do it between June and September you may see a migrating whale or two as a bonus. If you have binoculars bring them!Keep an eye out for white cockatoos, honey eaters and rosellas - very pretty parrots. Take some water with you as there are steps up and down at some places and you will be thirsty by the end of the walk even at a leisurely pace. my favourite spot on the walk is Gordon's Bay - just north of Coogee - a quiet pretty bay ringed by coastal bush and a great spot for a secluded swim in summer months."

The large expanse of clean white sand was beautiful.The pathways was easy to find and follow and the walkt wound around rugged coastal areas.The colours of the sea were divine. Differing landscapes with rocky outcrops and surf beaches added to the beauty.The walk was so interesting without being too challenging. So many others were enjoying this walk too.

I suggest one way, so take a bus or taxi back to Bondi\u2026.but if you are feeling adventurous, stop for a coffee or lunch in Coogee and turn around and do it all over again.

Granted I had no idea what I was getting into when my friend asked if we wanted to go get breakfast in Bondi and then go for a walk. I seriously thought he meant we would do a 30 min walk along the beach. I wore a maxi dress and sandals, as did another girl in our group, and my husband wore jeans. This was just before New Year\u2019s so it was really hot. This is a \"walk\" that is up and down for around 3 miles. You need to be wearing shorts, tank tops and walking shoes for sure. You should also bring sunscreen and water as there are not many places to stop in between. It would have been a gorgeous and worthwhile event had our guide told us what we were getting into beforehand. We were so pissed at the half way point that we stopped enjoying it and just wanted to get to the pub."

It takes a tiny bit of effort to figure out how to get there on the bus from downtown Sydney but the effort is well worth it. I didn't even go in the water, just walked along the shore. 5-6 different beaches to see, each beautiful in their own way. Some of the best people watching you will encounter anywhere in the world. Lots of relaxing spots to stop in and refresh yourself after the walk.Only caveat would be if you are older or out of shape is to budget a lot of time for this -- it is a LONG walk (5-6 miles I think) with a lot of hills and (generally) warm temperatures. Not a negative, just wanted to highlight this."

At Coogee beach bus stop, just take a bus back to Sydney city, less than 30min ride to Central station."

I've been to Sydney several times, and despite there being so many wonderful things to do in the city, the walk from Bondi to Coogee (or Coogee to Bondi, if you want to mix it up!) often rises to the top of my list for how I want to spend a free afternoon. It's easy enough to take a bus from the CBD to either Bondi or Coogee and then start the walk, which is 2-3 hours (depending on your pace) of jaw-dropping beautiful coastal view after jaw-dropping beautiful coastal view! There's also a nice variety of scenes, from very busy spots (like Bondi) to secluded, smaller beaches with no one on them. If you want to swim, there are several opportunities to do so along the walk, both in ocean and a few dedicated swimming spots with lanes, etc. The walk also varies: none of it is very strenuous, but there are some spots that are a big more rugged than others. You will love the pictures you take on this walk--be sure to bring your camera. The color of the water is amazing! The architecture of the cliff-side and beach-side homes that you pass along the way is also very interesting. Be sure to save some time for Bondi and Coogee. Bondi is a bit touristy, but there's a good smoothie stand in the pavilion next to the beach. Coogee has some nice spots to grab a meal. Highly recommended--one of my favorite things."

It was quite crowded the day we walked, but I assume that it was out of the ordinary because we were there on Easter Day. The views are spectacular- bring your good camera! The hike itself is not strenuous at all- just beware that there are several places where there are stairs, but nothing too extreme. It would probably take easily less than 2 hours to walk the whole thing (round trip), but it is easy to stretch the time out as you will want to stop mutliple times to take in the views and spend some time on the beaches."

I'd recommend starting at Coogee and ending at Bondi where you can have coffee and a gelato at the Pompeii Restaurant to put back any weight you may have inadvertently lost. The walk runs along the sandstone cliffs abutting the ocean and on a sunny day it is just lovely. You will also travel through a range of beaches as well. It is a great introduction to Sydney lifestyle and should not be missed."

It takes about 2 hours and is a bit hilly but if you take your time you will be rewarded with fantastic views and fresh sea air. In the winter, perhaps it is best to start from the Coogee end. If you are in Sydney City you should catch the Route 374 bus to Coogee beach and then commence your walk.Once reaching Bondi Beach you could stop in at the Bondi Icebergs for a meal or a drink, or you could extend your trip by catching the bus to Watsons Bay and then catching the ferry to Sydney.All in all a wonderful day, hard to beat anywhere in the world that I have visited."

Each beautiful was stunning and different to see, it's an amazing opportunity to take photos or just enjoy the sea air and scenery. It's an incredible strip of the coast and a good workout, plus it's free! You'll need a drink with you as it has some steeper parts, but it isn't a challenging walk unless you decide to scramble over some of the rocks! Amazing and highly recommended whilst you are in Sydney."

On revisiting Sydney in 2013 we did it again, but this time in the other direction. It's a really lovely walk, fantastic views, it's obviously a little up and down in places because it's coastal but all in all it's a relatively easy walk. It took us about 90 minutes but I think we're quite fast walkers. If you have children with you who want to stop and look at lots of things en route it could easily take much, much longer. If you don't fancy doing the full thing you could stop at one of the beaches in the middle (Tamarama, Bronte, Clovelly) and there are buses that run from each of these suburbs back to Sydney centre. Thoroughly recommend. It's also fun to play a game of \"'if I won the lottery I would buy that house\" en route!"

What a fantastic way to enjoy the outdoors before that evening's festivities! The public transportation is pretty simple and you don't even need to switch buses. You can take it straight to the beach from downtown Sydney. Once in Bondi, we took a few minutes to walk on the beach, watch the surfers, take some pictures, and put our toes in the ocean (freezing!). Then we embarked on the approximately 5K paved trail from Bondi to Coogee Beach. The walk passes by dramatic cliff views on the way through a few small beaches full of local Syndeysiders enjoying the holiday. It even passes by one of the most scenic cemeteries I've ever witnessed. Overall, the walk is a perfect (and free) way to see the natural coastal side of Sydney. It didn't seem like the walk was just for tourists either; we saw groups of locals jogging and working out along the trail."

Your backpack will be pretty safe while you swim - the Aussies are pretty honest. Tourists without a vehicle can get the train from Central Station to Bondi Junction and then the bus to Bondi Beach.

Quite a few coves or beaches that you could stop off at but as we were meeting the rest of our group in Bondi we did not stop except to get ice cream at one of the beach bars. Lots of people were running the route but this did not cause any problems for us. Would recommend this to anyone who is energetic. We beat one of the hostel groups but were overtaken by a guy of about 70 - he looked super fit and probably does the walk every day!!! Some lovely houses along the way to look at enviously - they must be worth a fortune with the views they have."

I've done the walk though sun and rain, alone and with friends, seen whales, dolphins and seals. some of the highlights? watching the sunrise during whale migration season (twice a year humpbacks and other whales pass on by). Doing the Sculpture by the Sea (Tamarama Beach to Bondi Beach for a couple of weeks in November every year) - do it early in the morning or on a week day though - it gets hugely busy on the weekends of the event. Two cautions though - this is not only a walking trail, runners use this trail frequently - be aware of them! The other caution is that parts of the trail are a bit narrower, I have found that when everyone shares the walkway, it's a much better experience for all, especially when it's a busy weekend. And don't forget to bring your swimsuit for a lovely dip in the pools along the way!"

Coogee is less touristy. The restaurants have to please repeat customers. There is a cute seafood shack where the cliff side walk meets the road where you can catch the bus to Sydney ."

My recommendation; catch the 373 or 374 bus from Circular Quay and start the walk at Coogee. There's a great little cafe called Crumpet at the southern end of Coogee (on Havelock Avenue) if you want breakfast before you go. There are fresh water drinking fountains along the way, or if you want a bottled drink you'll find one at the Kiosks - there's one in Bronte and another at Tamarama and both sell cool drinks and ice-creams. There's a strip of cafe's just behind the beach at Bronte too where you can get fresh barista coffees, fish & chips and cafe-style breakfasts. The walk is great in spring and autumn as its not unbearably hot... and if you are planning to go anytime between November to February, take sunscreen and a hat and if you can, aim to finish the walk by 11am at the latest as there's no shelter on the walk (you can stop at Bronte or Tamarama to sit under trees - if you're lucky enough to find a spot!) and it gets too hot after 11 to enjoy comfortably. The walk takes around 90 minutes one-way, has some steep hills (Coogee to Gordons Bay and the final stretch between Tamarama and Bondi) and there are plenty of stairs, so it's not ideal for elderly or very young travellers - however the section between Bronte & Tamarama is fairly flat with only one set of stairs up from Bronte to the path, and another set down to Tamarama. Enjoy, and remember the sunscreen!"

It's a 5km walk that you could probably do in a couple of hours but I took the best part of the day to do it and recommend doing that. You can stop to swim at some of the beaches (Bondi, Tamarama, Bronte, Coogee), watch the surfers (surprisingly fascinating) or have something to eat/drink on the way. It is worth stopping at Bondi Icebergs! The walk wasn't a quiet one - there was quite a stream of people doing it, especially between Bondi and Tamarama. The nearer I go to Coogee the less people there were on the path. There are plenty of places to stop for refreshments or the toilet. There is some up and down to the walk so you probably have to be reasonably able.I took the 380 bus from Circular Quay to Bondi beach and was glad I took it from there as the bus fast filled up and later down the line some passengers were turned away. It took about 40 minutes I think. I took the 373 bus back from Coogee.I was in Sydney towards the end of March for a business trip. I had the weekend on my own and chose to do this walk on the recommendation of my colleagues. I would definitely do it again, and don't regret using most of one of only two free days in Sydney to do this walk."

Lots of steps!We didn't stop too many times for photos and it took just under two hours, the different bays were beautiful and you could easily spread it out over several hours with coffee stops etc along the way. Three good coffee shops at Coogee as reward for your walk.It was a fairly still day, although I understand it can get extremely windy along there, so a fleece might be a good idea outside of summer.Take plenty of water as I didn't see any water fountains along the way.Easy bus ride from Coogee beach back to the CBD every 20 minutes or so.We will allocate more time and keep going next time, fantastic walking away from the City."

When you come round the bend into Bondi you see the whole of Bondi Beach stretched out before you. it's a spectacular sight and well worth coming at after a long walk.

And if you are fit and want an all day walk consider starting from Watson's Bay. Take the morning Ferry to Watson's and go from there. We are fit 60 somethings and only took a bus for part of the trip from Watson's to Bondee because the temp was over 30. You can always grab a bus to shorten your trip. There are washrooms and picnic sites at each beach.http://www.smashwords.com/books/view/228747"

The rock formations along the coastline are beautiful and the different beaches along the way all have a totally different character. At the end of October and beginning of November there is a wonderful Sculpture By the Sea display from Bondi to Tamarama Beach which is a fabulous experience. But it can get very crowded. It is best to do on a weekday if you have the choice. But everyone is usually happy and helpful so the runners and art lovers are all accommodating. The Bondi Icebergs Club is a nice place to stop at the Bondi end of the walk. The rock pool there is where the courageous swim every day winter and summer."

Even at a slow pace, with time to stop and savor the views, it takes less than two hours. It's best on a weekday, because there are fewer fellow walkers. And if you can plan it during Sydney's Sculpture by the Sea exhibition, you will have a special memory. We prefer to do the walk starting at Coogee, so we can end the walk at the bar in Iceberg's in Bondi."

It is a lovely beach, true, but it is the walk along the coastline that is gorgeous every step of the way, (About 3 miles.) The path meanders along the coast past cliffs and intriguing sandstone rock formations hugging the coastline. We thought about stopping at the Icebergs Club for lunch, which is a swimming pool/club restaurant built right over the water and the pool is filled with the ocean waves that crest the pool, but continued back to Bondi and had lunch on the outside patio of the Bondi Hotel directly across the street from the main beach. We reached Bondi Beach by bus, which provided us a tour of Sydney outside the central business district/harbor area. The bus there was an express bus, while the return bus made a lot of stops, so ask someone before boarding unless you want the snail bus. However you get to the beach, just do it!"

You can sometimes see whakles or dolphins if the time of year is right and you will always see surfers and generally just ocals going about their daily lives.

Did this walk the other way round, starting from our hotel in Coogee, and walking through to Bondi; either way, it's a beautiful meander (or jog, as many Sydneysiders do). Views across the assorted bays, coves and beaches you pass are gorgeous (and extremely photogenic), and aside from the slightly incongruous placement of a graveyard on one of the cliffs above the water, it's a glorious stroll. Word of warning: a swim at Bondi (or Coogee) is the ideal reward for an hour or so walking, but if you're making the return journey, a wet costume is no fun to walk in for an hour, so take something to change into."

Alternately, you can get the train to Bondi Junction train station and either walk or get the bus from there.From the southern end of Bondi Beach begin the coastal walk along the wooden walkway. The walkway runs all the way along the (approx) 9km of path over the clifftops. The walk took us about 2.5 hours, but in saying that we took our time, making many stops and taking photos. We were in no rush. I'm sure it can be done in 1.5 hours. It starts at Bondi Beach's southern end, leading onto Tamarama Beach, then Bronte Beach (which is not named after the literary trio of British sisters but Lord Nelson who was the Duke of Bronte), followed by Clovelly Beach, Gordon's Bay and finally, Coogee Beach.I thought that once you've seen one beach you've seen them all... I was mistaken! The views are spectacular. These series of beaches are some of the most wonderful i've seen, mostly due to the towering cliffs that protect them and the harsh waves that batter them and create picturesque foamy waves that surfers chase on the boards. Not to mention the imposing and vast Waverley Cemetery that balances at the edge of one of the cliffs. It's no Pere Lachaise but it appears grander due to it's surroundings and it makes for a gorgeous photo. If i had to be buried i wouldn't mind being buried overlooking the ever-changing sky and distant horizon!All along the walkway are information plaques explaining about each beach, it's history and name. Supposedly in 1938, a date forever ingrained in Bondi lore as 'Black Sunday' five beach-goers drowned on Bondi Beach. However, 250 were saved as a series of massively destructive and unexpected waves struck the beach. The word Coogee also means 'smelly place' in Aboriginal language! You decide!It's a spectacular walk for a spectacular day in Sydney."

Some are big and busy and bustling, others are quieter , all are more than well serviced by bustling cafes and bars.7MAlabar, Maroubra, Bronte, Tamara, Clovelly, Coogee and Bondi. Bondi is always the beach that is mentioned, its known the world over and takes the limelight from its sister beaches but in my humble opinion its welcome to the attention and the other beaches are absolutely worth your attention. There is no better way to see this gorgeous shoreline than the coastal walk. Again, this is a personal opinion but l always liked to start this walk at Bondi as l liked finished up at the other end. Its a great walk and for those who like to stay hydrated you can stop along the way for refreshments. I must say this is not a walk to be done by anybody who has mobility issues, or with somebody in a wheelchair.Of notable mention is one of my personal favourite visits in this lovely part of the world. Right up on the top of the hill in between Clovelly Beach and Coogee Beach is one of the most beautifully located and the most fascinated cemetaries you are ever likely to find in the world. Waverly Cemetary is absolutely fascinating and well worth devoting a portion of your time to. Its near the end of the walk so if your thirsty or peckish, stop off at SAlt Cafe overlooking Clovelly beach first, and then head up the hill to the cemetary. It has graves of Sydney residents who orginated from all over the world. there is a considerably impressive Irish section there, there are beautiful family tombs there, some have family name plates there, Italian and greek families in particular. It is amazing. Enjoy the walk, the coffee, stop and have a picnic on the hill top and make sure and visit the cemetary"

Can be a little tough for the elderly or those who don't do much exercise but you can just take your time, it will be worth it."

All this can be done with the family day pass where the whole family can hop on any public transport option for the low price of $2.50 each! That is a cheap outing. Oh - my two kids were not so keen on the walking though. It is about 7-8kms and a little too long and tedious for them."

We decided to start at Bondi as the buses home from Bondi are often busy, whereas coogee is quieter so to us it made more sense. When you walk away from Bondi you come to a high lookout point, where you can get a fantastic photo looking back over Bondi. There are some steep hills, and steps, but it looked to us like there were other ways round so parts of the walk may be accessible for wheelchairs. Lots of people had push-chairs, and there were lots of people jogging who could help carry them up the steps! The view of Bronte beach which is in between Coogee and Bondi is my favourite, the water is just gorgeous and you can get some lovely photos doing the walk from either direction. The closer you get to coogee the better the foot paths, it starts to become decking, and there are lots of benches to sit and admire the view or catch your breath! Although it is very windy along the walk, it is deceptively hot, so take sun precautions and take water for the walk (there are filtered water fountains so you can re-fill your bottles - and also ice-creams can be purchased at all beaches). I'm told you can often see dolphins along the walk, but the best time is in the morning, so get there early! Definitely worth doing!"

Take your time and enjoy the views. If you take swimmers there are some of the best places to take a dip along the walk. Clovelly is almost like swimming in an aquarium as it is in a protected environment with a collapsed casueway hidden at the mouth of the inlet making it a safe p;ace to take a dip and find the blue gropers!Furrther along the walk is Gordons Bay, if you come equiped there is an underway chained pathway thet allows you to dive along a special area, complete with dolphins, lobsters, gropers, the odd grey nurse, and lots of wonderful sea life. In the right season you will see whales from all along the headland. Be aware of the environment as you walk along it is spectacular and special. Volunteer groups work constantly to keep the weeds out of the natural bush, stop say hello and they will talk to you about the unique plants. Watch out for joggers, cyclists and gym based young parents with 4wheel drive prams they will knock down anything in their way.At the north end of Coogee is Giles Pool, a wild pool once the site of the mens' baths and gym, this is the hangout of younger boys who like to dive from the cliff tops (unfortunately several have died or been crippled doing this, but they are boys) and the best fun is standing on the rock face along the sea edge during big waves to be swept off the rocks and into the whirlpool of the sea pool. The south side of Coogee has some special areas as well.All along the route you will find great cafes, an open air one on the broadwalk at Tamarama, a street full of them at Bronte and both Coogee end and Bondi end have diggers clubs with amazing views and lunch and dinner time deals if you sign in and take off your hat! take a day, drink water, wear a hat and take it easy..very rewarding. oh and their are maps along the way that will tall you of side trips, history and safety issues.note it is all protected so no taking shells or rocks from the beaches.and remeber the new thought...when you go for a walk near the sea pick up 3 pieces of plastic rubbish into bins! save our turtles!"

This is because it is less developed and more individual effort is required to experience the waters edge. This walk however, following the cliffs as it does in parts and behind beaches of shimmering largely empty sands never fails to delight. Only be aware that in heavily overcast or rainy days its like cloudy and rainy elsewhere. In full sun it is hot and precautions especially bringing drinking water and wearing sunshield are definitely necessary! Annual Art by the Sea in late spring is very busy but perhaps the best time to go. You often run into old acquaintances then!"

We'd been to three different beaches around Sydney and Bondi's golden sand and breezy waves were sun-drenched perfection. The day we went the weather was warm but we weren't ready to take the plunge just yet. We decided to take this walk. We did the shorter version (Bondi to Bronte, about two hours) passing the sumptuous Icebergs (tempting outdoor pools and a cafe) and seeing beautiful landscapes, hidden surfing spots and unique pools of water in the rocks where kids indulged. Many a photo op is here, if you're compelled. The thing that stops this from being a 5 star for me is that it's advertised as a moderate stroll...and it is...but there are many, many stairs (especially at the starting 1/3 of the walk).

The part near cencemetery is amazing with cliffs and great views of the coastal line and the sunrise on the sea. Along there were several smaller beaches which is not that crowded.

Destination was Maroubra, around 13 kms south and a more scenic walking route would be hard to find. The route gets crowded at week-ends and in the early mornings and when Sculptures By The Sea is on it is slow progress. However, the sculptures are always a marvellous site and best to do that separately. We are so lucky to live in Sydney where there are numerous walking tracks and paths around the city. And so much bushland (and more great walks) in the suburbs."

People of all ages congregate around the sculptures to admire and comment, as many pieces are quite witty. The sculptures placed right in the middle of Tamarama beach are overlooked by a small cafe and outside tables with parasols, with a lot of people trying to get in.On a sunny day, do take a hat and a water bottle with you, as there is not any shade along the walk."

Right where the bus drops you off is the walking path. But better yet, there's also a strip of restaurants there - so relax over breakfast or lunch before your walk. After a lovely meal, walk the path to Bondi. You can take the bus back to Downtown Sydney from there."

The scenery from the walk is spectacular with the cliffs and the lovely blue ocean. You pass several beaches (Bondi, Tamarama, Bronte, Clovelly, ending at Coogee). The walk is easy and fully paved all the way but it is rather long. However, if you don't want to do it in its entirety, you can break off at any of the beaches along the way and take a bus back to wherever you want to go."

Although we have visited Sydney upwards of a dozen times, we never tire of this walk, taking in the dramatic cliffs, ocean views and lovely beaches of the eastern suburbs. Changes to the route in recent years with new walkways, especially near Waverley Cemetery, have improved the experience. Being keen walkers, we always extend the route southwards across the wetland walkways and through Lurline Bay (passable at low tide) to Maroubra. Use the bus service to avoid potential parking problems and the snags of a linear route. Enjoy a snack at one of the great little cafes in Coogee. Not to be missed!"

I got a bit hot and being over 60 took it slowly. Another highlight was the lunch at the Bistro at Icebergs. The view to the sea was beautiful and made me very homesick for it-I now live on the Murray inland and miss the coast. Despite being an older person I loved Bondi.

Bondi, Tamerama, Bronte and Coogee.... take a dip... get some great fish and chips at Bronte..."

Along the coastal walk for a large portion you are literally walking along cliffs, sometimes over 100 meters, its an unbelievable sight whether its a nice calm day and you can walk down to the lower parts and jump in for a quick swim or on rougher days watch the sea crash against the rocks, or go down early in the morning and watch the sun rise over the ocean."

Even so, we thoroughly enjoyed it. The walk is absolutely glorious on a sunny day, especially once the crowds are left behind. If we ever had the opportunity to do the walk again (which won't be any time soon, considering we live the other side of the world), I'd probably start at Coogee, though, so as to be able to spend some time in Bondi at the end of the walk. If you're staying in the City, and you want to start at Bondi, I'd suggest getting the 333 bus from Circular Quay (we caught the 380 which was rather slow and was overtaken by a 333 bus). The bus route back from Coogee seemed to be rather more interesting, passing by the SCG on its way. There was also less traffic to delay it!"

Our first time on this walk and the weather could not have been better - one of those days where Syd really does look like how it appears on a postcard. Scultpures by the sea runs from 18 Oct - 4 Nov (?) Public t'port was great. The bus driver made specific mention of the stop to alight at and gave directions down the road next to Icebergs as the starting point. Helpful signage in Bondi Junction bus station for correct bus numbers.The volunteers who work at this event are helpful and passionate about Syd and the event. It is worthwhile to spend the $10 on the booklet - but we got one from the seat pocket in the Hyundi Santa Fe courtesy car seat pocket!! There were lots of people on the trek, prams, joggers, non-English speaking tourists but everyone was in a good mood and just went with the flow as there was so much inspiring art to look at. Took us a good 2 hours.Sydney Tap Water had a great stand handing out free water and encouraging you to fill up your own water bottles in the park. The marquee in the park that housed a lot of miniatures of the life size sculptures was brilliant and would be something for ppl to do if their mobility was limited but they still wanted to participate.My favourite sculpture was walking through the bamboo 'wind farm' when the wind blew and I liked the significance of the commemoration of the 222 Bali bombing victims especially given the time of year and the recent 10 year anniversary. My sister liked the large silver ball out on the cliff face with all the holes and clocks in it.The only thing that detracted from enjoyment all day were the blokes who saw the sun and took their shirts off to unveil that bellies, boobs, hirsuteness and tatts. Seriously they could've done with some sculpting by the sea - and indoors as well. Blah! Despite being traumatised by this, we are going to make in an annual pilgrimage."

In mid October don' t miss the amazing Scultures by the Sea event,"

Finishing at Bondi for a drink at Icebergs is a treat. Walking past (or through) the cemetery is quite surreal - not at all spooky in the bright sunlight! I love reading the faded crumbled headstones from over a century ago.You don't have to do the whole walk.

There is a quirky bit when you pass through a large cemetery (there are sometimes works being carried out so there is a diversion), but this might give you the opportunity to spot lizards basking on gravestones.You will pass Gordon Bay, Clovelly, Bronte, Tamarama then the famous Bondi.There will be plenty of people jogging or walking and it is a simple, lazy walk.

I highly recommend that you start the walk around brunch time so you get to Bondi for lunch. Then have a bite at one of the dozen decadent restaurants (good Gelato if it's a hot day!). After you're done munching, take a city bus (it's not worth the walk) from Bondi up to \"Gap Park\" (5-10min). This will be the Watson's Bay area which has a couple parks, navy base, small beach and a lonely lighthouse. Follow the footpath around, take a picture next to the anchor, and you must keep going until you get to the lighthouse where you will see one of the most spectacular views of your life. You can see the mouth/entrance and a beautiful view of Manly (better at night because of the lights) on the North side of the bay. Keep walking around and then you're smacked in the face with a gorgeous view of Sydney city and the Sydney bridge. By the end, you'll have an appreciation what makes Sydney so spectacular compared to other Aussie cities: its beaches ;)"

We did the walk as our very first tourist activity the morning after arriving in Australia and it definitely helped with the jet lag. Walking in August is relatively chilly in the winter to start with and a jacket is a good idea, however after a few minutes you warm up in the sun and need decent sunglasses to fully appreciate the views, which are stunning. A word of warning - during the winter months, often the cafes along the route are closed so finding a toilet can be tricky. Also wear suitable footwear for climbing steps and slopes. It took us just under 2 and a half hours going at a steady pace with jetlag."

This is quite obvious when you look at a map, but you can also feel the seaside vibe when you walk around, nowhere more so than when you take one of the many walks directly along the coastline. The Bondi to Googee walk is probably the most well-known one, there are thousands of people doing it every day, and it's perfectly established (i.e. can easily be done in flip-flops). It's not long, and you can rest at the various small kiosks at each of the beaches it touches. What I really like about it is the beautiful sandstone that makes up about half of the track: you see the weirdest shapes, and if you catch it early in the morning (as in, just after sunrise), the colours are breath-taking. The sea itself is of course not too shabby, and walkers are treated with fantastic views from high platforms, and with plenty of beach access to refresh themselves.Every year around end October, there is also the \"Sculptures by the Sea\" exhibition, which I find is a must-see event, when they exhibit over a hundred sculptures along this footpath.I would plan about a couple of hours of lazy walk, plus an hour or two to dip your feet into the water. If it's too long, you can take a bus back from any of the beaches on the way, so it's very family friendly."

If you walk fast, you could do it in an hour, but it's so much nicer to take your time. When you get to the other end of the cemetery (between Clovelly & Bronte), you'll come to road. Follow the road around to the right, and then you'll meet up with the coastal path again. Bronte has some nice cafes, but if you can wait, go to the casual eatery at Bondi's Icebergs for a glass of wine or beer, fish & chips, and fabulous ocean view.

Along the way you pass through numerous bays and beaches where you can see some surfers in action or just admire the views. We were lucky enough to see whales breaching the surface of the water all along the coast which made it an extra special experience. Along the walk we came across numerous locals running the path - now that looked like hard work, but gave a taste of Aussie outdoor life.Finishing up in Bondi was great as there are plenty of bars and restaurants to have a drink!We really enjoyed our afternoon stroll and it was a great way to experience a few of Sydney's beaches."

In the evening the sunset is gorgeous and the ocean breeze intoxicating.I also preferred the selection of shops and restaurants. I wasn't aware that Bondi was an infamous beach. I was there in early May and did not find the beaches overly crowded. I had a memorable time. Based on the other reviews I would suggest visitors keep in mind the time of year they are visiting. Bondi may not be the best beach/coastal walk, but it is definitely an enjoyable one. I will visit again."

Bright mist drifted over it, as it did over the rest of the land, but against the white of the tombstones it seemed even more luminous and mysterious. What a peaceful place to rest forever, I thought. Every grave was gently nestled in the slope of the hill, looking out on the ocean.  The ocean was vast and deep blue. In the distance, it crinkled over the horizon and out of sight. Closer to us, the wind stirred the water into a frenzy, whipping them against the rocks. The spray flew into the air, droplets flecking our faces. We licked our lips and tasted the slightest hint of salt, tangy and wild. The constant rhythm of the thundering crash followed by a soft hiss as the water receded lulled us into a state of semi-consciousness. The only thoughts running through our mind were the lullaby of the ocean and the tapping of our feet on wood. We were relaxed and carefree, here in this isolated serenity, so far away from the loud noises and constant movement of the city.  We continued on, heading towards the mismatched houses spilling down a distant hill into a small cove of golden beach."

It was in November during the Sculpture by the Sea walk.(which is the best time to walk it in my opinion!) Ending at Bondi is more like a reward after the 10km walk because of all the area has to offer. The walk from Bondi to Coogee just before sunrise is utterly breathe-taking.(beginning the walk at around 6:30am) Bring a waterbottle, a camera, and good walking shoes!"

We started the walk from Bondi to Coogee around 3.30pm on a sunny winter's day and were worried we'd run out of time to finish it before it got dark but it turned out to be the perfect length for a gorgeous sunset walk along the coast with us arriving at Coogee just as it got dark from where we hopped on a bus back to Bondi Junction. A great afternoon's walk, we spotted a pod of dolphins from the cliffs and a seal lazing on a rock basking in the sunshine and bought coffees half way along to drink as we walked. The only thing I was sorry we didn't have time for was a dip in one of the many salt water pools. Definitely a worthwhile addition to a Sydney trip!"

The views are fantastic: rugged coastline, surfers catching waves, blues/greens of the water, and interesting flora.Most visitors are strolling, so runners may encounter some congestion, but it is still very enjoyable! There are some stairs which makes for more \"fun\" on the run.There are small stops along the path for the beaches (Coogee, Clovelly, Bronte, Tamarama, and Bondi). The guidebook indicates that the average walk may take 2+ hours, depending on how many stops one makes. At a brisk pace, one would be able to finish the path in under one hour. It was great to finish at the top of the cliff and round the corner to see Bondi Beach - really amazing! And just in case, running/walking along the path is free."

There are direct buses to Bondi, or you could catch the train to Bondi Junction and take a (long) stroll down to the beach. The walk itself is not challenging, though it does rise and fall gently. The beaches can be gloriously wide or cosy yet accomodating, and I can see how they capture their particular worshippers The cemetry south past Tamarama is moodful. Australia's outdoors are it's greatest attraction, even in the urban centres, and this walk and the Sydney Harbour National Park both represent this in an accessible way."

This Walk is definitely something worth doing if you are in this area of Sydney, especially if its the time of the year when they have the sculpture exhibition. It gives you a good insight into the Sydney coastline - its not up there with other great urban walks in other large cities such as Paris or NewYork but it is uniquely Australian and worth the effort."

We were staying with friends and so we drove to Coogee, which was close to their house, and walked to Bondi.It's a spectacular coastline but what makes it even better is the addition of the wooden stairs and walkways. These are literally clinging to the cliff side and create a path where a natural one is not possible. They are impressive and the need to up each hill and back down to each beach means there are several of them on the route. The views on this walk are amazing and it's a good way to blow out the cobwebs if you have been sat on a plane for 24 hours, which is why we did this on our first day. There is very little shelter on the route, so if it is a hot day, you will need sun cream and hats as it will get very hot up there. However, there are plenty of drinking water taps on the way so you are able to fill up a bottle if you need to, and there's also a couple of public conveniences on the way too.When you arrive at Bondi it's possible to just get the bus back into town if you don't want to walk back. There's a sports centre on the way into Bondi if you are coming from Coogee and the cafe upstairs gives you good views of Bondi Beach. It's a good place to turn around and head back if you are walking back to Coogee."

Lots of local people use this pathway as a means of exercise, so you see people, usually young people and sometimes a movie star or celebrity (if you turn your gaze from the sea). The walk is especially recommended on a fine morning, and when \"Sculptures by teh Sea\" is showing (once a year), with the intrugiing sculptures laid out beside the pathway. It wends along, up and down past the lovely narrow beach at Tamarara. Then along to Bronte where the families come to picnic..There is a classic stone pool beside teh sea which laps into it, if you care to swim.Most people stop here, and stop for coffee at teh cafes near teh beach, or just turn around and walk back. However, if you're feeling fit you can go on along the roadside and walk to Coogee Beach. A lovely walk."

If you can take this walk in the middle of the day it is often quieter an there are lovely spots to stop and rest or contemplate looking out over the ocean."

Not for the fainthearted, the walk from Bondi to Coogee may only be 6km as the crow flies, but if the crow walks up and down all the stairs, it would probably add another few k to the journey. Every twist and turn reveals another glorious view of the ocean and the beautiful headlands. If you're thirsty, there are a number of water fountains and even a few cafes along the route. We took about 4 hours to complete the walk to and from Bondi but that included lunch in Coogee and a leisurely coffee on the way back. Don't try this if you're not at least a little bit fit and it's certainly not pram or wheelchair accessible. And watch out for manic joggers. They won't watch out for you!"

Add the immense Pacific Ocean hugging the walk the whole way, the chance to see a pod of whales or dolphins, the art of Sculptures By the Sea once each year and the perfect coffee (and food) available at every key point along the route and you have a world class experience as well as a good bracket of exercise. Whether you do the whole or part of this walk I'm sure you will enjoy it as we always do.TIP - Weekends can be busy so pick your time of day carefully, sunrise and the morning energy is spectacular. Maybe stop at Bronte Park for a picnic? Plus you can take your dog(s) on this walk."

There is a boadwalk around the cemetary between Bronte and Clovelly that is one of my favourite sections. It is a little less crowded and you are right over the cliffs in part. Bondi is also not to be missed but I love the quieter feel as you head south from Bronte. Gordon's bay is also picturesque. with the water often azure blue. If you keep your eyes on the water especially around the rocks at Clovelly you can often see whales close to shore in the whale season. As you go pass the Bowling club at Clovelly heading south, make sure you walk out along the headland. It is untouched, like a little corner of wilderness so close to the city. The whales often come in quite close along this section of coast. There are cafes along the way where you can stop for food and drinks. There are also public toilets at all the beaches as well as showers. Best not for prams or people who have trouble with stairs. In summer take your swimming costumes and take a dip at any of the beaches or take a snokel and go to Clovelly.Enjoy!!!"

And amazing colours! Some areas are quite steep and other areas have lots of stairs. You can stick to the high road or go down to the coves and get your toes wet. Most coves have places to eat, and toilets. There are a number of water refill stations along the way. A walk through the cemetary is fascinating and deeply rewarding. You don't need to do the entire walk, but you MUST do some of it!"

Try to allow time to do this and take your swimming gear so you can relax and enjoy the lovely swimming spots along the way.You can do the walk comfortably in less than 2 hours or you can stop at each beach and take all day. Most have a cafe where you can refuel if you don't want to take lunch with you.Recommended."

I understood that there was plenty of cafes on the way to get a drink, however i only found one at Bronte beach. There are quite a few hills and steps especially towards the end of the walk near Coogee. Make sure the weather is good, i got caught in a very heavy shower towards the end of the walk there is nowhere to shelter and i got soaked to the skin which spoilt it a bit. But the walk is beautiful and worth doing, but take a drink with you, and catch the bus back from Coogee to Bondi Junction."

It doesn't matter much which way you do it - there is a very good bus service at either end, with taxis easy to get if you prefer to use them. You should allow at least an hour, up to 80 mins if you like to take photos or prefer strolling gently to briskly.Perhaps the only disadvantage is the considerable number of steps. These are worst around Bondi beach, so if you really want to make it a bit easier, start from or finish at Tamarama - although few will want to miss the iconic Bondi.Lots of good food places at Coogee and Bondi to reward you for the exercise and put back the calories you lost.One special time to do this walk is while the \"Sculpture by the Sea\" exhibition is on usually from mid October to early November. It occupies the Tamarama to Bondi area and is one of Sydney's most popular attractions."

What a lovely deep beach - with lots of beach space for ball games (since it was a little chilly for us Queenslanders to swim on Easter Sunday) and with green lawns and pretty houses overlooking the beach. From here we walked to Coogee, past dramatic cliffs, an historic cemetery and a wide range of different beaches. Despite a grey sky, it was a great day. I do wish though that there was a map to find our way to the graves of Henry Lawson and Victor Trumper in Waverley Cemetery."

There are some nice cafes/restaurants at Bronte a very pleasant little area. Coogee itself is quite a big town, similar to Bondi but I think rather nicer - lots of cafes etc and huge beach.

Most people/maps/visitors information will be able to tell you how to find the path, it is not hard. The main part of the walk is from Bondi Beach - the Southern end - to Coogee, but it does continue to Maroubra. It takes a couple of hours to do the main part (one way) so make sure you have plenty of time. But you do not have to walk both ways. If you choose to walk one way you can take a bus from Coogee to the city or back to Bondi.If you have a car a good portion of the walk is from Clovelly South to Coogee or North to Bondi. At Clovelly Beach there is a good public car park with no time limit so it is easy to park here and then join the walk. If you walk south to Coogee you will pass through Gordon's Bay and around the beach front to North Coogee, passing the sculpture to commemorate the Bali bombings and down to the beach, go past the beach and follow the path past Wylie's Baths (a sea bath) and on to further to the board walk where you can walk out to the rocks and enjoy a quite time with a picnic or a book (or both). If you go north from Clovelly you will pass Bronte and Tamarama beaches and a great old graveyard. It is just a great walk. There are some steep steps but anyone of moderate fitness should be able to walk some or all of the walk.There is very little shade, so make sure you wear a hat, sunscreen and sunglasses. Take water with you to drink as there are some drinking fountains but they are far apart.Pick your day, try to avoid weekends as that is when the locals like to walk/jog the path and it can get crowded. Also, I would choose a sunny day so that your photos will have great ocean colour as well as sky. Take a little money with you as there are many cafes to buy drinks, lunch or ice-creams!Always remember that you can do as little or as much as you want. It is easy to get to and from the main beaches.This is one of the best free attractions in Sydney if not the world."

On Christmas Day 2011 when most Sydney area tourist attractions are closed, we took a taxi to Coogee Beach to begin a very pleasant oceanside walk along the Eastern Coastal Trail to Bondi Beach. The trail is paved, safely off road, loaded with informative signage about the local history and environmental features and is thankfully free of charge. It takes about two to three hours at a leisurely pace with the requisite many stops for pictures and the ever changing views and, although having a few ups and downs, is never stressful. The swells were from the South so most of the three or four beaches along the walk had lots of surfers and very limited room for swimmers \"between the flags\". but they all had grass to lay out on, trees for shade and refreshments for sale.Bondi Beach was hopping with Christmas celebrators decked out in red hats and bathing suits and not much else. As the sun started to set and the families left the scene, partying groups wearing only their Santa Claus hats began to streak for the water to the visual enjoyment of all. Cheers mate!"
