            "review": "excellent happy :o))). My friend and me spent three wonderful weeks in Nepal. Right at the beginning, we planned together with Adventure Himalaya Circuit Treks and Tours our trip through the country. We got a very good tour and offer.Our guide, Surendra, is not only a very good friend of mine (and now of us :o) ), but also an excellent guide. You can ask him any question and he is also interested in your life and your culture too. We talked a lot about this and that and had lots of fun and always a great time. And he is caring a lot about his clients and their needs.All the booked accomodations were perfect for what we needed and the tours were fun and what we were looking for.Thank you very much for your help and service.Best wishes,Jenny"

And it was the best idea ever as Mr Basu arranged everything (permissions, airplane tickets to Lukla, guide etc) for us. He was extremely helpful and proactive but at the same time opened to our ideas and personalized the trip exactly in the way we wanted. Excellent service and a truly nice and hospitable person! I totally recommend Mr Basu and his company!"

However when Mr Basu Lamsal jumped into my taxi from the airport, all was taken care of. He took me to his office and listened to what I was looking to get out of my experience to Nepal (which was some moderate trekking ,stunning views and a visit to Chitwan National Park). He put together an 8 day plan which included all of these things (5 day trek and 2 days Chitwan) plus a Kathmandu city tour. Everything went as well as I could have hoped and special thanks to my guide Bigyan who made the 5 day trek informative and fun. Definitely recommend this as a first time visitor to Nepal."

I was given an extremely good advice as to how I can use my 4 days to the fullest and was given a great guide (Dhrupa) for my 2 day trek.

I was quoted a very fair price ($70) for the one day hike - as compared to other tour agencies in Thamel that were trying to charge me double the price! The package included a private driver and guide - both of whom were wonderful hosts. After a short drive to Nagarkot, we drove up to the top of the hill for the best views of the Himalayas. From there, the driver went back down the hill to a neutral meeting point, while my guide and I hiked down together through the village. He knew the area like the back of his hand. Nice views of the surrounding countryside and farm terraces along the way. Without a doubt, I definitely give these guys a +++"

Our arrival flight was delayed, and he was quick to change the plan to pick us from the airport. The trekking was well planned and the guide and the porter were very friendly. The guide did his best to accommodate our requests, eg, we got two nights with attached shower over the four nights. We took some great photos during the trekking. On our return from Pokhara to Kathmandu, there was petrol shortage in Nepal, and the guide did his best to secure a private van for us. A van of 16 seater carrying only 4 people in total, which was a bit of extraordinary. My only suggestion for improvement is the English skills of the guide, which might make the trip even better. Overall, a great trekking experience!"

Our guide on the sightseeing tour did a very good job and spoke excellent english. Our guide on the hiking trip did also do a good job but we had some trouble due to his english skills. Not anything that made the hiking a bad experience though. Also the company made us a totalprice for the trip which incl. public transport, guide and so on. We payed 35$ for three persons for transportation, but it turned out that the price for the busses was only a maximum of 10 dollars total. Of course the company has to earn some money aswell, but we would prefer them to tell us the actual prices and then claim an administration fee instead. But in total a very good experience."

I had a week to look around and talk to other tour guides, and all failed to come close to the level of service and truth that adventure Himalayan circuit gave me.Purushottam and Prakash were the most friendliest and knowledgeable operators, it seem like every one else was just trying to get my business, and didn't care about my experience. Puru and Prakash really worked with me about which trek would be best for me, as I am very peculiar about it. I ended up doing three treks with them! They also made sure I got the right guide (as I was traveling alone and had special request on food and culture). They had me meet the guides to see if we would work well together. I ended up going with a different guide on all three treks since all of them were great! They really treated me like family. They helped me even plan my trip to other parts of nepal and organize my traveling plans to India. Given advice about where to buy certain items, food, and even hotels (I know a lot of the time these business are partners with each other and send their clients to same places, and if that was so, at least these were to best places working together). I never had a complaint they always made sure that everything was good and up to my standard. They were also young and knew how to communicate with all types of travelers.I had amazing adventures and treks with this company, that's why I sent any of my friends and other travelers to them, because I wouldn't want them to get poor quality service from elsewhere, it really ruins the experience. I mean your in the Himalayas, why not get the best for this lifetime opportunity! As far as pricing, they were more than fair. They work with your budget and style of comfort and traveling. I also must say if your loyal (like doing 3 treks with them) you'll really reap some benefits! I will be using them again, and remain to tell any and all people I know to book there treks with them."

After research, the best value package seemed to be offered by Adventure Himalaya and an itinerary put together by Prakash Lamsal that gave me the opportunity to enjoy a fulfilling 27 hours in and around the capital. With the aid of Prakash and his team I was able to visit the main sights around Kathmandu city, to savour a Nepalese dinner and show, to experience a 'once in a lifetime' plane flight up around Mount Everest, and to drive up into the hills to Nagarkot to witness the last rays of sun glowing off the distant snow-peaked mountains - before heading back to the airport. I left Nepal with only a few coins and a T-shirt which says \"I did not climb Mt Everest ..... but I touched it with my heart\". You did well Prakash, and thanks for the special treatment I feel you gave me, all for a reasonable price.

The prices for the services we were offered were very fair, actually much better than we have found in the internet (we had rather small budget). We decided to book a stay in the National park Chitwan with the travel agency. We booked 2 days and 3 nights in a hotel with usual program (elephant safari, jungle walk, bird watching, canoeing etc.). Unfortunately, we had some health problems and couldn\u00b4t manage our arrival as planned. Although we contacted Puru just the day before our scheduled arrival, there was no problem whatsoever to change the arrival date. In Chitwan we stayed in a perfectly nice hotel. From the room we overlooked the river. We had also a straight view on the elephant bathing spot and the jungle. The rooms were clean, spacious and air conditioned. Everything was to our full contempt - for a student-friendly price. After Chitwan we also booked a small hiking trip to the view point Nagarkot, near Kathmandu. We decided just the day before to do the hiking. We got a guide to show us the way and help us with the chaotic bus transportation. The travel agency of Mr. Rimal offered us services on a high level. He proved very flexible, friendly and above all reliable. The travel agency is trustworthy and can offer a wide range of trips and helpful information. He was our contact person throughout the whole stay. We can absolutely recommend him to everyone (not just students)."

After a quick check on the internet to verify they were a good company, I met with Kabi and we arranged a fantastic week of fun in Kathmandu and Pokhara. I had guides to explore the capital, a plane ride to see Everest, a 3 day hike in Pokhara, a rafting trip... all kinds of fun things! Kabi did a great job helping me pick out places to stay at reasonable prices and with arranging transportation from taxi's to private drivers to plane and bus rides. I thought the prices were great, and Kabi's checking in through out my stay made me feel safe and taken care of! Looking back, I was very lucky to have met him immediately upon my arrival!"

I travelled to Nepal with my best friend last month and one of the first people we met upon arriving at Kathmandu's Tribhuvan Intl Airport was Puru, and what luck that we did. He speaks excellent English, is very friendly and helpful, and provided lots of good travel tips and information for us. We booked a Buddha Air mountain flight through him and he was able to give us lower rates than was advertised on the airline's website, and we also used his driver's services for a day tour around Kathmandu and Thamel. Although the driver spoke little English and mostly kept to himself, he was nevertheless reliable and waited patiently for us while we explored the landmarks to our satisfaction. Puru also provided money exchange services, giving us much better rates than any of the other money changers in Thamel. We also had the chance to sit down with Puru for a chat and drinks, nothing business-driven, just as friends and indeed, we felt like we had made a friend in Nepal."

They were friendly guys to desk with and I'm happy with the pricing, I had shopped around and knew the general costs. I understand you can trek for significantly cheaper without a guide and arranging things on your own, but traveling solo, this was well worth the money and the prices were fair. My guide, Surendra, was fantastic. Friendly and a genuine good guy, he was great company, knowledgeable about the trek and Nepal in general, professional, and happy to flex plans to accommodate me joining others I met along the trail (which I've heard can be a problem sometimes). An absolute positive experience, and I am leaving Nepal with a new friend (he came out to join me for dinner and to say goodbye on my last evening in Katmandu - almost a week after the trek ended). Would recommend this company and enthusiastically recommend Surendra in particular. Gave this review 4 stars because I hardly ever give a prefect 5 star rating, and thought all the previous 5 star ratings they had looked suspicious."

Puru's knowledge, experience and use of English was exceptional which really put me at ease, he and his team including the always smiling Prakash and Krishna responded to challenges along the way with professionalism, calmness and with action which put us all as ease, e.g. when Peter sprained his ankle in the middle of the jungle, a crew was assembled, a path was cut through the jungle, a helipad was made for a helicopter to land and Peter was carried to safety! I can't rate you guys enough.

He didn't push us into anything we didn't want, allowed us to go at our own pace, and taught us so much about Nepal. Puru has a ton of love for his country and is eager to share it with others. The trip was well organized, thoroughly explained, and worry free. I would trust Puru to plan any trips for my family and friends."

They were very thorough and detailed, and whatever price quoted was exactly is - nothing more nothing less.Again - and I cannot stress this enough - they weren't pushy like other tour operators we came across! Made our lives so much easier.Doing a trek/ride with them was very well worth it. Definitely will be using their offers next time I'm headed there!"

I\u2019ve just returned from the Ultimate Tour of Nepal and want to make sure you know how to have the best Nepal tour possible. First, you want to make sure you choose a competent and experienced travel partner in Nepal that meets your requirements. We were lucky to find this in Makalu Adventures. By way of reference this trip was the annual \u2018adventure trip\u2019 that my brother and I (\u201cBrothers Rice\u201d) have taken for the last ~8 years. Over the years we have used all types of travel guides, group tours, private guides, day tours, etc. in over a dozen European, Asian, African, and South American countries. We have used both small local companies as well as large tour operators like Gap Tours (G Adventures) and Intrepid Travel. Our accommodations have ranged from basic bush camping to 5-star hotels and everything in between. Our budget is typically low to moderate so I believe I\u2019m well qualified to provide you with an honest and insightful review of Makalu Adventures for your consideration.Here is what we loved about Makalu Adventures:\u2022 Vast experience \u2013 they offer everything from city tours to mountain climbing.\u2022 Reviews \u2013 there is a reason people rave about Makalu. They do a great job.\u2022 Personable \u2013 The company is now large but still personable.\u2022 Charitable \u2013 The owner (Mohan) has rebuilt 3 schools already.\u2022 Flexible \u2013 Unlike large group tours Makalu will tailor your experience.\u2022 Affordable \u2013 Very affordable compared to other companies.\u2022 Unique \u2013 Makalu Adventures will give you a unique experience in Nepal.We spent two weeks touring Nepal with Makalu and got to see and do some amazing things including: trekking, meeting holy men, visiting the Ghats, temple tours, village tours, private tours, authentic dinners, jungle safari, white water rafting, and more. We really learned a ton about Nepal thanks to our guide Serius. There was simply no question about Nepal that he could not answer and we asked him about everything. With our city guide (Tulsi) we were able to learn a lot about Kathmandu and meet the living Goddess of Nepal.It\u2019s important to mention that at one point our tour had some issues and Mohan addressed and resolved these immediately. To me, the mark of a great company is not perfection (there is no such thing) but instead the ability to recover from snafus and delight the customer - and that\u2019s what we experienced with Makalu Adventures.Makalu also arranged for us to visit a village devastated by the earthquake and we donated school supplies to the children of a school that Makalu is rebuilding. This was an experience that was as rewarding for us as it was or them. In summary, the beauty of Nepal and welcoming nature of its people enchanted us.Namaste,-JayPS: some tips below to ensure you also have a great time in Nepal.Nepal travel tips:\u2022 Pack light \u2013 Especially if you are trekking or moving around a lot you don\u2019t want too much stuff to haul around. A backpack or small suitcase that fits inside a duffel bag is highly recommended. \u2022 Bring Duffel Bag - The duffel bag was a Huge benefit for our trip. It can be used to check the backpack or suitcase so it won\u2019t get wrecked. Plus, you can leave behind items at a hotel while you trek to lighten your load. And, you can pack souvenirs inside the duffel for your return trip.\u2022 Skimp on clothes \u2013 rookie mistake is packing too many clothes. Instead, plan to wear clothes more than once. Plan to wash clothes in Nepal (you can do this very inexpensively). Also, consider packing a small vial of laundry solution to wash clothes in the tub and air dry.\u2022 Bring Imodium \u2013 food adjustment will happen.\u2022 Understand Accommodations \u2013 Nepal is a developing country and most hotels are basic. A 4-star hotel may only be 1-2 stars in Europe or U.S.\u2022 Know Travel Durations \u2013 Important you know how long it may take on a bus, train, car, etc. before your next stop so you can still hydrate without worrying about an emergency \u2018code yellow\u2019 or \u2018code brown\u2019. \u2022 Get Power Adapter \u2013 Nepal is a wide 2-prong style plug unlike U.S.\u2022 Avoid Public Transport \u2013 I advise you avoid public transportation (buses especially) as they are overcrowded and drive erratically. A good company like Makalu will provide an experienced driver with solid transport in A/C.\u2022 Specify your needs \u2013 If you require a fluent English-speaking guide \u2013 specify it. If you require a highly knowledgeable guide on culture, location etc. vs. simply someone to go from A-B, then specify it. Etc.Trekking Tips:\u2022 Buy Some Gear in Nepal \u2013 Realize you can buy good gear cheap in Nepal so don\u2019t worry about bringing it all. Just pack a few essentials that are your personal preference. For example, we bought Black Diamond trekking poles for $15/each vs. $100/each in the U.S. Were they imitation? Not sure, but they worked fine and saved us on our trek.\u2022 Be Fit \u2013 Trekking more than a day is Tough work! Practice hiking at home, running, stairmaster etc. so you can be in shape for the trek.\u2022 Bring Toilet Paper! - There is NO toilet paper in the toilets or teahouse lodges.\u2022 Water Proof Hikers \u2013 Comfortable Waterproof hikers are Essential. I chose the low-cut Salomon 3D and they worked well.\u2022 Foot inserts \u2013 try this trick \u2013 buy Dr. Scholls (or similar) foot cushions and insert those (remove the stock ones) if your feet get sore and it\u2019s like having another pair of shoes on the trail. \u2022 Get shower slippers \u2013 ok the showers are Gross so you should buy a pair of ultra-thin flip-flops to use for showering.\u2022 Micro-Towel \u2013 you may not find towels (or clean ones) in the lodges so you may want to pack a good micro-towel like the Sea to Summit antimicrobial towel from REI that packs down smaller than a banana. \u2022 Bring Energy \u2013 Recommend you bring protein bars, nuts, or energy chews (like Stinger or Bonk Buster) to help you through the trek.\u2022 Bring hand sanitizer \u2013 there is often no way to wash your hands.\u2022 Match gear to season - Warm weather is warm all the time except high altitudes so you only need 1-2 warm layers in summer etc.\u2022 Bring Rain Gear! \u2013 Highly recommend you bring a small packable raincoat and rain pants too. My choice for coat is the Helium II by Outdoor Research as it packs small and breathes well. Columbia makes good rain paints.\u2022 Get pack rain fly \u2013 In monsoon season particularly your pack will get soaked so invest in a rain cover.\u2022 Bring Hair+Body Wash \u2013 I\u2019ve found the shampoo in Nepal was not that good for hair&body washing. There will be None in the basic lodges. My go-to is Bronners soap which can be used for washing hair, body, clothes etc. it gets the grime off and packs easily.\u2022 Bring hydration tablets \u2013 you will sweat bullets on the trek and need to replenish electrolytes. These are also required in tropical climates or to prevent dehydration due to stomach problems.\u2022 Bring Sleeping liner \u2013 The tea lodges are not always clean. The beds are often dirty so a sleeping bag liner is highly recommended to use so that you don\u2019t need to get into a dirty bed. The coolmax green bag liner with bug protection is my lifesaver. It packs down to the size of a grapefruit, breathes well, and protects against mosquitos and bed bugs too. In an unclean room I\u2019ll Only sleep in my liner and even in tropical climates I\u2019ll sleep on top of the other blankets on my liner.

Makalu Adventure Travel is quite simply one of the best tour companies to experience the magnificence of the Himalayan region: either side of the border \u2013 Nepal or Tibet. The care and attention from Mohan Lamsal, the Managing Director and his team from my recent trip there was unsurpassed \u2013 with every attention to detail so well taken care of, that by the time you leave, you feel a part of the Makalu family. Whatever trip you dream up, the talented team at Makalu will make it a reality. The local guides are top notch and will provide you with a deep understanding of the region. I was fortunate to have spent time with various guides in both Nepal and Tibet visiting monasteries and golden temples with the majestic Himalayan Mountains as the backdrop, along with the chance of a lifetime to travel to the base camp at Mt. Everest in Tibet. I also submerged myself in the ancient capitals of Kathmandu and Lhasa where I learned so much about the local customs and met so many wonderful people. During my time there, I wanted to find a way to help after the devastation wrought by the powerful earthquake, and Mohan arranged for me to visit Taruka, one of the hill towns north of Kathmandu that was severely damaged. Mohan and his team have been on the ground since the earthquake hit providing assistance and help to families of Taruka and are now overseeing the construction of three schools in the area (with one already completed thanks to past travelers of Makalu). During our time at Taruka, we spent several hours with the school children in their temporary schools made from bamboo and blue tarp. We read them stories and handed out school supplies and by the time we left the children had completely stolen our hearts. If you want to help out in writing the next chapter of Nepal then please do visit this magnificent country -- they have done so much work to recover from the earthquake and you will be amazed at how little evidence there in the aftermath of this earthquake in Kathmandu and the major tourist areas. And while you are visiting Nepal, you can always visit Taruka for yourself and see the tremendous progress being made there. Namaste and happy travels!"

I and my boyfriend, Jason, traveled to Nepal looking for a local experience. We wanted to eat incredible food, live with a family, and really experience life as a Nepali. Of course, we also hoped to see the standard city sites as well. When we arrived, Mohan picked us up, gave us warm welcomes and brought us to a beautiful home. We were greeted by an adorable young boy. I asked Mohan, \"How do you know this family?\". He answered, \"This is my family. This is my son, Sampson.\" Though the next five days, I would grow to learn about the history of Nepal, its struggles with the earthquake, complex government relations with neighboring countries, and understand so much about the character and dedication of the Nepali people. Mohan's incredible wife, cooked us many meals, fed us fresh fruit, and always had flavorful milk tea at the ready. She made us feel like home. I came home and told my own mother that my Nepali mother in Kathmandu takes care of me better than she does. :) Mohan's two sons were amazing. The eldest, a highschool senior, is full of potential, and told us about aspirations of coming to the states. He also mentioned Mohan's difficult career starts, as a porter. On a way to dinner one evening, the son casually mentioned Mohan getting emotional while being interviewed about his beginnings. His story is a happy one because his family is well cared for. All of Mohan's hard work has earned him an incredible reputation of being a knowledgeable trekker, a caretaker, and well connected. During these five days, we visited a guesthouse that Mohan co-owns, and learned about a yoga retreat that he manages. We also had dinner with a group of trekkers from Switzerland who have trekked with Mohan and his company over TWENTY times. This time, they weren't returning to trek. They were returning to rebuild a school. This is an example of the connections that Mohan creates. I was floored and amazed. Also during the trip, there was a group of trekkers on a hike, and one was sick from altitude sickness. Mohan frequently visited to make sure that he was comfortable and feeling okay. I truly believe that his team goes above and beyond.DUring our five day stay, we saw many things that the city had to offer. We also took a trip up north to Bhattedanda Homestay, where we learned about the story of Fulmaya Tamang. This was an incredible experience because we were able to understand one woman's plight to fend for her family. She started a women's co-operative and empowered many families to send their children to school, and many women to make a respectable income. I would come back to Nepal in a heartbeat, and I highly recommend Mohan and Makalu."

Makalu Adventures provided a wonderful experience as both a first visit (for my wife) and re-introduction to this fascinating country. The first couple of days was spent in Kathmandu where Makalu provided superb city guides to help us navigate the rich heritage of the area, providing interesting information without overloading us. From Kathmandu, we transferred to Pokhara where Makalu Adventures had selected a wonderful pre-trek hotel for us. The five day trek was led by Tenzing and took us past verdant paddy fields and up through the rhododendron forests to the summit of Poon Hill and back. The guest houses were always welcoming and the no one could have done more to help ensure that we enjoyed ourselves. Our guide and porter were happy to let us walk at our own pace and helped create a fantastic experience that will stay with us for a long time. We had a couple of nights in Pokhara post-trek and then back to Kathmandu where we visited Bhaktapur before doing last minute tourist shop and heading to the airport. Throughout, Makalu Adventures went out of their way to ensure that we had a fantastic experience in Nepal. All staff were so helpful and we look forward to returning in a few years.

The organization, accommodations, schedule, meals, guides, cooks, price were perfect. The main guide did his best to ensure safety - following the latest protocols on altitude sickness avoidance (climb high, sleep low, acclimatization climbs, limit daily altitude gain), reminding me to be careful around yaks and steep trail sections. The guide carried my mountaineering gear etc, which is essential: it is very difficult to get used to the altitude even with a light pack. Got assistance with every meal etc.I successfully reached Kalapathar to view Everest, the valley of the base camp, the Khumbu ice fall, etc. Seemed like more than half failed due to previous overexertion or altitude sickness. Note, if you go to Everest Base Camp, you only go to the tourist part where you stand on the edge of the glacier and get a picture by a sign. The actual EBC climbers don't want visitors bringing illness.I successfully climbed Island Peak with assistance from an excellent climbing guide. It was a very long day starting at 1am, but I made it! After a very long climb in the dark, you have to climb a very steep snow field with fixed lines and an ice axe.The organizers helped keep the trip on schedule even with unforseen problems, including weather-related flight delays and a severe fuel crisis. (They also helped me in trying to fix a mistake I made.) Several other travelers were repeat customers. If you're comparing companies, be sure to compare itinery and what is included / excluded from the final price. You'll be shocked at what US-based travel companies are trying to charge for the exact same trip.The Nepalese have worked hard to prepare for tourists after the earthquake. Many of the tourist areas have been rebuilt. Everything was open for tourism. There were daily power outages in Kathmandu, but did not affect meals or the day trips.Thanks again, Makalu Adventures!"

We went with Makalu Adventure due to their professionalism, communication, competitive pricing and how easy it was to deal with the different options presented. This included transfers to and from the airport, transport to Besisahar and a day trip visiting the sites in Kathmandu.We were one day into our trek on 25 April 15 when a large earthquake hit the region. This was obviously devastating, however with everyone telling us to get out, we decided with the help or our guide and Makalu Adventure to stay and go west to the relative safety of Pokhara. We then arranged an excellent trek from there. Through all the disruption, we were able to travel by Bus, Jeep, Taxi and jeep again, all due to the excellent communication that was obviously going on behind the scenes between our guide and Makalu Adventure. Thanks for keeping us safe."

Even though we only gave about a weeks notice, Makalu Adventure worked with us to create a custom package that achieved our goals that was within our budget.The experience we had trekking was absolutely amazing. In addition to the scenery being the best tin the world, we met very friendly locals and had an amazing team. Our guide had decades of experience and worked very hard to ensure that both my wife and I were comfortable and happy (Guide_name_was_Tek) . He always went the extra mile to make sure we had sanitary food and the best room/beds available at each of the tea houses. Our porter and is also a newly minted trekking guide. He was a great person to have along because we had great jokes and a lot of information.There are many trekking company you can choose from, but Makalu Adventures is world class and will make sure you have a amazing and unique experience at a price you can afford. Also, if you decide to go for the Manaslu Circuit (highly recommended), definitely add on the Tsum Valley detour; it is well worth the extra time and money.Enjoy!Visited June 2014"

I have used Makalu Adventure on several occasions in recent years both to organise Kathmandu hotels and tours prior to long camping treks - as well as to organise the treks themselves (refer my last review in 2012). Most recently they organised a Kathmandu Valley tour that included Patan and the interesting village of Khokana - the guide provided was an academic with vast knowledge of the architecture, history and culture of the sites visited; as well as being very personable.The Makalu team continue to deliver an excellent service and I can recommend them for all your Nepal tour needs in the Kathmandu Valley or across the remotest part of the Nepal (where the quality of your outfitter is critical)."

We did the Jiri to Everest base camp walk with 4 Sherpa. Makalu's organisation was terrific in every area. We really enjoyed walking with our Sherpas, we liked that it was the low season and not many tourists. You do have to have good gear though as it was often very cold and the heating in the hotels mostly is in the main eating areas, we often ended up in the kitchens with the families - WHICH WE LOVED! Of course we loved the spectacular mountains, but for us the best part was walking in from Jiri to the National Park, the Nepalise in the villages on the way were so friendly and welcoming, it was less commercial. Our Makalu guide was terrific, and in the early days while we got our walking legs sorted he would help massage calves, knees and thighs that ached so much ...and got us on our feet so we made it to Kala Patar! Our porters and support person/cook were lovely people and so helpful. Some of the huts right up high such as Dengbouche were very cold in the bedrooms, it is essential to have sleeping bags in this area that can deal with minus 20 and good clothes - and good hiking boots, we did. In the winter low season in the really cold places you need to sleep with camera batteries - they freeze! The food we were served on the way was excellent,(we had garlic soup every night and dahl bhat for lunch every day - we never got tired of it.. and sometimes one of the Makalu team would cook - he was great! Best Hash browns and eggs for breakfast I've ever had! The Hotel we stayed at in Kathmandu was fantastic - and very welcome after 20 days in the mountains trekking! The staff in Kathmandu and on the road were fantastic and great so helpful and accommodating, they were wonderful company! Especially we liked the evenings all huddled around the potbelly fires talking with our sherpas and hotel staff.We really want to come back soon and organise another holiday - thank you Makalu Adventures - you are a very efficient, friendly and professional company.

This trip was absolutely awesome ! A once in a lifetime experience. I highly recommend it."

This is a trip for the true adventurer!! The guides were great - thank you! - and cooks prepared amazing foods, but the true entertainment on this trip was found in the cultural sites, the temples and monasteries, the hours spent on the bike, and definitely being in the presence of Mt.

After booking the tour i questioned myself, my fitness and my sanity! therefore i wrote a lot of emails with a lot of questions and got fast helpful responses. Once i met the Sherpa's and Organisers from Makalu adventures most of my worries went away (altitude sickness was still a concern). They were very reasuring and knowledgeable as well as treating us to some great Nepalise customs and tours. Once the cycle ride began in Lhasa all my worries went away. The sherpa's were the most supportive and encourgaing people I have ever met. They even carried my bag from the truck to the tent / hotel after a long day in the sadle. The food was excellent, so good we asked if we could have 'pappa' cook for us every night even when in hotels. The only warning i have is learn how to repair and look after your bike before starting the ride! i had to learn along the way, and thanks to the group i was with i am now at least if not more knowledgeable than my friends back home :) I would definutly recomend Makalu Adventures."

The crew cleaned me up and dressed my wounds with great care and then took me to hospital for an xray. The news was bad so we had to drive back to Lhasa for a flight back to Nepal. At all times the crew were extremely helpful, organising hotel rooms and food as well as dealing with the immigration people. The crew from Kathmandu picked me up from the airport and looked after me until my flight back to Perth.For the time I was there the trek was amazing, the food great and the crew extremely helpful. I will be returning next year to finish the journey and will definitely book with Makalu Adventures."

An amazing mtb trip,after much research decided to use Makalu to guide us across the Himalayas via base camp,the staff,guides and organisation where excellent everything done with a smile,cant praise them enough. The cycling was more of an endurance event,the altitude making it much tougher than you can imagine,so get some serious training in before taking this trip on,camping at Rongbuk and waking up to see Everest made all the hard climbs and sore butts worth while,  We went in September and most of the time it was warm daytime,and around freezing at nights,we had a couple of sleety showers but only on one or two days,You will need a down sleeping bag we bought fake ones in Kathmandu and they where fine,although they did tend to shed feathers so probably wouldn't last to long. If your going to do this route use Makalu the price is right the guides are really on the case,the catering was surprisingly good ,the camping and washing in glacier streams just add to the adventure"

It was 2 days after our trek was finished and any agreement was no longer bonding the company with us, but all of them were very helpfull and nice. Danku met us on the street just grabbed our luggage and carried it for us.We did 8 days trekking from Lukla to Tyanboche and it was great! Everything was well organized and planned. The guide was very competent. We felt taken care of. And in case of a problem, when weather kept us in Lukla, everyone in there, including the owner were very involved to help find the solution.We also used the company for the 3-days trip to Chitwan National Park and it was great as well.I already recommended Makalu Adventure to my friend, who plans trekking in Nepal.Thanks a lot guys for such a great experience!

All of us in the group achieved remarkable success. As I had a lung dissease, it was with some trepidition that I agreed to take on the challenge of going to 4,000 metres, but though very difficult, it was worth the effort. Needless to say, I could not have managed to get so far without the excellent, careful, detailed planning and organisation of Mr Mohan's travel company Makalu Adventures. Oxygen was even available if I needed it, which thankfully I did not. It was the most thoroughly organised photography trip I have been on, and I have been on nine previous trips all over the world.I can thoroughly recommend Makalu Adventures for all those travellers who want to travel to such remote places in the world, who want the security of knowing their hotels, food, transport and guides will be skilled and reliable.

My party of four Americans chose Makalu Adventures for a seventeen day trek in the Nar-Phu area of Nepal as well as touring Kathmandu and Pokhara. Mohan and his staff took excellent care of us throughout. They picked us up from the airport, arranged our local lodging, hired highly knowledgeable English-speaking guides who showed around both cities. I couldn't speak more highly of our trekking crew as well. Our guides knew our trekking route well and were always attentive to our needs. . Our always cheerful cook and his helpers managed to roll out excellent food even in remote locations. In short, at the end of our stay in Nepal, we felt nothing but great admiration and respect for all the people we worked with at Makalu Adventures. In the next year or so I want to return to Nepal and I would consider no other trekking operation than Makalu Adventurs."

At this stage of the trek we saw no other westerners.At all times our crew took exceptional care of us and the variety of food that our cook produced was exceptional.In short, Makalu Adventure once again proved to be setting the standards that other companies should aspire to."

The accomodation in general was good It was always clean but sometimes a little too basic and we came to realise that just because a tea house claimed they had hot showers didn't necessarily mean the water was hot, or that they had water! Food was generally good, although with every place having the same menu, after 3 weeks, you're over it!!Wifi was available in most tea houses but limited in strength of signal.The Kathmandu city tour was very good, Dil our guide was extremely informative.I would highly recommend using ACE for any trek and thank you Nirajan, Chandra and Gakul for a wonderful time in Nepal, hopefully I will be back."

We were paired with a couple of other trekkers and Santosh, our guide and his crew tirelessly looked after our comfort and safety and got us over the 17,800 ft Thorung La Pass without a hitch. Santosh's outdoor skills and leadership abilities are par excellence and Prem truly runs an outstanding company. I had a spectacular experience and I would not hesitate to book my next trip to Nepal with Ace."

They're easy to communicate with - Sajiya and Kathy are very prompt to provide the info needed. My trek was EBC with Island Peak , 19 days plus I did a 3 day city tour . Prem Khatry owns and runs a great business, I had the pleasure of seeing him a couple of times , he's very involved with each and every group that signs up with his company. To take personal interest speaks volumes ! My trekking guide was Rajan Rokaha - Raj - what an amazing guy ! Beyond his knowledge, people skills , flexible and tactful , funny and caring , I felt like I was in the most capable hands trekking through the beautiful mountains! I'd book my next adventure based on his availability!! Oh , and had it not been for Raj I wouldn't have some fun and spectacular pictures from this trip !!! On my birthday he surprised me with a cake and made arrangements to get blessings from one of the Buddhist monks at Tengboche monastery .. Talk about going above and beyond! He's a top notch man !Surya was one of the porters - an absolute delight ! Both of them made sure that all is running smoothly more so during the tough parts of this trip. Pemba and Pema were at Island Peak and there's no denying the skills they have to take people up the mountain. Communication was less forthcoming than what I would've liked given that I'm a novice at technical climbs but this was one part of my trip. And Prem has found a solution to improve it , thank you Prem. Trekking in the Himalayas is difficult and AMAZING and it matters a great deal which company you choose to facilitate it ! Go Ace !!!!!! My city guide Dil is a well of knowledge and information about Nepal , its history, people , faith , philosophy! I learnt so much going around Kathmandu valley with him !He's easy going , very sweet and patient and he's enriched my knowledge a great deal ! I highly recommend Ace The Himalaya, they've made this an unforgettable, memorable experience for me ! Thank you Raj , Surya , Dil , Pemba, Pema , Sajiya and Prem !"

My first trip was in October 2014 on the Everest Base Camp Trek. The guides (Toya and Sunil) were very helpful and professional, it was an overall remarkable trip! The most recent trip I just returned from 2 weeks ago, was to Annapurna Base Camp. I was so impressed and pleased with booking with Ace The Himalaya before, there was no question that I would book with them again for this trek. Once again our guide Kamal was very professional and good at leading us and answering questions. Our porters were very friendly and pleasant as well. It's nice having local guides and porters so you really get to experience the culture and have competent people leading you. Since this second trip was after the earthquake I was curious how things in Nepal may have changed, but everything I saw and experienced with Ace The Himalaya was still first class and I felt very safe being in Nepal throughout the entire trip. I highly recommend this company to anyone!"

There was a cook who produced delicious meals and our guide, Raju, who looked after us everyday was excellent. He also took us on the trek and encouraged us along the way when things got tough!

I was so attracted the great idea of combining volunteering and trekking that I decided to book it right there and then. The program not only delivered what it said it would on the website, it was bettered by the excellent guidance from our tour guide Raju whom I felt privileged to meet. Raju has been a fantastic tour guide in many ways. He always make sure we were well during volunteering and trekking. He triple checked that we never left anything in the hotel or guesthouses. He answered to all the questions - touristy or personal - we had for him. He put us at ease in every situation with great sense of humour. He sent me to airport and makes sure everything is OK. Throughout this trip, he became not just a tour guide but also a friend. Overall, I highly recommend this tour if you like to help rebuilding Nepal yet also enjoy a little bit of trekking and sightseeing. You'd get to see the beautiful places as Nepal is well known for, and also meet the beautiful people throughout the journey."

He was very personable and thoughtful, always checking in with my group to make sure our needs were met and we were having a good time. With any issues that came up, he was quick to address them himself straight to the source. I could absolutely count on him. My guide Rajan and his assistant guide Rabi were just spectacular. They were professional all the way, keeping us apprised of the trek and what to expect all the way. They were prepared for any issues that could possibly occur (which did!) My brother had altitude sickness and had to quit the trek. They came up with a plan to guide the rest of the team, along with getting mine and his belongings separated properly and carried them back and forth from where my brother had to stop and where the next guesthouse was. They were phenomenal in their care. I'm truly thankful for their care, their professionalism and their personable warm nature."

Not to mention, the food exceeded all expectations my team had for it, and Santosh would never fail to ask us if we had sufficient food and if he could help us in anyway. During the trek, Santosh and Dipesh never failed to entertain us with their humour, but more importantly they never stopped encouraging us to push harder until we reached our destinations. It was so amazing having such funny, sociable and knowledgeable guides, as they were able to answer many of the queries which we had. Although we didnt communicate much with our porters, they were always smiling, and never failed to help us out. Thank you santosh for making our trip to Nepal truly amazing, and always going the extra mile to help us in anyway possible. You were always attentive to the smallest details, and our trip wouldnt have been the same if not for you. You make us want to come back to Nepal to explore, and trek more.

From the start of the enquiry, I was asking alof of questions to Prem, the MD. He religiously answered each and every one of them with much patience. It was a first hand experience of dedication that I experienced. My guide for the trek was Nimesh Nepal and porter, Dipak Thamang. Nimesh is an excellent guide, and a better friend, who made us feel safe in his care all the time. We were 2 ladies, so trust and comfort were important to us when assessing a guide, whom we have to be with for the next 12 days. Nimesh is very mature for his age, and very interestingly, he is able to switch from a professional, serious guide, to a friend who could make us laugh with his silly jokes. The strenuous, long, trek over 12 days were spent playing catching and throwing snowballs, discussing life values, drawing portraits, dancing in the snow, and so much laughing. We enjoyed every moment. During the times when the whether wasn't too good, Nimesh switched to a seemingly serious, professional guide whom we can depend on for safety and navigation. He was also taking care of his porter, Dipak very well, ensuring his safety. Just like how a leader should be.Dipak is a young 20 year old porter, who has such strength. He speaks minimal English, so we don't converse much. However, for many times, he went beyond his duties as a porter, and took care of us ladies by catching us when we fall, and staying back to walk slowly with us, rather than just walking at his usual fast speed and porting the bags from point A to point B. The entire experience was life-changing, amazing, and I give 10 stars..heck even 100 stars, for such excellent service. Thank you Ace the Himalaya!!"

We were paired with another couple that we absolutely loved and have become life-long friends with, and we cannot say enough amazing things about our guide, Suman. He went above and beyond every day to make sure we were comfortable, that all our many questions about the culture and areas we were in were answered, and that we were having the best time possible. And it worked! We plan to stay in touch with Suman as he is just a wonderful person in general, and hope we can come back to Nepal soon and try the Anna Purna Circuit with Ace and Suman! I also wanted to say that we met multiple like-minded trekkers along the way that we became friends with and compared our guides and companies, and without a doubt, Ace the Himalaya was the easiest to work with, offered the best prices, and they were so helpful getting everything set up for us both before and after the trek. Their whole team combined made what could have been a very complicated trip considering foreign travel, multiple groups, etc so organized and well managed.If you're looking for an adventurous trip with some of the most spectacular views in the world, a place to meet fantastic people, and a company that will help you do it- Ace is the place to go and Suman is the man to request!! You will not be disappointed with your trip- it's impossible, believe me!Crystal & NatMaine USA"

The whole experience was made easy because of them and their very caring staff. Our lead guide Santosh was amazing and took care of everything...I didn't have to worry about a thing. We started our trip with the rebuild program in Arupokhari where we helped with the early stages of the foundations. The work was hard but we all came together as a team and I found it to be one of the most rewarding things I have ever done. The cooks looked after us very well and ensured we were well fed...i celebrated my birthday on the rebuild and the cooks made me a birthday cake...a chocolate one at that! We left this amazing little village and went off to our next adventure which was our trek to Poon Hill...and all I can say is ...wow....words cannot express how fantastic it was. The scenery....the village life...even the numerous tea and guest houses we passed on our way up...and up we went! Santosh eased us all up there and when we finally got to Poon Hill we all sat in wonder....just magnificent. My whole experience in Nepal is hard to put into words but the mix of humanitarian work with a trek is a winner. I encourage anyone to do the 13 day rebuild and Annapurna trek with Ace. They just made everything so easy. I trust them which is why I have just booked the Everest Base Camp trek with them...I wouldnt do it with anyone else."

I would say it was a once in a life time trip, but we were so impressed with Nepal and our experience with Ace (our guide, Santosh, was the best!) we have decided we are going back in a few years. We chose the Rebuild-Poon Hill Trek program through Ace, since it felt like one of the best ways to give back to a community that was devastated by the 2015 earthquake. Arrival and departure at the airport were taken care of by Ace, making travel days less stressful. Our drivers to get to the village of Arupokhari were very skilled, both navigating Kathmandu traffic and on the 4 wheel drive roads to the village. In the village we were housed in a tented camp, with comfortable sleeping pads provided. All the meals cooked for us were excellent, and there was always plenty of food. The green beans, while one of the more simple dishes, was one of the most memorable (probably due to all the butter and garlic!). Everything was always very tasty. Our volunteering work was helping to clear and level the foundation of the house, followed by helping with the early stages of foundation building. It was hard work, but very rewarding. Life in the village was also a rewarding experience. I did get sick while in the village (rookie mistake, don't drink the \"safe drinking water\" in the 5 gallon jugs at the airport), and Santosh was an excellent caregiver. He took me to the medical center in Aarughat and the Dr there knew exactly what to do. I was out of commission for one day of volunteering, but thanks to Santosh's quick actions to getting me to the medical center it was only one day. The trekking to Poon Hill was an equally amazing experience. We lucked out with the first break in clouds in a few days, resulting in a sunset hike as opposed to sunrise.All in all, we had an wonderful time with Ace the Himalaya. Santosh, our assistant guide Dipesh(spelling), the porters, cooks, and drivers were all fantastic. 10/10 would recommend, and we will be booking with Ace again when we come back in a few years! Technical recommendations: bring 3 passport pictures with you... Ace needs 2 and the travel visa needs 1. Water purification tablets were needed on the trek, either bring from home (what we did) or be prepared to buy in Pokhara. Trekking poles are recommended, you can cheap but reliable ones in Kathmandu or Pokhara for 800 rupees."

Accommodation overall were good, some places probably the best what one can expect. Thorough research is essential, especially when you are a first time trekker in the Himalayas.

A lot of people questioned our sanity, Trekking in January, but the weather was perfect, mostly cloudless days and only one day of snow. There were few people of the trail so it was very peaceful and added to the feeling of being away from civilization. Temperatures were cold in the early morning and at night, but once the sun came out, it was near perfect temperature for hiking. Prem runs a well organized organization. His staff was right on time to pick us up at the airport. They were helpful in helping us find last minute gear and trekking items that we needed. I might add that EVERYTHING you need for a trek like this is available in the Thamel, tourist area at 25% to 50% of what you would pay in the states. It is all chinese copies of the originals, backpacks, coats, gloves, sleeping bags etc, available at a fraction of what I paid in the states. I realize that the quality may not be quite as good as the originals, but unless you are a professional trekker, save the money and help the Nepalese economy. If I were to do it all over, I would have arrived with only my broken in hiking boots and and empty suitcases. The amount I would have saved on gear, would have paid for my trek.Nepal is in a state of turmoil right now. It is surrounded on three sides by India and China (Tibet) on the north. Since the Earthquake, the high mountain pass from China into Nepal is closed. Nepal imports virtually everything from India. India does not approve of the new Nepalese constitution and with one of their political parties which is trying to be less reliant on India, so India has created a blockade on exports into Nepal. This has made gas, diesel and propane very difficult to obtain. There are lines two days long from people waiting to purchase 5 liters of gasoline for their scooters and motorcycles and 10 liters for their cars. If you need more gasoline, people are paying as much as $20 a gallon on the black market. It also created an electrical shortage, There were planned blackouts and we generally only had electricity for 10 or 12 hours a day. This makes for a difficult environment to live in or run a business. I am sure that this is a temporary issue and the two governments will work it out soon, but even operating under these difficult conditions, Ace The Himalaya, kept things running smoothly. It was business as usual, they got us out to our different side tours right on time, kept us well fell and absorbed all the additional operating expenses they were experiencing.All of the Ace team took great care of our group. The office staff was well organized and friendly, our guide Kumar and his assistant Kamal were great. They were true professionals/ They always had a smile on their faces and kept our group of 9 hikers with different skill and experience levels together.We had two 70 year old men in our group, they kept them at the right pace, helped them with their backpacks when needed and made sure that everyone made it to base camp. This is not an easy trek, it was much more demanding than any of us realized, but they helped us all make it to Base Camp.Our porters were amazing. I am still in awe, that these young men were carrying 70 to 90 pounds on their backs, up and down difficult terrain, always smiling! and they would beat us to our next stopping point to have lunch or dinner ready for us as soon as we got there. The trek was amazing!, The landscape and scenery were beyond description. I took thousands of pictures and I could not capture the complete beauty before my eyes. It must be experienced to comprehend. I simply cannot give these guys enough praise. If you have ever thought about visiting the Himalayas. DO IT! meet the great people of Nepal. Experience this diversity of cultures and religions. Help out these great people in their post earthquake time of need. Help bring in tourist money and give them the jobs they need to rebuild their lives and their Country. Do not think of using anyone else for your trek. Ace the Himalaya is a first class act. Book with them and be confident that you found the best. Experience the Himalayas! I have traveled a lot and this trip was an unforgettable, life changing experience."

Whilst i previously traveled with a friend and a small group to Everest Base Camp , I returned on this occasion with my teenage daughter , a close friend and his teenage son - a good number for trekking. As before we met several different people and groups along the way - so much fun and so interesting and entertaining ! Ace were as on my previous trip absolutely fantastic and professional. From the staff and management in Kathmandu to our wonderful guide Kumar, our trip was unforgettable . On our arrival in Kathmandu we were met by Ace and transferred to our hotel, the Gaju Suites which was clean and centrally located in Thamel. The rooftop bar/ restaurant is particularly good. We then transferred by minivan to Pokhara , a challenging 5 hour drive (!) and then after a night's stay to the Annapurna base camp trek for 9 days . The trek itself takes in some magnificent scenery, staying at little hotels/ tea house houses throughout. Best to be a vegetarian in the mountains :) It's hard to praise Ace and particularly our guide Kumar enough . The team make the trip to this amazing country so enjoyable and unforgettable . Whilst the trekking can be challenging its more than worthwhile and a visit to Nepal leaves a deep and lasting impression. I've no doubt that we will return to Nepal again soon and will most certainly trek again with the team from Ace . Many thanks to Prem , Kumar and our wonderful porters - Namaste !"

My wife and I undertook a trek to Everest Base Camp in December 2015 with Ace the Himalaya and we cannot recommend this tour company highly enough. From meeting our guide Madan upon our arrival to being returned back to the airport following our trek, we were attended to at every stage. We were taken to the company offices for a briefing of what to expect and to go over the itinerary where it was obvious that AtH were experts in this type of trek. We immediately felt confident and at ease that our trip would be a success at a time when we were a little nervous about our undertaking.We have to single out our guide Madan for particular thanks - his reassurance, patience and knowledge were invaluable to us and we left him after our trek with a heavy heart. Everything he did for us felt like it was done out of friendship, rather than as part of his role. Our porter Prakass was also a great addition to the group - he ferried our duffel bags to each teahouse we stayed at, effortlessly it seemed despite the incline of the hills we were climbing, and always with a smile on his face.This really was the holiday of a lifetime for us but it was made extra special by the excellent organisation of AtH but moreso because of the incredible service delivered by its staff. When we return to Nepal, we will definitely be using AtH as our tour operator and will request Madan to rejoin us on a trek.Many thanks to Prem and all his staff for an amazing trek."

I travelled in January after the earthquake, so it was just me and the guide, Sunil. Sunil and I were brothers: 40K of biking every day and a combination of resorts and tea houses gave me the full perspective of Nepalese lifestyle. The biking was followed up by a four hour drive to Chitwan, where another guide named Krishna led me on a day-long safari through Chitwan National Park. I also spent three nights in Kathmandu. I can't imagine getting more bang for my buck on a trip. Highly recommend."

As both a solo and first-time traveler to Nepal, I was not only concerned about just seeing the sights, but also about my safety, my health, getting around, and not making mistakes that would jeopardize my adventure. I could not speak highly enough of Ace and its staff. Kedar provided so much information about the history of Nepal, the people, the religions, and, of course, the sights we visited. He is such a sweet and patient man. He even guided me in my shopping excursions to purchase authentic and handmade mandalas, mala beads, and healing bowls. My trek on the EBC trail was amazing. Raj took care of everything including providing a hot water bottle for a particularly cold night. He was always \"protecting\" me (in terms of the food, water, and physical elements of the trek, not in others doing harm to me...that was never a concern) while he let me do my own thing and go at my own pace. I was able to sort of experience trekking on my own while having what felt like a guardian angel in sight. If you want company, he's there. If you want to walk alone, he lets you do that too. Great guide and all around good guy! I will use Ace again when I return!"

Ace so far has helped complete two homes for large families and we began the foundations for a third. It was hard work but the families in the village constantly offer food and drink, making you feel welcome. Ace also supplies delicious food (cooked by a very friendly chef named Pemba). And when all the hard work is done for the day, I played football with the kids when they were out of school. I decided to do this trip solo, make myself to meet new people, and the Ace guide brought me in like family. Santosh is an amazing guide and constantly is working to make sure everyone taken care of. The second half of the trip was trekking to poon hill, and again Santosh makes sure the lodge is friendly/accommodating. Of course for this portion we required porters to carry the heavier bags. Their names were Dipess and Rufess, both were always smiling and went as fast or slow as the group required. Overall I will recommend this trip to everyone. It's one thing to visit Nepal and trek, like most do. However with the addition of rebuilding homes you become more a part of their community and have a more fulfilling experience. Ace offers all this and the bonus of an excellent staff. This is a trip I will never forget"

The accomodations and food were much better than I had anticipated. Of course, be prepared for bare minimum as you move further up the mountain, but everything was clean and the people were always very courteous and accomodating.Follow the equipment list Ace provides and you should be great. If you are young and athletic or live at altitude, this particular trek will not be too big of a challenge. If not, I would reccomend some incline and stair climber training to be prepared for a few of the grueling days of nonstop incline/decline."

I'm so glad that we did not give into fear and cancel or alter our trip. Everything worked out fine and the country is determined to keep a good level of service for tourism. We were met by a driver on our arrival to Kathmandu and that made the transition to the hotel very easy. The accommodations set up on this trip were clean and comfortable. Ace provided plenty of support during the trek. Our lead guide Kishore was so helpful, encouraging, and fun as he lead our group to the top. He had much to offer in terms of history and geography of the area. The porters that carried our gear were helpful and cheerful and were well treated by the company. Our gear arrived before us every day without fail. Everyone in our group made it successfully to Everest Base Camp including a 12 year old boy and an amazingly fit and accomplished 68 year old. The scenery on the trek was so beautiful, but I would definitely say that being part of this group made it infinitely more enjoyable. It's a great way to travel. Definitely check out Ace the Himalaya- you will a see a highly professional company run by local people who are invested in the community and are giving back and supporting areas in need across Nepal."

Rabi, our assistant guide, is one of the kindest, gentlest souls I've ever met. He was the \"frontman\" in the group each day and worked to pace us, he waited on us hand and foot at the guesthouses even when we begged him to sit down and take a break, and he constantly worried about each and everyone of us (someone in the group got sick and was sleeping in his room and he went to the room to check on him and got his sleeping bag off the floor and wrapped him in it). Madan and Rabi will forever be cherished friends and thank god for facebook for allowing us to keep in touch. In addition, Ace the Himalayas, is hands down the best touring company I've ever used.

I found out about Ace the Himalaya through a website called The Clymb, but booked my tour directly through Ace. The tour went off without a hitch. To say that Ace the Himalaya and my guide Suman are professionals and experts in what they offer and do is an understatement. Every detail of the tour was very well thought out and planned in advance...all I had to do was show up! Everything about the tour met or exceeded my expectations, and I look forward to my next tour with Ace the Himalaya. If you are planning a visit to Nepal I wouldn't look any further than Ace the Himalaya. Great experience!"

Yet they do not do justice to the splendour of taking it in with my own eyes. I am hooked now and hope to one day summit this mountain.My guide Ram was knowledgeable and friendly. His second in command Dep was an amazing mountaineer. It is a difficult trek, but their experience, constant attention and encouragement made it extremely enjoyable. They were highly competent and I had complete faith in them to keep us safe.If you are looking for 5 star accomodation this trip is not for you. But the accomodation was much better then I expected and the food was plentiful. After a long day of hiking the guides would not retire to have their meal. Instead they waited on us until they were sure that we had our fill and anything else that we desired. I have never been so well looked after.I thought we were lucky that we had such exceptional guides. But on the trek we met and hiked with two other groups that were also touring with Ace the Himalayas. Their guides were also friendly and, from all reports, just as amazing as our own.I was lucky enough to do this trek with some of my best friends. I witnessed my friends' proposal to his fiance, 5364 m above sea level.This trip has changed my life. I lost a dear friend prior to the trip. I started the trek stooped with the weight of the world on my shoulders. Each day as I climbed towards Everest, was like a balm on my soul. By the end of the trek I felt rejuvenated. Able to take on all my troubles, with a smile on my face, and my eyes firmly set to the heavens.You can not put a price on this. Yet I paid a minuscule amount. To say it was an absolute bargain is an understatement.Remember to tip the guides and porters at the end of your amazing trip guys. Pretty sure that you will all be extremely generous after the trip that they provide for you.Shout out to Ram, Dep and our Porters.Thanks for everythingQuang Tran"

None of this stops Ace delivering a smooth, problem-free Nepal experience. Don't be put off going to Nepal - it's safe, friendly and open for business.Nima, our guide was fantastic.

Although I am a very fit individual, trekking in Nepal was definitely a physical challenge but no matter how fast or slow I wanted to go, Santos was encouraging and supportive. He was irreplaceable in helping me every step of the way. Along with Santos my porter, (I think his name was Depwess?) was also a great sport, and both saved me from over doing it or feeling rushed, while keeping me laughing and educated on Nepali culture along the way. I simply cannot say enough good things about ACE. They communicated with me regularly prior to my departure and answered my slew of questions, arranged all my transports, all of which went smoothly, met with me before and after my day trek and arranged wonderful hotel accommodations. I plan to return to Nepal and would not consider any other company with whom to travel."

The trip started with a 6 day biking tour up and around the Kathmandu Valley with our amazing guide, Santos! The biking was a combination of road/dirt/mountain bike trail/cobblestone that provided us with a fun trip that worked us hard! With the ever changing scenery I never found myself bored. We typically rode in the mornings and by mid/late afternoon we were relaxing at our hotel/resort/guesthouse and enjoying the views of the countryside. Santos was an excellent guide; he was not just a guide but quickly became part of our close knit travel group (total of four) and a great friend to have. He was well prepared when it came to bike problems and set a good pace for all of us so that no one was left behind, but no one was bored. If I were to go back I would definitely choose a trip that has Santos as the guide. He definitely enriched our experience with the company. After the Kathmandu Valley biking a driver brought us down to Chitwan National Park, where we spent two nights just outside the park at a resort. Here we were guided through a local town, took a walk through the jungle, saw the breeding grounds for the elephants, had a canoe ride down the river and enjoyed the views of the jungle from the top of an elephant! What an experience!Finally our trip came to a close back in Kathmandu where Ace the Himalaya drove us to the airport for our flight. Overall I had an amazing experience with Ace and would recommend it to anyone. Santos was the best guide that anyone could ask for, I hope to go back soon and do another adventure!"

Vehicles were clean and well maintained. Guide and driver were friendly and knowledgeable.Couple notes on our trip. I will give them 5 starts because our guide was great, however if we go back I would stay at a different hotel. It wasn't bad, but there was a very loud bar on the roof that kept us up the night in Katmandu.The hotel we stayed in when we went up into the hills was amazing. Great view and good food. This was our favorite part of the trip. If we go back, we'd stay up there for 2-3 nights and just relax.As far as the temples go, once you've seen 3-4 they all blend together. This isn't a knock on Ace, just a comment on being a tourist. In Europe, all the big churches look alike after a while. The same hold true for temples in Nepal.DON'T LET THE EARTHQUAKE SCARE YOU AWAY. Nepal is open for business and everything is fine. They are repairing, but that should not stop you from making the trip. Great food. An amazing country."

I have to say that it was one of the most amazing experiences and the Ace guides were in large part responsible. We ended up having two groups combined so we had a merry band of 11 travelers and 3 guides. Kumar I Kumar II (Sarosh) and Dipak were the most amazing hosts and friends. I can truly say that they have eyes in back of their heads corralling 11 excited, eager trekkers over the span of 2 weeks. They had our backs at all times and we did not have 1 problem with AMS or any other issues. The kept us going at the appropriate pace and always had a smile and a joke to keep our spirits up. They are a great team and its evident that Kumar has much experience and a great bond with the guides as well as our porters. I feel that our group developed a special bond with them that was hard to leave. I know that I plan to return and tell all of my friends about Ace..and to request our guides. I have to give special recognition to our tireless porters - we met up with them regularly along the route and they always were laughing and smiling. My porter - Bilgagi made me smile with his great attitude from morning to night. Mealtimes were very well organized and a special time to see the guides in action. They were attentive to our every need. I equate it to service at a very good restaurant. I would be looking around for the salt and turn my head and there was salt magically appearing lol (just one example). Dipak would even remember the meals and milkcoffe that I preferred every day! They had an eye on each one of us at all times and looking to attend to our every need. I even suspect that they distributed room keys with an eye for the photographers in the group who would have better views for late night photos :) I feel like I am gushing but they truly deserve it. They will work tirelessly to ensure that they do everything in their power to help and make you comfortable. Anyone with specific questions about this trek - feel free to contact me for more details."

I communicated with Prem prior to leaving Australia and all my questions were answered promptly. We were collected from the airport by our guide, taken to our hotel and pre-trip meeting arrangements were advised. Ram was our guide and he is fabulous with many years experience of trekking to base camp. He is mature above his years (23). Any problems any of us had along the way were solved by Ram (there were 10 of us in our group). The day after we went to base camp I was affected by AMS (Acute Mountain Sickness) and needed to be airlifted back to Kathmandu to go to hospital. The evacuation was arranged by Prem and Ram and all went very smoothly and I arrived at the hospital in Kathmandu one hour from when I left the teahouse closest to base camp. When I was discharged from hospital we went on a 4 day/3 night tour to Chitwan National Park and again this tour went like clockwork - very enjoyable. I would highly recommend Ace the Himalayas for any trek or activity you were thinking of doing with them, especially if Ram is your guide."

            "review": "Everest Base Camp Trek. First off, ACE is a very well organized outfitter. Correspondence was easy and Prem always responded in a timely manner. Never a delay in replies to my various questions prior to arrival in Nepal. Upon arrival, I met my guide who I have to say left me feeling uneasy as I was unable to communicate in English with him. His English was very limited and he couldn't understand the most basic of questions or inquiries. We went to the airport on the day we were to fly to Lukla and throughout the 6 hours we were there due to inability to fly as a result of weather, we barely interacted as he couldn't understand me. Knowing my safety during the trek was in his hands, I was uncomfortable and quite anxious as to how we were going to communicate if I ran into trouble on the mountain and had to communicate. Thankfully, we couldn't fly that day and as a solo traveler, I was added to a group the following day and had a different guide. My new guide was refreshing and spoke great English! Things were pretty chaotic at the airport waiting to board to Lukla and the group was split up on different planes. This was a bit stressful as we were expected just to meet up in Lukla. It all worked out but appeared a bit crazy and disorganized at the time. I do not believe this is the fault of ACE, just how things run at Kathmandu airport. Once in Lukla, the trek began and everything was great. The trek is quite exhausting and as compared to climbing Mount Kilimanjaro, I found it more difficult. Climbing many stairs as opposed to a trail/path. Many sections of stairs along trail especially through villages. Support along the trail was great and our guide was very very friendly and extremely knowledgeable about the area. Each day we received a plan for the day as well as a pat on the back at the end of each day before dinner. Later on in the trek, I became quite ill. My guide followed my condition closely and the day before we arrived at base camp, I developed Pulmonary Edema and Pneumonia and had to be air lifted off the mountain. It was my decision to go down as I was so incredibly ill and honestly felt like I was at deaths door. I had wished that my guide had realized how sick I actually was earlier before my condition got so bad. The helicopter arrived and I boarded (alone) and was flown to another location on the mountain. I had no idea where I was and was ushered off the aircraft and left at a building without any further instruction. No one spoke English and when I asked why I was here and not off the mountain, I was just told to \"wait\". I had no idea why I was there and for how long. This was a bit unnerving. After approx 2 hours, I was flown to Kathmandu in another helicopter. I later found out that I was dropped off as the crew had to return up the mountain for another more life threatening rescue. I wish someone had been able to explain this to me at the time. Upon landing in Kathmandu, a vehicle pulled up to the helicopter and told me to get in. Driver had NO ID...did not identify himself as affiliated with ACE so I again, felt uneasy but got in the vehicle which thankfully transported me to an ambulance which took me to the hospital where I was treated. From when I landed in Kathmandu at the beginning of the trip to this point...no one has ID. It would of been helpful if employees of ACE has a badge with their picture and the ACE logo to assure clients that they were representatives of ACE and that they are in good hands. This is a strange country and getting in unidentified vehicles with people you don't recognize isn't ideal or advisable. My Doctor at the hospital was fabulous and the bed side manner of all the staff at the hospital was wonderful and better than that of my native country of Canada. The care was of high standard and very professional. I did not hear or see an ACE employee for most of my stay which at first upset me as I felt alone and lost and was very ill. I later found out that the Doctor prefers no visitors and this is why they weren't there. I wish I had been told this earlier. I did see them closer to the end of my stay and they brought me fresh fruit which was appreciated. If you want anything in hospital such as food/clean PJ's, towels etc... you must ask. Supplies are limited and these things will not be offered to you. You must be assertive. I had no trouble with billing. My insurance company and the hospital sorted everything out for me and there was no confusion in regards to charges etc...They did everything. All I did was sign the forms. It was seamless. ACE was very organized and transported me back to the hotel and returned me to the hospital for follow up upon the Doctors request. I was well taken care of throughout this scary ordeal and I commend ACE for taking good care of me. Overall, I loved my experience in the Himalayas and despite my trek ending early, it was a one in a lifetime adventure that I will never regret and always be thankful for experiencing!!! The Everest region is spectacular! Despite the few hiccups, I wouldn't hesitate to use ACE again should I return. It was evident my guide Krishore loved his job and I couldn't of had a friendlier more caring guide. I met some great people and the Nepali people are the kindest people I have ever met in my life and I've traveled to many countries in the world. Thank you ACE!!!"

I chose them as I wanted to go with a reputable company.Two guides our group had, Toya and Rabi were awesome and such compassionate and kind people. The fees the company charge were reasonable. All Nepali people in the region seem to be genealogy happy and content and also kind.Himalayas are breathtakingly beautiful and mystic and I recommend all my friends to go to Nepal and see them!

From the minute we stepped off the plane to when we left it felt like they were there to assist and look after us at every point of the trek and our time in Kathmandu. We ended up in a small tour group of 5 plus tour guide Raj and a couple of porters. All the way Raj looked after us both ensuring we were well serviced at the tea houses but also for our wellbeing all the way along the trek. He was well equipped for any situation and had a wealth of experience and knowledge of the Khumbu Valley which ensured we learnt as much as possible along the way.I can't wait until my kids get to an age so I can do the trek with them and of course use Ace The Himalaya."

I am so thankful and felt lucky to have chosen the \"Ace The Himalaya\" to handle and managed my tour visit in Nepal, as i 'd say they are well organized in dealing with their client's needs and demands. It was my my first time visiting Nepal and i would definitely use them again on my next visit. I'd like to appreciate the assigned tour guide, Mr. Dil Tamang for his skills of knowing the history of Nepal as well as the cultures, his knowledge are in details and very well expressed. It was unfortunate for me to feel that, the time we were in Darbar Square, I was taking videos and pictures on those buildings/temples and asked him ignorantly this line, \"when was the last time does Nepal got experienced of having earthquake?\" then he looked at me wondrin why asking such rare question.. but he then answered \"our country is prone of earthquake and perhaps the strongest one was 1934's\" and i just obliviously shrugged off and resumed the tour. 23 April i left Nepal, just about 2days, a dreadful news has came to me about Ghorka's earthquake.. that made me goosebumps and called my friend rigth away.I was so thankful that his entire family were safe and wished that i could help those affected at least stronger than i wanted to..My great appreciation to the driver, MR. PRAKASH, (can't remember his last name) a very humble and attentive guy. He knows all the way and of being readiness all the time you require his assistance.\u200bFurthermore, if you wish to visit their country, I would definitely advice that Ace The Himalaya tour services can be the best choice ever, not only because of being professional, your needs and requirements can be absolutely be accommodated.I would say, everyone should try to have the Nepali tour experience at least once in a lifetime. See you there again ATH, on the next no time!\u200b--vinfrom Philippines"

Our team leader screened through dozens of companies and quotations down to Ace the Himalaya (Ace). The main confidence gripper was the response rate of Prem, the boss of Ace. Every email sent out was replied in a jiffy and our requests were very well accommodated.Next part in deciding if Ace is truly a reputable company, is its logistics and admin support. An example was when our plane arrived late by almost 6 hours because of bad weather resulting in a backlog of activities. One of them was equipment preparation. Staffs of Ace made this fuss free and was delivered right to our hotel lobby, warm sleeping bags and down jackets which many of us did not have prior to the trip, saving us from bitter cold nights up in the mountains.Last and most importantly, good companies like Ace have to depend on their competent guides and porters during the trek itself. I'll leave the reviews of the actual trek, terrain, food, lodgings, photos aside as they are pretty generic in other companies. My focus will be on the people of this company, the guides and porters. Our main guide Suman, assistant guide (Thirta Puri aka Raj) and porters made sure everything was hassle free. Suman's knowledge of the mountains and terrain is enormous enough to constantly keep me in awe. Coming from a society that takes things for granted and all things material. Suman's humbleness and also attitude to towards work and life sets an example for all of us in the group, never failing to cheer us up during the hardest of climbs. Through the journey, he has become more of a guide but a friend, a brother to me. Raj the assistant guide comes across as an energetic and knowledge hungry , he constantly ensures that the last person is well taken care of, never hesitating to relief us of extra baggage which might slow down the group. He is also very clear of the terrain and the different routes to take even though our itinerary has changed. And finally the porters, without a doubt, the champions among the crew. Lifting baggage of minimally 30Kg on their backs and ensuring our belongings are intact, in our rooms by the time we end our grueling day. Along the way, we hear stories of groups not being able to cross high passes because their porters were not willing to do so. Hearing this, we can only keep silent and appreciate our group of tenacious portersWithout Ace and its crew, our journey to EBC and back (thankful) will not be complete. Thank you Ace for making this trip a very memorable one :)"

What I got was a professional outfitter who had the best guides and the best porters to make sure we made it to our destination (base camp) and back safely and with a smile. Kumar, Madan, Raj, and Robbie all worked together to guide 24 people up the mountain despite the different abilities, ages, and personalities. From the moment they pick you up at the airport to the moment they drop you off after your stay, they make sure your every need is met. They have amazing attitudes and are just there to serve in their highest capacity. If I were crazy enough to ever do this trip again (which trust me I am not) I would book with this company without question!!! A trip this difficult would not be easy under the best of circumstances but they pulled if off as if it were easy. I have nothing but praise to report about this company and would recommend you booking with a company that comes with high marks because up on the mountain it will make a huge difference!"

The trip was well organised & the Ace staff really looked after you with nothing being too much trouble, in fact they could not do enough for you!Special mention must go to our guide Ram who was simply fabulous. From the outset his goal was to ensure all of us had a great time right from when he advised me of the best side of the plane to sit for mountain views when flying into Lukla right up until he escorted us to our hotel back in Kathmandu. He also had a great sense of humour & made everyone feel like they were in safe hands. Our head porter Rhobi was also fantastic; I honestly do not think that I have ever met such a caring individual. After hours of trekking this guy\u2019s first priority when arriving at a tea house was to make sure all of us were taken care of even to the point of bringing us our meals, amazing!Anyone thinking of doing the EBC trek should consider this company, the trek is no \u2018walk in the park\u2019 but you will be rewarded with what I consider to be the best scenery on the planet as well as memories that will last a lifetime!"

In early 2014, I jumped on the chance of crossing off #1 on my list to reach Everest BC. I found a great deal through theclymb.com for a 16 day Everest BC trek (other deals are available now as well). I saw that Ace the Himalaya was leading the tour and I did a quick research on the company. After seeing mostly, if not all, positive reviews, I felt confident in choosing to go with them and chose a March 2015 date. Knowing that I was going into this trip without knowing anyone, sense of security was very important to me, and Ace provided that. From the time I booked, Prem, the company's owner, was in constant contact with me to provide me with all the information I needed as well as answer any questions that I may have. For 16 days in Nepal, basically everything was set up for me. From the hotel in Kathmandu to all meals throughout the trek. My guild, Dev, and other members of the Ace staff were extremely professional, punctual, and friendly. Even if I did the trek on my own (luckily I was joined by two other people who I now consider friends), I would have felt really comfortable. The trek was the most difficult thing that I have ever done. Looking back on the trip, I am even more grateful to Ace and my guild, Dev, for my success (yes...I made it). Dev was knowledgeable, energetic, caring, and humorous. He provided interesting facts and figures throughout the hike to help keep us informed and educated. He was always smiling, which made us feel like we were in good hands. He was always aware about how we were feeling by constantly checking in with us, and adjusted the pace appropriately when things got tough. He was always making jokes and even did some magic to help ease our minds. All of these little things, I believe, ultimately gave me the best chance of success. All in all, you can choose many other options to try to get to Everest BC. You can choose to go solo or you can choose other tour companies. None of these will guarantee your success, and that is just a fact! What you should be looking for is the BEST chance at reaching your goal. For many of us, we only get one crack at this, and I believe that Ace the Himalaya and their staff are the best bet! I would highly recommend them to anyone. I am already thinking about a different trip with them in the near future."

Our experienced guide Deepak and our strong, kind porter/guide Resham provided impeccable serivce and help throughout the whole excursion and were always ready and willing to answer any of our queisotns be they about flora and fauna or more in-depth subjects such as local politics, religion, welfare etc. The walking up to the highest point of this trek - Poon Hill - is not particularly strenuous but there are a LOT of steps. People with weak knees might want to take some knee supports. We also recommend trekking sticks to help. However, there is plenty of time planned in to the excursion and no one need feel rushed or stressed at all. The food along the route was just great - we were advised to opt for vegetarian dishes which we did and enjoyed every single thing we had. To my personal taste, some of the dishes could have been a little spicier - and we were happy to find out that local chile sauce was available which one can add as one wishes. We also tried \"local wine\". This was a surprise indeed! It looks exactly like water - and tastes like some kind of schnapps. We shared one \"cup\" and didn't go back for seconds! Everything was extremely well planned by ACE but what I would really like to mention is the extremely competent guides. On the way up to the highest point of our trek, I felt extremely ill. Our porter/guide stayed with me whilst the rest of the party continued. After a little rest I was fine again but Reshams calm presence really did reassure me that if anything were seriously wrong, I was in good hands. His strength and compassion are very valuable assets to any trekkers in difficult at altitude. We travelled in winter and were extremely glad of the sleeping bags we took with us. The accomodation was basic but clean and comfortable - and everyone was extremely friendly. Toilet paper is not used by locals so you may want to take some with you. We also took disposable bags so as not to leave any tissue waste along the route. Littering is a problem - children beg for chocolates and then let the candy wrappers on the ground. Our guide hepled in explaining why dropping plastic etc is not good and we hope this problem will be addressed conscientiously by future trekkers. This excusion was an unforgettable experience and we will be back for more. ACE gets our full 5-star rating without any hesitation whatsoever. Absolutely 100% recomend this company from start to finish."

We were provided with a guide named Milan who was both professional and personable, made us feel safe and well taken care of, and was an overall fun guy to be around. During the trek you pass trekkers from all over the world and local Sherpa people who constantly greet you with a warm \"Namaste\". The views of the mountains along the whole way are beautiful that one must see for themselves to truly understand how magnificent they are! There were plenty of rest stops along the way, tea houses, and places to eat that had great tasting food. One thing I would advise is to not forget to bring your own toilet paper! Overall it was an unforgettable experience and I would like to return someday and plan another trip through Ace the Himalaya."

Dipak was extremely knowledgable about Pokhara and led an exceptional afternoon city tour, and even went out of his way after the tour to show us Helping Hands Handicrafts, a weaving studio run by the deaf and the blind, and coordinated a meeting for us to talk with the owner. All of Ace's guides have superb English skills, and they made us feel right at home, like true friends would.

Everything was well organised even before the trip, with lists and instructions sent to me. We had a trip around some sites in Kathmandu Valley on Day 2 and Dil, the guide, had an amazing amount of knowledge and facts. It was a fantastic day with amazing places to see. The trek itself was (with the exception of my kids of course!) the best thing I've ever done. It was challenging, but all the more rewarding for that. Our guides, Raj and Deepak, were just the best. They became our mates very quickly, and I couldn't have asked to be with a better group of people, including Raj and Deepak. Raj kept us laughing throughout, even when we were a bit fed up (tired and cold), which we needed. I couldn't recommend this trip more. I will be going again!"

Our guide Milan from Ace was a joy to have - his knowledge of the mountains coupled with a special sense of humour gave our group a huge advantage, and the morale was always high. I met a few guides from other companies along the way and few of them could speak English as well as Milan. All in all a worthwhile experience and highly recommended."

We aimed high for this Adventure and got in very deep at times .We did Goyko Lakes ,Ridge ,Cho LaPass ,Everest Base Camp, Kala Patthar and then Injatsu (Island Peak ) base camp and finally the summit @ 6189m.We used ACE before to do a Anna Purna trek and this was our second experience with Ace. The company owner, Prem Khatry runs a sharp logistical show and we were fortunate to get a guide called \u2018\u2019Milan\u2019\u2019 who turned out to be a fantastic trekking companion with his perpetual buoyant attitude. Nothing phased him and his porters Krishna and Sandeep were always in attendance during meal times .Krishna deserves a special mention as he was a source of constant amusement with his offbeat manner. Then for the climb we had Pemba Sherpa and Karma Sherpa who really went out of their way in terribly cold conditions(refer to photos)to make sumptuous meals, although my appetite was dodgy at the best of times. I could\u2019nt fault them and found the whole experience professional .I can highly recommend Island Peak as a taster for anyone who wants to go further (up another mountain ..that is )and this is a good way to experience ice climbing with all the kit under trying conditions .Prem, to you and Milan ,thanks again .See u in a Spring time or 2 as were considering doing Mera Peak at arnd 6461 m as believe its beautiful and u hv great views of Ama Dablam ,Nuptse and Lhotse ..and then some .Or we might just aim high again and go for Peak 38 @7590m Till then Namaste"

Even our travel agent said to be careful as she had not heard of them.Well... from the time of booking, we felt a good connection. The owner, Prem, was so attentive to our questions and concerns. As our luggage allowance on the airline was 30kg, but our bags were 15kg we took over many school books, crayons, pens and supplies. Through Rotary Prem arranged for these to be delivered to an orphanage 7 hours away.When we got to Kathmandu we went to see Prem a couple of times, but he was always busy. We started to think of Prem as \"Charlie\" as in Charlies' Angels. We saw his staff, but never him.Anyway, the night before the trek he came to the hotel we were all booked at and briefed us on the trek. We finally met him!!The first day was a sightseeing tour of Kathmandu with Dill as a guide, who was wonderful - so passionate and knowledgeable about Nepal.We met our guide, Raj and our assistant guide, Dipak. Next day, it was on... on the 8 hour bus trip to Pokhara.During the trek, Raj, Dipak and the Porters were great. As we tended to be in the front half of our 16 pax group, we spent more time with Dipak (Raj was at the rear, herding the tail end).Once, my wife fell over on black perma-frost and hurt her hand. Dipak and Raj could not have been more attentive. From then on, Dipak made sure he was not far behind to help in case my wife needed any help.Ace the Himalayas is 7 years old and has grown from a small company created by Prem. Due to his work ethic and the great people he employs, we know that this business will grow bigger and better and we hope the same culture remains in the future.Thankyou Prem, Ray, Dipak and the porters for giving us such wonderful memories."

Finally, I made it this December. There were several places in Kathmandu which I put in my list as a must to see. Durbar Square was on the top of my list. This historical place is probably the most popular UNESCO World Heritage Site in Nepal. Amazing concentration of various temples in a relatively small area. The 3-roofed Taleju Temple is my favorite there. Try to allocate several hours for this place and, also, look around at the nearby streets. They are full of life which goes just outside... Another place in my list was Boudha Stupa, one of the largest in a world. Honestly, I wasn't much impressed by this particular attraction. However, the area around is charming, with a lot of restaurants and shops. My tour to Nepal was organized by ACE the Himalaya and Prem, the owner, and his staff have done a fantastic job to make my trip smooth and pleasant. My guide, Ram, was taking a great care of me.

I also felt very safe as a tour guide, or even Santosh himself, was always right by my side or very nearby in case of a stumble! I had had a fractured wrist at home only recently! Boy, can Santosh spin round fast when he heard me take a wobbly!! He also made sure I was very warm at night by providing me with extra quilts at every overnight stay! Meals and every break on the trek were well organized ahead of time so no wasting time!I was a little angry towards the end of the first day, as the staircase was never ending and much tougher than anticipated, and when the staircase got more like a wall of a staircase, Santosh was there to organize a pony for me which has now become one of my best memories ever! He organized a white pony ( on my request as a bit of a joke) and Santosh even delivered there! I can thoroughly recommend Ace the Himalaya. Nothing is too much for them.

This is more fun than two 50 year old gals should ever have. The tour had 6 other people which was just the right size to get to know folks. Sharing these experiences with new friends was the best part of the trip. There was a great variety in the activities, whitewater rafting was fun and quite managable for novice paddlers given the level of the Trishuli River at the time. Paragliding in Pohkara was a favorite for most of our group.Accommodations varied widely from rustic mountain top inn, to a luxurious resort it Chitwan, all were comfortable and met expectations for their respective settings. The elephant ride in Chitwan was fun, but we didn't get very far into the forest and never saw any rhino's, whereas other guests who did the jeep tour did manage a sighting, so if Rhino spotting is a priority, you may want to conisder adding a jeep excursion. The only excursion that begged for some revision was the mountain biking. To get to anything that resembles a trail, you need to spend a fair amount of time navigating the streets and traffic of Kathmandu, which turns out to be far more exciting and treacherous than the bungee jumping. Our guide, Arjin, was very friendly and managed the group with a very laid back style. Overall, I had a great time and would recommend the trip to a friend. I do recommned adding a day or two at either end of the trip to allow for a bit more sightseeing in KTM."

As an experienced Canadian teacher it was fascinating to work with dedicated Nepali teachers and to share ideas and lessons. The teachers were welcoming and interested in my different methods. The children were amazing - fun, smart and kind to me and each other. It was a great learning experience for me, really unforgettable. the children loved the songs and games I used to teach them English and rely appreciated the materials I left for them. I recommend this experience for anyone who loves working with elementary school aged kids and want to offer assistance to a village school."

The guides are very knowledgeable and friendliest people on the planet. Along the trek, the guides have tremendous patience and they make sure every one is taken care of.

Our guide ensured that I was provided with emergency evacuation co-ordinated by Prem and was air lifted back to Kathmandu and admitted to an international hospital which nursed me back to health. It was highly professional and good to know that in these times, you could depend on an organisation like ACE to take the necessary action to ensure your safety comes first.What I saw on the trek was amazing with Kumar our guide and porters doing an amazing job.

Our guide was a quiet person and didnt tell us a lot about the count and the culture, that was a pity. But I think it depends very much on which guide you have (as there are a lot of different guides in the agency). When I was back in Kathmandu, I did a mountain bike tour in the kathmandu valley, where I had a very good and communicative guide!

Ace the Himalaya is a small tour operator owned by an ex porter. That prior experience has given the company a lot of insight about the business and it shows in several areas from the attention to detail, wonderful staff to the value for price.Every person I interacted with during my whole stay was exceptional. Our guide, Suman was the best host one could have in a foreign country. During the trek he explained all sorts of detail about the geography and history of the area, safety tips and I always felt he took great care of all of us in the group. One group member didn't acclimatize well and I witnessed how they worked diligently to get the person extracted and followed up after the hospital release. No one signs up expecting to get extracted but it's great to know that Ace will handle emergencies with dedication and responsibility. That's great service.The trek was simply amazing. I traveled with my girlfriend and got paired up with 6 other folks who were great friends. The trek pace was well planned to allow for acclimatisation. I'd say this trek requires a moderate fitness level (e.g. doing a long hike +10mi, +6h). The accommodations are some of the best available in the area without being luxurious. By that I mean clean, cozy and in most cases with the best view available. For example, our room in Tingboche overlooked Mt. Everest, amazing!Outside of the trek our trip included an excellent tour of Kathmandu and a delicious cultural dinner with dances. I can't wait to return to the Himalayas and when I do I'll definitely book it with Ace.P.S. If you stay at Hotel Access Nepal do yourself a favor and try the food from their restaurant, they are to die for."

However as this was a return trip to Nepal I knew what questions to ask ahead of time. Prem answered them all within a day with lots of detail. I was able to be with my former guide Raj N. From the moment I arrived I felt welcome and safe. Raj\u2019s caring, sensitivity to my needs, knowledge of Nepali culture, sense of humour and friendship were outstanding in every way. He checked in with me by direct question every evening to ask how things were going and to make sure I not only felt safe and comfortable and but also that my goals were being met. I am a freelance writer so Raj acted as my assistant, translator, and sometimes photographer, helping me to set up excellent interviews with some people who might have been otherwise inaccessible. He acted as a co-teacher while I was volunteering at Bhairabi Primary School in remote Ratmate, his home village, helping me to understand the children and get to know the head teacher and staff. He took me to visit his welcoming family several times (I got to taste fresh buffalo milk!), arranged for me to attend a village Hindu wedding (he explained the customs) and toured me to other remote schools in the area. Raj worked very long hours to make sure my trip went smoothly. He remained in good spirits and positive at all times. My accommodations, while rustic in some areas, and tenting in some, were always just right for the situation. Special kudos to my village cook Kamal, and porters Resham and Tika. All fun, friendly and accommodating staff of Ace the Himalaya, truly an outstanding organization. I also love the fact that they are linked to a charitable foundation, Sambhav Nepal.

Our guides, Madan and Krishna, were knowledgeable, friendly, safe, and enjoyable. They really helped to shape my experience and help me get the most out of it. All of the activities were well researched, with instructors knowledge and certified.

            "review": "Just got back. Terrific trip, highly recommended.. I went on the EBC trip advertised through the Clymb along with 10 other strangers, all ages, abilities and backgrounds. Some with high altitude experence, some not. We headed up on May 20 for a late season trip- advantage, warm weather in the lower areas, disadvantage, as with any mountain range, the chance of snow. And snow we got, two feet of it at Loubouche. Some opted to head up the mountain to EBC, many of us didn't (me included) and opted instead to rest, relax, shower up and wait for sun. Our guides Raj and Deepak were cheerful, competent and talented. Raj was full of good humor and laughter every day, and even when we faced the identical menu choices at every single stop we found a way to get fed and fortified. One accustoms to the icy rooms, because once you're on the trail you are greeted by what most people will only have photos of in their houses: massive great walls covered with snows, looming Everest and her sister peaks, a stately monastery and a chance to listen to prayer services in person. The snows against those blue skies are something else again. We even got to see the Everest marathon head down hill through the same snow that kept us from heading up!You must be prepared for the long uphills and downhills which are hard on the feet and shins, and relatively good shape is not the kind of shape to be in for this trek. This is serious walking. One of our group got very ill with ALS and was not taking Diomox and that is another very serious piece of advice. Don't come without out it and use it while you're here. Altitude sickness is nothing to be trifled with thinking that you're young and strong is a good way to get helicoptered off the mountain. Fitness is not a preventative. If I had one complaint, and this does not in any way reflect on Ace the Himalaya, it is the condition of the toilets on the mountain. Considering the masses of people going up and coming down, one would think that some kind of effort would be made to recirculate the sewage gas so that it is not such a constant and overwhelming companion to one's toiletries. At one point i was told \"this is the mountain.\" To a point I most certainly understand. But there are ways to pipe this horrific smell somewhere other than into one's bedroom (yes really)and we used outdoor toilets which utilized wood chips and other compost to great effect. As this is my third major climb, I remember that the Inca Trail suffered the same issue. Do not travel with out a great deal of toilet paper, no matter what, extremely good glacier glasses, and a huge sense of humor. Take an alternate pair of hiking boots, you will use them. Ace did all the rest, by making sure we were safe, happy, saw blooming rhododendrons and gorgeous scenery the envy of all our friends and took care of all the administrative details so that we were free to do all the hiking, walking, gawking and standing in wonder- and there's a great deal of that- we wanted. One last note: get to know your porter. Kopal lugged my oversized load (by about ten pounds or so) and I made sure that he got something special every morning to start his day. At the end of the trip we were talking and laughing and having a great deal of fun interacting, and I also made sure that he got a nice big fat extra tip for his effort. I really appreciated that he had extra to carry, and a Snickers bar stuck into the handle (or two) was definitely something he enjoyed. But he enjoyed the big tip at the end even more. What's key to enjoying this trip is to remember that the end goal is not the goal. As with trips like the Inca Trail, it's the journey, the EBC is really just a place. Kala Pattar was ultimately too dangerous to climb. But the chance to make way for yaks, walk across heart attack inducing suspension bridges, watch donkey trains head by, and marvel at the human train taking massive boxes of Pringles and coke up the mountain so that you and I can consume that in Gorek Shep, and being able to sit right behind the pilot as he comes in for a landing at Lukla which will decide for you once and for all to let your grey hair grow in, well, only here. The kids faces, the ancients saying Namaste, the excellent company of your group- that's the journey, not whether you made base camp. Prem started out as a porter, Raj our senior guide did too, and so did Deepak our assistant guide. They all know the mountain, the trails, the best views, and they want you have a magical time. They give back to the community, too. In all regards, an excellent operation all around. Strongly recommended."

We also enjoyed sight-seeing, experiencing Nepali culture and cuisine along with an elephant safari in Chitwan National Park! Prem was very helpful in answering all our questions before the trip and provided us with valuable information concerning arrival procedures and suggestions on necessary gear to make the trip more enjoyable. As experienced travelers, we usually book everything ourselves. Having Ace take care of the details was like having your own personal concierge service. They were professional, courteous and were very flexible, allowing you to \"tweak\" your itinerary and tailor your trip to your own personal tastes. I would recommend Prem and the staff at Ace to enjoy Nepal in a \"worry free\" environment.

This trip was amazing, Ace did a wonderful job putting this together and went out of their way to accommodate us with any changes we needed when possible. (Not to mention answering all the questions we had before booking the trip.) From the time they picked us up at the airport to the time they dropped us off 12 days later we never felt unsafe. The driver was absolutely wonderful, how he's able to drive through that was unreal - you have to see it to believe it! They had everything planned for us and we even had time to venture out on our own. This is the first guided tour group we have booked with mainly because we like time to do things on our own, Ace was perfect for that. We even stayed an extra day so we could take a flight over Everest and Prem even sat that up for us. The only thing we wished we had known was how CHEAP you can purchase trekking gear for in Kathmandu. We could have packed light, gone with no gear, bought it there and brought it home with us to use here. Of course we still bought gear, but the extra baggage cost was brutal. You can't go wrong with this group. How many vacations can you say you went white water rafting, hiked up Sarangkot and woke up to a breathe taking view of the Annapurna range, para glided off that same mountain, took an Elephant Safari, played with a baby elephant, biked Kathmandu, jumped off a 524' high bridge to a 328 ft free fall Canyon Swing and flew over The Himalayas to see Everest (not to mention all the cultural sights along the way) - all in one trip! You can have all this and more with Ace the Himalaya."

I had a great time trekking to Gokyo Ri with the Ace The Himalaya Crew!Once I arrived I had a meeting with the manager of the Trekking agency who informed me about anything relevant and had time to answer all questions I had.Very nice to mention is following:I had booked a group trekking. Once I arrived they informed me that other group participants changed their trekk so I was the only one in the group... Nevertheless they gave me a guide so I had a guide for my own without paying more! Furthermore they managed to give me a helicopter flight instead of a plane flight without paying more :) (Kathmandu to Lukla) All in all great experience with the Team!At the end a personal recomodation: Plan 1 or 2 extra days for the return... The flight back from Lukla to Kathmandu can be a total mess! The airlines there dont have a ticket system as people are used to... It might be that you are stuck in Lukla for some days which can be really bad if you know your plane home will fly on the next day...."

I signed up with a group of UNSW students for 2 weeks of teaching primary school students in the mountain village of Arupokhari, 5-8 hours from Kathmandu, and about a week of trekking, rafting and general touristing. Upon arrival at the village, the kids welcomed us with buckets of flowers, a tune of the national anthem and wide smiles that were extremely contagious. Despite their limited English and our even more limited Nepali, it wasn\u2019t long before they treated us like big siblings. Day 1 of teaching was challenging, as the kids are more shy than the average western student. But we soon grew in confidence and developed ways of engaging that will no doubt be useful for public speaking or in the workplace. I stayed in the family home of one student. The facilities are simple, but I had access to clean water and everything I needed. Most importantly, I woke up each morning to the world\u2019s best sweet milk tea, some nice conversation with the family, and a stunning view of paddy fields covered in clouds. We were fed with dal bhat, a traditional Nepali staple, and a collection of Indian-Western fusion dishes that tasted delicious. The village is generally clean as it is sparsely populated, and we all stayed healthy. Upon returning to Sydney, I deeply missed the days filled with purposeful trips to the school and making friends the old-fashioned way, without facebook, email and other things that we keep busy with. I might have taught them a little bit of English, but they taught me how to live happily from the inside out."

From the opening inquiry to final post-trek correspondance, Ace the Himalaya's customer service was prompt, helpful, and comprehensive. It was important to me to trek with a group and I ended up with just two other people and the guide. Prem let me know in advance how many people I'd be trekking with and answered a host of other last minute travel and tip questions. As for the trek itself, I got within two stops of Everest Base Camp (Dinboche - 14,800') and did not acclimate well. Apparently I'm a \"slow acclimatizer\" and needed more than the two nights we had to adjust to that altitude. At any rate, my guide, Bharat, arranged an alternate route back down to Namche Bazaar, thru villages we hadn't previously trekked up. At that point, one of the young porters, Binot, served as guide, too, and did a splendid job of it! He was cheerful and always helpful and the trek down took on a new, more introspective turn. It was actually my favorite part of the hike, stopping at Khumjung for the night, followed by a leisurely stroll adjacent to Shyangboche airstrip then a short hike back down to Namche where I reunited with my small group. I had a great travel experience using Ace the Himalaya and would recommend them without hesitation."

Our porter Prassand also couldn't have been nicer (and was incredibly strong and fast to boot!) We felt so well taken care of the whole time. We were a bit slower than most trekkers, needing to go at our own pace, especially on the steep hills. Suman NEVER rushed us, and even helped set us at a nice, steady pace. We spoke to some people who were not happy with their guides - one woman felt uncomfortable by the way her guide looked at her (yikes!) I can't stress how important it is to feel safe and comfortable with your guide when on the trail, and Suman was top notch. It was truly a once in a lifetime trip and we couldn't have been happier to do it with Ace."

All accommodations and transportation in Nepal were taken care of, which took a lot of burden off of me. The trip started as a solo trip but I was paired up with another person that signed up for the same trip. I'm really glad it was more than just me on the trip, in Kathmandu I was taking in so much just seeing a culture so different from my own for the first time that I had no idea what questions to ask, the other person on the trip had a lots of questions and our guide was very knowledgeable and answered all of the questions. When we flew up to Lukla to start our trek to Everest base camp we got a different guide, Raj, who has more experience in the mountains. The pace of life up there was much slower and I had more time to take things in and start to ponder them. Raj was able to answer all of my questions and he makes some good jokes too. He kept things interesting, helped me pick food that wouldn't bother my stomach when I got a little sick after my water filter broke and always made sure we were having a good time. When we made our way out to base camp he pulled candy bars and other snacks out of his bag for us since there aren't any places to get food out there. In the evening he would meet with us and let us know what to expect as far as weather and amount of hiking for the next day. Overall the trip was excellent and I highly recommend Ace the Himalaya for anyone that wants to see Nepal, even if they've never traveled internationally before."

After illness struck, I had to stop early and head back down to the city.The guys at Ace were amazing, encouraging me to tour the city since I had some unexpected free time on my hands.The driver and guide arrived promptly, just after breakfast. We stopped off at three major monuments in the city, taking time to walk through them carefully, stopping often to discuss details of the various locations.The guide was amazing, having a masters degree in polisci. It was great getting a history lesson, talk geo politics, and discuss and compare our lives.There was ample time in the tour to see (and buy from) the local artists, but i never really felt pushed into making purchases.I look forward to booking with Prem and Ace again next time I come to Nepal!"

The best words I have to describe Everest Basecamp and viewing the surrounding peaks from Kala Patthar are other worldly. One of the best views you will ever have. Many people I met on the trail said they weren't going to go up to Basecamp because there wasn't anyone there this time of year (Nov). It was their loss. Hiking along the Kumbu Glacier with Nuptse towering is worth every second.Many thanks to everyone at Ace, especially my guide Raj and my porter Krishna, for making this trip possible. The pace they set for the elevation gain was perfect. Raj always answered my questions about which peak was which, why this or why that. I learned a lot from him, not just about the mountains, but about the area and the trail. I would recommend Ace to anyone. They take care of you, are well organized, are professional, are fun, and are an all Nepalese company, meaning the money you spend stays within Nepal, which I really liked. Happy trekking!!!-James"

Thanks to them I got to know Nepal (and a little bit nepali) as good as possible in such a short time. Since we were a small size group and met so many other nice trekkers on our way it was even possible to vary the itinerary and stayed one day in the beautiful Kagbeni.

Weather disallowed the flight to Lukla and the planned Everest BC trek so we had to do a different itinerary. The ACE team made the transiton for us very quickly and very smoothly. We decided to change our destination to Annapurna around noon when we realized a flight to Lukla was impossible. They had us on a van to Pokhara that same evening to start the ABC trek with a new trip itinerary. Our trek guide Ganyu was experienced and knew what he was doing. He knows all parts of the trek like the back of his hand. He was fun to be around and knowledgably answered all of our questions. His team took care of all the little stuff and were courteous and friendly. That helped me to just enjoy the nature of Nepal and enjoy the company of the others on the trip. ACE seemed like a very organized company and I would recommend them for anyone looking to do a trip to Nepal. Since an honest review will also point out things that need improvement, here is what I say they can improve on. Charging for every cup of tea and coffee along the trek starts to get ridiculous. You sort of feel like you are getting nickle and dimed the whole way. I also had to wait for my pick up from the airport for more than an hour when I arrived. Overall a memorable trip that I will not soon forget."

With the cost, vacation time, physical, mental, and psychological challenges Everest creates a lot of barriers to overcome. I thought to myself if I cannot summit Mount Everest I would be satisfied with stepping foot on Everest. In 2011 I came across Ace the Himalaya and called up a buddy to see if he would like to share this experience of climbing Everest Base Camp. Prem the owner of Ace was very flexible, informative, and responded to each of my emails throughout the year until our dream came true in September of 2012. Although due to bad weather our dream was placed on hold, Ace the Himalaya provided us with an immediate backup plan....Annapurna Base Camp. At first I was very frustrated but knew that no one person can predict the weather and we needed to take advantage of something before we ran out of time. Most people come to Nepal to see the mesmerizing beauty of Everest, but I would highly encourage Annapurna Base Camp. Gyanu our lead guided was very knowledgable and spoke excellent english. My hat goes off to the porters. I'm always amazed how these guys who wear flipflops and throw 80-100lbs over their heads and climb up a mountain as though it's nothing is done with such ease. And for Dale our city tour guide to Bhaktapur Durbar Square, we couldn't ask for a better guided. The compassion and emotion he showed to his city was felt throught the history lesson he gave our group. The only suggestion I would give is train on the stairmaster, drink lots of water, and avoid buying thousands of dollars worth of gear. In Kathmandu there are stores every other building with cheap prices (this will save you lots of money if you're on a budget)."

When she arrived in Lukla she was greeted by a porter and they hustled to meet the rest of us (at a very fast pace). This was all done while keeping everyone informed and on schedule.Our group's return to Kathmandu from Lukla was delayed because of weather. We were able to arrange for a helicopter charter on the third day but in the meantime all arrangements were made by Ace and our local guide Raj. We were in very capable hands and never had to worry about accommodations or meals. Everything was smooth on our return to Kathmandu including a half day tour of the city when we arrived and hotel room to prepare for the long flights home.Thanks to Ace we were able to enjoy Nepal and leave most of the details to them."

The first thing was to find a reputable company. Like others we wanted to use a local company to try and keep the profits in Nepal. Ace the Himalaya had fantastic reviews Trip Advisor, and the rapid and courteous response from Prem confirmed that this was the tour group for us. We did some research and realised that the EBC track is really crowded and pretty much a long dirt track, so we decided to spice it up and go via Gokyo which was the BEST decision we made! The Gokyo scenery is amazing, seriously amazing, compared to the EBC trek (you come back down via EBC trek, so we so both ways). You come across people from time to time, but you feel like the whole universe is yours alone.Our guide, Raj, was an absolute champion. He knew all the ins-and-outs of dealing with any bureaucracy etc, and when we arrived early to Lukla on the way back, he somehow managed to get us two seats on a flight home when they were booked solid. Our porter, Gopal, was hilarious! He was a dead ringer for Marky-Mark (Mark Wahlberg) but the Nepalese version. He was strong as an ox and fast as a race-horse and always had a huge cheeky smile on his face. Both men took care of us at all times, particularly when crossing the Cho-La Pass, and on the morning of Kala Pattar. Those two days are really tough going. Up to 8 hour days in the freezing cold, and the altitude was pretty intense. It was just the four of us, so we felt like a fabulous little team (aka The Funky Bunch). The tea-houses are pretty simple, and increasingly so as you climb higher and higher. Electricity and hot showers disappear after Namche and the yak dung fires only got lit at about 530pm, so we were usually wearing everything we owned all at the same time. Again, Ace supplied great down jackets and down sleeping bags. That was another bonus of going via Gokyo... less people crowded together meant we didn't get the hallmark \"Khumbu\" chest cough. I can't express the beauty of the scenery of the entire trek. It's just overwhelming and it hits you right at the root of your soul. All the big mountains are stunning, but yes, something about Everest is frightening, grave and majestic at the same time. You start getting glimpses of Everest on about the second day of walking, and you'll never forget the first time you lay eyes on it. You will never forget this entire experience.Thanks to Raj, Gopal, Prem and the whole Ace Team. You might see us again very soon!"

We get that it was a really busy season and time is always a constraint we felt like our meal choices were really limited most of the time...somehow the next tables food always look better! at the end of our trip we were trapped in Lukla due to bad weather and plane cancellation and that got really chaotic as NO ONE seem to know what is the plan of action or when we can get out...our guides seem like they did the best they can to get us out and looking bad it really wasn't as bad as it seemed (tho at the time it was really scary..not knowing how long we would be trapped on the mountain). In the end we paid for helicopter rescue and thanks to Prem, we got our money back from insurance after he provided us with receipts thru emails.

What a fantastic experience, Gill and I spent just under 2 weeks teaching English and researching Ethnobotany with children at the Shree Bhairabi Primary School. Where to start? A big part of the experience was staying with Raj's (our guide and translator's) family. We were made so welcome, we indeed believed we were part of his family. The day's started early, 5am before the heat became too hot, school started at 10.00 and lasted to 3.30-4.00pm. The evenings were cooler, an opportunity to relax with a walk or even a swim in the river (and prepare the next lesson plans). There were some stunning views of distant ice covered mountains.Despite the heat the children were full of energy, they seemed to have learnt a lot of English by rote. Using creative games such as matching words using cards/pictures/removing word cards/hangman/miming all seemed new and went down well - lesson planning was essential!Part of our work was to record local plants recognised by locals for their medicinal value, we set a homework exercise with the children, asking them to seek information from their family elders. This was a mixed success, the children certainly had a good grasp of identifying local flora, but parents and grand parents had far more knowledge. We hope this initial work will be followed up. A very effective way of researching 'Ethnobotany' was to sit with a family elder using a Nepalise/Latin/English plant dictionary (available from Pilgrims book shop in Kathmandu - we also donated a copy to the village library). There just wasn't enough time to go right through the dictionary with enough people!I was really moved by the endearing friendliness of all the local people we met, the quality and delicious flavours of the local produce and cooking. The village had only been connected to the electricity grid for 2 years, like the water at the standing tap, the supply kept coming and going, people just cheerfully got on with life, working around these 'small' inconveniencies.As I said at the start; an amazing experience, I really want to go back, despite the levels of poverty, many aspects of this life style, often lost in the 'west' where community pull together to help one another, are really appealing. I hope this isn't lost as the nation develops."

I was keen for my husband to love Nepal like I do and wanted to make sure that everything was pre-arranged, as we only had three weeks and were travelling with our daughters aged eight and ten. As I\u2019d already travelled to the areas of Nepal that we were going to, I thought it would be nice to also go somewhere new, so decided upon Tibet.I first contacted Prem when I was having significant difficulty organising the Tibet component of our trip through a Kathmandu-based company that also had an office in Sydney. In contrast, Prem was a delight to deal with. He answered questions promptly and provided exactly the information I needed. I wished I\u2019d also organised the Nepalese component of our trip through Prem.When we arrived in Kathmandu, Prem and his staff were terrific. Our Tibetan visas were organised with a minimum of fuss. The hotel that we had been booked us into (The Samsara Resort Hotel) was a little piece of calm within the hustle and bustle of Thamel.We thoroughly enjoyed the Tibetan Cultural Tour. Our guide Pasang Nodup and our driver Kelsang Wangdue were lovely. They were friendly, helpful and we always felt like we were in very safe hands. The vehicle was extremely comfortable. The monasteries we visited were incredible and Pasang gave us wonderful information on each. The Potala Palace was amazing ... difficult to describe in just a few words. The Tibetan countryside was rugged and beautiful and the people were truly lovely. So many of them wanted to spend time with our daughters. We were fortunate to have very clear days and so were afforded stunning views of the Himalayas including Everest. All of the hotels and guesthouses were very comfortable and well located. We enjoyed the authenticity of the guesthouses and we enjoyed the comfort of the hotels, so it was good to have a mix of each.It\u2019s certainly not an easy trip (the \u201cstrenuous\u201d rating became apparent when we were at altitude), but it was fabulous and we\u2019ll be reliving it through our memories and photos for a long time to come.Thank you so much to Prem and his team at Ace the Himalaya. It\u2019s always a leap of faith arranging a holiday from a different country, but I\u2019d thoroughly recommend Prem and his team. My husband was so impressed that he\u2019s already planning a return trip (he trying to decide between the cycling trips run in Tibet and Nepal, but I think Nepal\u2019s currently winning). I\u2019ll be returning to trek Upper Mustang. And while we\u2019re each off doing our adventure bit, the other will be trekking with our two daughters, who would return to Nepal and Tibet in a heartbeat."

Based on other positive reviews, I decided to go with them. Now I don't regret that decision because I had a wonderful time, and all because of Ace The Himalaya and their lovely guide, Arjun. Ace is a local company managed and run by local people. From what I gathered, they employ all local people and pay and treat them well. Remember not all touring companies in Nepal do that, they just want your money, but don't care for their employees. Ace made me have a wonderful experience. Prem was very quick and prompt in his email responses and was happy to respond to the silliest of my enquiries. A very patient man with excellent customer service focus. For Ace their customers come first and they will be ready to go to lengths to make sure their customers safe and well looked after.They employ an amazing group of guides and porters. I did the Everest base camp and Kala Patthar trip and my guide Arjun, a 23 year old boy, made sure that I had a wonderful time. A soft spoken and polite boy, Arjun, looks too young, but has the maturity to take the responsibility of his customers in the mountains. Through out my trek, Arjun was in the front and the Porter, Mohan, was at the back. They made sure I never slipped or took a wrong step. They don't push you, and give you all the freedom you want in the mountains, taking as many rest and photo stops as you want. Arjun took take care of me in every lodge, even bringing me hot water bowl in the mornings so that I could wash my face and teeth. Believe me, it is so cold up there that without that bowl of hot water I would be feeling pretty low through out the day.I even met a single Canadian lady doing her trek with a male guide from Ace. She mentioned that the guide was taking care of her so well that she did not feel uncomformtable even for a second, although being a solo woman traveller. Ace guides have a lot of respect for woman tourists.Overall, I can vouch for Ace the Himalaya and their guides and porters. I think their customer focus makes them stand apart. Even when things go wrong, like flight cancellations or weather delays, or your sickness, they don't complain and put the priority of their customers first.Well done Ace. Keep up your customer friendly focus, and thanks for my lovely trek up the mountains.I will be going back with them again in three years :-)."

We booked a private trip through Ace The Himalayas for just my husband and myself with a Guide and Porter. I found the trip on responsibletravel.com and after writing to all the Nepal trip providers I felt that Ace was the most helpful right from the first email. They were able to tailor the trip to fit our requirements and were good value in comparison to other providers. We had an amazing trip, our guide Raj (KC) and our porter 'Kancha' were great. I probably wouldn't have made it over the Thorung La pass without them, especially as I slipped and slid my way down the pass they were also there with a helpful hand to catch me! Raj and Kancha also both managed to look ridiculously stylish at all times, while my husband was doing his best impression of a ginger yeti by the end of the 3 weeks Raj was immaculately groomed everyday! We were pleased that they were both well equipped when so many other firms let their porters go over the pass in trainers and without proper cold weather gear.Raj always chose great guesthouses, not the most commercial ones, he seemed to be very well respected by all the guesthouse owners, my husband ended up in a volleyball match in Manang with Raj and Kancha and the chef from our hotel there. Kancha joined in our nightly card games and kept us entertained with his card tricks! He is training to be a guide and will be great at this, I would have no hesitation in returning with him as a guide. The trek itself was immensely enjoyable, the scenery is unmatchable. While the route is touristy we managed to avoid the crowds by going at the very beginning of March and Raj always chose guesthouses slightly away from the crowds and always found great lunch stops for Dal Bhat. We would definitely book again through Ace if we return to Nepal and given what an amazing time we had I think that's more a question of when not if!"

The trip was very well organised, the guide (Suman) provided excellent service and knowledge about the area and was always there if needed. Although not the cheapest trip available, the excellent organisation and knowledgeable guides made it worth the $$. I would highly recommend using Ace for treks in Nepal and will certainly contact Prem & Suman for future trips."

I had quick replies to my emails which was appreciated.I had arranged for airport pick-up so it was smooth getting to the hotel after long flights. The hotel they booked for me was nice, a bit out of the touristy area yet within walking distance. It was nice to know I could go to Ace while in Kathmandu if I needed something (although I didn't).On the first morning of the Everest Base Camp trek, the guide came to pick me up at the hotel. From there it was a fun adventure in the Himalayas. Gyanu, our guide, and Ressam, our porter, did an amazing job. We were only two on our group, so it was quite nice! I was able to ask many questions to the guide, about the culture, life in that region, etc. He was very knowledgeable. He also had our safety at heart, with yaks and dzos on the trail! I was the slowest one in our group of two, but I didn't feel pushed to go fast, we had a good system going... Sometimes the guide would walk with me when it was rougher, but sometimes he'd walk ahead and wait in some spots for me to join up. I didn't feel rushed, I took many great pictures. Gyanu also made sure we got good rooms in our lodges, with a nice view or not near the bathroom for example! They also thought us neat card games and chatted during evenings in the lodges main rooms. It was a great trip to Everest Base Camp thanks to Ace and their nice staff."

My wife and I volunteered to do some teacher training in the Dharapani school near Arughat in the Gorkha district in January 2012. Ace the Himalaya was responsible for taking care of us from the moment we arrived in Kathmandu until we left again two weeks later. This included transport to and from the airport, accommodation and a sight-seeing tour in Kathmandu, transport to and from the village in Gorkha, preparing the site and pitching tents and providing all our meals.The accommodation wasn't exactly 5-star (tents and sleeping bags) but the personal attention and willingness to please was. You only had to ask and it was done, even if that meant someone popping down to village a mere 600m below and back again. The meals were outstanding and all prepared in a tent with equipment carried onto the site.We enjoyed outrageous views, some of the friendliest people we've met anywhere in the world and at night, singing and dancing around open fires. Our two guides, Raj and Gyanu, were friendly, polite and ever willing to help. Nothing was a bother and their commitment to customer service had a genuineness that I've rarely experienced anywhere.If you're visiting the small villages in the more remote areas you will need a camera, both light and heavy clothing as the days can be warm but the evenings and mornings are cold in winter, a head-lamp, a supply of toilet paper, and water-purification tablets and hand-distinfectant as a sensible precaution. Nepal can be a little confronting if you are used to the ways of the west but some cultural tolerance, respect, and modesty in dress and behavoiur will ensure your visit is as enjoyable as ours was."

I can't think of a company who would take me through my journey across the Everest region better and safer. Not only I booked just one week in advance, but I was solo and physically completely unprepared for the challenges that laid ahead. In fact, I had no trekking experience whatsoever and that was supposed to be my first one. So I simply ignored the \"difficulty grade\" and thought that EBC+Gokyo Ri/Lakes+High Passes+climbing Island Peak would be more fun than doing something easier, and that I'll deal with the \"difficulties\" later. I had no clue. And that's probably what Prem, the Managing Director, thought when he saw me, cause he kindly offered to do amendments to my itinerary, should i decide to quit half way through, so I don't lose the payment. Needless to say, not only i didn't quit any way through, but successfully completed the whole itinerary crossing all the passes and reaching the summit of Island Peak (i'm not mentioning EBC because it was kiddy stuff comparing to the rest;)). And all that thanks to the Ace the Himalaya team! I can't thank enough to: - Baikuntha (a.k.a. BK or Bai), who managed to take me through the trek without a single glitch; who kept my spirits high with his good humor and encouragement; who calmed me down when i was freaking out (about AMS mainly:)); who helped me pack when i was late (which was every day:)); carried my backpack when i was too tired; taught me so much about Nepal when i was bored; and who became a dear friend by the end of the trek, and i wouldn't go to another one in Himalayas if it's not BK leading the way:)- Raj, who, i can only imagine, has super human powers, cause i can't explain in any other way how on the treks where i could barely carry myself, he managed to carry all my stuff, get to the lodge ahead of us, and then come back to see if any more help was needed! And all that with a great spirit and cheerful laugh. At one point, when crossing Cho La Pass, he actually pulled me up the hill cause i couldn't take any step further:) - Pemba, without whom i would never be standing on top of Island Peak (6189 m) with no prior climbing experience nor physical training; whose approach to the climb was so professional that I think he actually counted my breathing to set the pace that i could follow and the amount of breaks i need to take (so i don't pass out half way up on the mountain lol:)). He also made sure the climb was very safe, the equipment in top condition, and that i receive an adequate amount of training to know how to use it. - Kishor (a.k.a. Kris), who sorted out all pre-trip necessities in Kathmandu and helped with helicopter transfer when all the flights to Lukla were cancelled. - and of course to Prem, who gathered such a great team and without whom this company wouldn't exist. His management and problem solving skills are outstanding and he always follows up with the team to make sure each of the clients are safe and happy and everything goes well on the trek.I would definitely recommend this company if you're traveling to the Himalayan region. You know you'll be in good hands!"

Although I was dissapointed I didn't get to see Everest, the Annapurna Trek was just as scenic as any of the pictures I had seen taken from the EBC trek. I couldn't speak highly enough of the trek itself. Accomodations are basic but I never felt I needed anything other than what was provided. I found Ace the Himalaya great. Everything to do with the last minute switch went smoothly. The cars provided were always high quality with professional drivers. I never got stuck waiting anywhere and they were always extremely professional. I would highly recommend my guide Rabin and porter Myla. I'm sure I could have hired a single guide and porter cheaper after arriving in Nepal, but being my first time there I was glad I went with an established company such as Ace.

Suman in particular was meticulous in preparing us for the altitudes we had to face. Our acclimatisation was very carefully managed. Our climbing guides at Island Peak were also very careful with our preparation for the climb, and their attention on summit day was excellent.A special mention to Suman for his efforts in getting us out of Lukla the end of our trek. We arrived during 7 day period of fogged in and closed airport. Suman did everything possible to ensure that we arrived back in Kathmandu for our international flights. Next time I travel to Nepal I will be arranging my trek through Ace the H. and requesting Suman as my guide.Cheers Brian"

            "review": "Nepal and Tibet 2011 with Ace the Himalaya. I have just returned to Perth after spending the past four weeks in Tibet and Nepal that was arranged thru Ace the HimalayaAfter my initial three days in Kathmandu, we travelled by coach for 4 days into Tibet on the Friendship Highway to Lhasa where we spent 3 days looking at the sights.The most memorial was be seeing the Potala Place at night. If you get the chance to go to Lhasa you must make the effort to see the palace at night it was beautiful.I flew back to Kathmandu, then had a driver take me to the Temple Tiger Safari Lodge in the Chitwan National Park, where I spent three days. The accommodation was great and the staff friendly and helpful. We did see Elephants, Rhino\u2019s, deer, monkeys and crocodiles, But not any Tigers.On returning to Kathmandu we headed to the airport to start the 14 day Lukla, Gokyo Lake, Cho La Pass, Everest Base Camp return trek. Due to the weather our plane did not fly to we ended up taking a helicopter (great flight and being so low you see much more) to Surke, about two hours walk south of Lukla. Our first two days were damp and cold, but on the third day, the clouds cleared and we had fine weather for the rest of the trip. My guide for the trip was BK (Baikuntha Prasad Nepal) who is studying to be a teacher, so his English was very good and who had done this trip many times before and my porter Christian (Balkrishna Magyar) were both very helpful and at tentative.My goal had always been going to the Everest Base Camp after visiting Nepal some 30 plus years ago. We had trekked to Gokyo Lakes and the view was beautiful, especially with the light shimmering on the lake and the mountains behind when we climbed Gokyo Ri. All was going to plan other than me getting a chest infection the night before we climbed the Cho La Pass. That was hard, and took me 8 hours to complete with some assistance from both BK and Christian. What an achievement once we got to the top and cross the ice glacier. Now for the main goal of the trip. We reached Gorak Shep two days later and that same afternoon we headed for the Everest Base Camp. We saw glimpses of Everest on our three hour trek, and then we were there. The euphoria I got when I reached my goal was overwhelming. Photos, Video then the walk back to Gorak Shep, only took one half hours, but the sun was setting behind the mountains and it got cold. So cold that by the time I got back I could not feel my fingers as they were so cold and I had on two pairs of gloves. Must get better ones for my next trek.It had been getting colder the higher we climbed and most mornings part of my water bottle that I had in the room was generally frozen. The following morning in Gorak Shep the temperature inside the dining area was -4c and it must have been -10c to -15c outside. Although once the sun rose over the mountains it warmed up. We trekked back down thru the valley to Lukla and took the Yeti Airlines flight back to Kathmandu, then two days later flew back to Perth, WA.It was a fantastic journey, and one that that I had wanted to do for many years. Summary of trip;If someone said \"would you do the same trip again\", I would say \"no\" not unless I could be 30 years younger, although if challenged, would probably say \"yes\", but now there are other places and sites to see. What did I enjoy the most?\u2022 Seeing the Potala Place in Tibet both during the day and at night when all lit up\u2022 Catching the fist glimpses of Everest as we trekked towards it\u2022 Actually reaching my goal, the Everest Base Camp and having an enormous sense of achievement and overwhelming euphoria.\u2022 Likewise when taking off at the Tenzing-Hillary airport at Lukla and flying to Kathmandu, and again that sense of achievement. I've done it after all these years Some of the challenges that I had were;\u2022 Climbing Gokyo Ri at a height of 5360m then climbing down in the darkness and the freezing cold.\u2022 Trekking over the Cho La Pass at a height of 5330m With a chest infection and took 8 hours to complete.\u2022 The walk to Everest Base Camp at a height of 5364m was long and slow and satisfying, but it was the cold on the way back when I could not feel my fingers was worse. The food;I was very cautious on what I ate during the trip, and my general rule was that it had to be hot, and preferably vego. I had very little meat on the trip, especially once on the trek and no alcohol. Got used to eating Dal Bhat and lots of potatoes and eggs.The water;In Tibet and Kathmandu I purchased the local mineral water, but when trekking used the local water and added purification tablets. Suggested anybody else doing a similar trek consider purchasing a Permipen, a water sterilization device that sterilizes the water in 90 seconds and does not need any pills, just batteries, which are changes about every 50 litres.Washing;In Tibet there was generally always hot water available, but once on your trek, get used to washing in cold water as you have to purchase hot water for washing and showers, and sometimes they are not always hot as power is my way of solar panels. Accommodation;Whilst in Tibet, I ended up sharing a twin room with guy for Japan. It was difficult communicating with him as he spoke very limited English.Quite often we would have a room with ensuiteIn Kathmandu, I always had a twin/double room with an ensuite, and generally the condition was not bad.On the trek I always had my own twin room, so had plenty of room to lay out the clothes on the others bed. But these rooms were just a room, with twin beds, a thin mattress, a cover over the mattress and a blanket and pillow. I do not know how often the mattress covers, or blankets or pillows were washed, but it did not look like very often. I always used my sleeping bag liner and most nights my sleeping bag, then put the blanket, over it, plus the blanket from the other bed, so always nice and cozy.On the trek there was always a dining room in all of the lodges and they all had a pot belly fire that they stoked up as soon as the sun went down. Depending on the number of people in the lodge they either kept it going, or more often than not, by about 7.30 to 8.00pm that was it for the night and they let the fire go out, so it was always an early to bed.Toilets;I'm sure I could write a book about the different types of toilets we came across, some sit down, some crouch down, some just holes in the floor. But in essence you had to ALLWAYS, carry a roll of toilet paper with you and when finished place the paper in the nearby bucket/container, and get a tin/container of water and flush away what you had just done. Fellow travelers guides and porters;Generally there was always a \"Namaste, hi, hello, good morning or Bonjour\" on the trekking, although sometime nothing as the trekker was exhausted and reserving what breath they had.In the lodges everybody seemed to be quite friendly, and people seemed to get on well. Met different people from all parts of the world and they all had a story to tell of where they had come from, what they were doing and where they were going. Many, not just finishing the trek and going home but going to other countries to continue their travels. Health and Clothes;Unfortunately I got a chest infection and a fellow traveler gave me some antibiotics that helped. Think this was caused by a combination of the cold and the dust on the track. It has not rained for some time on the tracks and a combination of the Trekkers, porters and yaks, made the track very dusty. Had what I called was Himalaya/Everest cough.I ended up wearing a mask around the mouth for most of the trek, but even so, my throat got extremely sore thru breathing in the cold air all the time, and ended up drinking hot lemon or hot ginger with ginger or lots of sugar.Had no problem with the feet. Made sure that every day when we had finished trekking that I took the boots off and took out the insoles to dry, in the sun if possible, plus changing into a different pair of socks and slip on Crocs and wash the feet in cold water, not hot water! It is not good for them in hot water.I tried to rotate the clothes most days, as it is not always possible to put clean clothes on everydayLike always took some clothes that I did not wear and thought should have brought more of others. Cold hands was my biggest issue, even though I had three gloves, one I had purchased in Vietnam that were lined, and my hands got cold, I used a silk pair of gloves when the day had warmed up and added on top of this a pair of Gortex gloves that David and Tina loaned me, but even within both these, at times my fingers were freezing.For trekking I was always wearing a pair of thermal bottoms and tops so together with a pair of trousers, another top, plus quilted jacket, plus scarf, and one or two beanie hat was quite warm. The only thing is when I wore my Gortex jacket I purchased to keep both the water and wind out, I ended up beings wet on the inside from perspiration, but hey, I was warm. I remember taking the Gortex jacket off for lunch prior to reaching Namche Bazaar, and I was only wearing a thermal top underneath, and as soon as the top same off, there was steam rising from my thermal top.Suggest that anybody else doing this trek, if they haven't got all the clothes and kit, don't worry, buy them when you get to Kathmandu, there as you will have at least two days free prior to starting trekking. Just make sure you take and have worn in your own boots, and have a supply of undies, socks and thermals that you bring with you.Batteries;I was able to get my mobile phone and camera charged, but bear in mind that power on the trek is mostly Solar, especially the higher up you get. The higher you go the more expensive to charge I paid up to $5US per hour and then the battery was not fully charged. I took my iPad, and this was great for downloading the photos from the camera, plus was able to use the camera/video on the iPad, to film a 360 deg view of Everest Base camp, great. I also used the iPad for writing my daily notes, but I did have difficulty in getting it charged. I was only able to do this at Kathmandu at the hotel and at the Cho La Pass resort lodge at Dragnag, so other iPad users beware.Phone and Internet;In Tibet there was generally mobile reception but very little internet other than in the major cities, where the internet was censored by the Chinese In Kathmandu you can get mobile reception and the internet either at your hotel, or one of the many WIFI and internet shops and cafesOnce trekking, the mobile reception gets limited as does internet connection, which is more difficult the higher you get, although there is great mobile and internet connection at Gorak Shep, the last stop before the Everest Base Camp, so you can make the call and send the photos to say \u201chave been there\u201d, \u201chave done that\u201d, \u201chere is the photos\u201d.Thanks; To Prem the director of Ace the Himalaya for organising the trip, the guides, porters and guides who were so helpful and to my fellow travellers and trekers that I met on the trip to make it such a fabulous journey that I will not forget."

He made sure that every aspect of our trek went smoothly and paid attention to the smallest details. I recommend him to anyone wanting to have a great time in the Himalayas. Ace the Himalaya's Kathmandu staff also attended to every aspect of our trek very well, from equipment needs to successfully handling all our requests. We had a great time in the Himalayas because of their efforts--our trip couldn't have gone better. Thank you Robin, Santos, Prem, and Prakash!"

Right from airport pickup they have done a fantastic job of organizing the tour.Khatmandu tour was great, Prakash did an excellent job of showing us around explaining the history of Nepal. He did a great job again when he tok us to the Orphanage.Milan, our tour guide was simply superb. He was patient, thorough and sincere in taking care of us. Milan took care of us even when he was sick. That shows his sincerity.I would definitely recommend my friends Ace The Himalaya for their trips in Nepal."

My only warning would be not to leave anything at Hotel kantipur in pokhara, which is the hotel they use in pokhara as things disappeared from my bag there.

Great organisation, even when the weather was doing its best to keep us in Lukla. Prem was super-punctual and helpful with any queries leading up to the trip, making it an absolute breeze to get things ready.Milan, our guide, really felt a part of our group and not just there to show us the way. His wise words of wisdom helped us - everything from what to eat when at altitude to dealing expertly with potentially serious situations. Plus his patience, local knowledge and teaching us basic Nepali phrases - priceless! If we get the chance to go back, we'll seek him out not as a guide but as a dear old friend.The porters, too, were amazing. Amer (aka Som, aka 'Happy') and Hira were just quietly efficient in going about their business and unfailingly polite. It was humbling to see them perform their duties at the teahouses after lugging our heavy bags all day. Even with the disappointment of not being able to attempt Island Peak due to illness, the trip was certainly memorable and we had a blast. I've already recommended Ace to friends and will certainly go back to them for future trips."

More than just a trek guide and porter, Milan and Amar made the whole trek enjoyable and a trek that will be remembered by the great countryside and these 2 great gentleman.

I left with a few more. The Langtang trek was less physically demanding than walking in Everest region and much quieter. I felt at home, like I was walking in my backyard at times. The guys from Ace were super. Sangram was our driver and he was professional, reliable, polite, funny, and kind. I kept joking that I'd call him for a ride when I went back to Kathmandu and though it was a joke, I have no doubt he'd come through if I really needed a lift. Ganesh was our porter. He too, was very professional and efficient. He liked to be on the go and could always give us time checks and keep us on track- an important necessity when moving trekkers through terrain unfamiliar to them. He was also very sweet and consistently looking after us. After dinner each night, he would disappear for a few minutes, then return with a sliced apple or some orange wedges and though we didn't ask, we gratefully accepted the food. He took very good care of us in the guest houses and made sure we had what we needed. His charm and friendly spirit were also very refreshing and welcoming. He was both professionally attentive and responsible, but also extended his friendship and made us feel like we were important clients and friends at the same time.Rovin was our guide and he was great as well. He was my guide the last time I used Ace and I'll definitely ask for him next time too. He stayed right with me, even though I walked much slower than the others. He frequently checked in with me, made sure I felt good, and took pictures with me along the way. He was constantly aware of our surroundings, reading the land and weather, and always keeping safety and enjoyment as top priorities. He took care of the whole group, gave us lessons on language and culture in exchange for juggling and card game tutorials, and made the whole experience better. He pointed out landscape, livestock, and evidence of change on the way down that we didn't see going up. He went out of his way to make sure we were comfortable and happy. He was the same consummate, enthusiastic and skilled guide this time, as he was the last. Rovin became a good friend on this trip. His strong work ethic and attention to detail of his clients' overall enjoyment were both resoundingly clear. His friendship was extremely valued and I hope to walk with him again. Prem, as a repeat performance as well- was extremely efficient in answering all our questions about the trip before we got to Nepal and was attentive to our needs while we were there. It's clear he's worked hard to make Ace the great company it is. I'd choose Ace again and hope to have the opportunity to do so in the future. They are a good outfit."

The efforts Raj made to ensure we got to see and do all that we wanted to was fantastic. We enjoyed having many laughs with Raj and the porters and the dinner table conversations whilst they took the time to teach us Nepali words each night.

While the guides were friendly, knowledgeable, and made it a point to ensure I was looked after; the driver in Nepal was the best value-add (Note: a tourist bus crashed and fell off a mountain). He always had a smile on his face, was a safe driver, and tried his best to explain a little \"off-the-beaten path\" aspects of Nepal. James and Prakrash were excellent guides. You'll do well to tour with either gents in Pokorha or Kathmandu. But be extra kind to the drivers. By the way, bungee jumping and white water rafting in Nepal should be on everyone's bucket list! Lhasa is not impressive; would recommend spending more time in Pokhra - especially after Chitwan National Park. Either way, you cannot go wrong using Ace the Himalaya."

But, we would not have been able to do this without Bharat our Chief Guide and the rest of the ACE support staff. Bharat and the support team were absolutely amazing and met our every need. They exceeded our expectations. This was the greatest experience and challenge we have ever had. And again this is because of our guide and Aces's \"top notch\" support staff. Lastly, our plane was delayed arriving in Kathmandu for over 6 hours well into the night and Ace's staff did not know when we might arrive--they waited the whole time at the airport for us for us and when we arrived we were cheerfully greeted and taken to our hotel--good luck finding another tour company that would do that."

I just returned from three weeks in Nepal, trekking in the Everest region with Ace the Himalaya.This was my second visit (after treks to Annapurna and Everest base camp back in 1993) and this time I was looking for a more comfortable trek, staying in some of the luxurious lodges that were built since my last visit.I contacted several agencies with top Tripadvisor ratings in Kathmandu and asked them to propose custom solo itineraries and accommodations for a trek to Gokyo Lakes and Everest base camp via the Cho La pass. While the total cost quoted by Ace was not the lowest (but at the lower end) I selected them because I felt in my email exchanges with Prem K Khatry, the managing director, that he understood best what type of experience I was looking for. We ended up selecting Everest Summit Lodges in Lukla, Monjo, Mende, and Pangboche, the Yeti Mountain Home in Namche (my favorite of the bunch), and the Everest View Hotel in Syangboche, in addition to \"best available\" accomodations at the higher elevations.All those lodges (as well as the amazing Dwarika's Hotel in Kathmandu) turned out to be great, well worth the extra cost to me. We settled on a relaxed schedule of 20 trekking days for the trip to optimize altitude acclimatization.Prem selected Rovin Sapkota as my guide for the trek and Rovin turned out to be just the prefect guide for me (and a really fun team with Santosh, my porter). Everything was taken care of, I never had to worry about a thing.I enjoy my trekking at a moderate pace (\"bistari bistari\") with a lot of stops to take photos, enjoy the view, read a book, relax - and Rovin was very patient and always in a great mood. He is also a very caring guide, which was particularly important because I caught a bad chest infection after a few days which ultimately prevented me from ascending above 4800m.Rovin took me to the rescue post in Machermo where I received treatment and antibiotics. This allowed me to reach the amazing Gokyo Lakes, and Rovin provided the advice I needed when the tough time came to decide to either tackle the high pass or descent. In coordination with the Ace office he was very flexible in rebooking my reservations on the way back to Lukla, making the trek a success in spite of having to cut the trip short by five days due to the bronchitis.After my return to Kathmandu Ace's Prakash Aryal provided an excellent day of temple visits and sightseeing in Kathmandu and Bhaktapur.All in all I fully recommend Ace the Himalaya for your Nepal trekking."

And our porter was hard-working to say the least-- I think our gear weighed as much as he did! The city tour after the trek (Kathmandu) was also a good value.  The only thing I'll add (nothing to do with Ace the Himalaya)-- it's a tough trail. We had climbed Mt. Kilimanjaro previously, and in our opinion, the trail to Everest Base camp was a LOT harder. Also, \"Globe Trekker\" has an excellent DVD on Nepal that covers the hike quite well. We're from the USA and our trip was in May, 2011."

Since I would be going alone, I decided to use a trekking company to organize the trip. I wanted to use a local company and environmental awareness was important to me, so I began with those things in mind and wound up finding Ace the Himalaya. From my very first inquiry about the trip, Prem was extremely professional and attentive to answering my questions. I sent him several messages before arriving in Kathmandu and he responded to each one thoroughly and quickly. A driver from Ace and one of the guides, Rovin met me at the airport at my arrival and brought me to my hotel. Rovin was friendly on the drive; we talked about the trip (I had questions about trekking during monsoon) and right away I knew we would get along and he would take good care of me while on the trail. I spent the next day with a different guide, Kedar traveling around Kathmandu Valley. Kedar was very nice and taught me a few words in Nepalese. For every place we visited, Kedar had lots to tell me about our surroundings. His stories were informative and entertaining and he went out of his way to teach me about Nepalese culture, while also making sure I was comfortable. We didn't have the best driver (there's some question about his name, but I understood it as Raz). Unfortunately, he left us waiting around for about 45 minutes. Kedar was very apologetic about the wait and said he would report it to keep it from happening again. We had no problems after that and got around just fine.The next morning, Rovin picked me up at the hotel and we caught our flight to Lukla, where we met our porter, Santos. Both Rovin and Santos were great hiking companions and since they each spoke a lot more English than I did Nepalese, we were able to easily communicate. They frequently checked in with me to make sure I felt good and had what I needed and I felt extremely safe and at ease while trekking with them. By day three, we were playing cards and board games and they felt more like friends than anything else. It was a lot of fun and I'm thankful I was with them especially because I was traveling alone and would have been bored on acclimatization days and evenings without their company. They both taught me a lot about the landscape and people of Nepal. Rovin especially, taught me a good amount of language. I was in very good hands and felt extremely well looked after. The trekking was incredible and I had a really good experience, mainly because of these two guys. They took care of everything; all I had to do was walk. Because it was monsoon season, we had clouds and rain and ended up stuck in Lukla for 4 days after the trek. I wasn't worried, since I had a few extra days before I had to go back to work. Plus, Rovin and I passed time playing cards and talking. I spent my last three days in Kathmandu, mostly in the company of Rovin. I did some things I wasn't expecting and went to a few beautiful places. Rovin became a friend and I hope we stay in touch. My trip wouldn't have been the same without him- he was an essential part of the experience for me, being both an excellent guide in the mountains and a great teacher elsewhere.Overall, Ace was a great company and I would definitely use them again. They have quality people working for them and can take care of customers' needs efficiently and economically."

The friendliness of the guides and all those involved was something that definitely impacted me. The constant song and dance, as well as the true concern they had for our well-being meant a great deal to me as it ensured we were properly cared for. The catering was excellent, with a hiking chef accompanying us, the food I recieved in such a remote area was truely outside my expectations.

The guides were helpful and very passionate about their community. I had a great local village experience to see what their life looks like. I am very impressed how much support they have done and they are going to do to the villages and everybody in the community is working together. If you want to see and experience a real Nepal, Ace the Himalaya will make this happen for sure, not only they are good at trekking but also unforgettable cultural experience trip."

My fiance (after a proposal at Everest Base Camp :) ) and I have just returned from an amazing trip to see Everest with Ace the Himalaya. From the first moment we touched down in Kathmandu we were made to feel so welcome. We met Chris, our trekking guide, on our first evening and we given a full briefing on what was to come. From our first meeting Chris was professional, informative and very friendly. We looked set for a great trek! And we were no disappointed. The 12 days were just great fun. Chris was fantastic throughout. He looked after every member of our group with such care, always checking that we were feeling OK. Being at the back of the group for 99.9% of the time he also had to follow me for 12 days and despite the odd clash in music tastes (Chris liking the vengaboys, me not so much) he was a great trekking companion with a brilliant mix of banter, jokes and himalayan knowledge! He even managed to take a quick snap of the base camp proposal without us realising which is something that we will treasure for ever!Overall the trip was 10 out of 10. We could not have asked foranything more from Chris, Yim & our three porters. If anyone is looking to make the trek to Everest Base Camp in the future I can 100% recommend making the journey Ace the Himalaya and Chris. You would be mad not too!"

Ace helped me through a difficult visa problem in India and restructured my trip to account for a lost day as a result. They carried out a well planned comfortable itinerary with good lodgings and food for this style of trek. My guide Raj was very impressive, and paid great attention to my condition throughout the entire trip, coaching me when I needed that extra energy and resting when I didn't have it. He was well versed in recognizing signs of altitude sickeness, what foods to avoid, local customs, and attentive to my hydration status, yet was laid back enough for me to experience the Himalayas in my own style if I needed. I would strongly recommend this group to other trekkers. People I had encountered on the trip paid much more money and received treatment that appeared inferior to mine. Ask for Raj if you can as his style of guiding is probably the best you can ask for. Thanks guys for a great trip. Hope to see you again in the future. Definately one of the best experiences of my life."

            "review": "Everest Base Camp Trek with Ace - HIGHLY recommended. I just completed the Everest Base Camp Trek (16 day tour) with Ace the Himalayas and have nothing but praise for the company and it's guides. From the very beginning, the Director of Ace (Prem K. Khatry) was wonderful to work with. Every time we emailed him a question or concern, he responded immediately. In fact, I don't think I've ever gotten such personalized service from a tour company before.I was with a group of six (from the US, Australia, New Zealand and Malaysia) and we all arrived at different times. Ace picked all of us up at the airport and we were taken to the Hotel Tibet in Kathmandu, which is very nice and comfortable and a 15 minute walk to the tourist center of Thamel.On Day 2 of the tour, we had a city tour of Kathmandu with stops at the Bodhnath Stupa, Pashupatinath and Bhaktapur, which were all on my list of 'things to see' while in Nepal. Luckily, I could cross them all off my list without having to arrange my own transportation and guides. How convenient! Our guide that day, Prakash, was fantastic. He is clearly a wealth of information on Nepal!There were 14 people on our EBC Trek, we had 4 Ace guides and 7 porters. I cannot say enough about the level of service they provided. We were all at different fitness levels and there was always a guide at the front and back of the group to assist as needed. Several people had issues with altitude sickness, stomach upset, etc. and the guides were right on top of it. In fact, one morning I took an asprin because my knees were a bit sore, and one of our guides, Bharat, immediately asked if I was feeling ok and if I needed anything. It was nice to know that someone was looking out for us and making sure no one came down with any serious altitude issues. Our other guide, Raj (commonly known in our group as 'Dr. Raj') kept a close watch on my friends who were sick in bed (one with tonsilitis and the other with altitude issues). He checked in on them regularly and it is such a relief to know that you'll be taken care of even though you're far from home in a country you're not familiar with. You can't put a price tag on that kind of service.In addition, the guides were fun and very easy to get along with. At night, we stayed in basic teahouses and since it was cold outside and not a lot of things to do in these small villages, the guides played cards with us at night, taught us how to play Bagh Chal (a popular board game in Nepal) and chatted with us about our day.We were all thrilled to reach Everest Base Camp and after a celebration with tea and cookies, I was still wanting to go in further to walk around the tents. I have to give a big 'thank you' to Bharat for offering to take six of us on an additional 1 hour trek into base camp (on top of the 9 hours of trekking we'd already be doing that day). It was an experience I will remember forever. Bharat's work day was lengthened an additional hour, but it provided us with a once in a lifetime experience. Incredible.To me, one of the best things about about booking a trek with Ace is that you're supporting a local Nepali company. I was highly impressed with the level of service they offered and the amount of personal attention we received thoughout our experience. I don't think a company based in an outside country would be able to provide the same level of service. If I have the opportunity to return to Nepal (and I hope I do!) there's no doubt that I'll be booking another tour with Ace."

Resham was our porter for the Annapurna area and Shiva was our porter for the Everest region and both were very strong young men with great personalities and welcoming smiles. Between Raj, Resham and Shiva - we were introduced to a couple of new card games and a board game - they were great! We were treated to a couple of city tours in Kathmandu and Pokhara - both extremely interesting! To finish off our holiday - we travelled down to Chitwan National Park and spent a couple of days exploring the jungle and viewing rhinos, monkeys, deer, tigers, wild boars, and many birds - all while on the backs of elephants!

It was a very interesting 5-6 hour tour.The trek was very well organised and any emails prior to booking and before we left Perth were always answered within 24 hours, always a good sign.We chose to go as our own group,so we had a guide and a porter and we would recommend this choice. It meant that we travelled at a pace to suit us,and also the lower number allows much more interaction with the guide and porter. They looked after us extremely well and we were able to enjoy the whole trip.We would recommend that paying a bit extra and using private transport is a much better option than local buses,as our transfers were relativly relaxed compared to the comments of others we met who used local transport..All in all we were very pleased with our choice of this company and would have no hesitation in using them again.

From the time they picked me up at the Airport to when they dropped me off 16 days later everything on the trip was professionally dealt with and delivered as stated on their website. The accomodation in Kathamandu was a 4 star hotel and the guest houses on the trek (from speaking to other guided trekkers) always seemed to be in the upper tier with respect to cleanliness and comfort. I even had my own shower in my room in some of the guesthouses. Robyn, my guide on the trek, was great and a pleasure to be with. He was very attentive, knowledgeable and always concerned with my well being. The porter, Santos, always stayed with us which was very convienent in case there was an unexpected change in the weather and I needed some other article of clothing. This was unlike many other porters who I observed that were several kilometers ahead of the guide and client. The tour of Kathmandu and surrounding area with Prakash on Day 2 was very imformative and an excellent introduction for a first time visitor (i.e. myself) to Nepalese culture. I had a minor issue with my visitor's visa for Nepal and Ace was more than helpful. Without hesitation Prakash took me on his motorbike to the Visitor Immigration Center in Kathamandu and straightened out the issue for me and insisted on no renumeration for his efforts. I hope to return to Nepal some time in the near future and Ace Himalaya would definitely be my first choice."

Our guide, Suman Thapa, is friendly and fun loving while taking care of every detail with professionalism and experience. He knew the area well and provided a wonderful experience. The trek is remarkable in beauty and in the people of the Khumu. Ace the Himalaya operates by taking care of the little details and doing those things that make it a great time- from organizing the flights, to lodging and meals and keeping an appropriate pace for their clients- it was top quality. As the trek went on I noticed the other trekkers and their guides and I understood that Suman was in a league of his own, other trekkers were envious of the experience he was providing us. I was also impressed with the cultural and environmental sensitivity that Suman displayed and the manner in which he educated us in these areas for the Khumu.This trek is spectacular- ideal if you have little time but want to experience the big mountains and have time in this part of Nepal. I strongly encourage trekkers to hire Ace the Himalaya for a good trek. This is particularly if you are a woman alone or a small group of women- Suman and Ace the Himalaya provided a respectful and safe experience that I recommend highly."

He (Suman Thapa) spoke english so well. He was incredibly knowledgable about the area we were in (Lukla to Tengboche), the local history and culture, the wildlife, every peak and elevation, the list goes on. He also told us about other treks in Nepal as I expressed great interest. He was patient and kind. could go faster or slower depending on the hikers that day. was knowledgeable in the dangers of elevation & hypothermia, as well as sincere concern when one of us was sick. Was very flexible with the trip when sickness altered the plan without any hesitation or any indication of complications with same. He was a really great guide, oh and.... so incredibly invaluable in getting us to and from Lukla as airport announcements were completely unintelligeable in english and knowledge of the maneuverings in these airports was crucial! Having done this once, I would never go without a guide and preferrably this guide (Suman Thapa). Nepal was amaizing and yet we only tasted a drop in the bucket. Such amaizing views and such wounderful people! I can't wait to go back and hike several other trails. Nepal has SOOOO MANY giant mountains it's crazy!

They took us sightseeing in Kathmandu and helped us with local shopping.We camped in remote villages and met some of the beautiful gentle Nepali people and children who liked to practice their English . We also stayed in three different hotels and everything was well organised. The hotels were all located off the main street, quiet for sleeping and each one even had a garden. I doubt we could have found these on our own. The hotels were very clean, probably rated three star.The company specialises in treks but in the off season they can organise for small groups. we suggested the places we wanted to visit and they did everything else.Pokhara has two very good museums, one on the Himalaya including the tribes and expiditions and the other museum is on the Gurkha soldiers.Nepal is not a wealthy country and services such as garbage collection do not operate as in a country such as Australia. If you go there please consider what you carry in ( such as plastic containers) and try to carry the emplies out.My husband who travelled with me had been to Nepal in 1971, we don't plan to wait another 40 years to visit this spectacular country again."

Starting in the middle of the night, with headlamp and warm clothes, we headed up towards the top - and many hours later, the sun just has risen, we arrived at a surprisingly wind-calm summit!What a moment.... no words could ever describe!!!Pemba always let me feel very safe. He is a highly skillful climbing guide, handling every situation on the mountain!The tour never stopped with revealing new stunning views, moments of happiness and laughter.... adventures... and so much more!I thank Pemba, Suman, Prem and all the ACE-members for this unforgettable, unique experience...Your way of spoiling your clients is really outstanding!See you all very soon...Namaste!"

The trip itself was absolutely incredible and even though it didn't quite go to plan, Prem and our guide, Bharat, were always there including reorganising our entire trek. Bharat and the porters were always helpful as well as knowledgeable making our trip fantastic.

Regardless of the circumstances or situation, my guide from Ace was always professional and went to great efforts to ensure I was well taken care of. My guide and porter could not have been more patient, encouraging and supportive. I can't describe only one memorable part of my trek, as the entire trek itself was a wonderful experience! The views were spectacular and the chance to meet and chat with other trekkers in the evenings at the guest houses was always provided great conversation and learning experiences! Even though I did not reach Base Camp (due to my own physical limitations) I still had a fantastic experience that changed my life! Thank you Ace for making it a safe and wondertful experience!"

From day 1 our enquiries and booking was straightforward and prem in the office answered our emails by return. On arriving in Kathmandu we were whisked through the mayhem of traffic to our hotel and given good advice on where to eat if we wanted to go outwith the hotel.The following day we were taken round kathmandu to all the sights and the guide was excellent and very enthusiastic.We were met by our trekking guide Raj and taken to the airport for our flight to lukla which was amazing. From then on Raj looked after us, he knew everything about the area, knew the names and heights of every mountain we could spot! Yem our porter did a great job carrying our gear and was an all round really nice guy. We could not have asked for better service on the mountain and by the end of the trip we treated each other as friends. Our favourite part was climbing Gokyo Ri starting in the early hours, the view from the top was breathtaking. The few tips i would give are climb kalapathar in the afternoon when the sun is on everest and be meticulous in your hygeine especially your drinking water, we found the trip quite easy because we stayed healthy, people who didn't fell by the wayside. The reason we chose Ace was becuse they were a nepalese based company with good enviromental policys and we feel we made a great choice.Thanks Ace and your team."

The website tells one exactly what is on offer and whatever was offered was fulfilled. The trek to Everest Base Camp was well organised from day 1. The accomodation was as good as is available in the Himalayas which is not saying a lot; all food and accomodation was included in the price. I had an excellent guide who was fully commited to the trip and often offered side trips which others might not have bothered with. I made Base Camp and we climbed Kala Pattar at 5500m and had brilliant views of Everest and the sorrounding mountains as the sun rose. A view never to be forgotten and all in all a once in a lifetime trip."

            "review": "Everest Base Camp Trek with Ace The Himalaya. For the second consecutative year Ace The Himalaya has provided me with a wonderful vacation giving me memories which will surely last a lifetime. Last year was the Tibet-EBC land tour and this year the Nepal-EBC trek. The Nepal-EBC trek took 11 days to complete, starting at Lukla at 2800 metres we trekked 9 days to reach our high point, the top of the Kala Pattar ridge at 5600 metres. The first 2 days of the trek were very pleasant walking along the Dudh Kosh river through pine and rhododendron forests passing many farms, villages and guesthouses. along the way. The climb to Namche Bazaar on the 2nd day was the first test of the trek being a grueling 2 hr climb gaining 600 metres in altitude but the view from the town when arriving is spectacular.Namche Bazaar lies in natural amphitheatre like bowl in the side of the mountain at 3440 metres looking across at 6000 metres peaks. Climbing to the top of the hill behind Namche Bazaar you're rewarded with the first view of Everest, Nuptse, Lhotse and Ama Dablam to the north. Following an acclimatization day at Namche the trek resumed walking north to spend the night at Tenboche with it's wonderful monastery and views of Everest and Ama Dablam. As the trail heads north from Tenboche slowly gaining altitude the pine forests give way to shrubs and rocks and the thinning air becomes apparent as the pace gets a little slower. Two nights were spent at Dingboche at 4350 metres with a day trip up the Chhukung Valley for acclimatization. One of the highlights of the trek for me the mountain vistas walking up the Chhukung Valley in clear blue skies were truly remarkable with Lhotse and Nuptse looming like a giant wall to the north and Ama Dablam spiking the skies to the south.Leaving Dingboche the trail heads north to the mouth of the Khumbu Glacier and the landscape becomes desolate at the high altitude with huge boulders and snow and ice. The hike up the Khumbu Glacier to Everest Base Camp was an obvious highlight of the trek. Though Everest can't be seen being hidden behind the Nuptse ridge the views of Nuptse and Pumori and all the lesser peaks are breathtaking along with the rugged desolation of the area. After lunch at Gorak Shep we walked the last few kilometres to Base Camp at 5365 metres. After decades of reading and dreaming about the area it was truly an exhilarating feeling to finally make it.Early the next morning after staying the night at Gorak Shep we made the 2 hour climb up to the top of the Kala Pattar ridge. Truly the definitive highlight of the trek for me the climb seemed long and grueling with the pace being very slow at the high altitude but the view from the top made one forget the effort to get up there. Everest down to the South Col is in clear view and so close now. The Khumbu Glacier and Base Camp now seems far below and looking out and across at all the peaks and valleys of the area it seemed we were higher than the 5635 metre elevation on my GPS.The trek out back to Lukla seemed anticlimatic but it was sure nice to get back into thicker and warmer air and grab a hot shower at Namche Bazaar.Overall I would highly recommend the trek to anyone with an adventurous spirit. The scenery is spectacular, the Sherpa people always friendly and hospitable. The trail itself was exceptionally well maintained at the lower elevations and the guesthouses we stayed at though often fairly crude and basic in accomadation were always clean and comfortable. It's hard work to make it through compounded by the thin air of the high altitude and one must be in moderately good shape with good endurance. For those of us whose age is advancing (I'm 53 yrs now) it's certainly do-able. There appeared many of us in their 50's and 60's along the trail.I can't thank Prem Khatri and his staff at Ace The Himalya enough for the organization, execution, courtesy and professionalism on all aspects of the trip. Ace always make you feel that they truly care and takes pride in providing the customer with all his needs to make his vacation a truly wonderful and unforgetable experience. Special thanks to trekking guides Bharat Adhikavi and Dhurba for their knowledge, patience, good humour and stamina. Both wonderful companions to have on such a trek making the entire adventure such a carefree and enjoyable experience. A special thanks to the three porters whose stamina and strength were truly remarkable and without whom the trek wouldn't of been possible. And finally a special thanks to city guide Prakash Aryal whose knowledge of local history and customs were truly impressive, which combined with his good humour and friendliness made the Kathmandu tour a perfect start to the vacation. Without the slightest doubt I would strongly recommend Ace The Himalayas for anyone considering traveling through the Nepal, Tibet, Bhutan region."

We did a two week trip and had the time of our lives. Everything was perfectly organized, from sightseeing in Kathmandu and a breathtaking Everest flight, to a five day trekking at Poon Hill, a rafting tour plus an overnight stay on the river bank and finally a visit to the national park in Chitwan, where we saw wild living monkeys, crocodiles and even one of the famous one horned Indian rhinos. We are totally in love with Nepal and will for sure come back."

We checked for tour companies on trip advisor and the first tour guide company that came up on the list was Google trek due to their ratings. We didn't bother calling any other company. We just went for it. We were in Nepal for three days in total. We went on the Everest flight, the temples and the stupas. Nepal is a beautiful country, if you plan on visiting during the season time. It could get quite hot and humid if you went off season. By the second day we didn't want to do the trips in the valley, we told our guide Pranav (pronounced as Pranob) - let's do something else where it's cooler. So he took us to Nagharkhot and it was just amazing! Pranav is really good at what he does. He is very knowledgable (I meant literally- he has a Master degree in Tourism), friendly and has the right attitude for his job. We were lucky we got the best tour guide, for the trip! He took us to all the right places, he was very understanding when we changed our trip at the last minute. At the end of the trip he became a buddy to us. I would recommend this tour company just for Pranav if not for anything else! You might find it a little pricey if you book last minute but if you air your concerns to Mr.Simkhada, he would be willing to reduce the price. It was a wonderful trip, and we thank Pranav and Google trek for making it an amazing one! Attaching some photos from our trip and our guide!"

We decided at the last minute to try to squeeze in a day or two of sightseeing. We contacted 6 of the top rated sightseeing companies on tripadvisor including Google Treks. Google Treks was the ONLY company to call us back and have a full day tour arranged for us ASAP. We still haven't heard back from the other 5 companies that we contacted! We ended up doing 2 full days of sightseeing plus the Mt. Everest flight all arranged by Prakash at Google Treks. We highly recommend the Mt. Everest flight...it was amazing and is a 'must do'! We also loved Durbar Square - Patan and the Patan Museum, Bhaktapur, Bodhnath, Swayambhunath, and Pashupatinath. Also save some time to explore the shopping and restaurant area of Thamel. You can just tell Prakash how much time you have and he will put together an itinerary for you to see the top sights. If we ever make it back to Nepal, we will definitely contact Google Treks to arrange our sightseeing tours. His tour guides are extremely knowledgeable and also very friendly. His drivers have nice modern vehicles with seat belts (not always easy to find in standard taxis in Nepal) and drive safely.

On arrival make sure you have US $25 for the visa, fill a new immigration form (not the one they give you on the flight), and make sure you have a passport sized photo.Prakash made sure everything happened as it should and his drivers are all courteous and safe. He selected a very nice hotel for me, which was also exactly what I wanted.I did a one day tour of Kathmandu and the city suffers from bad traffic so allow for a considerable time to be sat in a dusty vehicle on noisy roads wherever you go. The 1 day tour in Kathmandu was great-ask for Pranav Thapa, who is an entertaining and informative guide. Prakash organised a transfer to Green Park at Chitin by air. The domestic airport is a little old fashioned (there is wifi) and listen out for the flight announcements, they won't let you miss your flight however. A 45l back pack is OK for cabin baggage even though you will have to sit with it between your knees.Green Park at Chitwin is a new lodge with rooms for around 50-60 people with pool and bar. The apartments are very nice with wifi and a/c, the food is good (if you are ok with Nepalese/Indian food - there is some western as well) The tours were all good, the best was the canoe ride - don't miss it. The elephant ride in the jungle is a must, however be aware you will be very lucky to see a tiger (the elephants have a habit of snorting on themselves, and the passengers, trying to stay cool - what can you do, just have a shower when you get back to the lodge). I also had a bird watching walk with Binod Chaudhary, who was the lodge guide for all the tours and was entertaining, courteous and knew his stuff.For International departures there is very little after security and the seating is basic."

            "review": "Annapurna and Chitwan trekking. I signed up for a Mt. Everest Base Camp Trek with three friends. After days of waiting for the weather at Lukla to let a plane through and no end in sight, some of our group could not spare extra days to wait, so Prakash arranged to have us to the equally awesome Annapurna trek, arranging things in such a quick order we didn't even have to leave the airport to get to Pokhara! Prakash helped us to arrange to bring things from the hotel to the airport so we could get one or two things for our different itinerary. We had an amazing trek to Annapurna Base Camp and then down to the jungle in Chitwan. A bit of advice on Chitwan, first, March/April is the peak time to visit because the grass is short so that animals are easier to see. Secondly, please ask Prakash to omit the elephant ride- we didn't realize how bad it was until we did it, but they jam 5 people on an elephant back that is not as strong as you think it is, and the mahout constantly whacks the elephant on the head (the elephant often cries out) to keep obeying his command. Really, it's not worth a spot on your bucket list, just don't do it, please don't support his industry, I really regret doing it. Anyways, other than the elephant ride, the whole trip was awesome. The country was (and as of this writing still is) reeling from a severe fuel shortage but Prakash managed to get us where we needed to be despite it, and did everything in his power to make it a great experience for us. Other people have mentioned this, but Prakash makes you feel like you are his only clients in the world and your happiness is very important to him."

Prakash made us feel welcome and helped us out with any questions we had. He organised everything for us, including airport pickup and drop off. He went out of his way to ensure we had a great time in Kathmandu, this included during festival time Prakash invited us around for lunch at his house and enjoy the day with his family. He treated us just like another family member. As for the actual trek I recommend having the guide Dipendra. He was very knowledgeable and he was just like having another friend on our trek. He made sure we had a great time up the mountain, it was so much fun with him as our guide. I would definitely book another trek with Google Treks!"

I went with friends and we all had an amazing time. The guide we had was great but his pace was a little too fast for me. I would of liked it to be a bit slower so I could enjoy the scenery a bit more. I did not have trekking pole which you definitely must have with you! You don't necessarily need them on the way up, but on the way down is a killer. I ended up hurting my knee on the way down due to the decline. The guide as well as the porters were so amazing with me. They even made me bamboo sticks to use while I hobbled down the mountain. We went in September/October time and it was hott! The only time I needed cold gear was the last day on the top of Annapurna because I packed too much cold gear for this time of year and would of liked to bring more short sleeve shirts and socks! I would recommend this trek for anyone! Beautiful country and I did not feel unsafe to travel here at all even after the earthquake! I hope to return to Nepal for climb Mt Everest!!"

The package sounded a great value when traveling to Nepal for the first time and thus I booked the trip. Additionally, I chose the Chitwan Jungle Safari Trip for two nights and Prakash organized everything to fit well within my holiday. Although I prefer DIY traveling, it was so easy to follow the ready plan giving still flexibility for extra plans and there was no stress about booking accommodations and tickets during the whole trip. Special mention and thanks for the skilled guides, who helped to learn about Nepalese culture and its great nature. I really enjoyed the order of my trip: first more active parts rafting and 5days hiking in Annapurna, then Pokhara for 2 nights including a city tour, Jungle Safari for 2 nights and Kathmandu for 2 nights including a city tour and a farewell dinner. Although, I traveled alone to Nepal, it was nice to join other customers for the tours and activities."

Why?....... he had good reviews and he replies to nearly every review with a personalized response. We weren't disappointed at all. Once contact was made, everything for the tour was sorted very quickly. The Everest Flight was cheaper than we could book it online. Once we arrived in Nepal, Google Treks looked after us amazingly well. Even loaning us Nepalese Rupee not once but twice with out any concern. Why twice you may ask??Jet air lost our bags in transit!! This is where Google Treks and Prakash really made our trip, Not only did he loan us thousands of rupees until the next day but he was in contact with the airport and the airline constantly, trying to track down our bags just so we could enjoy our trip to Nepal.The guides were amazing as well - Shout out to Prabak! We repeat - you may find cheaper, but you won't find better!We strongly recommend Prakash and his team for Nepal - 5 stars!PS - Nepal is completely safe to travel even after the earthquakes."

All the arrangements were done by GTN and we had nothing to worry about, just to enjoy and follow the guidelines and timetables. We did the classic EBC trek + Kala Patthar, after that we spent one day in Pokhara and three days at Chitwan. Every single flight ticket, bus ticket, guides, porters, hotels, everything was arranged beforehand and all the things worked out perfectly. And in case of problems, there is ALWAYS a phone line open straight to Prakash, the owner and CEO of this travel agency so any problem that might arise will be solved immediately, even if it would be midnight. This gave us a feeling of extra safety. However, everything was so perfectly organized that during the 3 weeks we spent in Nepal, we needed to contact Prakash only once by phone. Our bus from Chitwan back to Kathmandu kind of didn\u2019t stop where we expected and for a moment we were a bit confused. But just one phone call and within a minute we had a taxi driver and clear idea where we are and where we are going to. Now that\u2019s what I call a customer service! :) We also met Prakash by himself several times in Kathmandu and he must be the most dedicated and frendliest person in travel business in whole Nepal.

Unfortunately we had to stop before the Basecamp and descend because I got sick, but our guide was very helpful and suggested an alternate route that we were able to take instead.The services by our guide and porter were generally satisfying. The English speaking skills of our guide were sufficient. The information that he provided on the trek itself as well as the land, wildlife, plants, people and culture were quite limited though. That's the main reason for not giving five stars.Logistics went really well. Transfers from/to airport as well as arrangement for bus and plane tickets were very reliable, despite a major shortage of fuel during our stay in Nepal. This service was extremely helpful. Arranging everything by ourselves would have been possible but time consuming.Accommodation was always clean and comfortable. Of course, standards are a bit lower in the mountain lodges but that was expected. The Moonlight Hotel in Kathmandu was very nice, especially the newly renovated rooms are very spacious and comfortable. The standards in Center Lake Hotel in Pokhara were slightly lower but it still made a good accommodation for the end of the trekking trip.Thanks again to Prakash and his team for making this an unforgettable tour."

Last December my partner and I decided we needed a change of scenery and purchased an online deal, packed our bags and traveled to Nepal to do the Everest Basecamp Trek. We weren't sure what to expect when we arrived, having done next to no research on Google Trek or the actual base camp trek.Thankfully, Prakash and his team turned out to be the perfect choice for us. Prakash picked us up from the airport (which itself is an experience!) and took us safely to our hotel. He walked us through our travel plans for the next 2 weeks and helped us purchase all the trekking gear we would need while in Thamel, Kathmandu.I always felt very safe with Google trek in charge. I even felt comfortable enough to hand over to them $400AUD to change over. The trek itself was amazing and I cant wait to go back. I think we had the most popular tour guide and porter on the mountain. Everywhere we went people would call out to them and ask them for advice on different matters.After the trek, we decided to extend our stay (to recover and rest our legs!) and Google Trek was able to arrange travel and accommodation for us at Pokarah.Overall I had the experience of my lifetime and have no problem recommending Google Trek to anyone. NOTE - It's taken me a few months to get around to writing this review. I was prompted by the recent earthquakes in Nepal. My partner and I saw the work that Prakash and his team have been doing to support the Nepalese people in recover efforts and decided to make a donation directly to them.Trust is must when you are traveling through unfamiliar territory and Google Trek are honest and reliable."

We booked an 11 day Langtang trekking trip with Google Treks Nepal for March 2015.We had never been to Nepal before so having the basics like airport pickup, pre-arranged accommodation and the arrival-evening orientation were key benefits for us as first timers. These logistics were managed by Mr. Prakash - the friendly general manager of the outfit - and generally executed by his local Kathmandu staff.During the trek we were shepherded by our capable, friendly, and appropriately chillaxed guide, Asok. With no mobile network along the route, there is no way for him check in with management so he completely ran the show for the 7 days that we were under way. He managed to keep the 7 people in our group together en route despite different paces of some of the Trekkers. What was especially nice for a trip like this is that he handled all of the dealings with accommodation along the way, doing most of the thinking for us, making it possible for us to really just focus on the experience, the beautiful nature, the occasional tricky foothold and just relaxing in the evenings. Real back-to-basics stuff. The best test of any company's customer service is how they respond when things go sideways and how they accommodate special requests. Due to the fallout from a crash landing at the airport a day prior to arrival which closed the airport for 4 days (no serious injuries though), Prakash was forced to deal with incoming Trekkers from different parts of the world and uncertain arrival dates at the last minute. He setup a Facebook group which helped everyone stay abreast of developments and changing plans in a situation otherwise devoid of good information from the airlines and officials. He ultimately delayed the start of the trek and shuffled around some of the planned itinerary to accommodate all of us. We understand he also allowed one of the would-be members of our group to reschedule their trek for 6 months later. The Facebook thing was so useful that I'd encourage Mr. Prakash to set one up for all his trekking groups in the future.Despite the difficult circumstance around our arrival, the trip came off well and we'd easily recommend working with Google Treks Nepal.NOTES:- although mentioned in our tour description, sherpas are optional and cost quite a bit extra and we opted against - if you find you overpack (don't plan to carry more than 7-10 kilos) it is possible to leave items at the various tea houses along the way- sleeping bags are cheap to rent - around 1 euro per day per person. They were nice and clean. Mr Prakash handled pick up and drop off so it was very easy for us- yoga and meditation were mentioned and implied as part of the itinerary but in fact these are 'self-led', meaning if you are already into yoga or meditation, you're free to do that on your own in your free time, but there's not like a yogi or anything- we visited the cheese factory and bought super tasty yak cheese, but the factory is only in operation in May to maybe September when the grass is green so no operations to see for us- both monasteries along the way were closed when we got there, (blame us for being slow), so we didn't meet any monks but the exterior and grounds were still beautiful in a minimalist way and made for some great photos"

If you plan to do any kind of activity in Nepal you can trustfully rely on Prakash as a coordinator. I bought a ticket for trekking in the Langtang Valley via Groupon Germany and from my arrival in Kathmandu up to my departure about 3 weeks later everything went smoothly. Hotels, sightseeing and transportation in Kathmandu were well organised by Prakash who was always available via phone and was taking good care of us. Two day after my arrival we drove to Syraphrubesi (the starting point of our trekking tour) together with Raj our guide. Raj is a very likable and polite guy and it was definitely fun to trek with him. We were pretty lucky with the weather and we rarely met other tourists on our way. Despite the trekking tour we had booked via the Groupon deal we asked Prakash to organise wild water rafting and and a trip to Chitwan National park for the time after our return from Langtang to Kathmandu. Both of these activities were great fun and again extremely well prepared by Prakash. Prakash took good care of us until our departure, even joining us when we had to drive to Kathmandu airport at 6.15 a.m.I will definitely be booking any of my activities in Nepal via Prakash again whenever i return to this wonderful country."

I booked an 11-day stay in Nepal incl. a 7-day hike on the Langtang trail via Googletreks and was absolutely happy with the services provided. Prakash, my SPOC, was always proactive and very helpful in providing information and advice before and during my stay, even involving himself personally in the farewell dinner and other informal activities. All logistics incl. pickups, city tours, hotel arrangements worked in an absolutely flawless way. On top, Prakash was always approachable when any special requests by any of the customers occurred.Our tour guide Ashok was fun to spend time with. He was very knowledgeable regarding all aspects of the hike and took good decisions, even during adversary weather conditions so that our little group always felt safe and taken care of. He is also a very interculturally sensitive person who anticipates his customers' needs in a remarkable way. Our porter Narayan added with his amazing physical fitness and always some nice conversations during the hike. Overall my experience was excellent and I can highly recommend Googletreks for any tours in Nepal.I am very likely to take advantage of their services again in the future."

I would not have enjoyed my trip to Nepal as much if it had not been for the support and assistance of this great company.

He checked up on us regularly to make sure we were doing ok - and I am please to say we were able to maintain his 100% everest base camp success rate! He even arranged a relaxing post-trek trip to Pokhara and took us out to a traditional dinner at a local restaurant. Highly recommended."

Overall we had a fantastic experience and found Prakash from Google Treks Nepal to be a brilliant tour coordinator. Whilst in Kathmandu, we stayed at Hotel Nepalaya - it certainly met our expectations. Our sightseeing and airport transfers in Kathmandu were seamless.Our guide once we went to Lukla was Pasang and our Porter was Carey. Both did a wonderful job at assistIng us however they could. We experienced some challenging weather and Pasang did a great job in ensuring we made it to Base Camp (and back down again). There were often times where there was no path to follow due to the snow, Pasang knew the area so well he would create his own (that other tour groups would follow).Throughout the trek, Prakash was on the phone regularly checking to make sure everything was going well. He also made himself available on a daily basis at Kathmandu to ensure we had everything we require. Additionally, due to the closure of Kathmandu airport, Prakash did everything possible to ensure we were able to get the first available flight when the airport reopened.I would have no issues in recommending Google Treks Nepal to anyone considering trekking in Nepal. I recommending emailing Prakash in the first instance and he will be able to put something together for your trip."

He ensured we had ample time to take photographs and walk around the places before or after gathering us to share more information about the place.Trekking guide Ashok was awesome. He also ensured everything was to our comfort and checked on our well-being throughout the trip. Even though he's considered quite young as a mountain guide, he is experienced and was not shy to share stories about other treks he had been to. He always motivates us during the trek and followed our pace.We were accompanied by two caring porters, Hari and Sunde, who were always ensuring our safety and that we had enough food. We enjoyed the whole trek because of these 3 men who never failed to keep us entertained and never left any of us behind.My friends and I really enjoyed our trip in Nepal.

We immediately had a good feeling with him, because he gave us all the questions competently answered and gave us very helpful advice on the way. A large Parti of our trip we organized ourselves, such as the Annapurna Trek. Prakash organized for us the transport to the startpoint, a guided tour in the Mustang in between our selfguided Annapurna Trek. This required a good organization because the guide for the Mustangtrek has to appear at a agreed-upon date at agreed-upon location, all formalities must be completed and the tour must be exactly organized with fixed dates. In Nepal, things do not go strictly according to plan, and you can not rely on everyone and everything. With Prakash... it works! Reassuring it, if you can call someone in Nepal and get a competent service at a fair price. After the Annapurna- and Mustang Trek we traveled further into the South and after that we started an other extended hike in the Langtang Helambu area. Even with these trips we were given valuable advises and well organized transport for the journey to the starting- and endpoints of the treks and good hoteladvises and -bookings . We recommend google-trek and Prakash. Thank for the great service, Prakash!"

There were a group of about 30 Aussies. Prakash was extremely helpful in many aspects of reliable transportation, co-ordination of hotels etc. Further to this, Prakash was instrumental in sourcing a range of specific Nepalese souvenirs for me once I had returned to Australia. He sourced the items, sent images and arranged international freight. He is very trustworthy and helpful. I would recommend his services to anyone. Thankyou Prakash, we appreciate you very much!"

We were two couples planning the trek individually but due to the \"Festival of Lights\" (new year) all offices for getting the permits and TIMS were closed. So we went to Google Treks Nepal agency and got everything we need immediately by taking a porter (Jeep to Jiri, permits, TIMS, flight tickets for return from Lukla, accommodation, porter). The guys were very friendly and helpful. We got a very good porter (Harry) and had a wonderful time on our trek. Every ordered detail was perfectly organized and worked very well (Jeep, permits, flights, porter). The most important point was, we were still independent on our trek. So we decided on our own about the daily trek target and the lodge to stay. Nevertheless our porter Harry was a good advisor for the best lodge in town. During the trek his experiences helped to find the right decision about available options. His communication skills helped us to ease our whole trip. So we were very happy to have him along with us.The prices were reasonable but you should know that the first mentioned price is net. So they added 13% tax on it at the end. Concerning accommodation we would not include it next time because we were fixed to \"common rooms\" which means just the bed. In higher areas you have to pay for the shower separately. So it is better to decide on-site whether you save money taking the \"common room\" or to spend some more money to get a detached shower and toilet. The \"common room\" is much cheaper on-site anyway."

And we couldn't be more satisfied, we arranged for an 18 day trek with Everest Base Camp trek while visiting a Gokyo first, followed by a 3 night Chitwan Jungle Safari in October of 2016. Everything was amazing, simply put. We stayed with Ammar and his family while we were in Kathmandu and they really treated us like friends and family. We could really feel Ammar's generosity and warm heart. Our guide Ram was incredible as well! We really felt a strong connection with him by the end of our trek. He knew English really well and definitely knew everything about where we were and about the Himalayan culture on our trek. What I thought was an exceptional job on his part was when I got sick when we were in Gokyo, we wanted to see if there was another route we could take that was just as scenic, just not to base camp, and he sat us down with a map and showed us where all we could go for the rest of our trek. We were left not having a single regret and not feeling like we missed out on base camp. Especially since we did make it to Gokyo! Our Chitwan trip the perfect way to relax after our long trek, Ammar booked us the Chitwan Village Resort and it was nothing short of amazing! On our bus trip back from Chitwan, I somehow managed to forget our camera on the bus and didn't realize it till an hour or so later, feeling defeated and terrible, Ammar was quick to call the bus company and they said they found it! So Ammar and his kind heart walked my husband down to the bus station at 6am the next morning to retrieve it. I don't think we would be able to get our camera back without him! I couldn't imagine a more ideal way to visit another country.-KandiceHello, I'm Patrick, Kandices husband. Prior to our arrival to this Nepal I didn't quite know what to expect other than trekking followed by relaxation. When we arrived we were greeted by Ram and taken to Ammar's home, after we formally met and he showed us around we settled in and caught up on some much needed rest. The following day he took time out to address and questions or concerns, and that evening we met our guide to be and had ample time to get to know him. The trip in its entirety was exceptional just as Kandice described, with our guide and Ammar taking time out for us whenever we felt we required something or anything further. The hospitality in my opinion, is unmatched as Ammar and his entire family are very kind and forthcoming, I cannot recommend anyone else as I cannot vouch for their services. If you do just so happen to choose GT you will not be disappointed, the staff here even showed us around a busier part of the city where the market resides, and even lent us a personal cellphone if we became lost, that's unheard of! If you have any other questions about the company or our experience please feel free to contact me at eight one six six five one zero four six zero. Thank you"

It was a great physical challenge and the walk up at times could be quite tough but it was a extremely rewarding and satisfying. Although I did meet a few people who did the trek without a guide I personally believe that it would only be a dis service to yourself to not have one. Umesh is a wealth of knowledge and had amazing stories to tell. It was a great piece of mind having him with us knowing he was there to look after us. I can not recommend enough Goyko Treks and Expeditions. Ammar welcomes you into his home and he does everything within his power to ensure you leave Nepal having experienced a trip of a life time !

I booked a trekking in Annapurna in advance with Gokyo Treks and Expedition and could not be happier for my decision. Ammar Guni, manager of the agency, offered me to stay at his house in Kathmandu before and after the commencement of the trekking. Ammar and his family treated me as a friend not as a client. They are very warm people who ensured I am well and safe and made me feel like home. The house is located about 25' by taxi from the airport in a quite neighbourhood and is just a 20' walk on foot from touristic Thamel, which makes it an excellent location to explore Kathmandu. Ammar organised the trekking to perfection. He was proactive in informing me prior my departure of the weather conditions that could affect my trekking and suggested alternatives. Ammar assigned me as porter-guide Kamal. I could not have been more content. Kamal is the best guide ever. He took care of me when I was sick and made sure that I eat properly and take my medicine, selected nice tea houses and bargained accommodation prices, motivated me when the altitude and exhaustion had taken a toll on me, in short he was my guardian angel during the whole trekking. He is an experienced and knowledgeable guide and a beautiful soul. Judging from Kamal, I am 100% that all the guides, who work at Gokyo Treks, are experienced and reliable. Apart from organising the trekking, Ammar also informed me of sights I could visit during my staying at Kathmandu and even booked the taxis to and from the airport, always at the best prices. Moreover, his nephew accompanied me the day of my arrival to the city center to purchase trekking equipment. With all these services Ammar went far beyond his role as a trekking agent. The professionalism, generosity and hospitality of Ammar, his team and his family is exceptional! He made my trip to Nepal a memorable experience. I could not have chosen a better agency. I will definitely be back! If you have doubts, whether to book with Gokyo trekking or not, just BOOK!"

This past May (2016) I completed the Annapurna Circuit in 15 days, largely thanks to the guiding services provided by Gokyo Treks and Expedition. At the start of my trip I had planned to hike Manaslu but due to an illness with my trekking partner I had to change plans last minute. Fortunately, Ammar (owner of Gokyo) was able to help me and provide info, which ultimately led to me choosing Annapurna. During my 2 days in Kathmandu, Ammar and his family also provided a very nice and convenient homestay while helping me prepare for my trek (buying jackets, etc.).The trek itself was everything I had imagined and more - my guide, Kamal (KC) was helpful and knowledgeable. He knew the best routes to take and provided me assurance, help, and motivation when necessary (i.e. when I had some stomach issues). KC was also more than just a guide - by the end he became a friend. He's somebody I felt very comfortable around, kept things interesting, and even taught me some Nepalese (bistare bistare). I'd highly recommend not only Gokyo Treks but also KC as a guide. Additionally, the prices offered by Gokyo were the best I could find when compared to several other agencies. Finally, the services Gokyo provides to the community (schools, tutoring, etc) made it a no brainer to choose them. Hopefully this review will help others make their decision - having an experienced guide made everything so much easier (knowing what lodging, food places, etc.)."

We were a little afraid of dying according to the driving style but we and our backpacks arrived alive and well at the destination. The trekking was filled with phenomenal views and hurting legs (it gets better after the first few days ;) ). Bhupal knew the trek very well and could help me when i got a little hight sick right before the pass.We met a lot of people on the way who didn't have a guide and i have to say if you have some trekking experience in the mountains it is not necessary to have one. But we were really glad to have one especially at the beginning and when i had problems with the hight. He also knew at which places it was safe to eat. A few people we met, got food poisoning on the trek which is the last thing you want when you have to walk 20km a day going up and down.It took us 15 days in total, to complete the whole circuit.We were happy to support Gokyo Treks since Ammar showed us a lot of projects they do such as rebuilding schools and helping families who lost their homes due to the big earthquake."

It was a big pleasure to see my friend Mr. Ammar Guni after such a long time. He has a great organization and excellent guides.  We had an incredible trekking in Langtang National Park. This hiking route contains everything; forest, high mountains, buddhist village and warm lodges. Everything was taken care of for us by our guide so all we had to do was enjoy the view.I strongly recommend Gokyo Treks & Expedition, and would go back again!"

Right from the planning stages of our Expedition to Annapurna Base Camp our company 'Gokyo Treks & Expedition' were extremely helpful with emails giving us clear directions what to do about money, visas, costs, food, gear - what to bring. With their perfect English all our communications were clear and the planning and preparation went smoothly. We flew to Kathmandu our company 'Gokyo Treks & Expedition' met us at the Hotel as we arrived. There we met our Guide Ram who also spoke perfect English. The Guide and Porter were always flexible and changed plans to suit our fitness levels when ever we needed. We took our time and reached our destination Annapurna Base Camp at 4130mt easily. The Trek the scenery the people were always helpful and smiling kind people. All along the route are Hotels, Guest Houses, Tea Houses so you could stop all along the way for tea & food.

Ammar's attention to detail in ensuring our every comfort, from our airport pick-up in Kathmandu to our last meal in his family home after the trek, left us unwilling to go home.On the trek, our guide Som was not only knowledgable and professional but also an excellent companion in the remoteness and beauty of the Gokyo track. We have continued to remain in touch some months after our journey.Aside from his excellent staff and service, Ammar's work in the community is the main reason to use his company. Gokyo Treks and Expiditions is run entirely to benefit the people of Nepal, with the majority of profits being channeled into school building projects and disaster relief in remote areas. His guides and porters are well paid and their welfare is the foremost concern. As we were concerned about the ethicality of our trip, Ammar's deep passion for the empowerment of the Nepalese people put our minds at ease.Thanks Gokyo Treks and Expiditions for an experience we will never forget."

It was really lucky for us to met Gokyo Treks team. They really gave their best service as recommended by my friend who went to Nepal 2 months earlier. Ammar Guni helped us to fixed our itinerary, informed us the basic needs for the trip (weather, clothes, etc) and arranged the transport we would use before our trip. Ram Thapaliya, our tour guide helped and accompanied us along the trip and minimize any hassle. He showed the good local food and good places, explained us the history and Nepali culture with excitement and tired less. I really appreciated his patience with the girl stuffs : shopping, eating and taking pictures! And even though Ammar was not our guide, he kept in contact frequently to make sure we enjoyed our trip and to made sure we were safe. It also appreciated. Thank you Gokyo Trek, for sure we will contact you again for our next trip to Nepal."

The owner of the company, Mr. Guni and his family, provided a first-class homestay and the trip itself was incredible nice.Our guide was also very professional and whenever there was a problem, he solved it, whenever we had a wish, he fulfilled it.

There was a fair amount of driving as we covered a large area of Nepal and our driver (sorry I've forgot the name) was excellent. The roads were damaged and the traffic was heavy, but we felt safe and comfortable on the road with him.

We stumbled upon Gokyo Treks and Expeditions during our long search for the right trekking company and immediately warmed to the accomodating and helpful nature of Ammar, the company director. He was able to help with any questions we had, at any hour and also made organising the trek incredibly easy. Upon our arrival in Kathmandu we were picked up by a company representative which was so helpful after many hours of flying. The last thing we wanted to do was seek out a reliable taxi service. We even got to stay at Ammar's home for the evening leading up to our trek!The trek itself was incredible. Our guide Som was incredibly professional, caring, funny and knowledgable in aspects of the trek's culture, religion, landscape, weather, food and much more. We could not be happier with our awesome guide who truly made our trek the best it could have possibly been! In addition to the company's prefessionalism and ease at organising the treks, part of the trek cost is allocated to their volunteer work in which they work towards improving health and education in remote village areas. They have also done extensive work on disaster relief following the April 2015 Earthquake. I would highly recommend Gokyo Treks and Expeditions not only for their excellent service but also for their commendable efforts in their volunteer work. I will definitely be using this company for our next trek as well!!!"

Due to time and the Monsoon season we were limited in regards to the Trekking trails we could walk. We Trekked the Kathmandu Valley. It was 4 days of Trekking. About 6-7 hours walking a day, about 15-20km. What an amazing experience ! Of course if time permitted we would have loved to walk longer but 4 days is still enough time to disconnect from the modern world and plug into nature. The walk itself was stunning ! Not a difficult walk but still quite challenging. The nature is stunning , we meet some very nice people along the way in many little villages. The Nepalese are very warm and hospitable people. The most friendly people I have ever encountered. Gokyo Treks and Expeditions are an amazing Tour operator ! Ammar organised our entire trip, he welcomed us in his home and made us feel like one of the family . He provides an exceptional service and goes above and beyond with his hospitality. One day we will return to Kathmandu to take on an even more challenging Trek like Annapurna or Everest base camp. Gokyo Treks provide a tailored made Trek for any type of Trekking adventure and we look forward to our next Trek with Goyko Treks. Thank you once again Ammar and Kamel, it was a pleasure to meet you both and we look forward to seeing you again for your next Trek !"

For:\u2022 Fantastic trek for mountains, villages, culture, adventure\u2022 Gokyo Valley has less crowds & is different in a number of ways from the main Khumbu valley \u2022 Gokyo Ri experience and views were fantastic\u2022 EBC is a thrill although it is basically only a sign surrounded by tourists during the non-climbing season\u2022 views from Gorek Shep are excellent\u2022 The Cho La pass from Gokyo valley to Khumbu Valley is spectacular, but very hard work at high altitude & a bit dangerous if icy\u2022 Tea Houses or Lodges are very basic but the common rooms are generally friendly & warm\u2022 The flight and landing/take-off from Lukla are a thrill, and Lukla is a good place to start-return\u2022 Namche Bazaar has a wide range of shops, views, food & musea and things to see so interesting for a day or 2.Against:\u2022 Main Khumbu valley is very busy, on our return leg down the valley, we were probably passing ~500 people /day\u2022 Gokyo valley is quieter & has a different feel to the Khumbu valley, but you do climb quicker so be very careful of Altitude Sickness\u2022 Many of the porters on the trail carry incredibly heavy loads and they are generally just lowland farmers working for extra money, so they have no genetic advantage to normal people to altitude, so please monitor & help them as much as possibleTrekking Mart provides very good service, an excellent range of itineraries and at reasonable costs, so we would definitely use them again."

We are happy that we did.Ammar the owner/manager keeps communication regular and quick - this is important when you are making all your plans from overseas and via email. I found his dealings transparent and honest, also important when dealing from overseas.Our guide was Kamal, who was very experienced, knowledgeable and polite. He went out of his way to make sure our needs were catered for, was patient when our walking pace slowed and was very flexible to change things if unplanned circumstances arose.All in all, Kamal and the Gokyo Treks team help make our first trip to Nepal a very pleasant and unforgettable one, allowing us the enjoy the sights and sounds of the Himalayas fully whilst taking care of all the logistics during a very busy peak season.If you're shopping around for a transparent, good-value Nepalese trekking agency, add these guys to your list."

She, unfortunately, could not join me for the trek so I embarked on this adventure to the Annapurna Base Camp (ABC) alone with my guide, Kamal.Let me start this review with my guide: Kamal. I was expecting someone to simply show me the way to the ABC. Kamal ended up being a trekking guide, a cultural guide, a culinary guide... You name it, he did it! He pointed out bee-hives in the Himalayas, always took the time to explain in full details any cultural questions that I had, negotiated on my behalf and was attentive to my every need. In a nutshell, I could not have asked for a more respectful, thoughtful, kind and knowledgeable guide (whose English happened to be amazing)! If I make it back to Nepal for another trek, Kamal is the guide I will be asking for.The journey to and from the ABC was spectacular. It was physically challenging but, thanks to Kamal's patience and encouragement, I never felt pressured. I did this trek during the rain season (July 2014), which means that I did not get the full bright and sunny views. However, I had the privilege of seeing the Himalayas with mystical and magical lenses as the light and the clouds would reveal the mountains in the most spectacular way (see pictures below).Lastly, I want to thank Ammar, the owner and director of Tokyo Treks and Expedition, for providing and excellent price to quality ratio for this adventure. He accommodated my budget with the time I had and made sure my expectations were met.Margaux Yost"

Once i reached Kathmundu, he also helped me immensely with outfitting myself for the trek. As for my guide, i can't say enough nice words about him. He lent me a hand where needed, and he egged me on where appropriate. He saw how i fared and he took that into account when planning the next day. He was lively, kind, considerate and thanks to him and Gokyo i came back home stronger, wiser, more confident in my abilities and with a rich treasure-trove of memories that will sustain me for a very long time to come.It should be obvious by now that i'll recommend Gokyo quite fervently to anyone asking for my recommendations :-)"

When he successfully came back from the trip, I was quite jealous when I saw great pictures of him and heard his stories about how good Nepal and Gokyo Treks is (he always mentioned that he misses his guide, Som very much). So, when we got married early April this year, I've decided that I wanted the same trip to Nepal for our honeymoon. I never thought that I would enjoy my trip to Nepal very much. Thank you Gokyo Treks & Expiditions for making my honeymoon by far the best vacation I have ever been. Thank you Ammar Raj Guni for arranging this trip.. Thank you Som for picking us up at the airport and walks us to the hiking stores.. And million thanks to our guide, Kamal Bahadur for all his services and guidance throughout the trip. One thing that I will always remember is that, they treat all of us like family. Its a sad goodbye because I love Nepal and Nepali people. But, this will not be my last trip to Nepal.

My travel companion and I did the Annapurna circuit trek in early June 2013, and chanced upon the reviews for Gokyo Treks on tripadvisor while planning for our trip. Due to the great reviews here, we decided to contact Ammar to plan for our short stay in Nepal.The first thing that struck me was not only how quick Ammar was to answer our queries, but the level of detail and transparency he provided in every single email exchange we had. Because of the very reasonable prices his agency was able to provide us, as well as the honest suggestions and tips that we felt he provided in our interest, we were very comfortable in signing up with Ammar and his team before arriving in Nepal. Before our trip, Ammar provided us with a detailed itinerary, as well as a full break down of what we were exactly paying for. The highlight of the trip really was our fantastic guide and porter, Umesh and Mundri. We always felt like they truly had our interests at heart - making sure we had enough to eat, that we were happy with our rooms, that we weren't feeling too cold etc. Mundri would always lookout for ways to help us have an easier trekking experience, and the best thing he did for us was to get us some sturdy branches that he skilfully turned into hiking poles after a few shaves with a rock. Umesh, being the experienced guide that he was, got us safely through a newly formed landslide and avalanche (scariest moment of our trip). At the end of our trip, he even invited us to his place and cooked us an amazing dinner, a gesture and experience we will remember for life.Although this is a really long review, all I'm trying to say is this: Gokyo Treks made my virgin Nepal experience an unforgettable and fantastic one, and I will not hesitate to recommend them to anyone thinking of having a memorable, once-in-a-lifetime experience in Nepal."

In Kathmandu angekommen, traf man sich in seinem B\u00fcro um alle Einzelheiten zu besprechen. Meine Tour wurde etwas indiviuell und flexibel gehalten. Der engagierte F\u00fchrer (Niru) und der Tr\u00e4ger (Umesh) waren der Hit! Wir hatten jede Menge Spa\u00df und sie k\u00fcmmerten sich immer sehr um mich. Ich w\u00fcrde jederzeit wieder eine Tour bei Ammar buchen und kann ihn nur w\u00e4rmstens empfehlen. Der Everest Base Camp Trek (inkl. Kala Pathar) war eines der sch\u00f6nesten Erlebnisse, die ich bislang hatte. My tour to the Everest Base Camp was excellent. I wrote many emails to Ammar before I flew to Kathmandu and got very quick and friendly response. When I arrived in Kathmandu, we met in his office to clarify the details for the tour. My tour was an invidual and flexible tour. The guide (Niru) and porter (Umesh) were great and we much fun! I enjoyed my time with them a lot and they were taking care of me very well. I would book a tour with Ammar (Gokyo Treks) again and can warmly recommed him. The trek to EBC (including Kala Pathar) was one of the most amazing experiences in my life so far!"

            "review": "Langtang and Annapurna Circuit. Gokyo Treks and Expedition is an excellent smaller guide company that created a custom made tour for me as an independent traveller. I had a relatively small window of time (10 days), and I wanted to see as much as possible - after emailing extensively with the hardworking, responsive, and responsible Ammar, the manager at Gokyo, we decided upon the Langtang and Annapurna regions. To be as efficient as possible, my guide and I flew between the 2 regions.The strengths of Gokyo are that they are able to custom build an itinerary that suits your needs. Also, although Ammar is slightly unusual looking (I kid, he is a very handsome man), he was very patient and responsive to my inquiries. The trip itself was really stunning, and I had a memorable time with a very friendly and knowledgable guide. As additional support to use this company, Ammar and Gokyo give back approximately 10% of their yearly earnings back to the community. In the past few years, they were able to help build waterpipes and toilets to a regional school, and have additional plans to provide health resources to their local community. These people care about nurturing their community, and it speaks volumes about their character. The services provided were professional and very reasonable priced. I would highly recommend Ammar and his trekking company. Rob C"

I hadn't had a lot of experience of trekking so Ammar wisely suggested i do the lang tang then move up to the more grueling Manasalu. From Ammar organising the itinerary to our guide (KC) and our porter (Mundray) everything went perfectly. We did a circuit of Mt Manaslu with a trip up and down the Tsum Valley. At all times KC & Mundray were friendly, helpful and always on hand. They showed me local customs, taught me Nepali and became genuine friends on this trek. Mundray was especially adept at finding a bottle of Raksi (Rice Wine) in an emergency. I am have never felt so welcome in a country as when i had KC and Mundray along to show us the Himalayas. They were also very sure that we ate properly, had enough blamkets at night and also that we were feeling ok. As we went up to over 5000metres it was fairly dangerous but we were never rushed by KC. It was always we were able to do i never felt under pressure. As some hygiene standards were a little lax inthe kitchens of the home stays we rested in KC always supervised cooking to make sure we didnt fall ill.I had a few days in Kathmandu before the trek so I checked with other agencies to see if i could get a better deal. I saw 5 in the Thamel area and it was impossible. None came close even without a porter!! I am already thinking about my next trek in the mustang area and i will insist i trek with KC and Mundray and whenever i meet other travellers who are thinking about going to Nepal i recommend Gokyo straight away. They treat their guides and porters properly which cannot be said about a lot of Trekking agencies in Kathmandu and also promote sustainable tourism. Thank you Ammar, KC & Mundray."

Personally, I love Gokyo trek than Everest base camp because of spectacular mountains view from Gokyo Ri 5357m including Mt Everest 8848 meter above sea level {world highest peak}, Mt Lhotse 8501m {4th highest in the world}, Mt Makalu 8463m {5th highest in the world} & Mt Cho Oyu 8153m {8th highest in the world}, {approximately Elevation} and numerous snow copped peaks surrounding you. Actually, you ca not see the Mount Everest from Everest base camp. If you have flexible or more time then would like to suggest to visit to fifth lake of Gokyo valley which lies nearby Mount Cho Oyu and can see Mt Everest as well, so fine shape. You can see and visit the Ngozungpa glacier, it is largest glacier in Nepal. You can enjoy with flora and fauna as well in this trek in Nepal. There are good lodges and hygienic foods available."

We chose them from about 30 options because the price was very reasonable and they would organize things the way WE wanted, not how it would be convenient for THEM. It sounded too good to be true so we were quite suspicious.However, everything turned out better than we could ever imagine. Amar chose a guide for us that we first though was too young to be experienced but Pasang proved to be the best guide ever. He went way beyond the call of duty to make our journey as fantastic as it could be. I have asthma and expected problems but Pasang and our porter Lakpa were always on the alert and followed me like shadows prepared to help any minute. We were so impressed with Pasang's knowledge and kind and joyful character that offered him to join us on the Annapurna trek and we never regretted this.Amar on his side could solve almost any problem, hard even to think what he couldn't help with. Ram helped us to choose equipment we wanted to hire and everything was of very good quality and survived the trip. In other words, if I ever go travelling in Nepal again, there is only one touring company I will go to - Gokyo Treks. Thank you very much, guys! You are the best!"

It was my first time in Asia and I was a bit apprehensive about the whole trip. We hired a guide, Krishna, from Gokyo Treks to guide us through the trip. It was the best thing we did. Krishna smoothed our bus and jeep journeys to and from the trailhead, guided us through the maze of hostels and hotels on the trail; in few places because of the washed trail, we would be lost without him. The most memorable event was negotiating with the guard armed with the saw off shotgun and a Ghurkha knife at the entrance to the bank. Apart for smoothing the way at all corners we visited with him the Buddhist temple, the local artisans, we were invited by local villagers for tea, and visited the ayurvedic Natural Hospital at Mukhtina. Without the guide from Gokyo Treks out trip would have been so much less memorable. Yes, if you ask, I would hire the guide from Gokyo Treks again."

Every single trip I made to Nepal (either myself or with a group of clients) I used the services of Gokyo Treks & Expedition Pvt ltd. and have never been disappointed. Nepal is a bit different World on its own, in some way rushy, in other slow, but definitely different. But that is why the people travel - to discover and to learn these differences. However, sometimes cultural misunderstanding in combination with language barriers may culminate into a stressful experience which hides the merits of travelling. At the first place, I talk about problems in hotels, booking confusions, wrong understanding between driver and the group, slow processing of some services etc. These are the experiences you don't need to take with from Nepal. As far as now I have to say that Gokyo Treks & Expedition team is the very best choice. They are helpful, they understand well the needs and wishes of foreigners, have good, safe and careful partners and at any time during providing their services to you they are listening and are very flexible to accommodate to you (e.g. if you want to have a change in your itinerary or change the driver because he/she's too rushy to you)... If you want pleasant and financially budget trip in Nepal, the Gokyo Treks & Expedition would be your right choice."

I really cannot speak highly enough of the effort that she put in to make my visit memorable and smooth. Nothing was too much trouble for her.Last year Nepal Social Treks organised a short trek for me in Nepal which went so smoothly I thought I would try them again this year. I am so glad I did! I would highly recommend them to anyone thinking of going to Nepal or Tibet."

I cannot begin to describe how wonderful Nepal Social were in making our trip to Nepal the most exciting and stress free holiday ever.We met with the owners Ram and Sajana on numerous occasions and nothing was too much trouble for them. They are totally professional and so friendly to deal with.I was a first timer to Katmandu and believe me, without their help and guidance I think I would have been on the first flight back to Sydney.Many thanks again for a fabulous holiday and I will be back again with your help of course."

After many emails from myself, which were all answered quickly, I was reassured to know I was dealing with a professional team. My trip was perfect, I got to see everything I wanted. My plans changed slightly as I had a little more time than I thought, and Ram and Sajana helped my book side trips to Pokhara and Chitwan, taking care of all the necessary arrangements. By the time I left I felt like part of the family! I'm so grateful for all the work they did to make my trip unforgettable.My guide for the EBC trek was Indra (we shared a birthday on the trek!). He was knowledgeable, friendly and helpful, and seemed to know everyone in the villages! He made my trip easy with his guidance and I feel that I learned so much more about the region than I would have elsewhere. His English was excellent, when listening to other groups I noticed there was sometimes a language barrier, so this was a massive bonus.Thank you all so much for everything, I cannot recommend your company enough to anyone thinking of visiting Nepal."

            "review": "Gokyo \u2013 Chola Pass - EBC Trek / Bhutan Tour with Nepal Social Trek. After some research we followed the TripAdvisor recommendations and contacted Nepal Social Trek via the contact details on their website. Ram and his wife Sajana made sure that we would feel welcome in Nepal, even before we arrived. The communication and arrangements beforehand went smooth prior to our arrival. Even our many questions and change requests to the itinerary were always dealt with immediately. From the pick-up at the airport to the drop-off a month later, everything was taken good care off by the people in Nepal Social Trek.We chose the more challenging and longer route to EBC via Gokyo and Chola-Pass, our guide Achut was the perfect companion, he made sure we stayed safe throughout the trek and that we get proper rest in the well-chosen hotels/tea houses. The trek via Gokyo is very beautiful and it\u2019s worth adding a few days more to the regular EBC trek. When we had to cross Chola Pass we were very unlucky with the weather, it started to snow heavily when we started to hike up the pass. The hike was very steep on ice and fresh snow, we were glad that Achut with his experience was not afraid and helped us to reach the top safely (he pulled us more or less up the pass). Going down over the glacier was not less scary, especially since we could not see a path, since we already trekked with Achut for many days we fully trusted in his abilities to get us safe through the ice field and the most dangerous portion of our trek.Achut knows the Khumbu region very well and has a lot of stories to share, which was very entertaining during the many hours on the trails. When our porter became sick (AMS) and we couldn\u2019t find a porter for hire in the mountains, Achut was willingly carrying our baggage for three days (luckily we packed light and only had 16kg together as a couple, and we loaded a few heavier items in our day-packs for that period). All in all we felt very well look after by Achut. I would recommend all trekker to hire a guide and a porter for the trek to EBC (no matter which route), as this ensures you don\u2019t have to worry about accommodation, heavy load on your back (we have seen many people suffering carrying all their luggage) and the days planning, but you can just enjoy the beauty of Khumbu.If we would do this trek again we would again book the tour package with Nepal Social Trek (which included all meals, the tea with the meal, accommodation, permits, flights KTM-Lukla-KTM, porter, guide) as it makes the trek less troublesome and we only needed to carry cash for any luxury we wanted in the mountains (for example cookies from an amazing bakery on Gokyo).After our return to Kathmandu from the lengthy and exhausting trek we stayed 3 nights in the city to relax and get used to civilization again :)Our Bhutan trip was also fully organized by Ram and Sajana, who briefed us with the details for the trip the day prior to the departure. Again we booked a package which included flights (KTM-Paro-KTM), accommodation, meals, guide, driver, permits and visas. Everything went very smooth in Bhutan, our guide (Mr. Namgay) and driver (Mr. Tobden) [as a foreigner it is required to be accompanied by a guide and a driver in Bhutan] picked us up from the airport and our cultural tour through beautiful Bhutan started immediately. Mr. Namgay and Mr. Tobden were dressed in the Bhutanese traditional dress Gho and welcomed us with the traditional Khata (Buddhist scarf, representing well-wished). Throughout our 4 days in Bhutan we were able to learn a lot about wonderful Bhutan and the Bhutanese people. This country is full of culture, Bhutan is certainly worth a visit. Although after 2 days of visiting fortresses, monasteries and temples it is very difficult to follow all the explanations of the statues and paintings throughout, but the beauty is still amazing. Ram and Sajana organized everything very well.Many thanks to all friends from Nepal Social Trek, we had a great time under your care :)"

Our family just finished the Everest base camp trek with the Nepal social treks and expedition organization and could not have been more pleased with our experience. My husband, 13 year old daughter and myself completed the trek with the excellent support and service of our guide (Achut) and porter (Kalu). Combined these gentlemen had 36 years of experience trekking in the Himalayas and it really was evident. Everything from logistics, food, accommodation, etc. were executed perfectly. Given their advice and support, we completed the trek and Kala Pattar summit without any illness, injury and most importantly no altitude sickness. This far exceeded our expectation particularly for a developing country and the intense, difficult terrain. Our wonderful experience would not have been possible without their incredible support. The extra touches ( including several kilos of fresh fruit carried by our guide ) and customizations for the strength and skill of our individual family members really made for a great experience .I also want to mention the office staff. In particular Ram and Sakarya who made us feel welcome before, during and at the completion of our trip. They did a great job matching our family with the appropriate guide. In addition, The river rafting trip and visit to a local school are cherished memories also made possible by the office. We also appreciated both the welcome and departure dinners with other travelers. I would highly recommend this organization and look forward to the day we can return to this wonderful country. "

We helped rebuild the school where village kids go to and distributed the goods we had collected prior to our trip. We also did a small trek to get a glimpse of the nepali mountain wonders (the annapurnas).Our experience was complete and genuine.

They put together a wonderful itinerary and made sure were were taken care of all along the way. They were exceptionally lovely people down to the very last--and I think we met most of the staff by the time it was all over. Overall I feel it was good value for money and I have exceptionally fond memories of all the guides we had along the way.I VERY MUCH want to give them 5 circles just because they're all so lovely, but I save 5s for perfection, and we had several small issues along the way--all of which were dealt with professionally and quickly. We were unhappy with 2 of the hotels they booked for us. That said, when we voiced our concerns, they booked us in new and BETTER hotels right away. When originally booking our tour, we had some communication issues and ended up 2 nights short on our itinerary. They bent over backward to fix this issue, and the last 2 days ended up our favorite days. At one point in the middle of our tour they changed our schedule without asking us first. It ended up a good change, and we were happy, but as a matter of policy it's better to ask people before changing their itinerary. AND NOW for the GOOD things. I really feel they are a wonderful group of very hard working individuals. They organized a wonderful birthday dinner for my father, and were AMAZING with my 2 kids. Recommendations for restaurants were all spot-on and we loved the guides they set us up with. The hotel they booked for us in Chitwan was amazing (and set the bar higher wrt our expectations elsewhere). They arranged for us to visit an orphanage and donate some items. Every staff member we had conversations with was caring and committed to charity work and social improvement. We were one of only a couple families with young children I saw the whole trip, and admittedly when you have young children your requirements for comfort and happiness are different from the foot-loose and fancy free backpacker crowd they normally cater towards. I'll cut them some slack in that regard. I recommend using NST for your vacation, just be very clear about comfort expectations if you're traveling with kids. Don't be afraid to tell them right away if you're not happy. They will do everything they can to fix it."

The route that Ram, the business owner suggested was definitely not for beginners. Considering the fact that the mid-section of the trail was destroyed, I was lucky to come out of it with only a broken ankle. High altitude sickness, hypothermia, leech infestations, you name it. Not sure if I was in more physical or emotional pain, but I'd say it's an equally high amount of both. Nepal Social did not do their research for the area (post-Earthquake trail and weather conditions). No beginner trekkers should be out in the Gosainkunda-Suryakunda Path unless you're a landslide and torrential rain enthusiast, or if you're into traversing mountain sides with no safety gear and with no way of being medically evacuated.After the trek, we were supposed to go on a volunteering program. Ram made all sorts of promises but no surprise, he flaked on us as we waited for him the day he was supposed to pick us up and we had to look for other ways to hand out donations by ourselves. I remember thinking how ridiculous the whole ordeal was and how unbelievably unprofessional Nepal Social Treks conducted their business that no one back home could possibly believe us when we tell them what happened. I hope this will serve to give others an idea of what our experience was like. There are many other more honest and safe trekking companies in Nepal. I wouldn't in a million years consider NST as one of them. My ankle will eventually heal but the trauma and disappointment will stay in my memory for a very long time."

Nepal Social organised the 10 Days Annapurna Panaromic Trek to cross over Thorong La Pass from 04 Sept 2015. This is 2nd time I engaged Nepal Social as they arranged such a memorable & wonderful 12 Days Gokyo Ri (5,360m) Trek in Sept 2012, that I had no reservation to re-engage them this time for the Annapurna Trek. All itineraries and provisions were as per they promised in the quotation. Nepal Social is flexible to changes of itinerary with short notice e.g. changing from 2 Nites in Muktinah to 1 nite each in Muktinah & Pokhara. They also provided me for this trek the same guide that took me to Gokyo Ri in 2012. The guide is very patient, professional, responsible, jovious chap who speak very good English, and ensure I am happy & comfortable with all the tea-house accommodation at each village. All in all, a professional & responsible Trekking agent you can rely upon.It is a pity that there are so few trekkers, due apparently to negative news reporting of earthquake damages in April. The Annapurna/Pokhara are NOT at all damaged by the April earthquake. I hope more trekkers will visit Nepal to help the local villagers, who depend very much on tourism for their livelihood."

            "review": "Bad - Not all you read here is true. Right at the start, we got the sense that it was going to be terrible. They forgot to pick us up at the airport, and we actually had to call to remind them. They came eventually, but much later. We were promised a decent hotel at Kathmandu based on the itinerary, but it transpired that that hotel was fully booked on the day we arrived. What puzzled me was why didn't they book the hotel for us in advance, because we certainly booked our trip earlier and paid them in advance. Anyway, they checked us into a terrible hotel at the last minute. No apology was given for that as well, since they were pretty much trying to tell us that both hotels were about the same. It's definitely not, just like a two star hotel is different from a four star one. Let's talk about the tours next. Everyday was like a mystery. You really learn to be patient there. When we asked our guide what was going to happen tomorrow and what time to wait etc, their typical response was I'd let you know. And they wouldn't let us know till it was late into the night, because they changed guides for us everyday and each guide wouldn't know what was on tomorrow. Good way to earn more tips for the guides, I get it. At least one driver didn't know where to take us even (because the guide left earlier), and had to rely on us to tell him. We could only hazard a guess, and thank god we were right! Because it meant that the hotel they were meant to book for us was booked! We actually cheered there and then, which pretty much tells you how low our expectations for them were at that point. Ok, now the good about them. A few of the guides were knowledgeable and had good attitude. The itinerary in Nepal was fun and well planned, and the entire trip was reasonably priced. Nepal is beautiful, exotic and interesting, and really a country worth visiting! We also booked a trip to Tibet through them, and it was bad as well. They arranged hotels with no attached toilet or shower facilities for us, even though we specifically asked and confirmed with them that all our rooms would have such facilities. The Tibet part was expensive as well, which led us to think they probably gave themselves too much commission. On the upside, the guide and driver in Tibet were sincere and quite good. Overall, this agency definitely does not deserve such good ratings on trips adviser. Buyers beware, I suspect that not all that you read here is true."

We spent 15 days in Nepal, trekking in the Langtang Himal, paragliding in Pokhara, rafting on the Trishuli river, sampling local cuisine and visiting the local cinema for a Nepali movie. We spent a night in Bhaktapur next to the largest temple in the old city and explored temples and monasteries across the country. It was an amazing trip and we could happily have stayed for another two months was it not for work back home awaiting us. Basu (aka the Magician) and the team at Nepal Social have organised all this extravaganza of activities amazingly efficiently, so that the whole trip went smoothly and we could fit in twice as much as we expected without ever feeling stressed about it. Thank you guys for an amazing stay!! We will be back :-)"

We did the Three High Pass trek with our guide Achut (R2 to us!) and our Porter Kaloo in mid December. It was really important to me when searching this trip that we went with a local company and with a company that treated their guides well. I cant even begin to put into words how amazing Achut was and I truly do believe he was the reason why our trip was such a success. He always made sure we were doing well and feeling good. He took the time to show us animals, vegetation, and to talk about culture. We had numerous games of cards, had many laughs, and danced to stay warm at 5550 meters while watching the sunset on everest. He treated our porter like his best friend and although the language barrier prevented us from conversing with Kaloo\u2026 we still shared many laughs with him along the way. Basu the owner was easy to work with when setting up the trip. Our pick up was great, our hotels were great, and our city tour that was included was awesome. Our city guide was very knowledgable and a pleasure to spend the day with. Our final dinner with Basu was a great way to end our trip. Not only did we get a better chance to get to know Basu, but it was also cultural dance and dinner show to send us off. From our experience, this company was a great choice. Thank you Nepal Social for the trip and especially to Achut for sharing with us in such an amazing Himalayan adventure!"

Nepal Social Treks offered us a very competitive price which we couldn't refuse, though we were originally worried this might mean we would miss out on quality. Luckily, we were very wrong, and enjoyed impeccable service throughout. Our experience could not be faulted - we had excellent weather, stayed in clean and comfortable lodges with friendly staff and enjoyed incredible views along the trek, which is a great one for beginners (it was our first time in Nepal, and our first trek ever). We always enjoyed impeccable service, from pickup, to the hotels, to the trek itself. However, the best thing about this company is their down-to-earth, attentive and friendly staff. Basu, with whom we liaised over email with from Australia, had great English and organised everything without hassle, then helped us from day one when we arrived in Kathmandu, took us out for dinner, met with us regularly to discuss the trek and organised other tours to Chitwan National Park (must do!!) for us. Our guides Bishnu and Shisir were beautiful souls. They took note of our fitness levels and altered pace to suit us, always made sure we were comfortable, helped us with any problem we had and made us laugh alot. By the end of the trek, we knew we had made two very good friends. You can not go wrong doing a trek with Nepal Social Treks. They are the very best of the best!!!"

He's such a man. He's experienced, great caring, and good sense of humor, who can make you laugh all along the journey. After the trip, we spent a day at his house to cook chicken curry with his family.Over all, I would vote two thumbs up for the service of Nepal Social."

When we had to change our trip at the last minute due to the political situation in Kathmandu, they were extremely flexible and accommodating. Our trekking guide Indra was amazing, the teahouses we stayed in and our meals along the way were fantastic, and our porter Raju was brilliant and never stopped smiling as he lugged our bags up the mountain. From arranging day tours, airport transfers, or even just telling us the best value place in Thamel to buy jewellery, they were always ready to help out in any way. I'll definitely be doing more trekking with these guys, and thanks Basu, Indra, Raju and Nama for making our trip to Nepal one of the most fantastic experiences we've ever had!"

Basu was so personable and took much time to kindly and patiently answer the millions of questions we had. I ended up doing three different trips with them: 3 high passes and Everest Base Camp, Island Peak, and Indigenous People's Trail. Each trip was great and I always felt well looked after by all of the guides. I would highly recommend Dil! He was so kind and sweet. The management here is great also. Nirajan is the best! My experience with Nepal Social is that they are your friend above all else. While professional, the relationship I had with the office staff and guides felt really personable. They are my friends, not just a trekking company. Other guides that I observed seemed to be more distant, acting just as that: a guide. The guys at Nepal Social really make an effort to be your friend. They will let you drink tea in the office and will help you with anything you need, from visas, to money exchange, to buying trekking gear, shipping packages, etc. They are also really flexible to work with you to make your trip what you want. As I was signing up for the 3 high passes trek, they told me I could decide later to add Island Peak or Jiri. They take good care of you and will do everything they can to accommodate you and your needs. I can't talk them up enough and confidently recommend them."

            "review": "When things go wrong on the mountain. First, I would like to say that the Everest Base Camp trek is a spectacular and rewarding experience among the highest mountains in the world. It is impossible to capture the scale and grandeur of this region with either words or photos. If you have the desire and ability, please go see it yourself.Nepal Social Treks was my choice for a tour operator. I am pleased and fortunate with my choice. I can't imagine a more competent and accomodating organization. Other reviewers have praised Ram and Basu and the team. I would like to give Nirijan and my guide Buddhi Lama special credit and thanks. Nirijan got me there, Buddhi got me home.I am 63. I have trekked in the Andes and other ranges. I am in good shape and active, but also very aware of the inherent risks of climbing to high altitudes. And, in spite of taking numerous precautions I was stopped at 5000 meters, about 1 day from base camp, by cerebral edema. This is uncommon, but dangerous. So I want to focus my review on how Nepal Social Treks handled this situation.As soon as my symptoms began, our guide Buddhi began to observe me for all signs of altitude sickness. He has received special training in altitude sickness and mountain first aid. When it was clear that I had a problem, I was directed down the mountain accompanied by Dipesh Kulung, a sherpa who knew all trails and conditions on the mountain. My group continued to EBC, and we planned to meet again at a lower altitude. Dipesh guided me, took all of my gear, and attended to all of my food and water needs. He was patient and very helpful. After two days of trekking down, my conditions had not improved. This is when Nepal Social made a very coordinated effort to provide me with immediate care, and remove me from the mountain. Buddhi was dispatched from the rest of the group to my location, even though his steep climb down was during the dark night. He coordinated the local resources that were available in this village. Nirijan worked tirelessly from Kathmandu to coordinate my emergency contacts, my insurance company, and a helicopter ride out. This was clearly a procedure they had already worked out. It was a long night on oxygen for me, but by early the next morning the helicopter arrived. I was shocked to see that Basu himself had flown out with the pilot to take over my care from that point on. He delivered me to the hospital, and remained there until I was cleared by the doctor. I believe that the company's response could not have been any better. They also coordinated all of the documentation required for the insurance payments.In spite of the problem with altitude sickness, I loved my trek. I plan to go back to the Annapurna region someday (but stay below 5000m). And I will most definitely use Nepal Social Treks again!"

I'm a bit delayed as I did the tour in April but I finally got a chance to sit down and write something now.I completed the Annapurna Circuit mid-April, 2013 and I couldn't have asked for a better time. My guide, Bishnu, and my porter, Kamal, were both wonderful and made me feel at ease even though I was completely on my own as no one else ended up joining the tour! I was a bit nervous that I would be the only one on the tour but it ended up being such a fantastic time with such great people! Bishnu was wonderful and really took care of everything - the food was wonderful, all of the people we met were amazing and the tea houses we stayed in were friendly, clean and comfortable. I didn't really know what I was signing up for before I got to Nepal because the circuit was probably the most challenging thing I've ever done in my life. Each day was like a new adventure - the geography, climate, villages, and people changed so much so I felt like I was in a different world every day. Even though I was on my own in the tour, because so many other people were doing the trek, we ended up meeting people at the teahouses to hang out with, drink some beers and play cards with at night. It was such a blast after long days of trekking!Bishnu was absolutely perfect too - we could spend hours talking about whatever was on our minds whilst we were trekking, but we could also just shut up and enjoy the beauty and the entire experience. He was very kind and caring and was never condescending or pushy, even when I wanted to give up and not take another step towards Thorung-La! Everything went without a hitch (other than me losing my iPhone and dropping my camera in a commode but whatever) and I couldn't have asked for a better time :). I am so happy that I researched Nepal Social Treks on tripadvisor prior to coming to Nepal because it really took all of the stress of travelling alone out of the holiday. It may be a bit more expensive than if you take matters in to your own hands and wait until you get to Kathmandu to book a tour, but you never really know what you're going to get with other companies. Plus, Nirajan picked me up from the airport and took me to my hotel which is essential when you're jetlagged and have no idea where you're going. He was also good about being in contact with me before the tour and giving me good advice on how to best prepare and pack before I arrived. I couldn't have asked for a better experience and I really want to promote this tour as well as Bishnu because he was such an incredible guide. You will not regret this experience!!!"

It\u2019s as much of a mental challenge to hike up in that altitude as it is a physical. Furthermore, the trek helped raise money for Nepal\u2019s Orphans Home. We did get the opportunity to go there, hear the stories about how the children came to the home, and also how there are thousands of others who need a home like NOH.

Cousin and I were able to create a tour plan for EBC with Nepal Social Treks (liked this flexibility) incld Gokyo & ChoLa Pass which our fit guide Buddhi helped to make possible. I got altitude sickness and cousin had gastrointestinal issues - Thanx Buddhi for motivating and taking care of us during the trek. He acted as athletic coach, pharmacist and photographer for us in addition to tour guide for EBC. Thanx Dil for taking us around Mustang and teaching me about Nepalese culture.PLUS: Pickup/dropoff to hotel for arrival and departure into and out of KTM"

First, a shout out to Basu, Ram, Nirajan, Buddhi, Dipesh,the porters and the rest of the staff at Nepal Social Treks for the job well done that made our EBC trek last April 7-21 a great success. Thank you so much!I've known Nepal Social Trek online as recommended by a blogger. Months before the trek, I've been exchanging tons of emails with Nirajan inquiring anything about EBC trekking. Promptness in responding to my inquiries is one of the things that i like in this company. Nirajan is always there online 24/7. The thing that i like the most in this company is their being service oriented. They took care of us since the day we arrived in Kathmandu to the day they send as off to the airport. They know what we need need and they provide it. Just excellent! In fact, Basu personally flew to pick one of my companion who is forced to go down due to altitude sickness. It was a sad thing that not all of my group made it to the base camp, but he was taking cared off well.P.S. If you are first timer to do EBC trek, I would recommend to hire a guide/trekking company. There are people out there that says EBC route is pretty easy and doing it alone is fine as long as you can read maps and etc. They maybe right, but I've been there. It's not that easy. It's totally not a walk in the park. So, hire a guide or use Nepal Social Treks to help you realize your EBC dream especially if you're first timer!"

Our flight to Nepal was actually delayed for 9 hours which made us very worries. However, their team just appeared at the airport as expected, than serving us very good lunch and this energized our trip.The trek was excellent and we stayed at the few of very best hostels on the mountain, especially the one to the Poonhill. It was the best and the most nearest hostel which exceptional facilities and view. Other arrangements such as transportation were prefect and best in the class."

Nirajan was very professional in planning our tour and super accommodating. He was also very responsive via email. Although they provide a suggested itinerary, I really like the fact that you can tailor make your own tour as you go. They assigned Buddhi to us for the Everest Base Camp trek, and it was a very tough trek for us especially having to deal with food poisoning, but Buddhi really motivated and pushed us to continue. He was awesome. Looking forward to making another trip to Nepal soon, and I shall be using this company again."

He organized a two way journey from Kathmandu to Pokhara by new 4x4. We were very glad to have chosen the scenic route, winding through the mountains where we were able to stop and explore at will. All in all, each drive took about 8 hours with the extra stops. Airport pick up and drop was nice as well, saved having to arrange any other transport. Our driver spoke a bit of English, was safe and professional. These guys will be organizing all my future transport in Nepal."

I booked two trips with Nepal Social Treks and I was more than just satisfied with them organizing both of my adventures in Nepal.The owners Ram (Rara Lake Trek) and Basu (Ganesh Himal, Manaslu Circuit and Tsum Valley Trek) and also the whole Nepal Social Treks staff were more than eager to fully fulfill my/our expectations of the two treks. Since I was/ we were specifically looking for the \u201coff the beaten track\u201d experience, they especially tailored the treks to my/our individual needs and expectations! No additional effort was too much for Nepal Social Treks - I really appreciated the extra miles they went for making my adventure in Nepal so unique and unforgettable.My first trek took me to the Rara Lake Region with a small detour in Bardia National Park (total of 3 weeks). At first, I didn\u2019t have a traveling partner so the company posted my travel plans on their twitter and facebook page to find me a companion. The trek was led by Kumar, a guide who truly loves his job. During the trek we changed our itinerary constantly and Kumar was more than happy to give us some insider information for some small detours or side trips. The two porters and Kumar tried and succeeded to make our trek unique and unforgettable and my trekking partner and I are forever thankful for this amazing experience!My second trek was in the Ganesh Himal Region with the Manaslu Circuit and the Tsum Valley in addition (total of 4 weeks). Nepal Social Treks organized my previous guide Kumar for this trek, which I was really grateful for. During the trek Kumar helped us organize a couple of detours on the Ganesh Himal Region Trek and the Manaslu Circuit. The Tsum Valley itinerary got totally changed too to fit the individual interests of all the trekking tour members. The group constellation was sadly really bad (100 % my fault: I had organized my trekking companions throughout a trekking website) and a real challenge for not only me but especially Kumar. Our guide Kumar took on the challenge of this group and perfectly managed to make this adventure an unforgettable and fun trekking trip \u2013 for not only me but for the whole group!I would \u2013 without hesitation - recommend Nepal Social Treks to my family and all of my friends or people asking me for advice concerning traveling in Nepal. Thank you again for everything!"

We had a wonderful 10 day vacation in Nepal ( Kathmandu, Pohkrara, Chitwan, Lumbini, Nagarkot) all because of the closeness we felt with our tour guide; Dil Gurung and Deepak; our driver. They were really true to the heart i.e. such simple warm people representing Nepali culture and people. Dil went all out to ensure everything was good for us, right from hot water, food, shopping etc. Deepak made sure we were always safe on the road. Miss you guys; both Dil and Deepak.I choose Nepal Social Treks through tripadvisor and communicated with Nirajan via skype and email. He was prompt and accommodated to our needs and budget especially ensuring that all hotels booked had backup generator due to frequent power cuts in Nepal. Everything went as planned and we had our hot shower in almost every place. Thank you Nirajan. I would recommend Nepal Social Treks."

We organised a 25 day trek with them, we changed schedules numerous times, arrival dates etc and all of this was no problem for them( thanks Nirajan). We were met at the airport when we arrived from Australia, taken to a great hotel for the night. We had weather issues starting the trek so the planes weren't flying to Lukla, so Nepal Social organised a helicopter to fly us up limiting our down time.The guide provided by the company was excellent, professional and well versed in all aspects of providing us a safe enjoyable trip in the mountains. This was proven when my girlfriend got Altitude sickness and we had to decend to Namchee Bazaar. I was worried this would be the end of the trek. Our guide rearranged our itinerary. Once we were ready to start trekking again we went up a different valley caught up to close to where we had left off and continued on with a very enjoyable trek missing next to nothing. Nothing was to much trouble( thanks Buddhi). Everything that was promised and more was delivered, making our trek so much more enjoyable. Ive done quite a few organised trips and treks and i have to say the service and eye for detail delived from Nepal Social Trek was first class. Nepal Social Trek also donate part of your trekking fees to local charities, so i like the idea of this as well. I hope to return to Nepal in 18 monthes or so and there will be only one company i will be using! Nepal Social Trek.!"

The guides were always on time and friendly. The highlight of the trip was definitely sunrise over the Himalayan Range and the Chicken Biryani in Nagarkot (Paradise Inn) was the best I have ever tasted!I did everything I set out to do in Nepal, the guides were very accommodating and fun to hang out with.

While we initially were apprehensive about dealing with a company through the internet, on the other side of the world, from start to finish they were spectacular. EVERYTHING WAS AS ADVERTISED, AND NOTHING FELL THROUGH THE CRACKS!!!During the planning stage, Ram was incredibly professional and responsive to our needs. It was just the two of us travelling, and after listening to what we wanted, He set up the most amazing private adventure. He took care of every detail, and made sure we got to see everything on our list in an orderly and expeditious fashion. He responded very quickly to our emails and questions.Our visit included a Kathmandu tour, a short Trek in the Pokhara area, visiting Chitwan, and finishing with a morning view of Mount Everest from Nagarkot.The guide for the majority of our trip was Bishnu. We can\u2019t say enough good things about him. He went way above and beyond our expectations. He was very attentive, and anticipated our needs, often before we knew they existed!!! He took responsibility to keep us safe with plenty of bottled water and safe food. We didn\u2019t have any stomach issues at all.In Chitwan, our guide was Saroj. He also is a very talented guide, who went way above and beyond in providing us with a great experience. His knowledge of the jungle and ability to safely guide us close to many wild animals was greatly appreciated.Nirajan works behind the scenes coordinating many of the travel details. In the middle of our trip, in an effort to maximize our time in Nagarkot, we requested he rearrange our flight (move it up by 4 hours) from Chitwan to Kathmandu. This was no small task during peak season, and he rose to the challenge and accomplished it quickly and professionally. Wow! We were impressed!The final day, Ram called and invited us to lunch, where he made sure everything had gone well. It was a classy finishing touch.In summary, Nepal Social Treks is a great company that treated us with incredible care. We highly recommend them."

Ram Barakoti and Bassu Panday, the directors of the company are incredibly customer focused and are available and responsive literally 24/7.

As first time trekkers we had absolutely no idea about anything (literally we had never even worn hiking boots before!!) And as you can imagine from searching the internet there are thousands of Trekking companies!! How to choose which one?The moment we were in contact with Nepal Social Treks they gave us all the attention we needed and they were happy to answer any questions we had! (Even the silly ones!) That in itself gave us confidence that we chose the right company; we checked Trip Advisor and all reviews were at high standard- they were all right!As we arrived at the airport, we were greeted by the lovely smiling Basu, with a lei of flowers and our names clearly written on a board amongst the 100\u2019s of men waiting! (It can be quite confronting if you have never been to Nepal!) Basu was fluent in English and made us feel so welcome to Nepal- even joking about the traffic and cars as I think he could see we were a little shell shocked! Hotel; they arranged our hotel for us which again saved us time searching the area! (Moonlight and Travellers INN): Moonlight: nice outdoor area, breakfast included and your basic hotel needs with hot water. Travellers Inn: comfy beds, basic hotel needs \u2013 perfect for all Trekkers! If for any reason your plane is delayed or your trek has been moved, there is no cost to cancel or change the dates; they will do it for you.The first night Basu and few of the lovely staff showed us around the lively Thamel area. They took us out for a welcome dinner at Third Eye Restaurant- quality traditional food!! It\u2019s nice to have a local show you the sites and all the hidden gems! We actually had a few nights before our trek and were shown so many unseen restaurants and bars, that as a first timer you could easily miss! 0K2K, New Orleans Caf\u00e9, Bamboo Restaurant \u2026 all great for a wine , food ATMOSPHERE and CHEAP! During the days we were taken site seeing to all the major tourist attractions with our tour guide that was going to take us up to Mt Everest Base Camp.. Dill Gurung\u2013 we spent 2 days site seeing with Dill which gave us a chance to run through everything about the trek and also a chance to get to know our guide; We also needed to hire jackets and they took us to a place and helped us find what we needed!! Which saved us so much hassle (as there are soooo many places). By this time our expectations where met far and beyond what we had ever expected!!!! And we hadn\u2019t even started the TREK! The Trek: from the flight/ kits they packed/ first Aid/ trekking gear, all of it was fabulous! Sleeping bag was warm, they had everything we needed in the first aid and some! Our tour guide - Dill was truly the kindest person and guide we have ever met! Even though Dill has been trekking to Base Camp for over 7 years, he made our first time just as special! Explained in detail about where we were going, how long it would take, rest days, food, you name it, and it was covered! It was also peak season, which meant busy tea houses! Dill would ring ahead to make sure our room was ready (even with blankets!). We would play cards each night and he would make us feel happy EVEN if one of us was feeling tired or sick. Dill would do everything possible to make sure we were comfortable! Our porter Lila: we are still amazed at how much they can carry! Wow wee!! Lila made sure our bags were ready before we even reached the Tea houses! How that is even possible, I have no idea?? short cut?? But he managed every time to be waiting with our room key upon arrival at the tea houses! He would also ask if we wanted a tea, and would join in with our evening card games and turned out to be quite the comedian!!After we got back from Everest Base Camp we were greeted by Basu and Ram his business partner, who welcomed us back with t-shirts and tea! The office feels like a second home, Basu and Ram make sure all their clients are well looked after and if you need anything they will help in anyway they can! Truly incredible peopleTo sum this all up; after meeting and speaking to fellow trekkers they were amazed at the service we received and the quality for money! Our experience in Nepal would not have been the same without Basu and the team at Nepal Social Treks! We will go back again and again and would highly recommend to all our friends/family and random people! So if you\u2019re thinking of heading to beautiful Nepal and want some adventure or even just a few days of sightseeing Basu and Ram at Nepal Social Treks will organise anything for you!Happy Travels and hope this has helped!!Kelly and Sherri Green"

We were first introduced to Ram and Basu via our Volunteer company, from the first email 2 months before our arrival in Kathmandu right through to our last day, the attentative service and help we received was second to none.We pretty much had a shopping list of things we wanted to cover during our time in Nepal. Having spoken to Ram he assured me that they would be able to look after 'everything' for us. True to form, emails were replied without delay and once we finally decided what we wanted to do the cost was reasonable to say the least.Such was their offering, that we booked our Annapurna trek; return flights to Pokhara; hotel in Pokhara and airport transfers with them and could not have been any happier. Unfortunately we had some last minute change of plans (due to ill health), Ram made sure that we were comfortable and the changes that he made to our itinerary were seamless. Ram and Basu were responsive very friendly and helpful infact they couldn't do enough for us.To sum it up, what a great professionally run company coupled with such humble, helpful and down to earth people. We're already thinking of when we can return back to Nepal, whenever that may be, Nepal Social Trek will be the first people we call!Well Done Ram and Basu and Thank You for making our trip a memorable one!"

We arrived there and they promptly picked us up from the airport and arranged our hotel stay there. Initially, my sister and I were intent on going on the Everest view trek with Nepal Social Treks. However, the flight to the Everest trek entry-point (Lukla) was not safe enough for us to go on as it was too windy that day. Our guide then gave us information regarding our alternatives and we decided to switch to the Annapurna trek instead since we didn't have much time flexibility. They were very versatile and flexible in meeting our needs given the circumstances. All in all, I would highly recommend Nepal Social Treks to anyone! In fact, we are planning on going back in a few years to do the EBC trek!"

We recently did two treks with them (EBC and Annapurna Circuit) and we cannot recommend them highly enough. From the moment we landed in Kathmandu, we were greeted at the airport and taken into the office in Thamel, where we were treated to a welcome drink and some snacks. Ram and Basu (the owners) are two friendly and fun characters but they also make sure that you are well looked after in Nepal.The treks were fantastic. The scenery was out of this world and our guide (Dil Gurung) was exceptional. We knew we were in good hands - he knew so much about the trekking regions and he always made sure that we were in good health and well looked after in the lodges. We had great fun on the trek and by the end of it all, we really felt like Dil was a close friend. I could say so much more but rest assured, if you decide to book with Nepal Social Treks I'm confident that you will have a fantastic trek and an experience to remember. P.S. Make sure to ask for Dil as your guide as he really is the best guide that we encountered on our 5 months of travelling! We hope to return to Nepal some day and we will definitely be trekking with these guys if we get back there."

As someone from the US I can say that Nepal Social Treks and Tours is the best of the best. I would not work with any other trekking company besides them. They are accommodating, polite, and easy to work with. They are always extremely flexible, and are willing to go the extra mile to make your trip exactly how you want it. In 2010 I did a wildlife safari tour with Nepal Social Treks with my fiance. The tour was held at Chitwan National Park which is approximately 4 hours from Kathmandu by car. Every part of our trip was organized ahead of time and we always felt extremely safe. Day two we spent the day on the back of an elephant for our elephant safari throughout Chitwan National Park. It was truly a wonderful experience, and I would recommend Chitwan to both families and couples, especially during the peak season. The Elephant Breeding Center, which was included as a part of our tour, was another one of our favorites. We traveled in a small canoe across a river to the center, and spent several hours interacting with the elephants in a very natural habitat.The trip was relaxing and a lot of fun, all because of the hard work of our friends at Nepal Social Treks.In 2011 when I returned to Nepal my fiance and I went on a trek to the Annapurnas. This was by far one of the most beautiful treks that we have ever been on. From the Annapurnas we could see the Tibetan mountain ranges. I definitely recommend the Annapurna circuit because of the scenic views that you can find no where else in the world, but also because of the interactions we had with the Nepali people on the trip. It was always a positive experience for me and my fiance, and we enjoyed our village visits so much, that we hope to do the same trek again soon! Nepal Social Treks set up the trip for us with one of their best guides, Basu. Afterwords, Ram Barakoti, from Nepal Social Treks, even helped us to organize our trip to India.  Ram and Basu dai are unique to the trekking industry. I have not found anyone else in Nepal who works as hard as they do to make your trip an enjoyable and successful one. Their experience in the industry is phenomenal! Hope you will consider working with them on your next trip to Nepal for all of your travel and trekking needs!"

My boyfriend, friend, and I planned to do the Annapurna Circuit, starting at the end of November and finishing mid december. This is the tail end of the treking season in Nepal, so we knew that accomodations wouldn't be a problem along the trail. We kept going back and forth about whether or not to get a guide or go with a tour company, but ultimately decided our trip would be less stressful with a guide and also create a better dynamic for the three of us. I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW HAPPY I AM WE MADE THIS CHOICE! My friend had done Everest Base Camp with Nepal Social Treks last year, and she had a great experience, so we decided to visit their office and have a chat. We got a really good vibe from the owner Ram. Although a businessman, he was not manipulative or pushy, and I knew he felt confident and passionate about what his company/guides/porters offer even in the first 5 mins of chatting. We decided to just have a guide and not a porter, and signed up for a 19 day trek with a great guide named Naba. I can't say enough wonderful things about Naba. He was very professional, spoke English very well and supposedly knew 5 other languages too. Not only was Naba professional, but he was also a man of good character and fun to be around. This is important if you're spending 19 days hiking with someone! He knew every mountain from every angle and could tell us the elevation them all. The trek can be physically challenging for some, so it was wonderful wandering into a village and knowing exactly where to stay. Naba would walk into a lodge or tea house, grab keys, and within minutes, we were enjoying hot tea and a place to rest. I'm so glad I didn't have to bring loads of cash along with me to pull out every day for meals and accomodations!! With an all inclusive package, you really just focus on the treking, the scenery, and at the end of the day, you can rest without any stress. When you're in a group or with your partner/friend/sibling, it's nice to have a guide to create a better dynamic, eliminate stress on the trek, and give great cultural insight as you pass through villages. Nepal Social Treks went above and beyond by making arrangements for hotels on either end of our trip, purchasing all of our permits for treking, arranging our transportation back from Pokhara, giving us t-shirts, and they even offered us a ride to the airport a week after our trek when we were leaving Nepal. Although our trek had ended, Naba came and met us at the bus stop in Kathmandu and walked us back to Thamel (after a few days of rest in Pokhara). While on the trek, we met many guides and porters, who were traveling with other tourists like ourselves. I'm sure there are some other great companies in KTM, but we felt so lucky the entire time to have gotten Naba. He just seemed a step above the rest! I recommend Nepal Social Treks very highly! If I did it again, I'd probably get a porter though. Not having one really didn't reduce the price very much, and I think I would have had a more enjoyable time. That's just me though.. Definitely get a guide!"

Our package included 12 days with guide and a porter (one porter for both our backpacks) and included all meals and accommodation. We weren't sure at first if we needed guides but found our guide indispensable. Taking a porter allows you to walk in comfort and taking a guide meant that we did not once have to worry about getting a bed at the next tea house, misjudging walking times or any aspect of our general safety.We allowed 12 days for the return journey, stressing that we wanted to walk at our own pace but found that we got to the top much sooner than expected. Our ever-flexible team suggested an extension to the return leg via Poon hill and it was arranged there and then. As we still had a day to play with after Poon hill and expressed an interest in rafting, all it took was one call and it was arranged. The company has preferred hotels - hotel Moonlight in Kathmandu and Hotel Kantipur in Pokhara. We found both of these hotels to be solid mid-range options and have no complaints. We were looked after from start to finish and felt like they couldn't do enough for us. As a travelling companion we found our experienced guide (KB) to be a fount of knowledge on all things and was matched by an inexhaustible good humour."

Once I arrived with my son, we were met at Kathmandu airport and taken to the Moonlight Hotel, where we met Ram Barakoti a director of the company to run through our schedule and see if we wanted to change any aspect of the trek, which I thought was a lovely personal touch.We flew to Lukla with our guide, Dawa Sherpa early the next morning and began a wonderful journey to E.B.C. and Kala Pattar. Nothing was too much trouble for Dawa, he was a fantastic guide with great knowledge of the region, and his experience of trekking and mountaineering was second to none as his three successful Everest summit expeditions would suggest.Even while we were trekking the schedue was changed to suit our needs, we had pre-arranged a 12 day trek, but due to forecasted bad weather arriving, Dawa suggested we got back to Lukla one day sooner to ensure we could fly back to Kathmandu, and have plenty of time to get back to the Uk. Thankfully, we did as Dawa suggested, he changed our flights seamlessly and we got back to Kathmandu early, the following day all flights to and from Lukla were cancelled for 4 days!!!Back in Kathmandu early, we met Ram again and he organised a tour of the temple sights of the Kathmandu valley region, a trip to Nagarkot and an extra night stay in Kathmandu for us. I would like to conclude by stating that I would recommend Nepal Social Treks and Tours very highly for a professionally run company that gave Ben and myself a most wonderful adventure in Nepal without us having to stress about any arrangements, they were all taken care of."

            "review": "I cannot add much more to what has already been said - Nepal Social are utterly Fantastic!. I cannot really add much more to what has already been said - i have pasted in below my story if you are interested but basically for all things to do in Nepal I thouroughly reccomend Nepal Social, they are a fantastic team!! Not only great service at a reasonable price but they also have a social conscience and put back into the community - it was really a wonderful thing to experience.***In a nutshell I can not recommend Nepal Social highly enough. If you are travelling to Nepal these are the guys to see. Their service is amazing. My husband and I are quite experienced travellers having backpacked through 60 countries on every continent (excluding Antarctica!) and found the guys at Nepal Social to be probably the most friendly, non pushy outfit that we have ever dealt with. One day after arriving in Nepal in March this year we received news from home of a death in the family which meant we had to cut our trip short. Still want to experience a little of what Nepal has to offer we decided to undertake the 3 day Poon Hill trek in the Annapurna region. We visited Nepal Social offices after 5pm that afternoon and by 7am the next morning we were in a car on our way to the airport with NS having arranged everything for us - a fantastic English speaking guide (KB, an absolute legend!) permits, flights, car transfers either side, accommodation in Pokhara upon our return - it was seamless, there was not one thing we needed to worry about. They even helped us get gear for the trip later that evening at very reasonable prices. From the minute we walked in there we had nothing more to arrange or organise, and it was all done quickly, to a high service and very reasonable price.Our guide KB was fantastic, very knowledgeable and generous with us in talking about life in Nepal. We had planned on only doing a three day trek however when we got out to the start of the trail he talked us through the different options we had and was confident that with adjusting the Ghadruk - Gorepani Poon Hill Trek slightly (taking the reverse route) and adding a few extra hours a day if we were up for it we could do the 6 day trek in 3.The trek was wonderful and even though we walked a few extra hours I never felt rushed, we just took our time and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. The tea houses we stayed at were all wonderful and the hospitality fantastic, food lovely.When we finished the trek Nepal Social arranged for our fights back to Kathmandu, picked us up at the airport, arranged for an everest flight and flights to Bangkok so we could get home for the funeral in time. They arranged all this without us paying - we had already taken the flight from Pokhara to Kathmandu without even having paid for it until we returned to Kath... talk about putting trust in people!!On our last night in Kathmandu Basu and Ram took us out to dinner which was a wonderful end to our trip - they talked about the 'social' side of their business i.e. the different charities and causes they are invovled with and support and i think this is what makes NS really stand out from the crowd - they are hard working local guys who truly give back to the community.We had such a great experience ourselves and two friends are planning on returning next year to undertake the base camp trek with Nepal Social."

            "review": "Nepal Social Treks our travel and trekking agency NO. 1. My name is Yehuda Unger \u2013 CEO of CMRLinx \u2013 an Israeli medical software company. It is my 3d trip to Nepal. My first trip to NEPAL was 11 years with my Best Friend (Nachman Etstien) in which we did the Langtang & Helambu Trek. A year after we did the Jomsom Trek from Pokhara to Muktinath. We did those treks solo (Without Porters) using some local agents to get basic services (Trek permits, Flights, Ground Transportation) \u2013 nothing was exceptional regarding the services. This year (SEP 2011) we decided to do the Annapurna Circuit from Besi Shar to Jomsom. This time my brother (Roni) joined us. We did it again solo except from Roni, who passed a surgery and needed a porter. For this trip (after making a detailed research) I selected NEPAL SOCIAL TREKS as our agents for the basic services \u2013 Domestic Flights, Trek Permits, Ground Transportation and Hotel in Kathmandu. It\u2019s not my habit writing posts over the Internet, however in this case it was inevitable. NEPAL SOCIAL TREKS and its two managers \u2013 RAM and BASU was a big positive surprise. Anything I will say regarding this Company and its two owners will be an understatement. Its starts with the communication \u2013 it was very easy to communicate with RAM via e-mails and SKYPE. As a matter of fact I closed all the details including price quotation over SKYPE from a coffee shop in Israel. Since RAM is so computer literate and responsive, we managed to finalize the whole deal in few hours \u2013 including a deposit of 100$ which was performed via PayPal \u2013 which simplify the transfer. About the prices; since I did my homework in advance I have a clear Idea about the prices. I can say that the price quotation issued by NEPAL SOCIAL TREKS was more than fair and there was no reason to bargain! I accept the quotation as it is, and realize in Kathmandu that the NEPAL SOCIAL TREKS respected 100% all the services and prices we agreed upon. RAM came to pick up from the airport free of charge and provided the same service at the end of the visit. On the first day we were invited by RAM to a dinner. We find out that the best way to changing big amount of money is via NEPAL SOCIAL TREKS! Ram was very helpful with the prepaid SIM CARD for our mobile phone. During our stay in Kathmandu RAM and /or BASU pay us a visit every day just to verify that all is OK. Their office in the Thamel was open for us for any request \u2013 always with cap of tea!!!! We received a triple room according to our request and detailed specification. On our last day in Kathmandu, we have a late flight at 22:00 \u2013 so RAM enabled us a late check-out and provided us with a room to take a shower and refresh before leaving to the airport. All these are small things that make the difference. Hotel Moonlight is operated by NEPAL SOCIAL TREK and is located within the Thamel. For the price we paid (45$ for a Triple Room) I can say that the place is OK with very kind and willing to help staff. One of the biggest successes was the porter provided by company. Nil Sherpa doesn\u2019t speaks English \u2013 except for few word (Up-Up, Down-Down, Slowly-Slowly, very hard\u2026.etc). However you rarely meet such a person- modest, responsive, sensitive and ready to help. He did everything with tones of commonsense \u2013 no words were needed. We asked Nil few times to go ahead and book for us a lodge. In each of the times he booked a place and then returned 1 our back to meet us on the Trek \u2013 it was his own idea! If you work via NEPAL SOCIAL TREKS, and you need a porter (which is also a guide) ask for NIL \u2013 however keep in mind that he weight about 45 kilo, and it will be unfair to let him carry more than 18 Kilo maximum. We are planning our next trip to NEPAL next year \u2013 probably doing the Mustang trek. It goes without saying that SOCIAL NEPAL TREKS will be again our agent company, and NIL will be our porter. It was a great pleasure for us working with RAM and BASU and the NEPAL SOCIAL TREKS staff."

My brother and I went on the Kathmandu-Lhasa overland tour with Nepal Social, and we would join any trip in the future with this great company!I had gone from place to place trying to find a tour that was reasonably priced, but either they suddenly raised the price or they didn't know much about the Tibet trips, which often meant that I had to wait for them to make numerous phonecalls. With Nepal social none of this was the case.The trip was great and we had a very good Tibetan guide (which I can't give Nepal Social credit for, unfortunately). They helped us finding travel companions and then reduced the price. After our return to Kathmandu we were even invited to dinner by the owner of the company. All in all a great experience!"

I'm used to traveling alone, so it was a nice break not having to think about anything. Bus, accommodation, food, everything was taken care of. My guide was extremely knowledgeable and cheerful, which made the hikes a breeze! Before I could get hungry or thirsty, he made sure I got plenty of yummy tea or food.

He also can arrange accomodations etc. We did the Annapurna trek from Jomsom and as I was quite pregnant we had some specific wishes. Our guide was KB and he was so much fun and very gentle and easy. If we are back in Nepal I think no need to trouble to look for another agency, this worked just great. At the end, what all these agencies can offer is pretty much the sime, what differs are the people. Ram and KB were both very nice. Namaste\u00a1"

The guides went above and beyond in terms of service and worked really hard to accommodate our unending requests. They even pulled miracle when we were stranded at the airport in Lukla. Due to inclimate weather there were only a limited number of flights leaving Lukla that afternoon and Nepal Social had called the head of the airlines and convinced them to put us on the last flight out that day ahead of everyone else, otherwise, we would've been stranded there for at least 2 more days.The great guys at Nepal Social, Basu and Ram, helped make me feel like home away from home. As a girl on my own, I felt very safe and well supported in a country that can feel very unfamiliar. I've traveled all over the world and it was my most amazing trip yet!And because they are very socially conscious, our group of 12 trekkers were able to raise USD4000 through our trek for Nepal Orphan's Home - we even got to meet and play with the kids one morning at Papa's House. Felt good to know that my vacation was helping to further a great cause. I would highly recommend them to anyone visiting Nepal."

Before going we contacted quite a few companies we found on the Internet, and then chose Nepal Social Treks as the response we received was very friendly and helpful, the price was right and the itinerary was flexible. When we arrived in Nepal, Basu and Ram immediately made us feel right at home. Another single traveller joined our trip so it was the three of us, Basu our guide and KB our porter. Having a small group we were able to go at our own pace and our itinerary adjusted accordingly. We spent the days trekking through spectacular scenery and the evenings sitting around playing cards with Basu and KB, who is quite a card shark. We were there for eight days, and it was nowhere near long enough. Next April we are going to do Everest Base Camp and will definitely be going with Nepal Social Treks again."

A first few days we plan our trip and try to manage everything by ourselves. It is quite tired and waste time we can go only few place a day, waste time to lost and bargain..also we are too lazy to read any guide books to know what is what..at first we read but after that..there are so many thing we want to know. Finally we come to Nepal Social Treks which I'd like to say it is a best decision we ever made after arrived to Kathmandu. We found a program of day tour around Kathmandu valley. They have many program and lots of free information also we can choose and modified all programs by ourselves. They also have lot lots of day trip in nepal not just only kathmandu, all those outdoor activities, all kind of transportation, places to stay or to eat.We have 4 days so we went to ..Hanuman dhoka durba square, swayambhunath, boudhanath, garden of dreams, Lion Palace, Pashupatinath, Bhimsen Tower, The Narayanhiti Palace Museum also Nagarkot, Bhaktapur, Changu Narayan, Patan, Bugamati and khokana village. Those places are amazing and wonderful just like every tourists..every guide books said. But the things that make our trips memorable is the staff from Nepal Social Treks. They are professional, honest and very friendly. We don't need any guide books cos they can tell us many stories. We don't need to bargain anything much cos they give us the reasonable price. We don't need to beware and nervous cos they are honest and very polite. We don't need to waste time and tired cos they can provide everything and bring us to all interesting places within our time limit. They never ask for special gift or special tips from us which some company or some tours some agencies may do. All I need to do is just to say I want or don't want to go where and prepare my camera. I also meet new good friends whom they are also go with this tours too.We decide to go trekking with them too. which it is a very nice trip and wonderful time with many good friends."

I had actually looked into a guide before I left but the quotes from another company were so high we decided we just needed to go alone. The advice on the internet forums were that you could go to a travel agency and pay them to take care of your permits for you. We went to the agency that was on the same property as our hotel to have that done the morning after we got there.Once we did everything change. Our agent, Dennis, did not pressure us to use a guide but demonstrated why we should consider it. When I told him that we were students and didn't think we had the money he did some calculating. He also added in a whole different trek because it sounded like more of what we were looking for. The price was just barely below what we brought with us, but we did it.And boy are we glad we did. The extra circuit, the Manaslu, was amazing. That was by far the gem of our trip. We did that for the first half and then Annapurna for the second. Our guide, Ram, was amazing. He was the same age as the other two guys in the trip. We got along very well. He took care of us and adjusted the plan as needed. He was more impressive than any other guide, often helping other groups when we stopped by meals. Many people made note of this and wrote down the company information with the intent of hiring Ram in the future.All in all, spectacular experience. I would note 3 things, none of which would change my review from 5 stars, but that should be said. 1. The infrastructure in Nepal is not so good. It caused delays for us on numerous occasions. You should be prepared for things not work at times.2. The agency has connections all over and you end up staying in hotels that are owned by friends or family. They were all very nice, but the communication between was not always perfect. When we finished our trek in Pokhara there was confusion about breakfast. Our agency and guide said it was included, but that information wasn't relayed to the hotel in a way that they understood and we had to work it out with them. It was fine, but we shouldn't have had to do it.3. Our guide steered us away from hiking Tilicho Lake because the way was too dangerous at the time. We of course were fine with that and altered our schedule. However, when we got up to the area we met lots of people who did it the same time that we were going to and the reports were that the way was both open and that it was not dangerous at all. They also reported that it was one of the highlights of their trip. I'm a little disappointed that we didn't get to go and I personally feel that it was given the ax too quickly."

Out of the best 10 rankings I choose Osho Vision Treks & Expeditions Ltd. because I liked the homepage and the friendly offers. So I wrote an email and the reply was very quick and Dinesh, the manager offered us three different treks to choose. After customizing the itinerary to our special wishes, we booked the holidays with Osho Travel and that was a great deal!From the first day arriving, till the last day before departure we were more than happy with the service. All people working for Osho Vision has been friendly, experienced, helpful and just great, and especially the crew we had on our trek, everybody was perfect. Prakrash, our guide and Bijaya and Ram Hari our porters made the trek unforgettable. Prakrash was every time looking after all of us, always reacted to the situation when somebody needs something, or when we decided to change the plans a bit, he always tried to answer all our questions and very often all three of the team worked together to get us a perfect lunch or dinner, or make our day even better. After asking for a special song, they have taught us the words and so we were able to sing along and had so much fun. Comparison to our last trek in Nepal in 2011 this tour was much better, because of this brilliant team which was guiding us. So all in all we were very happy with our decision to book with Osho Vision Treks & Expeditions and we recommend it to all our friends and those, who are looking for a familiar, friendly, but also experienced company. Thanks a lot dear respected Mr. Dinesh Lamichhane for such a great experience! Namaste, Dhanyabad and Bidaa Hau"

The great thing about having our own trip meant we could flex as we went. I.e. If you want to walk a little further in a day you can. If you want to speed up & finish a day earlier to relax for an extra day in Pokhara this is all possible as your guide (in our case Raj) can help arrange all this for you. Our trip included food (you can select from a menu), accommodation, transport, transfers, a guide & a porter. The only extras you needed to pay for were for drinks and then occasionally for showers, wifi & phone charging. We were also helped with hiring trekking equipment & we had a lovely final trekking day dinner. We want to thank all the team Raj, Ram and Dinesh for such and amazing time. We would definitely recommend for any trek in the region...."

When I arrived in the (quite) hidden office of Osho vision, I've been surprised by the quality of the service (very welcoming staff, good tea and coffee to wait...). I've then been introduced in the office to speak with the manager. First good sign, he didn't give a price directly. He first asked some precise questions about the type of trek I was interested into, showing everytime a map of the areas we were speaking about and detailing the steps of the trek. He also asked which kind of transportation we would prefer. Then he offered directly a fair price for the options I showed a bit of interest to (everything included but drinks 200\u20ac while some other started with 600\u20ac offer... Off season prices). We had a pick-up from our hostel fixed by our excellent guide (Ram) and after a night in Pokhara, started the Mardi Himal trek, in the clouds and the rain, learning Nepali songs to keep the mood up! Ram was very sorry for us about the lack of visibility and was awake as soon as the sun rise to knock at our door (on our request) as soon as it was possible to admire the wonderful mountains surrounding. All in all, priceless memories acquired in a trek during the monsoon! (possible to pay cash in different money, or with visa)."

Met Udaya, from Osho vision, at the airport and he advised us on some options to make the most of the time we had. He made our minds about doing a 13 day trek on the Annapurna circuit, which would be just on time to catch our flight back home. We were a bit concerned about the guide that would be leading us as we would only meet him the next day, 1st day of the trip and would be someone who we had to depend on the next two weeks. Udaya assured us on the guide's experience and next day we met Rajendra \"Raj\" the best guide we could ask for. Raj is a very experienced, friendly, funny and helpful guy. We had a great time with him and felt we were always taken good care of on the journey. Always felt we were staying at the best places available and that there was a constant concern from them about our well-being and happiness. At the end we felt we were lucky to have met Yudaya, Raj and Osho vision, as we didn't had much time to look for agencies and guides and they came through with everything that was contracted. We even spent the two nights at Kathmandu in their hotel, an excellent place to stay.Very positive balance of the experience with the agency and with the trek, the perfect way to be introduced to Nepal, culture and trekking the Himalayan range.Left two final advice's for them to improve: a bit more advice on the gear and weight to carry, and drivers arriving on time and rested."

I initially planned to the ABC Trek solo but changed my mind after numerous friends advised me against it as it was my very first trek in Nepal. I met up with Udaya from Osho Vision Treks who drafted out a 13-day trek that put more emphasis on picturesque locations. The day before my bus to Pokhara, I was hit with a really bad case of Gastric and was pretty much bed ridden until Udaya helped me out and took me to see a pharmacist which really helped a lot. The next day, I was a lot better and the ride to Pokhara (which a lot of people had warned me about) was actually pleasant.Now onto my guide, Harry Pokhrel, we got along very well from the beginning and he was very helpful in pointing out some points of interest along the trail. He even helped me out by volunteering to carry some of my camera equipment which really helped out since I'm not exactly in the best of shape. What was most interesting was that he actually turned out to be a fairly good photographer! I'd say 30% of my favourite photos were taken by Harry and I'm very happy with guiding me throughout the trek.Photography aside, I was very pleased with the lodging Harry had selected for me as the food was great, the beds and blankets were comfy and most importantly, I had some great night sky views at 3-4 in the morning! We were also blessed with amazing timing as we had great weather during the trek and when we stopped for the day, the weather had usually turned rainy. We were also joined by another group from Osho Vision Treks and I had the pleasure to meet another guide, Bishnu and the porter of the group, Bhijaya, who funny enough, was Udaya's younger brother! Together with the Scottish couple who trekked with us, we had a real fun time trekking and the continuous climbs and descents weren't too rough on morale since we had good company.All in all, I had a blast trekking with Osho Vision Treks and if things work out, I'm planning to do another trek with them next Spring!"

Raj is a very responsible, knowledgeable and funny guy whilst Bavin is a very caring young man, both taking good care of us in the mountains, esp we went through the muddy and slippery paths under the adversed weather condition. It was great fun to have them among us and by the end of the trip, we became good travelmates. On top of this, staff at Osho Hotel are very supportive and always readily available to provide assistance to us during our stay.Although this is my first visit to Nepal, it brought us very good memory and already tempted to plan for another \"aggressive\" trekking soon.. We have no reservations in recommending Osho team to any visitors."

Having decided to go trekking on a whim, I was lucky to have Hira patiently answering all my questions on the various treks available - locations, accomodation, food, costs and other trekkers' feedback, etc. He also showed me photographs taken by their guests, which helped me make my mind up on an Everest Base Camp Trek package. I just had to pack my bag while all the required paperwork and bookings were taken care of for a reasonable fee.Hira then brought me to a shop with honest salespeople who helped me get all I needed - trekking wear, gear, equipment and accessories. During my stay in Kathmandu at their very comfortable hotel, he gave me good advice on Nepal too. What I appreciate the most is that he treats me warmly as a friend.Ram guided me safely to Everest Base Camp and back. He kept checking to see if I was alright - something very important since almost everyone we met on the way suffered from altitude illness, but not us. At the lodges, he made sure I was comfortable and happy with my meals. Ram even carried 2 kilograms of apples from Kathmandu and shared them with me, along with warm drinking water, which I was too lazy to carry. Also, he was always helping me with my gear and equipment, like my crampons to walk on ice, and giving me a hand when the path is not easy. The day after we reached Everest Base Camp, as it was too cold (minus 15 degree Celsius in some rooms at night), I requested to descend faster and we did our first Everest marathon-plus in the middle of winter - 48 kilometres in 10 hours, up and down slippery, snowy, icy paths and the last hour in semi-darkness. It was not easy but Ram made it possible.During the trek, Mr Dinesh, the managing director, would contact Ram to check if everything was fine. From many aspects, Mr Dinesh shows that he genuinely cares for the safety and comfort of his guests.Thank you very much, Mr Dinesh, Hira, Ram and the Osho Vision family for showing me your beautiful country and true Nepali hospitality."

Accommodation was better than in Tsum Valley.My guide for the trek was Mr Bishnu and my porter was Mr Prakash.

Being on 'a bit' of a limited time/speed schedule I wrote to a few agencies in Thamel to see who would be willing to offer a program according to my needs to get me around the Manaslu Circuit and on to the Annapurna.Osho Vision placed one of the first and easily the best offers. Udaya provided a very transparent view of what the costs would be and how the schedule would look. The organisation of the fairly complex set of permits was completed without any fuss upon arrival. I paid i advance for the permits - this was no problem at all.The trek itself took place less than one week after cuclone Hudhud had taken over 50 lives in the Gorkha amd Manang districts - it wasn't an ideal time to be heading out on a trek. I need not habe worried. On the trek itself, my guide, Harry was very professional, ensuring constant updates from futher up the trail as to conditions on the pass. In addition this, Harry was a great companion speaking very good English with a tify sense of humour. We crossed the pass in challenging conditions without a single hitch and completed the circuit in a speedy 10 days. I was extremely satisfied with Osho's service and have recommended them to other friends already. It was a top trip."

We bumped into Prakash on the way from airport and to our hotel and in between our ride to the hotel, Prakash managed to convince us that he will be able to arrange our sight seeing activities in Kathmandu. Originally, we thought we will just request the hotel to arrange for us but when we compared and found that we get more bang for the buck by chosing Osho VIsion we decided to go with them. A decision we never regret.Since we are only going around the valley, we arranged with him to bring us to all the all the famous tourist traps e.g. Swayambunath Stupa, Pashupatinarh temple, Kathmandu Durbar, Nargarkot, mountain flights arrangement etc. He provided with us a really nice and friendly driver - Kapil to manage our transport need. Everything was well arranged and the trip went according to how expect it to be. It was wonderful and memorable trip and Osho Vision was instrumental to the enjoyment to our trip. The only negative portion that I have is in term of time management. We encountered twice late transport arrival that made us anxious - once, when we are supposed to be on the way to the domestic airport for the mountain flight and the 2nd was on way from hotel to the airport for our return flight back home. I hope they will improve on this aspect. Anxiety is something tourist are not looking for when they are on holiday! But otherwise, I will be chosing them again the next time I come around to Nepal for a holiday. Their price are the cheapest and exemplary service is why I will be chosing them again."

Really great guy!3) Best of all was our guide Udaye. We chose him based on other great reviews here and we was definitely not disappointed.

He also gave us excellent advise for when we were trekking in the mountains. We both have great respect for the job he does, as it is not easy to walk in the mountains carrying just a day bag let alone both of our luggage. Gadul, our guide was just fantastic. His wealth of knowledge about the mountain range was amazing and any question we ever had, he was always more than happy to answer them. You could tell he is an experienced guide. Gadul made our trip so enjoyable, not only was he a wonderful guide that made us feel safe and at home in the mountains, he was such a lovely person. He again always had a great big smile on his face to greet us in the morning.

This October my friend and I had an amazing experience trekking to Ama Dablam base camp with Himalayan Glacier (trekking). Himalayan Glacier organized a private luxury lodges tour for us from Lukla through Namche, Thame, Khumjung, Portse and Pangboche to Ama Dablam base camp and, of course, back. The amazing experience was enhanced by fantastic weather and the best guide we've trekked with - Gadul Tamang. Gadul was always very friendly, kind and attentive. The company, Himalayan Glacier was very responsive when booking the trip. They tailored the trip to our time schedule, preferences and style. For most of the trek we followed the typical Everest Base Camp trek, or Everest Luxury Lodges/View trek. Except, we did not go all the way to base camp but rather visited Ama Dablam Base camp from Pangboche and trekked back. We added Thame to the itinerary. We loved visiting Thame. It is not often on the typical Everest BC trek. We highly recommend this addition. One of the most charming Sherpa villages. Along the trek, from Namche, thru Portse and Pangboche and on the way to Ama Dablam BC we had amazing views of Everest, Lhotse, Lhotse Char, Nuptse and Ama Dablam itself. We highly recommend this 11 day itinerary and the luxury lodges. The views are spectacular. The lodges we used were the Yeti Montain lodges and the Everest Summit Lodges. We also highly recommend Himalayan Glacier and Gadul Tamang. They provided outstanding service and a most memorable experience. We loved our trek and time In the Everest region. We'll definitely return again."

Team were very helpful in understanding our needs and pointed us in the right direction for food, shopping , places of attraction etc. we received excellent service and we certainly will use their again in future with out a doubt. We did not do any water sports or biking, if we had the time we would certainly consider adding that to our itinerary. Bumdra trek requires moderate fitness and you can hire porter to carry your stuff . No need to carry sleeping bags for trek as they provide everything you need, you just need to carry clothes to change , tooth brush and paste, water and snacks , ( they provide breakfast, lunch and dinner)"

Their office was easy to find in Thamel, and they went through each of our tours with us so we knew exactly what was what. The guides were all brilliant - they had great knowledge and made adjustments on the tours to suit our needs, i.e. on the trek it was pouring down and we wanted to finish a bit early, so they arranged the car to take us back to town after lunch. I would thoroughly recommend this tour company and will use them when I hopefully return to Nepal to do the Everest base camp tour."

I did this 15-day trek with another friend in September 2016. The journey was difficult, but Himalayan Glacier provided an excellent guide by the name of Tulsi Bhatta. The company also provided a fabulous porter named Fulman who helped carry our large duffel bags up the mountain.Even though the trek was quite strenuous, Tulsi and Fulman both made the trip much easier by helping us every step of the way. Initially our flight to Lukla was cancelled due to bad weather, and Tulsi conveniently arranged for us to be flown by helicopter when there were no other options available. He was also very helpful with little things along the way such as food advice, medical help, etc.All in all, this was a great experience. If you are planning to do this trek, I recommend choosing Himalayan Glacier and requesting Tulsi as your guide, if he is available."

As it was on my Bucket List somehow I grasped the chance to join him. This was how I met the guys from Himalayan Glacier Trekking. Frankly speaking my expectation were not such as high as my experience from travelling in Asia framed me in a certain way. It was at my surprise then to learn how perfectly Ms. Urusha organized the trip upfront with no question being unanswered, then being accompanied by Narayan and Rishi who took perfectly care about us during the 5 days walking. Even if it is possible to explore one\u2019s own way during the lower level hills (up to 3.800 m) of Nepal the taking care of the team of Himalayan Glacier simply let us feel relaxed and provided a hunch of luxury. It is definitely worthwhile to spend the money here. Thank you to the MD Mr. Narayan Regmi who did not want to miss the chance for a personal exchange of ideas and information by inviting us to a gorgeous dinner once being back to Kathmandu. The professionalism and personal taking care of only two of us before, during and after the hike let us think to come back ASAP \u2026 the Annapurna Base Camp tour is waiting \u2026 Thanks again to all who made this trekking trip such an unforgettable event to us."

We elected to go during monsoon season and therefore at times our schedule needed to be adjusted due to weather. Never any issues or problems, the changes made were great.Naba, Sneha and team could not have been more hospitable or caring. Even after our trip ended they helped to arrange further accommodations and car service for us.

It was with some trepidation I left my wife (she was volenteering in Kathmandu) and put myself totally in the hands of the Himalayan Glacier team on the 23rd May for a trek to EBC via Gokyo lakes. Conventional wisdom suggests that the end of May / beginning of June is the start of the monsoon season and signals the end of both the climbing and trekking season - but this also opens up the opportunity to experience this fantastic trail as nature intended - uncluttered footpaths and mountains with only the occasional clashes of other Trekkers and tourists. With the right apparel either umbrella (as our guide carried) or \u00a3300+ breathable coat (I may re-think my wardrobe) the occasional shower was a small price to pay for the peace and tranquillity of the trail. Our trekking team of myself, Mel and Lucy coupled with our two porters and guide, Gadul + (sorry guys can't remember how to spell your names), we soon established a comfortable but hard pace and easy enjoyable bantering, which added greately to the trip.The organisation of the whole enterprise was exceptional, great advice from the guide, exceptional support from the porters and excellent tea house stop overs to rest weary limbs before each day. This was exemplified when at the end of the trek we found our flight back to Kat cancelled and the guide and team back at head office arranged helicopter recovery for us - thus avoiding missed international flights back home.My advice to anyone considering this trek is \"stop considering and get booking - you won't be disappointed\" however do read all the kit list carefully and do come prepared, I'd definitely recommend DIY water purification and a trip to the docs for a course of antibiotics just in case ;-) .My last piece of advice is don't forget your cards, dhumbal is compulsory, but please be warned cheating also needs to be practiced - anything from chanting mantras to concealing jokers is fair game :-).Lastly a big thanks to all the team, joking apart, this has been one of the best experiences of my life and I really don't think I could have enjoyed myself anymore with a different company or trekking buddies. When I return to Nepal to trek some more of the Himalayas it will be with Himalayan Glacier."

We did a trekking trip through the Annapurna Sanctaury (with its never-ending steps!) with our guide Tulsi, who was very good. Based on my husband's interest in birds, he suggested we visit Chitiwan National Park after our trek and made all the arrangements for us at a very reasonable price.

The hotel was fine and I was invited to awkward welcome dinner with tour guide who seemed to not want to be there. I signed up for volunteering days and said from get go I would like to work with kids. When I got to HGT office, they kept pushing construction work on me and when I said I wanted to work with kids and said this from beginning they didn't have a plan.When I was sent to town in Gokura, I was told it would be a bus. It was a death trap for 5 hours where 23 people were crammed on a 15 seat bus and the driver was darting through winding mountain roads. If you google bus accidents and Nepal, they are monthly and due to overcrowdeding and poor driving. HGT showed little regard for my health and well being.When I got to Gokura, I met with a tour guide and I demanded to speak with his boss and I said I was never told I would be put in such an unsafe bus. He then tried to flip it on me and say I wasn't up for experiencing life like a local. I said I refused to ride another bus like that and demanded a private driver or safe ride, which he said was not possible and we had to cancel the volunteering portion.I wasted a day in a non-air conditioned hotel HGT placed me in with poor service and a thin mat for a mattress. It was pitched to me as best hotel in town aka cheapest for them to maintain their margins off me.We agreed to do a trekking trip for four days and the guide and sherpa were cool.I spent a few extra days in Pokhra and then returned to Kathmandu. The manager insisted on meeting me at my hotel at 8:30 AM to discuss my trip. I agreed but he then no showed. When I called him later, he said he was there, but I was asleep. I called him out and said I was sitting there in the small lobby at agreed upon time. After I told him this, there was a long pause and no response.I then asked him, why he was lying to me. He said he called and hotel staff said I was asleep and I said no, I was eating breakfast in area visible from lobby. He couldn't keep his story straight.All they care about it money. Lied to me. Had no regard for my safety and well being. You can get guides and find groups once you arrive in Kathmandu at a much cheaper price than HGT. I felt like they took me for a ride and were full of crap.I know they have good reviews, but I am telling my story to let people know my own experience and the disorganization and cost cutting they used that put my well-being and life at risk."

We soon found that Himalayan Glacier Trekking (HGT) was the obvious choice. They have been around for 24 years and we couldn't find a bad review on the internet. We started planning well over a year before we decided to travel. We filled out the online request for the EBC Luxury Lodge Trek offered by HGT, and in less than 12 hours we had heard back. Our first contact was with Urusha, her emails told us what we needed and explained everything we could expect on our trek. Urusha was amazing, she was more than someone on the other end of an email, she wanted to make sure we were well taken care of and there were no issues with our planning. Even after the earthquake, when we were concerned about Urusha and everyone at HGT, she contacted us to say that communications had been disrupted, but they were still working hard to make our trip the best experience possible. We were blown away by this company's dedication to our needs. When we arrived in Kathmandu, we were met at the airport by our guide, Asabir (Asi) who was to take care of us at every turn, not only on the trek, but from start to finish.First on the schedule was a tour of Kathmandu, which was included in the package. Our tour guide, Dipesh, was exceptional. He was incredibly knowledgable and gave us plenty of time to explore on our own. After the tour, we met again with Asi and Mr. Regmi, the Managing Director of HGT, to go over final preparations for the trek. Mr Regmi was wonderful. He would check in by phone every couple of days while we were on the trek to see how everything was going and to make sure we were enjoying the trek. The next morning, Asi met us at the hotel, and our trek began. We flew from Kathmandu to the Tensing-Hillary airport in Lukla. We met our porter, Bok Tao, another exceptional individual, and we were on our way. Asi is the best! Every aspect of the trek was taken care of by Asi. He made sure that our trek would be memorable but also safe. It was just us on the trek, so we were able to go at our own pace. Asi has over 15 years experience and knew the name of every mountain, glacier, village and almost every person we met. He encouraged us everyday and his knowledge and support were the reason this trek exceeded our expectations. Thanks to Asi, we made it to EBC and had a wonderful time.I've never dealt with a company who has such a complete understanding of customer service. Their dedication to giving clients the best experience possible and to their well being is rarely found. The HGT team is the best."

From the moment I walked into the 'Himalayan Glacier' office in Kathmandu, I knew that it was going to be an AMAZING Trekking experience..!!!Nayryan, the managing director, was so lovely, helping me with everything I wanted to achieve on my trek..he was so professional and friendly and making me feel very comfortable and confident..particularly being a female going alone! This is only the first part though..! I then got to meet my guide Babu, which I don't think there are words to describe how incredible he is! Within the blink of eye I could tell how genuine, honest, friendly, helpful, fun and accommodating he was going to be on our trek..and he was all of that plus more! I decided to opt against getting a porter..but after our first day of trekking, I knew a porter was definitely needed..(I packed wayyyy to much)..so of course Babu came to the rescue and managed to get a porter, who just happened to be another amazing soul to trek with for the next 10 days or so!! I honestly could go on and on about every detail of my trek and how much fun it was, especially doing it with such an incredible guide (Babu)..but I think you should find out for yourself and just book your trip with these guys!! So professional, so helpful, so accommodating and have just made some of the best memories forever!! You won't be disappointed!!!"

All my e-mails were responded to quickly and with useful information. This was not the case with other companies I contacted. My dream was to trek to Mt. Everest base camp. Instead I chose from the many tours offered by HG \"Annapurna Sunrise & Mt. Everest Region because at age 74 and with no history of daily exercise, it was obvious that base camp would be a trek offering too much difficulty and risk.The tour I chose had enough difficulty for me and without the support, help, caring, patience and good judgement of the HG guide, my hero, I could not have met the challenges of a beautiful itinerary. The HG porters who carried my luggage were also very helpful. I returned from the trek with no bodily or joint aches and pains, only with fond memories to last a lifetime."

We were extremely surprised with the level professionalism we received from the agency. They gave us a clear itinerary and clear gear list required for the trip. At arrival we were greeted by our guide who took us to the hotel to check-in and from there we went to their head office for a briefing session. We met with the managers Narayan who clearly explained the next steps and the procedures. Then we made our way to a charming restaurant were we had a Nepalese traditional dish \"Dal pat\". Next morning we took an early flight from Kathmandu to pokhara, from Pokhara then the agency had organised for cars (4 wheel) to take us to our trekking starting point. The agency made bookings for us in tea houses. Some of the teahouses were good and some we extremely poor. We felt that they have chosen some terrible ones (on the way back) in order to make a bit saving. We felt that way because we were comparing the teahouses around the one we stayed in and they were a lot cleaner. Our guide Tulsi was a bit rushed in the beginning, we understand that he is pressured with a schedule that he had to follow. We thought that was a bit annoying and defeated the purpose of a hike where we can relax and forget about time... after couple of days he was less pressured so we all started enjoying the trek a lot more. Overall Tulsi was professional supportive and well knowledgable about the country. We had a bit of a challenge communicating with his assistance due to the language barrier. Also, at the end of the trip we stayed with the assistance and he had organized for a pick up with in a small car, when we asked the reasons why he blamed on a new rule (and we know that our friends returns in a big car) we felt again in that situation that they were trying to make a bit of saving. We insisted on getting a big car, simply because the small car in these roads was not the safest option. After we insisted they eventually managed to get us a jeep. Overall we would highly recommend Himalayan Glacier for whoever is planning a trekking experience in Nepal. We will definitely use the agency again."

My guide, Chewang Palden Sherpa, has vast climbing experience, including 3 Everest summits. He was a great companion to have and an excellent trekking and climbing guide. He is a true professional! Our summit of 6189m Island Peak went very well. My guide Chewang took care of everything regarding the set-up of base camp. He cooked a great dinner and breakfast and was fun to climb the peak with. After setting out around 2am, we made the summit of Island Peak at around 9am. It was a tough climb, but worth it as the view at the top was spectacular.I have been traveling across the Himalaya for nearly 15 years and have done many treks and climbs. Himalayan Glacier is an excellent company. I am already discussing a climb of 6476m Mera Peak in the near future."

We are in our 30s, are usually independent travellers and have trekking experience, but we decided we wanted some help with this trek. We wanted to have someone with experience who knows the side trails off the sections of jeep road, as well as some help carrying one of our backpacks. We decided a porterguide would be the best solution for us, and we then spent a long time researching agencies to arrange the porterguide. There are so many agencies to choose from, and we're so glad we chose Himalayan Glacier. Within only a few days of our planned departure date for the trek, we went into the HG office and met with Naba, the manager. We were worried about having to fend off an upsell to an organized tour, but Naba was amazing! We explained what we wanted, which included a flexible itinerary, only one staff to help us, and that we have final say about the route and which lodges we would stay at. Naba was entirely agreeable, and made the whole process very easy. He set us up with a porterguide and made a meeting time for the introductions for a couple days later. He also arranged our trekking permits and transportation to the trailhead (by public bus, as we had requested). The price for the agency's services was very reasonable and competitive. Naba also arranged for us VERY warm sleeping bag and down jacket rentals, at half the price that we had been quoted in the stores. Then we threw in a last minute challenge for Naba. With only 15 hours until departure, we decided we wanted a porter to carry the second bag. We emailed Naba, and he had no problem graciously accommodating this last minute change of plans. In fact, he got us a second porterguide. The trek far exceeded our already high expectations. The circuit was absolutely breathtaking. Our two porterguides, Sanjib and Gokul, were AMAZING. They were friendly, fun, easygoing, and took great care of us. Sanjib has a lot of experience with the circuit, and knows the trail very well. Gokul has less experience, but speaks better English. Although we had wanted to have final say on the lodges, we were always happy to go with Gokul and Sanjib's recommendations. They always found the best places, and always managed to get the best rooms for us. Having good connections definitely helps! We really had an incredible time with Sanjib and Gokul, and are glad to now count them as friends. We hope to return to Nepal in the future for more trekking, and without question we will arrange it again with Himalayan Glacier."

They went as far as Tadapani and headed down while I trekked all the way up to ABC Camp. This has long been a dream vacation of mine having seen friends pictures years ago of their trek to EBC. After careful consideration and with MUCH help from Sristi in the Kathmandu office, we settled on ABC. And boy am I glad we did. The scenery and people were amazing!!! What a phenomenal experience in all ways - the highlight of our recent Asia trip in my opinion. Love the Nepalese people - warm, caring and loving. And it all started with Sristi in the head office. I probably sent her 100-150 emails in preparation of this trip and she never failed to answer all my questions and calm any concerns I might have. She was amazing and invaluable! Then we met the manager. A fantastic guy who was not just concerned about our money but about our safety! A wonderful man who called the hotel that my wife and son were staying at to see how they made out as I ascended higher. From there we had the opportunity to meet our Guide and Porters. I cannot say enough good things about these men. Shankar, our trekking guide is the type of guy you could trust with your life or your 6 year old son's. He is very knowledgeable, caring (safety first) and fun loving. He was like a brother to me by trek's end. My family had a hard time saying good bye to him when we departed Nepal. Ram, one of our porters, was as strong as an ox and as loving as a grandfather type. Both of these guys were my soulmates as I trekked up to ABC camp, attending to any needs I might have and providing advice and companionship along the way. I can't say enough good things about them. My wife and son were looked after by porters named Gopal and Sanjib. My wife could not say enough good things about them. They really looked after my family, especially when Ethan got a dose of TD coming down the mountain. They showed geniune concern for my family and my son reallly bonded with them both. They became like members of my family. The whole Himalayan Glacier Company can be best described as a Family Operation. it is impossible to not feel connected to these people. Yes, it is a business, but they make it feel like a family. You absolutely must utilize this company if you are planning a trek of the Himalayas. You will not be disappointed. I certainly was not. I would rate my entire experience an 11 out of 10. I am planning to go back and do EBC in a couple of years. Can't wait. And I will insist on using the same crew-from Sristi, to Shankar to Ram, Gopal and Sanjib. Thank you HG for an amzing experience. P.S. The earthquake effects or fuel issues with India were in no way felt by our family. It was not an issue at all. Nepal is ready to accomodate. And with HG's hospitality, you will be in family like hands."

We planned our EBC trek over a two year period (the 2015 earthquake caused us to postpone our trek until March 2016). We selected Himalayan Glacier through a trekking friend's recommendation, and they fully exceeded all of our expectations with their responsiveness, thorough explanations in answer to our questions, and patience and reassurance with handling our concerns about safety, etc.Our trek was 'picture perfect'--no one got ill, no dysentery, no altitude sickness. We attribute our healthy trek from start to finish to our amazing guide, Giri (Dev Raj Giri). Giri, a very experienced guide, took extreme care to make sure that we were staying hydrated, eating properly (he insisted that we eat 3 meals a day even when we felt too tired to eat), recommending which foods to avoid at which lodging and lunch locations, and showing great sensitivity at handling our occasional headache. One of our group had a bout of tummy trouble at the beginning of our long day to reach EBC, and Giri worked with her, supporting her, and ensured that she healthily and successfully reached base camp. He is well-known to other guides and tea house/lodging staff, giving us added assurance that we were in the best of hands. He let us use his phone to call loved ones at home (US), too--eliminating the need for a SIM card or relying on the iffy wifi that was avaialble at some of the higher altitude inns. Jiri, our assistant guide, was a quiet and calming influence on our group, sometimes leading, often 'bringing up the rear' to complete the team effort. We saw beautiful vistas, amazing sights (an avalance in the disstance, yak 'trains' moving across thin trails, monks chanting at Tembouche Monastery). While we worked strenously to complete our trek, our guide's guidance and his uncanny ability to know what we needed (words of encouragement, assistance with carrying our daypacks, a Snickers bar when energy was failing) ensured that we completed the trek on time and safely.  We talked with many other trekkers during our trek and we were the only group that experienced no ill effects (tummy trouble, altitude sickness). We attribute it to the care and intelligent way that Himalayan Glacier operates--seasoned guides, known lodges, perfect pacing."

While we met many people on the trail that didn't have a guide, I am incredibly satisfied with our choice to hire a guide - the information and ease of travel they are able to provide is invaluable and for a first time trek in Nepal we saw it as money well spent. I was so impressed when Narayan checked in on us throughout our trek to ensure everything was going well. I would highly recommend Himalayan Glacier Trekking, they treat their staff incredibly well and provide their customers with top level service! Note: If you plan on doing the Annapurna Circuit, try to go to Tilicho Lake if it is safe to cross and you feel comfortable crossing the rock slide. It made crossing the pass so much easier since we were able to acclimatize with the few extra days. Also try to trek the whole circuit if you have the time. Tourism has declined in some of the lower elevation villages with the construction of the road and they could really use the business!"

            "review": "Fantastic 17 day around Annapurna Circuit. We just did a fantastic trek around the Annapurna Circuit in December 2015. We organized the tour once we arrived in Kathmandu by talking to Naba, who gave us some great advice and catered the trip according to our time constraints and what we were interested in. There was only 2 of us and we had Babu as our guide. Babu is a top guide but because there were so few tourists in Nepal when we visited he was happy to work as our guide/porter - which meant he carried one of our bags and while still being an excellent guide. We really found our experience with Babu amazing. He enabled us to chat with all the locals we met along with way and gave us some good information about the area. He was also really easy to get along with, very friendly and looked out for our needs (and seemed very responsible and capable). You don't need a guide to do the Annapurna circuit (and this is the first time I have ever used a guide, and I do a lot of trekking) but I think the experience we gained with Babu was definitely worth it. I would also strongly suggest now is a great time to visit Nepal as there are so few tourists (and they are in need for tourists!). The Annapurna Circuit has a reputation for being so busy but when we went in December, the combination of the season, earthquake and fuel blockade, meant we were often the only people at the teahouses! December was a great time for trekking. It was cold, but beautiful weather. Highly recommend!"

Once arrived in Kathmandu I booked with them on spot several treks as well as sightseeing and paragliding trips. Mr. Naba (the executive Manager) helped me further with all my inquiries and established a personal program for the whole 6 weeks. My Guide Sudarshon for the 3 treks (Annapurna Base Camp, Langtang and Gosaikunda) was awesome. No words can describe his professionalism during all the treks. He always gave me the best service available in the mountains (f.e best lodges & tea houses etc) and he always carried about me and looked very well after me. I always had the possibility the personalize the trek day by day corresponding to my fitness. I absolutely and very highly recommend HGT and of course I will book again with them for the next trek!"

From the first inquiry, email correspondence was timely and dedicated - I never felt we received \"form answers\" but instead was convinced that a person at the company had taken personal interest in maximizing our trip. We were able to customize our itinerary according to our requests with no problem. All of the logistics were handled seamlessly. Once we arrived, our tour guide and driver did everything possible to ensure we were comfortable and enjoying our trip. As vegetarians, aside from one small mixup, we were always presented with a range of food choices that met our dietary needs. The hotels (we opted for the standard, 3 star accommodation) were perfectly comfortable, although a bit breezy/cool in January, the middle of winter. All told, our trip to Bhutan was magical and the ease of working with Himalayan Glacier contributed greatly to this experience. The country is beautiful, the people are friendly, and the food is delicious. We hope to go back, and if we do, will certainly travel with Himalayan Glacier again."

            "review": "Absolutely Phenomenal Eye-Opening Trek. I went on the Langtang trek with Himalayan Glacier Trekking in mid-February. The route, far up near the border with Tibet, had been closed since the April 25 earthquake and its aftershock last year. The trek was not easy, but Himalayan Glacier stepped up and made it all run smoothly. Naba, one of the principal figures at Himalayan Glacier, met with me personally over lunch to see what my interests were. My guide, Ashish, helped me hunt for the best equipment, taking my limited budget into account. He handled all the permits and bus tickets, and was a genuine friend on the trek.Langtang itself has been hit hard by the earthquake. The aftermath is everywhere, and the entire village of Langtang is now sitting under rubble. This creates one part of the trek where it's highly advised to bring your own lunch, owing to a significant distance (6-8 hours) between meals. However, more people should really go on this trek, both to get a better sense of the devastation that has racked the country as well as help in the recovery. Every person who goes on this trek and visits Kyanjin Gumba is helping bolster the many families who are still living and working there.The view from any one of the peaks ringing Kyanjin Gumba is worth the trip, but the opportunity to help the community makes it a can't-miss. I thank Himalayan Glacier for giving me the opportunity to see this, for their unwavering support and commitment to what turned out to be an unforgettable experience."

My husband and I just had a tour with Himalayan Glacier from Kathmandu, Nepal to Tibet and we can honestly say it was an incredible experience we will remember for the rest of our lives. Himalayan Glacier staffs took great care for us the moment we landed in Kathmandu. There was a pickup ride arranged for us to the hotel and the hotel stay was superb beyond our expectations. Throughout the tour, the Executive Director (Mr. Naba) took care of us to ensure we know what to do and the detail itinerary for the entire tour in Kathmandu and Tibet. He made sure we know all areas we will face when entering Tibet such as dealing with the change in climate given that we went in January. In addition, the potential of altitude sickness for the high elevation in Tibet. Overall, we had a great experience on the tour and the staffs were extremely nice and attentive to our well beings. Prior to the tour, we were always in contact with Vidya via email and she was great and responsive to all our inquiries and concerns. She was a big help in accommodating to all our requests and we were so happy to meet her in person in Kathmandu. In addition, I lost my wedding band at the hotel and we contacted Himalayan Glacier to ask them pick it up for us. They were more than happy to pick up from the hotel and wait to deliver to us at the airport. We were truly grateful for their service as they went above and beyond our expectations. We would definitely recommend Himalayan Glacier to anyone looking for tours in Nepal, Tibet, India, and Bhutan areas as you will not be disappointed with their services."

Himalayan Glacier were an easy organisation to communicate with before and during the trip.

Our guide Suresh was lovely and it was brilliant getting to know him, as well as our assistant guide Saroj and our 2 porters Suman and Purna. They were a great team and really showed us the hospitable, friendly Nepalese culture.We booked our trip before the April earthquake and were unsure before arriving how the area had been affected. We were surprised to see that the EBC has barely been affected by the earthquake. We hardly saw any damage at all and can verify that the scenery, walking trails and accommodation are still in working order! Our only advice is to take warm clothing!!"

Just back from an unforgettable trip, hiking in Everest area, with as highlights Gokyo Ri 5.360m, Cho La Pass 5.420m, Everest Basecamp 5.364m & Kala Patar 5.550m. I can still not believe that I did them all. I couldn't do this without the help from my amazing guide Babu, who guided me true all difficult parts. Babu a big thank you for you, for being a good brother, taking good care for me. I will never forget. Also a big thanks to Naba for arranging my trip smoothly.Frequent asked questions:Is it safe to travel in the solo Kumbu area after the earthquake? YES! The trails are in a good condition. There was a small land-sliding area just before Cho La Pass, Babu guided me safely to the other side. You will not travel in this area if you do only EBC or Gokyo Ri. Teahouses which got damaged during the earthquake are repaired or rebuild.Is it safe to travel alone (female) with a guide?Yes this is no problem at all! My guide took excellent care for me and had professional manners. In the teahouses I had my own room.Why travel alone?You walk at your own pace. It is easy to meet people underway in the teahouses. It is also a great opportunity to build a friendship with your local guide. And yes, my guide spoke excellent English.Why a guide?A guide is there for your safety. If anything happens he will take care for you. He can show you 'inside' Nepal. He will arrange that everything goes smoothly.A wish came true by doing this hike. It was a life changing experience. Once again thank you so much. Warmest wishes to everyone from the HG-team. I wish you a great season & happy Dashain."

Beginning with the pre-trip planning and continuing through the time Shanker, our guide, met us at the Kathmandu airport to the moment he dropped us back at the airport two weeks later, every aspect of the trip was flawlessly executed. The entire Himalayan Glacier organisation is first class. Shanker and our always smiling porter Shiva led us on a fabulous 11 day trek to Annapurna Base Camp. They took great care of us and shared all their local knowledge and experience. The food and accommodations were terrific, and Annapurna Sanctuary is a magnificent and special place.Himalayan Glacier and the Annapurna Base Camp Trek exceeded our expectations as the experience of a lifetime. With no equivocations and 100% satisfaction I recommend the team at Himalayan Glacier. This was an awesome experience."

I did the Annapurna Basecamp Trek (10 days) and some sightseeing around Kathmandu. First I was a little insecure at first about travelling alone as a female when they told me there wouldn\u00b4t be other people in my group. But everything was perfectely organised to the very last detail (even though there was a gasoline shortage in the whole country they managed to organize every pickup without any delays!!) and during the trek my guide/porter Pradip and Kesap took excellent care of me and really made my trip a wonderful experience! I felt totally safe with them and didn\u00b4t worry for a minute. I can totally recommend booking any trip to Nepal with Himalayan Glacier and if you go Trekking request Pradip and Kesap, you will have so much fun!"

            "review": "Fantastic Even After the Earthquake!. A friend and I had our trip planned and then tragedy struck. Unsure what to do, Himalayan Glacier emailed that they were resuming tours in late May. Not wanting to pass up this once in a lifetime opportunity (literally, we were both between jobs and had could spend the month travelling) we hopped on the plane and eventually landed in Kathmandu.We were the only ones that came, so it was just the two of us, our guide Tulsi, and our porter Rahm. Given the circumstances, the expertise of the entire Himalayan Glacier team was a welcome blessing. Due to risk of landslides, we changed our trek from the Everest base camp to Annapurna base camp. They made it clear that we had full control of our trek, but they acted as trusted advisers at every step. Tulsi knows all the owners of the lodges at each village and camp, and by reaching out to his network he knew exactly where we could go that would be safe, open, and good for a hot meal.Before our trek, we got a tour of some of the fantastic temples (unfortunately damaged by the earthquake) and sights of Kathmandu. Himalayan Glacier took care of the hotel (the lovely hotel Aryatara in our case), all the flights, and transportation & sightseeing. We were never left wanting, we had a driver, guides, and fantastic service at the hotel. Tulsi even took us out to the markets in Kathmandu and made sure we were properly equipped.In terms of treks, Annapurna may not have the same name appeal as Everest, but it's a beautiful region. Greener than the Everest trek, the lower altitudes are almost tropical . Plenty of wildlife, including monkeys, buffalo, ponies and burros, goats, as well as village cats and dogs. As you start to climb it gets cooler, and you have fantastic views. The ever-present landmark is Mount Machhapuchchhre (\"fishtail mountain\") names for it's unique identitiy.Stays at lodges are fun. Due to high vacancies, we typically got the best room in the house (with attached bathroom / shower). All the food is covered, and you'll be hungry. Dal Bhat is more or less the national food of Nepal, and I highly recommend it. We were coming up against the rainy season, but Tulsi was very good at getting us to the destination village before the afternoon rains. We didn't get rained on once.Due to landslide concerns, we didn't go all the way to Annapurna Base Camp (again, our choice, Tulsi was ready to take us if we desired), so we trekked around at the lower altitiudes. We ended our trek at Sarangkot, a village overlooking Pokhara. Instead of hiking back to the city, we gave all our things to Rham and Tulsi and then Parasailed down!All in all, it was an experience to last a lifetime. I can't recommend Himalayan Glacier enough, and will strive to make it back if I can ever get a month of again."

Our way was very well lead by our guide Dol, who not only knew the best places to stay and visit, but also told us a lot about the people and culture of Nepal. Special thanks to Gopal, our porter, who carried our heavy backpacks and still was faster than us along the mountain paths (our hero!) - always with a smile on his face.

The company was very easy to work with in setting up the logistics, and our crew was terrific. Very friendly and always made sure we had what we needed. I'd love to do another trek with Hira, Padam and Bishow - can't thank these three enough for an amazing experience. We had to change our schedule in the 2nd half of the trek and it was seamless on our end; they took care of changing any lodging arrangements and worked out flight changes out of Lukla without us ever having to worry about it. They are very focused on health and safety, both for us and their crew, and they have a ton of knowledge of the mountains. It's not a cheap trip, but the value of what you're getting is well worth it (transportation in Kathmandu, flights in and out of Lukla, lodging and meals every day, and their expertise in the mountains to name a few). In terms of the Gokyo Ri trek itself, it's the most beautiful setting I've ever experienced. We did this in late march / early april and got to experience a wide variety of terrain (including snow). There are definitely some days of tough hiking in terms of climbs, but nothing technically challenging. A great trip for anyone looking for a beautiful trek."

Words cannot begin to express how I feel, and how grateful I am to the team at Himalayan Glaciers to have put together an error free and splendid trek for me along with my partners on trek ( 8th March 2015 ). the whole trek has been cast in fond memories which i shall cherish throughout and because of the trek and Himalayan Glacier have now developed a yearn to summit Sagarmatha !.Naba ( co founder and overall incharge of operations ) has put together an excellent organisation both in terms of customer delight ( not just satisfaction ) and the professional team of guides and support staff.Right from my very first interaction on email with Urusha from Himalayan Glacier i could tell by the way all my queries over the weeks were answered patiently and with all details that i had made the right choice in going with Himalayan for the trek. Urusha not just answered all my queries but was most helpful in providing various other inputs both with regards to trek and for things to do at Kathmandu.We were a group of 4 ( my Australian mate, a German and an Indian and all of us gelled and hit off the trek with fun and close bonding ) and were accompanied by Dol ( main guide ), Biru ( assistant guide ) and 2 porters ....so for the 4 trekkers we had an equal number of support staff !!!! Amazing....Dol has been the most clam and composed guide one could have asked for, his knowledge about the Himalayas, its people, the nature and the trek were beyond any fault. He took great care to ensure all our likes were catered to throughout the trek and at times he anticipated our needs in advance and had them met with in advance. Himalayan Glaciers is congratulated for having trained such exceptional staff. Biru the assistant guide, is another prized catch Himalayan Glaciers have and shall one day turn into an exceptional guide himself under Naba and Dol.We could tell from the places we stayed at and the kind of food we ate that we were \" royalty \" as we always had the best places with best rooms to stay and the food was exceptionally good ( i also made it a point to interact with chefs at all the places we stayed which meant we could all have food to our liking......).I can go on and on about the trek especially because everything was thought of and taken care by Himalayan Glaciers ( right from first interaction over emails to Welcome and farewell dinners and the trek in between...).I happen to be a very fussy person, however Himalayan Glacier have not once given me any time to complain about anything, cos there wasnt anything to complain upon....I do look forward to many more treks with them ...and congratulate the entire team on the exceptional work they all put in."

The email correspond before the trip with Sangita from the company was very informative and helpful all along the way. The trip was amazing with a very professionel and experienced guide, and everything went smooth. The company invited me for an exclusive dinner at The Ship in Kathmandu after the trip without extra cost, and all in all I will definitely recommend Himalayan Glacier and return to them in the future."

We did something quite extraordinary and completed the tour in 8 days, rather than the recommended minimum of 12. We had the excellent guidance of Asis and our wonderful porter Raju (I highly recommend that you ask for them when getting in touch with this company), we have achieved every goal we set for this trip. Asis organised everything for us and thought of every little detail from antibacterial gel to biscuits for afternoon tea. We have seen many tour guides on the way to Base Camp who would remain behind to chat with their fellow guide hence leave their clients alone in some treacherous paths, Asis would never do that. He adjusts his pace according to the clients and he would never get you out of his sight, in case something happens. Many times when I was struggling to see the next unfrozen point in the path, he would come to the rescue and made sure I would cross that bit safe and sound. I would heavily recommend anyone to specifically ask for him."

            "review": "Recommended tour group for EBC. Having completed a trek to Mt.Kilimanjaro in Feb 2014 my wife and I decided we'd give Everest Base Camp a go. In selecting a tour company we chose Himalayan Glacier based on a colleague's recommendation. We found going through the source rather than a third party who subcontract it to a local operator (as can be the case) both saved us money and gave us a greater understanding of who we were dealing with.After feeling very fortunate in having a great group in Kilimanjaro we decided we wouldn't risk the group dynamic this time and chose to take the tour as a couple. We also took the trip over the Australian summer (Jan 2015) - which is the Nepalise winter - the main benefits of which are the lack of crowds and mainly crystal clear days. We chose the 15-day luxury trek which included a day tour of Kathmandu and approx 11 days of actual trekking. Of this 5 nights were in \"luxury lodges\" hosted by Yeti Mountain Houses and 6 nights were at tea houses/lodges. The differences between the luxury lodges and guest house/tea houses was significant particularly for those who dread communal toilets, especially in the bitter cold. We would definitely choose this form of \"glamping\" again. The Kathmandu day tour was run by a very informative guide ( forget his name) but very knowledgable, good English and plenty of stats. Whilst \"temple-itis\" set in quickly, we found the day surprisingly enjoyable and a great experience of Kathmandu city. The trekking part was run by our guide Pradip and our porter Furman. Pradip was an extremely competent guide, great English skills and knowledge of the various mountains and their peak heights. He was always ready to help and make sure we were ok. Whilst I think we're pretty straight forward and low maintenance, we really couldn't ask for anymore. Our porter likewise always carried our bags with no fuss, forever with a smile and whatever English he knew and always helping out with tea and clearing plates etc.As a team both Pradip and Furman worked very well and are a credit to Himalayan Glacier. In summary the comments we make are: * Compared to Kilimanjaro we found this trek far more enjoyable. All the various villages, proper altitude acclimatisation, and being in the midst of such a landscape was amazing.  * Of the very many tour groups in Nepal, we would recommend Himalayan Glacier to anyone for professionalism and care of Trekkers as well as proper conditions for guides and porters. Personal touches by the owner to make sure things met expectations was also appreciated. * Request Pradip and Furman to be on your group if at all possible. * Whilst trekking in winter was cold towards Base Camp (around minus 10 in the tea/guest houses at night) we preferred having more of the trails and guest houses to ourselves or a few others. Of approx 39,000 who do the trek each year, around 9,000 trek in Oct, which in our view would have made the trails and guest houses/lodges way too busy and hardly enjoyable for such a serene location. However we also note that for most of the trek, when going uphill we spent a lot of time in t-shirts and lose clothing. * The luxury Yeti Lodges were well worth it - not only was the food far better, but hot showers and bathrooms to yourself and electric blankets added a little bit of comfort to what can become a little tiresome in the guest houses.* A lot of the food on the menus arrived quite differently to what you'd expect in a western country. Tolerance of understanding that this was the Nepalise version of a favourite dish goes a long way. * Avoid potatoes or anything that may of needed preserving north of Namche Bazaar. We made the fatal mistake and thereafter stuck with staples that came from a tin or was dried ( eg pasta sauce, soups, noodles, etc ). * Take plenty of layers with you clothing wise. Beware that the 15kg limit on baggage for the Lukla flight includes hand luggage otherwise you have the excess baggage charge ( about $10 for us). * A hot water bottle will get you through cold nights - alternatively having your water bottle filled up with hot water before you go to bed can help. * Last but not least, take plenty of photos and remember that even if the view of Everest is cloudy on the way up, it may still be clear on the way down.

Ok, we were lucky that we ended up doing the trip just with the two of us instead of a larger group but think even then - HGT would have made it a very enjoyable trip (maybe even better)...They were very attentive, informative, helpful and always there if and when we needed them.

We visited the Peace Temple in Pokhara and the Alpine museum as well as many Buddhist temples. We witnessed the stunning sunrises over the Annapurna range and the sacred mountain named Macchapucchre, otherwise known as Fish Tail mountain, which is dedicated to the lord Shiva and may not be climbed. We trekked through rhododendron forests with monkeys cavorting in the trees above and shared the trail with donkeys carrying heavy loads as well as young children on their way to school.

Best of all, we were permitted to make some significant changes in our itinerary, while on the road in the kingdom of Bhutan, which really enhanced our journey, and were able to do so with no fuss or added extra costs, remarkable! Some other travelers we met along the way (with other companies), were having so so trips, while ours was superb and of quality in every way!My advise, especially in Bhutan, is to hire a private car (with driver and guide) as the roads are ridiculous. Also, spend more then one night in at least some places! Most companies seem to run you around needlessly, and exhaust one by arriving late and leaving early. Simply put, not my cup of tea!"

The guides and drivers in Bhutan and Tibet were excellent. Navigating those windy roads definitely takes a level of skill. There had been an issue with the vehicle that was to be used on the Tibet tour several hours before my arrival. This did not affect my time at all. We used taxis and public transport (at no cost to myself) for getting around Lhasa. When the time came to leave Lhasa (for the drive back to Nepal) and our vehicle wasn't available, another was provided without hesitation.Everyone who has asked me about my time in Bhutan and Tibet I have suggested they look into HGT.

The mountains appeared and disappeared in the high mist, but are overwhelming when fully revealed. The resonant chanting of the Buddhist monks will remain with me forever as will the lone Yak bells along the trails. Himalayan Glacier is a first class organization from start to finish.

As two young girls arriving in Nepal we were concerned about finding a trek company that could give us peace of mind along with the trek we wanted. Naba the manager was amazing and totally accommodated our needs and understood that we were students so not wanting to spend a crazy amount. We did the Annapurna Trek, and it was the best experience of my life. Our guide Pradeep made the whole experience for us, not only was he very knowledgable and helpful, but a great person who really tailored our trek for us both. As two young girls they put our mind at rest about safety. Could not recommend them enough to anyone wanting a short to long or cheap to expensive track. They have it all, and will accommodate in the best way for all."

We were greeted at the airport with fresh flower necklaces, and given a real cultural experience in Kathmandu before we tackled the mountains over the next few weeks. We did not have to worry about a thing.The views on the trails are spectacular at all times (even if there are clouds in the sky), and the company ensure you stay in the best accommodation available (the facilities become more and more minimalistic as you approach altitude- but this is all part of the experience)Our guide \"Pradip\", went above and beyond expectations! he carried up enough fresh fruit and cookies to last us the entire duration (food on the mountains becomes a bit samey after a while- this hit the spot). He was there to help us when we felt sick, or just needed an extra push of motivations when times got tough. He was patient and caring, and above all- really fun. Definitely ask for him to be your guide!This trek is slightly more expensive than the others available- however it is worth every penny due to the amount of care and extra inclusions. I wouldn't consider going with anyone else."

We explored Kathmandu & Pokhara, had a sceninc flight past Mt Everest Trekked to Poon Hill for incredible views of the Annapurna range in the himalayas, safari'd in Chitwan National Park, Trekked to Tiger Nest monastry in Bhutan to name a few. Naba and Krinisha were absolutely fantastic in organising everything and our whole trip ran flawlessly. Naba checked in with us along the way to make sure there were no issues. We had different guides / drivers along the way, Sadeep and Tulsi our guides and Dipper our driver in Kathmandu showed us everything there is to see, We were also lucky enough to have Tulsi as our trekking guide for 5 days with Porcus our Porter, they looked after us extremely well and made sure we had everything we needed along the trek, and finally Sonam and Gilla in Bhutan showed us how amazing their country is. All of the staff from Himilayan glacier that we met along the way were outstanding, genuinely nice people, super friendly and very very knowledgable in their respective areas. I highly reccomend Himalayan Glacier Trekking to anyone considering visiting these beautiful countries. They made our wellbeing their number one priority and we are already dreaming of our next trip back!! We will definitely be going through Himilayan Glacier Trekking next time.Value for money i also rate 10/10."

Doing such a long trip over nine days required an experienced and efficient tour company and Himalayan Glacier delivered on all counts. Things can go terribly wrong travelling 1000 km at such high altitudes so we wanted a knowledgeable person to plan the itinerary and arrange the logistics of passing from Nepal to China and then back to Nepal without any hassles. We found him in Mr. Naba of HGT. The whole trip was executed like a dream. He took care to arrange for us to acclimatise ourselves properly in Lhasa before setting out for higher terrain. A master visa for all twelve of us made immigration checks a breeze. The Tibetan guide was superb. Fluent in English and thoroughly professional. The driver was very skillful and he needed to be since our vehicle was travelling along winding mountain roads. Sure, some of us still experienced some AMS symptoms but we were prepared with medication and oxygen. And sure the road to EBC was torturous to say the least, but this is an adventure trip as Mr. Naba himself told us in his earlier briefing. So we were prepared to take the bad with the good. And it was good!It was exhilarating taking in the mountains and lakes, experiencing a snowfall and visiting the ancient monasteries. Not your run-of-the-mill type of holiday definitely.

I researched several companies, including many American ones, and decided upon HGT. I went by myself and met my group there, so I have to admit I was a bit hesitant and wondering if the company would pull through! Everything was done online. My contact person was Sristi and she answered my many questions very promptly. When I landed in Kathmandu my guide Suresh was there to meet me, with a lei! I was taken to the hotel (Shanker) and got settled in after being up for 40 hours! We had a welcome dinner, a tour of Kathmandu, and everything was included! We flew to Lukla and luckily had no flight issues! Our tour included the Gokyo Lakes. I was SO glad I booked this trip vs. just going to EBC and back. Our tour breaks off from the mainstream for several days. We saw so much more, it was cleaner, a lot less crowded... Beautiful! Challenging due to Gokyo Ri and the Cho La Pass, but SO worth it!! Gokyo was my favorite part of the trip. EBC was just a bonus! HGT took care of everything! I only really had to pay for tips, 1 shower, battery charging, wifi, and souvenirs!! Our guides were all great: Suresh, Uttar, and Jungbu. Uttar and Jungbu were younger and played cards with us and were very personable. They called me \"didi\", big sister. Kinda miss it! The porters were also fantastic and worked their butts off! We also had afternoon tea every day complete with \"bickies\" (cookies), and fresh cut apples after every dinner! I would highly recommend HGT. Every detail was taken care of from airport transport, to meals, to rooms,... EVERYTHING! I truly can't recommend them highly enough! There are no HGT day trips to the Himalayas, so I snuck this in under a day trip they do offer! I hope those interested find it and read it! What an awesome, epic trip!!"

The guide and driver greeted us at the Kathmandu airport and escorted us to the office where they briefed us on the trip, and gave us the sleeping bag, down jacket, blue HG bag and blue HG tshirt. We then had dinner back at our Shanker Hotel which was had good food. Four star hotel which was acceptable according to our standards. We still purified the water with steri-pen even though it purified bottled water. We always used the steri-pen for the trip and never had any gastrointestinal issues. Our guide was Bimal and he was top notch. He was polite, professional, quiet at times, but strong with his recommendations to keep us safe and healthy. For example, he explained that meat should not be eaten above Namche Bazaar. He would check for any symptoms of altitude sickness and had an emergency first aid kit on hand with medications commonly used to treat altitude sickness including Diamox and Ibuprofen. He was well versed in the culture and mountain environment based on his substantial experience leading trekking tours over the past 10+ years with over 50 trips under his belt. After the trip was over and we were back in Kathmandu, he took my wife and I out to the Thamel streets for shopping. We became friends and exchanged contact information at the end of the trip. He was genuine and sincere, as evidenced by the fact that he was constantly approached by other guides from HG or other companies who wanted to greet him. That speaks volumes of his character that everyone knew him and was friendly to him on the trail. That gave us confidence to trust him with his decision making and recommendation. Our porter was Bikram and he did an excellent job carrying our bags over the mountain terrain. He was always courteous, on time, and delivered our bags before we even reached our destination. On the second to last day with him in Namche Bazaar the four of us played a few rounds of pool together. On the last trekking in Lukla, we took him and the guide out to dinner to say farewell to Bikram. He deserved the recognition after doing an excellent job over the long hard work. The trekking experience was more difficult than we initially imagined primarily due to the altitude related issues such as the cold temperature and 50% oxygen relative to sea level when we were 5500meters above sea level. Fortunately, we acclimatized by gradually ascending, and took a rested in Namche. The itinerary was \u201crapid\u201d in part to the rapid descent. Our legs were sore by the end. I would recommend this trip only for those who are physically fit otherwise it may be difficult to enjoy the beautiful surroundings if you are having problems with leg pain from the moderate to hard trekking."

Though we were travelling alone, we always felt safe and in competent hands.The highlights of our trip included visiting the temples in Durbar Square where we were honored to see the current Kumari goddess; the colorful Monkey Temple; Pashaputinath with its heartrending funeral ghats and the unforgettable Tibetan Buddhist Boudhanath Stupa with its wise Buddha eyes looking down at us while monks and devotees walked around its periphery. We also visited Tibetan carpet weaving studios as well as the famous Rum Doodle Restaurant with signatures and photographs of the world's most renowned mountaineers adorning its walls.

All trips had guides family accommodations and transportation. All the guides were as flexible as they could be within the tight schedule and manage to work in extras as we became aware of the options available. Lastly his inside knowledge and connections helped us do all this avoiding typical delays common to travel in Nepal or third world countries. And he did this at the best price point - he always managed things inside our budget!"

We are so happy that we made the decision to go, I know that there are people wondering if it is a good time to travel to Nepal, but honestly, the people are so welcoming and lovely and the tours is so well organized that we never had any issues. Our cultural guide, Mukesh was so knowledgeable and answered every question we threw at him. From the different culture, nature and their uses, to the religious ceremonies taking place. Having him with us made us feel like we really got an insight into the wonderful culture of Nepal. The views, culture and people truly make this Nepal a remarkable place, somewhere I hope everyone has a chance to visit! "

The trek itself takes in some magnificent scenery, staying at tea house lodges throughout. It's hard to praise adventure connexion and particularly our guide dawa enough. The team make the trip to this amazing country so enjoyable and unforgettable. Whilst the trekking can be challenging its more than worthwhile and a visit to Nepal leaves a deep and lasting impression. I've no doubt that we will return to Nepal again soon and will most certainly trek again with adventure Connexion. Many thanks to RB, Kulendra and our wonderful guide and porters - Thank you !"

Thanks to Adventure Connexion I saw more than I hoped. Everything was very well organised. I booked my trip by email with Mr Baral. It was easy and smooth. I also met Mr RB. These 2 persons made my stay in Nepal very pleasant and flawless. The hotels that I stayed, chosen by the agency, were amazing. The guide provided by this agency, Mukesh, is very knowledgable and gave a lot of interesting information about the places we visited. The car driver, Shree, is a good professional. I felt always safe in a car. I saw the Everest thanks to this agency having arranged for a mountain flight for me. Adventure Connexion really takes care of their customers. I felt it all the time. Mr Baral called me to check whether all was OK, we had lunch in a nice local restaurant in Thamel, for me to taste the real local food. Mr RB treated me to a nice coffee when I mentioned that Nescafe coffee was not what I liked. When I was leaving I received gifts from them, a tea shirt, orange scarves, it was touching. The earthquake of April 2015 caused lots of damage, but in any case Nepal is such a beautiful country with friendly and hospitable people. I definitely recommend services of Adventure Connexion in Nepal. Thank you dear Kulendra and RB!"

My flight was behind schedule by 2 hours and they were there waiting for me first thing at the airport. Having Adventure Connexion take care of all the permits and logistics of going on the trek and providing a very experienced guide made for a hassle free and extremely enjoyable trek. The entire trek was well planned and made great use of time. The entire Adventure Connexion team were very helpful and willing to do anything to make it a great trip."

One of the most important things I learned while travelling though Nepal is how valuable an experienced, local guide team is. Adventure Connexion had all of our permits, paperwork, travel logistics etc sorted out before we arrived which saved us DAYS of waiting in lines and planning. Whenever there were modifications necessary to our original plans (impassable roads, landslides, delays due to religious holidays, last minute decision to go to Chitwan etc), RB and his team made the necessary adjustments smoothly and seamlessly, so that every part of our trip was a pleasant experience . Small attention to details also mattered a lot: arriving at our teahouse at the end of every day to a steaming cup of tea, our bags already in our rooms, snacks before supper... Such a treat! Nepal is even more beautiful than I imagined: the scenery is breathtaking and the people will steal your heart with their kindness and generosity of spirit. They are always smiling, laughing, ever eager to please. The quality and variety of food along the circuit was also a pleasant surprise. The Adventure Connexion team went over and above when it came to accommodating a gluten allergy in our group. We were so pleased with our adventure and feel lucky to have been referred to RB and his guide team to walk us through our first trip to Nepal. The love they feel for their country is reflected in their passion for what they do. We highly recommend Adventure Connection to our friends and family who are planning a trip to Nepal."

We first met RB nine year ago when he guided us through Tibet. This time we brought our daughter and son-in-law on their first adventure in this spectacular country. We have had the privilege to travel all around the world and all I can say that this trip was the best organized one we have ever been on! That is a tall order for this nation of so little material goods but with such a calm an generous spirit. Despite difficult conditions on the roads because of late monsoon rains we travelled to our mountain trekking start up points without difficulty. The Manaslu trek was outstanding, the tea houses great and our porters strong and friendly. All four of us highly recommend Adventure Connexion and plan on using them again!"

The circuit took us through villages such as Beshisahar, Chamje, Chame, Pisang, Braga and Manang on our way to the Thorung La pass (5416m) and onto Jonsom where we took the plane to Pokhara. He had then organised a stay at the Chitwan Safari Park before returning to Kathmandu....again everything went smoothly.

It's a bit of a gamble with who to go with as there are hundreds of trekking companies all trying to get your business. We are so glad we decided to go with Blue Mountain purely because of our guide Ram.From the moment we met Ram he was a kind and friendly guy. He was always positive and happy. I was quite slow and he never made me feel bad about it which I was thankful for. He chose us good accommodation and places to eat and told us lots of information throughout the trek. He even sat with us at dinner, I noticed a lot of guides didn't do this. The Poon Hill trek was a great taster of the Himalayas, it's a good trek if you haven't done much walking before and you are short on time. At times it was a little tough in the heat but the amazing views and the thought of dal baaht for dinner made it worth it! We were sad to say bye to Ram as it felt like we had been with a good friend for 5 days. You will not be disappointed if you have a trek with him! Thank you Ram and Blue Mountain!"

He had arranged good vehicle for our 7 day trip and our stay at good hotels in Kathmandu and Pokhara. The trip to Chitwan was excellent though the hotel room was not clean. We had given the feedback to Mr. Buddhi and he taken it in a positive manner. The trip was well arranged and taken care. A big thanks for Mr. Buddhi and his team."

Our knowledgeable, fun, and personable guide Raj arranged transportation to and from Pokhara for us and secured accommodations at the friendliest, safest and most beautiful guest houses on the trails. His knowledge of the local culture and of the mountains helped us to absorb everything the mountains have to offer\u2014much more than if we had gone on our own. My friend and I also wanted to change our itinerary midway through to make it to the hot springs and our guide was very flexible in adapting our trekking schedule. We left the country with a new Nepali friend and for that I highly recommend using Blue Mountain for any trekking needs in Nepal!"

From the first day i arrived to Kathmandu Mr. Buddhi and his team at Hotel Happy Home, Blue Mountain Travels&Tours, Mount Fuji Adventure Pvt. Ltd. They were all really helpful to me. They've picked me from the airport, they even paid my visa fee as i didn't have cash on me! Then Mr. Buddhi introduce me to Mr. Yaka Simkhada at the Hotel Happy Home and we've made a trekking plan for 9 days on The Annapurna Circuit. Starting from crazy bus ride from Kathmandu to Pokhara, i had great time;) Then fifth of march we started our trekking adventure with Yaka.After 4 hard days, passing through tight jungle paths, by flowers, by farmer villages on hillsides, by langur monkeys and in between rocky hills, living the four seasons in one day, racing with rain and snow, sweating with sun we've made it to the Annapurna Base Camp (4130m) 8 of march at 15:00 local time. I feel like a professional mountainer because i felt great at an altitude that so many people get sick, with severe headache and high altitude sickness. Only there was snow storm at night and temperatures was down below -15 but next morning the view was amazing.I couldn't make it to 5000m because of the heavy snow night before, these monumental mountains creates their own climate but we made it to 4400m and faced some of the most dangerous mountain peaks on earth. It was a wonderful feeling.Machhapuchhre also called Fish Tail (6997m), Annapurna South(7219m) and most dangerous, deadliest mountain in the world Annapurna First (8091m) We had a lot of fun with my friend Yaka Simkhada singing Nepalese songs. We're one of the best teams ;) now descending, still one day to finish our 9 days of wonderful and difficult adventure.. By the 13 of march we were back in Pokhara.. Overall, i recommend you to trust Mr.Buddhi and guide Yaka Simkhada. They are really professional and helpful. They solve any problem it might take time to solve by yourself. Great experience and wonderful adventure. Please book your trekking trip with Blue Mountain Travels and Mount Fuji Adventure Pvt. Ltd. You won't be disappointed;)I also respect Nepalese People a lot for adapting themselves to the hard life conditions specially in the countryside, they deserve better..Adil AVCI adildenadam@gmail.comBrussels/Belgium, Istanbul/Turkey"

Blue mountain is so very on top of every detail, and very professional, I would use them again and again without any doubt at all. My hotel was very very hard to find even after Blue Mountain spoke with the owner once the day before and also at 0500 AM the morning of my 05:45 pickup. My great driver was early. He even enlisted help from a local in the dark for help on locating me. Most taxi's have a very tough time as the hotel is tucked way in from main alley. Nothing was left to chance by this company, I was very impressed. I have never been to Nepal before as well I am a single woman alone. Nepal I find very safe. We arrived at the airport with 1 hour to relax have coffee and anticipate my adventure. The flight was smooth as silk, crystal clear, and sunny. One of the pilots was a woman which was so great to see. The service on board was wonderful from the first moment. The flight certificate was personally signed in pen by the pilot. Each person took a turn on the cockpit, which was truly amazing. We each had our own window seat took take photos. This trip was for me a lot of money for 1 activity, only because I am on a 1 year around the world trip. I am so grateful I did it, as I will never forget Valentines 2016 over Everest.

Based upon the information in Trip Advisor (As I always consult with Trip Advisers before any trip planning) I planned to visit Nagarkot, Kathmandu, Chitwan and Pokhara.Mr. Budhdhi and his travel support team of Blue Mountain arranged all the hotel bookings that we suggested based on the reviews of TA and also arranged a good car with very efficient and decent driver Deepak.Our whole journey was hazards free thanks to Blue Mountains support team. We had difficulty in returning back to Kolkata as a Turkish Plane crash landed at KTM airport and we had difficulty in arranging the return tickets. Mr. Buddhi and his team really helped us with additional staying and other booking arrangements as it was a crisis situation with airport being shut and thousands got stranded. In fact I still have not received the refunds of my Air India tickets.The hotels suggested by us and booked by Blue Mountain were fabulous."

Fortunately, on our 1st visit to Kathmandu, we stayed at a great local hotel (the Kathmandu boutique hotel) with links to 'Blue Mountain Travels'. As experienced travelers we are always sceptical about this type of arrangement, especially as there are thousands of 'one man' companies around. But our fears were totally unfounded. Initially we were concerned about our level of fitness and decided on a short foothills trek before more strenuous stuff. Buddhi, the boss at Blue Mountain, couldn't have been more in touch with our needs and tailored the trekking for us - at good prices. Or guide throughout, Bharat, was outstanding, he sorted all the inevitable problems that cropped up and was excellent company. My partner and I can't recommend 'Blue Mountain Travels' highly enough."

Buddhi at Blue Mountain was the most engaging and offered what appeared to be the best service.Prior to arriving, we agreed on a helicopter flight from Kathmandu Airport which would take us to one of the villages beyond Lukla and then up to see Everest and back. The morning after we landed, we met with Buddhi and finalised the details and the following morning, weather permitting we would be on our way.Right on schedule, we met Buddhi and went to his office next door to pay the bill and he led us to the airport we were met a representative for the airline. The escorted us through the terminal (we still had to go through all the security procedures) and made it to the office where we met the Captain (Captain Andy). By the way, the domestic terminal where we waited was a zoo!They took our weights, and decided that we did not need to stop in Lukla. Our routing was direct to the Everest View Hotel (the highest hotel in the world it's claimed--hard to argue). It was a very smoggy morning and we did not see much until we cleared Kathmandu city.Captain Andy was the pilot monitoring and First Officer Raj was the pilot flying. We felt very safe the whole time which meant we could enjoy the views.What an amazing experience. About halfway the mountains came into view and the haze had disappeared. Below the countryside is dotted with agricultural minded villages and eventually we reached Lukla which we overflew to get EVH. We spent an hour at the hotel before flying back. On the flight back, we flew up a bit more and got a little closer to Everest before turning back to Kathmandu. I would highly recommend having tea or coffee (no milk). I had the hot chocolate and as it was the only item which I had different from my wife, and I was terribly ill the next day.It was amazing!!! I have not done anything like this, and while it was not cheap, it was so worth it.Another cool thing is that you can listen to the air traffic control as that is the only way to communicate with the pilots who are also the tour guides.Buddhi did great as our arranger, and I could not think of anything that could have been done differently. He also arranged with our driver to stop at Boudanath Temple on the way back from the airport which the driver did, no problem.Another reason to appreciate Buddhi, is that the next day I was quite sick and went to look for a pharmacy. I happened to run into Buddhi who walked me to a pharmacy--incredibly grateful.I would highly recommend Blue Mountain Travels--it may not be the cheapest, but I would attest that it is a solid service. No complaints!"

We used transport service from Mr. Buddi in October 2014 for 8 days in Kathmandu, Nagorkot and Pokhara.The vehicle used in Kathmandu and Nagorkot (same one) was new and the driver was very polite and helpful. As per rule, the same transport could not be used in pokhara and we used 2 cars in 2 days. Out of those, one was not up to mark. Later we came to know from Mr. Buddi that they have to rely on sister companies in pokhara and not totally in their control.In the last day Mr. Buddhi personally came to see us. It was nice meeting him.In total it was a great experience and service. I would 100% recommend this to other travellers as well."

We used Blue Mountain Travels car hire for a journey from Kathmandu to Chitwan, Pokhara, Bandipur and back to KTM.Our driver spoke good English and the 7 seater jeep was as comfortable as we could hope for with 4 adults and a week's worth of luggage.Throughout the journey our diver drove very aggressively which I acknowledge is symptomatic of driving on Nepali roads. However, on more than one occasion this seemed to err more on the side of recklessness.While we were in Pokhara we were offered a sight seeing tour and asked what time we would like for it to start and we chose 9:30. Due to Dashain a driver arrived and asked us if we would mind postponing it until midday so that our driver would be able to visit his family and receive a tikka - we were more than happy for this. However, when (a different) driver arrived for our tour he drove us around to the sights of Pokhara without a word of what we were seeing; if it hadn't been for an Indian family also on the tour telling us why we were stopping in each place we wouldn't have know where or why we were there.For our journey home from Bandipur our driver expressed to us his desire to get back to KTM for a family gathering that evening and we felt guilty requesting that we left at 10am. Knowing that our driver we keen to get back home we were ready to leave promptly only for our driver to call us and say that he was running an hour late, this ended up being and hour 45 late."

I spent the first three days of the trip guided by Deepak and Sonica, who quickly became very good friends to me. Their willingness to help, level of knowledge, and openness were amazing. Deepak consistently went above and beyond in order to help me and a friend of mine get what we needed to make our trip was successful. Sonica was a wonderful guide who taught me a lot about her culture in a fun manner. Buddhi has a very nice organization and his family was very hospitable during my stay. So how are they life savers.... About a week before my flight home, I began to feel sick, but decided to try to stick it out. When it became obvious to me that I needed to see a doctor, I didn't hesitate to call Depaak and knew that he would be willing and able to take care of everything I needed logistically. His response on the phone was reassuring and comforting. After a three hour ride back to Kathmandu, I met Deepak at his office. He then helped me with my gear, the hotel, and getting me to the hospital. He stayed three hours until I was admitted, then came every day to check on me, and even came to pick me up when I was released. When I noted my appreciation of his kindness, he responded you are family and this is what we do for family. I was deeply touched by this and it has impacted how I value and relate to people. I ended up having a temperature of 106, advanced typhoid fever, and was in the hospital for four days. If it had not been for Deepak, I would not have known what hospital to have gone to, might not have got the care that I needed, and would have felt very alone. All of this aside, I would still be giving Blue Mountain Travels and their staff a 5 star rating because of the quality of service. I highly recommend using there services and trusting that you will be well taken care of. Many, many thanks! David"

Having made the trip on short notice, I really hadn\u2019t fully planned the visit. I met Buddhi Basnet at the airport, and he was able to help me with the Everest flight, and also with a tour of the city. He arranged for the next morning sightseeing flight to Everest, and then when the flight turned back because of low visibility, he arranged for the flight the next day. For the tour of the sites in Kathmandu, he arranged for one of his drivers Dipak to take me around the city. Dipak was a very good guide, and was extremely helpful as he took me to some shops to get replacement items as my luggage was lost going into Kathmandu. Buddhi even offered to help me later to locate my luggage at the airport, as I was only there for three days. Overall it was a good experience with Blue Mountain Travel, and when I return I will definitely contact Buddhi.Paul, Kentucky, USA"

The trip was made truly memorable because of the well planned itenary by Mr. Buddhi from Blue Mountain Travels. He was truly courteous and planned everything for us from our hotel pick up and drop - trip across kathmandu, chitwan & pokhra - booking of our choice of hotel in each of the destinations - even managed currency change for us. We were totally relaxed during the whole trip and any kind of issues or hassles were taken care by Mr. Buddhi. He had perfectly planned out our itenary basis our need - it was tailored to perfection for us. Anyone travelling to Nepal, I highly recommend them to plan out your stay and travel through Blue Mountain, they truly personalize your itenary and all you need to do is sit back and enjoy!!!

For the car trip service, it is a pretty nice and impressive experience.

I was approached by Krishna, the owner of Ammonite, on the streets of Thamel and immediately waved him off, thinking he was just another touter. Upon checking out his organization on Trip Advisor, however, it was evident that Ammonite was a promising organization with which to embark on a Himalayan trek-- especially after we shopped around and found that Ammonite offered the same trek (a 10-day trek to Mardi Himal and Ghorapani/Poon Hill area) for much cheaper than many other organizations quoted us: $485 per person including everything except water and coffee versus $650 to $750). We were so, so glad that we opted to go with Ammonite as we found them to be genuinely wonderful people. We hung out with Krishna and his staff in Kathmandu both before and after our trek. Before our trek they graciously hosted a birthday party for my sister in their office (cake, candles and all!), and after the trek took us to their favorite local restaurant one day and a fun live music venue the next. They were so fun, and Krishna's constant response of \"Sure, why not?\" soon became a catch phrase of our time in Nepal.The trek itself was excellent, with a well-planned (but adjustable) itinerary that took us through sublime areas of the Himalayas. All of our accommodation was good, certainly good enough for us. Unfortunately we didn't have the greatest weather and missed out on several prime viewpoints due to all-encompassing fog, something that we weren't expecting given that October is known to be clear. (Though we embarked in very early October.)Our guide Pasang was the highlight of our entire 5-week trip to Nepal. He was hilarious, knowledgable, and went above and beyond to ensure that we were content and safe. My sister had some knee trouble in some of the steeper sections of Mardi Himal, and Pasang was patient and incredibly helpful in assisting her down many of the ledges. He's unwaveringly positive and incredibly loquacious, as he's eager to strike up a conversation with anyone, foreigner or local, whom he comes across. As a former chef, Pasang knows his way around a kitchen and would help out at all the restaurants and guest houses we went to, ensuring our food was cooked to perfection. In the evenings, we spent a great deal of time drinking raski, laughing, and talking about Nepal. My sister and I experienced some major post-trek depression when we had to part ways with Pasang. He's truly a gem, and we can't recommend him enough! Clearly, I can't say enough good things about this organization. If you're looking for a good organization in Kathmandu, this is it!"

Krishna of Ammonite Adventure approached us on the street in Thamel and although we are usually very skeptical about that sort of thing, Krishna was different due to his charming, friendly and non-pushing attitude. We heard him out and came in to his office to hear about all the activities available to us without him ever being pushy. He wants his clients happy! He even helped us get local SIM cards.We opted for a 4 day trek to Poon Hill leaving from Pokhara which was a breathtaking experience in both senses of the word. A challenging but rewarding trek! We found his prices reasonable compared to other agencies, especially online quoted prices (don't ever book online!). The average we heard from other people on the trek was between $200-$300 per person with a guide. It should be known however that you could do it without a guide for near half the cost but if you want to use an agency for peace of mind, Krishna's your man. Word of advice: If you do get a guide, meet them first before trekking with them so you get a feel for each other. Overall, Krishna and his friendly team go above and beyond to make sure you're happy and I would not hesitate to recommend this company to my friends and family and have already done so. "

Krishna from the office was very friendly and explained the trek and the alternatives well, showing it all on a decent map where I could see what he was talking about.But the price was totally intransparent. I still have no idea about how much money the guide and the porter got, how much money was planned for lodges / food and how much money stayed at the agency.But the worst part of the trek was the guide himself who spoke very bad English. This made it impossible to have a nice conversation, and plenty of my questions about culture and religion remained unanswered (which was one of my main reasons to take a guide). And whatever I explained to him about me or my homecountry, he didn't understand.He also told me everyday that I was a slow walker, that I had no idea of mountains / hiking and that he was bored by doing this trek.Further on, I had been told at the office that \"the food is all included\". Yet that only meant one choice per meal without any little extra (eg an additional boiled egg for breakfast or an additional soup for dinner). In addition to that, my guide tried to convince me for some cheaper food all the time, because he could keep the money that was left over at the end. That was really annoying.But not all of it was negative. Despite all the things I didn't like about the guide, his behaviour towards me was usually friendly and he always paid attention that I would not leave anything behind (eg my camera). He also organised some rooms for me with a great view and he regularly asked me if I was fine. And the porter was a very nice guy.After all, I had high expectations in this trek because of the high price and the great promises made by Krishna of the office. But I'm disappointed now for all the reasons mentioned above and if I come back to Nepal, I definitely will not book with Ammonite again.So if you really want to book a trek through an agency, then look around in Kathmandu / Thamel. As I now know there are agencies whose price is 25% lower than Ammonite's price for exactly the same tour!Or instead do a trip all on your own without a guide, which means more fun, more freedom and also a lot of money to save. Especially for the main treks you don't need a guide to show you the way, and then you don't have to bother with an annoying guide (but there surely are nice guides, too!)."

Charming, humorous, and the guy who can make anything happen (weather permitting). I was short on time and wanted to leave for my trek the next day. All other companies said I could leave in two or three days, but Krishna said I could leave the next day, and for the best price I'd seen in any other trekking company I'd found. Guide, food, flight, paperwork, accommodation, guide health insurance, abd transport to and from the airport. It was an easy sale. They even let me store my non-trekking stuff in their office. Sadly my flight was canceled the next day and they rebooked it for me with a promise if it was canceled again he would make sure I made it to the mountain that day. Fast forward ten days later, I made the flight, got to Everest Base Camp and was so sick from altitude sickness they got me a helicopter down from the mountain to Kathmandu, got me into a wonderful hospital, and Krishna personal met me as the ambulance pulled in. I've travelled quite a bit, tried a lot of services, but never have I ever felt so much like family. They were truly wonderful and I'm so grateful to Krishna and Rajesh for looking after me.

They organised a 16-days trek to EBC via Gokyo including flight to Lukla, meals, guide, porter, accommodation and pick-up from our guest house for a very, very good price. Mr Krishna (the other owner) even promised us that if we could find a similar trip for the same price, we would get the trip for free.The trip turned out to be perfectly organised, we had absolutely no trouble, and it is worth mentioning that Ammonite is a responsible company that provides their guides and porters with a descent salary as well as rescue and medical insurance (a very important point in my opinion). I will definitely use Ammonite again if (or rather when) I go back to Nepal as well as recommend it to anyone who's looking for an unforgettable experience."

We'd a tight schedule to arrange everything for the trek and we asked multiple travel agencies. When we were walking from one agency to an other we met Krishna, he invited us for a cup of tea and offered us a package for the trek. In the beginning we were a bit suspicious because the price was way cheaper, but we decided to book our trek at Ammonite. The next morning the taxi was perfectly on time (this was one of my concerns) and the trek was just amazing. During our trek Krishna even called us to ask if everything was OK. I would definitely recommend to book your trekking at Ammonite."

Our guide Suresh for the trip was very accommodating. My travel partner was ill on the first day and he adapted out travel schedule accordingly. I'd recommend our trip summiting poon hill to everyone. It was tough on day 2 and 3 but you don't want to say you've hiked in the Himalayas and it be a walk in the park. Trust ammonite. The owner, staff and guides are great people and great it really is a company. They even bought us a souvenir afterwards when we returned. I'll be returning to Nepal soon for some more trekking and I'll be using ammonite to organise my itinerary for the full Annapurna circuit when I do.Peace out trekkers."

I had a really amazing trip to Nepal in last December 2015, it started when we met Rajesh in Thamel, you took us to Ammonite Adenture agency, and we met Krishna who i'd like to call \"The Guy who knows a guy that knows another guy\", he has numerous connections that helped to arrange our trip and many other trips we saw him arranging when were visiting his office.We just told him three words \"Rafting, Chitwan, Trekking\".Then next day in the morning, we took the tourist bus out of Kathmandu, then got of beside Tirshuli River to start rafting with Bishal Sunar, a very nice and modest guy. and we had a very good experience in rafting although it was our first time and we stayed in a good hotel for the night.Next day we went to Chitwan National Park, which was a nice experience riding canoe in the mist between crocodiles, walking into the jungle, riding elephant into the jungle again, and watching cultural dances in the town theater.Then we left Chitwan with our good memories to Pokhara to meet our super nice super honest guide Santosh Paryir, whom we loved to Trek with for 4 days.Trekking was a real fun to me were we walked Nayapool-Ulleri-Ghoripani-Tadapani-Ghandruk then back to Nayapool.Weather was so cold, but we enjoyed the Trek so much and we wished to have the full Annapurna base camp trek, but I think it will be in our next visit in Nepal and with Ammonite Adventure.When we arrived back to Kathmandu, we decided to have another trek in Kathmandu valley so we asked Krishna again to arrange something for us and he did.We had 3-days/2-night trek to Sundrijal-Chisopani-Nagarkot-Dhulikhel and Old heritage city Panauti and Newar people neighborhood, this was with Suneel, the calm and energetic guide guide who showed us his own home town Panauti.I'd really recommend this agency for your next trip in Nepal. we had a really good price and the trip really worth it."

Passang made sure we were always comfortable, walking at a good slow pace to keep our energy and he ordered our food for us as well as the occasional special treat like Buffalo chilli yum yum. He also provided fresh cut fruit every night or morning as a treat for us which was lovely. Our accommodation was very comfortable with hot water, wifi and warm beds every night.We also asked Passang if we could head to the hot springs as we really wanted to go and he helped alter there itinerary to accommodate our request which was well worth it!!!

Our trek to Abc started from nayapul and then to ulleri, ghorepani, tadapani, shinuwa, duerali, and then to Annapurna base camp, we traveled back down and spent a night in bamboo before reaching the hot springs in jhinu. Along the way our guide stopped to explain many things to us, flowers and plants, local customs and agricultural techniques as well as the certain religious significances each place held. Our guide, Pasang, was extremely friendly and very knowledgeable. The pace was very slow and steady, quite safe.

It was such a memorable experience!I walked in to Krishna while shopping in Thamel. He guided me to his office and we went over some trekkings. I wasn't sure yet which trekking I wanted and I asked him to call me two weeks later, since I was busy with volunteer work at the time. He did as I asked, and after checking with some other companies, Ammonite looked like the best option, since it was a more personal approach and we got a fair price.We were invited to the office to go over the trek once more, and later that week we could meet our tour guide, Rajan. He would come with us to Pokhara by tourist bus. Everytime we went to the office, everyone there was really friendly, and although we joked around a lot, it stayed very professional.Rajan was a great guide. From the morning in Kathmandu when we took the bus, up untill the moment he helped us find a taxi to go back home, he was both friendly and professional. During the trekking he carried our stuff (we probably took too much, but he didn't complain) and gave us information about the places, the culture, and most importantly, the mountains. He made us feel safe during the trek at all time. He stayed behind us most of the time, so he could always be sure that we were allright, and we didn't feel rushed at all. When we were tired, we could rest if we wanted to. Looking at other trekking parties during the trek, we felt like we had the best guide of them all!You start off with a guide you barely know, and you leave as friends! And a great trekking experience of course!"

Unfortunately i fell ill on EBC trek and had to return to Kathmandu on the 5th day. I seen Krishna in Thamel again and being impressed by our initial conversation he provided information on some shorter treks that would align with my partner returning from EBC. Krishna suggested I trek the Annapurna circuit with the high point being Poon Hill at 3200m and being able to view 2 peaks over 8000m, Annapurna 1 and Dhaulagiri. The trek was 4 days starting in Pokhara bussing to Nayapul then walking to Ulleri. Ulleri to Ghorepani. At Ghorepani we woke early and watched the sunrise at Poon Hill. The weather was spectacular. Perfect views of Annapurna and Dhaulagiri and other beautiful mtns. We than walked Ghorepani to Ghandruk. Ghandruk back to the bus stop and way back to Pokhara.My guide Pasang Sherpa was nothing short of excellent. He made sure I had enough water, plenty of rest breaks, always made sure i was comfortable, extremely knowledgeable of the mountains, culture and of course, trekking. He even cut up fruit every night to have after my evening meal! The accommodation was very comfortable with hot water, wifi and warm beds every night. I enjoyed the food greatly.

I cannot speak for all the guides and porters as this is where an experience can go from bust to greatness, but I can speak on Pemba and Kumar. They made our trip amazing. Here are the reasons why you should ask for Pemba and Kumar:1. I have never seen both of them without a smile.2. Pemba would always walk on the unsafe side protecting his clients from anything bad from happening. He always had safety on his mind. He also knows where there can be rock and land slides and would always stop us before, explain, and then we would cruise through the dangerous areas.3. The service was top notch. Anything we wanted, he would not hesitate to get. 4. Kumar, the porter, was never out drinking or misbehaving. I saw some porters who were not reliable and thus your bags and belonging may not be traveling right with you.5. He actually cared, yes it was a job for him, but you an see he really loves it and is excited for you to have a good time. He saw him on the cliff ledge waiting to make sure our plane came and we boarded safely. It as nice to give him one last final wave before boarding the plane.Thus, in conclusion. If you hike with Ammonite, ask for Pemba and Kumar. You will not be disappointed."

We had originally planned to trek on our own as my boyfriend had done the trip 10 years ago. However, when we weighed our backpacks in our hotel room in Kathmandu, we made a last-minute decision to get a porter. The choice of tour companies in Thamel was overwhelming but we were won over by Krishna's friendliness, professionalism and expertise. We had already planned our itinerary and he was not at all pushy about changing it, unlike some other companies. He made us a cup of masala tea in his office then simply made a phonecall and organised for a porter to meet us at Lukla airport the next day! Our porter (Kancha Lama) was outstanding. He was a very generous man with a good sense of humour. He told us the names of all the mountains and taught us about Nepali culture and a few words (the most useful phrase was \"please go slowly\" - \"bistali bistali\"!). He chose some excellent teahouses and always checked that we were happy with our rooms. He was a very experienced porter and knew the routes well, which was reassuring as even though we had our own maps, there were a couple of tricky sections, such as crossing the morraine from Gokyo to Thangnag. I did one section of the trip on my own (Lobuche to Everest Base Camp) with Kancha Lama and felt perfectly comfortable doing this as a single female. Overall, we had an amazing time in the mountains and based on our experience, we would recommend Ammonite."

At the end of our trek, our private cab that we paid for was not waiting for us and 45 minutes later we ended up having to take a private cab back to our hotel. Upon arriving back at our hotel we tried to explain the situation to Mr. Krishna Bahadur, who, despite the extremely poor service still demanded full payment. The guide who was with us at the hotel even had the nerve to demand a tip after basically not doing his job for the entire day. I would never recommend this company to anyone. Also FYI for those interested in this trek, a guide and travel company which charges around 100 USD is not necessary for this trip and can easily be done alone for about 30 USD."

Guide 'Pasang' was very friendly and nice person and taught me lots of Nepali language, culture, information about mountain and food as well. He took care of me a lot especially when I felt tired or had fast breathe. Even night time he checked my room is ok, safe, not cold and enough blanket. I got a cold during my trip because I was not used to winter weather in Nepal, So he recommend me many folk remedy such as gargling with warm salt water, drinking hot lemon ginger tea with honey. Also he helped to find good price accommodation for my economic condition. Besides, I was a female traveler, I was worrying about the safety problem, I had no problem at all thanks to 'Pasang' Guide. Thanks a lot Ammonite Adventure & Treks! If anyone looking cheep and good service, I'd like to recommend this company."

            "review": "Mediocre and Ambivalent Experience. My friends and I had just completed a 5-day trek to Poon Hill with Ammonite. We knew that Ammonite was a young company of only two years old, but we were very impressed with the reviews on Tripadvisor, and had heard about Ammonite from our friends. Thus, it was highly unfortunate that our experience was a subpar one, mainly led down due to a highly unprofessional guide, Krishna. Our trekking experience was saved by Suresh and his fellow porters, while Sovit had provided stellar services in Kathmandu itself. I will provide a summary of my group's experiences with them, so that you can make a better judgment on Ammonite.AIRPORT TRANSFER:(i) Kathmandu Airport to HotelAmmonite had promised airport transfer to us. Unfortunately, when we had arrived at the airport, we could not find the sign for Ammonite anywhere. The other tour agencies at the airport were not too helpful either - they had not heard of Ammonite. We had also tried contacting them on their contact number, but it was unfortunately met with a \"wrong number\" response. Alas, we simply decided to take a cab to their office, hoping that they may be legit.Thankfully, Suresh was sitting in the office and had informed us that Sovit was trying to find us at the airport. There was a miscommunication over the timing (though we had made it clear to them our flight timing via e-mail) and it was highly unfortunate that we had to take a cab down. Nonetheless, when Sovit finally arrived, he apologised profusely over the incident.(ii) Pokhara Hotel to Pokhara Bus BayUnfortunately, for this leg of the transfer, Krishna had informed us that we had to walk from the hotel in Pokhara to the bus bay. It was a good 15-20 minutes walk from the hotel (we knew it because we decided to walk to the International Mountaineering Museum in Pokhara), but Krishna insisted it was only a 5-minute leisurely walk. When we had informed him that the package explicitly stated that \"all necessary transport will be covered\", he was left without any proper explanation, and tried to dismiss it by saying that we simply need to pay 200 rupees each to get to the tourist bus bay.When we arrived back in Kathmandu, his partner Sovit was surprised by this - as he had passed money to him for the transportation for us between the Pokhara Hotel and the Bus Bay. Thus, please ensure that you carry all your e-mail correspondences with you, as you never know whether all details have been properly communicated to the guides and partners in Ammonite.(iii) Kathmandu Hotel back to the AirportThankfully, the ride from the Kathmandu Hotel back to the Airport was uneventful.ACCOMMODATION:Ammonite had chosen a variety of hotels and guesthouses for us over the trip. Most of them were decent and they do seem to provide value for money. However, it was highly unfortunate that for the hotel that they had chosen for us in Kathmandu, it was mosquito-infested and had no electricity till about 10pm. The only saving grace is that it was located in Thamel - right in the heart of Kathmandu. Thus, if you were to book a trip with Ammonite, please do tell them what are some of the stuffs you would like to avoid in a hotel. Surely a one-star hotel may still be decent enough not to be mosquito-infested.TREKKING + GUIDE EXPERIENCE:On this trip, we were accompanied by Suresh and Krishna to Poon Hill. Poon Hill has often been rated as an easy trek - however, note that we think it may actually be a moderate trek due to the many steep slopes that you may encounter along the way. A good stamina is necessary - so do prepare for it. Your preparation would indeed reward you with an awestruck view of the Annapurna region.On the first day, we found it a rather odd decision by Krishna to rest for the day after two hours of trekking from Naya Pul. He said that it was better to have 7-hour of trekking the next day, and rest for the day instead. While this is our first time trekking, we cannot help but noticed that it was still rather early in the day (mind you, it was 1.30pm), and was horrified at the suggestion that one ought to do 7-hour worth of trekking the next day instead.As a group, we decided to make the decision not to follow Krishna's advice, and carry on trekking instead. This decision proved to be the right one - as it had been a challenging trek up 3000 stairs - and one cannot imagine how painful it would be if the group had to do this flight of 3000 steps, followed by the trek to Ghorepani on Day 2. When we got back to Kathmandu, we had informed Sovit of this rather odd decision - only to be informed that he had also thought it was an odd decision and that Krishna was simply being lazy.On Day 2 of the trek to Ghorepani, Suresh provided excellent commentaries on the various mountains, history of Nepal and current political situations. He demonstrated a high level of trekking competence, as well as knowledge of the trees and jungles. In fact, it was a very enriching cultural exchange that Suresh had provided - and I would always remember this trip for the sincerity and professionalism that Suresh demonstrates. He is a valuable asset to Ammonite.By contrast, Krishna proved to be rather incoherent in the speaking of the English language, and had often interrupted Suresh whenever the latter was speaking. When we had asked Krishna for information about the vegetation in the area, \"what type of plant is this?\", we were greeted with a shocking response with \"this is a plant\". We tried to ask him again to ensure that he understood our question well - but again, he greeted us with \"this is called a plant\". It does not take a first-grader to tell you that a tree is a plant - but unfortunately, Krishna found it fit to provide us with such humiliating response and he had laughed at our question. Instead, he found every opportunity to appear in photographs - so that he can use it for the company's publicity purposes.On Day 3 of the trip, one of my friends had fallen ill and was running a high fever. Krishna and Suresh were alerted to it - and they knew about it as we had decided to take multiple rests along the trip from Poon Hill downwards to Tadapani. Suresh had tried to keep a lookout for my friend as much as possible - and had even accompanied him for most part of this leg of the trip. However, it came to a point when he can no longer carry on walking and needed evacuation.Unfortunately, this is where Ammonite needs to improve on the evacuation plans. We had pleaded with Suresh and Krishna to find the fastest way to evacuate our friend to the next resting place or hospital. Alas a heli-evacuation was not possible as we were in an area that is too low an altitude for helicopters to land. Instead, a pony-evacuation was necessary. Instead of alleviating the situation, however, Krishna decided to shift the blame to everyone else for not informing Suresh or himself about our friend's situation. This was highly unprofessional and disturbing - both guides knew that our friend was already not feeling well, but decided that of all times, when our friend was feeling unwell, finger-pointing was necessary. This made for a very unpleasant trekking experience.When Suresh sensed our rather unmotivated feeling, he encouraged us to carry on with the trek and enjoy the many sights and sounds that Nepal has to offer. This was indeed uplifting - though our hearts and minds were clearly with our friend who was being evacuated at that moment.On Days 4 and 5 of the trek, we experienced the places of Tadapani, Ghandrung and Ghandruk. They were very lovely places to stop and rest, and experience the cultures of the mountain people. Unfortunately, Krishna saw fit to be spending half the time on the trek carrying an umbrella and speaking over his mobile phone. He had chosen to go on a wanderlust of his own - walking far ahead of the group of 8, with Suresh and the back. At some points, our group was lost as to where to head to - as Krishna had walked far too quickly ahead. Certainly this is very unprofessional of a guide - not only to be speaking on the mobile phone for a prolonged period of time, but failing to demonstrate care and concern for his trekking group. Fortunately, Suresh and his porters had provided the directions from the back of the group.Later that night, Krishna (who probably had a drink too much) engaged in a song and dance - and saw it fit to taunt us with some odd songs. We asked Suresh what was he singing about - but Suresh, given his nice nature, refused to translate it for us.Overall, the trekking experience was a very memorable one. To be able to experience the sights and sounds of the mountain people through the perspective of a competent guide was very valuable. Indeed, the Poon Hill trek was itself a stunning beauty - and I would advise anyone to do this trek if they are heading to Nepal. However, Krishna has significantly marred the experience - and it was highly unfortunate that Suresh had to do damage-control for all of the above incidents.POKHARA EXPERIENCEIn Pokhara, we had wanted to arrange for a vehicle to bring us around for the entire day. We had decided to entrust Krishna with this task. He charged us an exorbitant 6000 rupees for the whole day. However, on the actual day itself, the bus driver had informed us that he would only bring us to five selected locations in Pokhara, and it only lasted for three-four hours. We were shocked, as we had paid good money for it.When we had arrived back in Kathmandu, we had informed Sovit about this experience. We were shocked to hear from him that a usual rental costs only 3200 rupees for the entire day - not a sub-par experience of 6000 rupees for a few hours. He had informed us that we may have been fleeced by Krishna.Krishna also saw it fit to be pushy and sell a paragliding package to my friend. While it is perfectly normal for tour guides to push other products, Krishna thought that it would be a good idea to keep pushing the product even though he had already said no.Thus, please do be careful about a possibly dishonest guide - not just with Ammonite, but any travel agency in Nepal.OVERALL:I would think that I would experience the same level of enthusiasm, honesty and professionalism that the many reviews below had suggested. Alas, I am unfortunately ambivalent about it. In some ways, I did experience the magic that the many reviews had suggested - in the form of very competent guides in Suresh and Sovit. The sights and sounds that Nepal offered had also contributed to this memorable experience. However, it was significantly marred by a very unprofessional guide - enough to make me think twice and think seriously the next time I get a cheap tour package from a young travel agent firm. Ammonite has so much going for them - I wish them all the best in trying to indeed, stay honest and trustworthy. Indeed, these virtues had been lost on one particular guide."

Their previous training as guides in Nepal have provided them with huge amount of knowledge for all the treks and activities in Nepal. While other companies provided me with generic routes to trek EBC and Annapurna Circuit, Sovit and Krishna tailored a specific route with side trails according to my interest. The amount of details and creativity to their plan in addition to offering me a good value convinced me to do two treks in one month with Ammonite. When I was sick after trekking EBC; thereby, delaying the start and end dates for Annapurna Circuit, Sovit and Krishna immediately took care of all the bookings and date changes, making sure I recover first before starting again. For both of my treks, my guide Birkha is extremely knowledgeable and his attention to details, ranging from the weather condition all the way to my meals, are especially appreciated. Overall, an unforgettable experience in Nepal, thanks to Ammonite. Sovit and Krishna have become more than just businessmen, they have become my friends in Nepal! Highly recommended to those who are looking for a company to organize or help plan itinerary in Nepal."

My partner and I have just arrived in mainland China after an awesome trip to Tibet from Kathmandu.We can't fault the guys at Ammonite and hope they remain as enthusiastic and trustworthy as we have found them to be!Tours are never 100% value for money, we've recently taken tours in Mongolia and DPRK and learned to keep our expectations low - this tour was no exception (and to be fair Ammonite will tell you exactly the same - to avoid disapointment keep your expectations of the guide low!): The first night could have been much better in Zhangmu, the breakfasts (included) were very poor, we had to pay extra for heat in the rooms we stayed in (tibet is very cold) and the train fare was twice what it should have been! All of these issues and more were beyond the control of Ammonite and the guide on hand was dismissive of our complaints. Ammonite don't personally arrange the tours and the guide is a cog in the wheel between agencies in Nepal and Tibet so as a customer you have little control.With this in mind and the expense of the tour I don't know if it's possible to get value for money BUT if you really want to travel from Nepal through Tibet these guys will do everything in their power to ensure you get the tour you want and at as reasonable a price as it's possible to find. We had 9 days in Tibet, we saw all that a westerner is allowed to see and the train into China was awesome. I wouldn't do it again but I'm glad I went.The guys at Ammonite really looked after us - even helped us arrange our independent trekking permits without charge, simply the most honest travel agency I have encountered in 12 months travelling Asia!"

I'm glad we went with them over others."

            "review": "First time to Nepal, had a great experience. I visited Nepal from 2nd October to 10th October 2016. As it was my first time trekking in 10 years, I booked a trek with Above The Himalaya. The owner of the company, Puru, was very responsive through email, and made the entire process very easy.On the day I arrived, Immigrations took about an hour to clear. Despite the long delay, the driver was still waiting at the airport to pick me up. If you've never been to Kathmandu airport, it's pretty chaotic. It's nice that I didn't have to navigate my way over to my lodging after a 12 hour journey.The second day was a tour around Kathmandu, visiting three famous temples. Note that you have to pay the entry fees for these temples (as stated in the itinerary). Just for your information, the ticket fees were 200 Rs, 250 Rs and 1000 Rs, so bring enough cash and small change. My guide was Kumuda, and he was very knowledgeable about the history of the temples and various landmarks in Kathmandu.I have a back injury from military training a decade ago (annular tear), so decided to go with an easy trek (Annapurna Panorama View Trek; Nayapul to Ghandruk, then to Jhinu Danda, then to Pothana, then back to Pokhara). My guide and porter were Bassu and Sorus, and they were a pleasure to be with. The first day's hike was from Nayapul to Ghandruk. I am reasonably fit, but there were way more stone steps than I expected. Those of you with back injuries will know that this is bad news. At Ghandruk, Bassu came up with a new itinerary to avoid too many steps. We thus changed the remainder of the trek to Pothana, Sarangkot then Pokhara. Bassu was thus able to turn what would have been a miserable experience into something memorable and enjoyable.One regret I had was not bringing enough cash. I've just recently graduated from grad school (which was the reason for the trip) and was trying to spend as little as I could. But seriously, it felt ridiculous that I was privileged enough to travel yet still tried to scrimp on things like tea. I'd advise you to bring more cash, and in small denominations. Many of the villagers can't make change for large notes. You can use your large denominations in the supermarkets in the city before you start your trek. If, however, you're really tight on cash, be sure to check how much things cost before you use them. E.g. Wifi and hot showers cost about 100 Rs at the altitude I was at, and I didn't know until the next day when my guide told me before we left for our next checkpoint."

I booked Everest Panorama Trek with Above the Himalaya Trekking, I also did tour in Kathmandu including Bhaktapur, Patan, Boudhanath Stupa and visited Dhulikhel and Pokhara including sunrise view from Sarangot. All was arrange by Above the Himalaya Trekking (Mr Puru Timalsena). Everything was well organized and all my requests were met and exceeded. If I go to Nepal again (and I will), I will book the trip with Above the Himalaya Trekking. Most people go to Nepal for trekking, the landscape is amazing, and the experience is life changing. However, Nepal offers more than trekking, Kathmandu valley have more UNISCO World Heritage sites than any country in the world. Walking in Kathmandu Durban Square, Bhaktapur, or Patan is like walking into an open museum. Also if you cannot do trekking in the mountains, you can drive to one of the hill station near Kathmandu like Nagarkot, Sarangkot, Dhulikhel and watch sunrise/sunset over the peaks of the Himalayas. In this trip I stayed in a hotel in Dhulikhel (recommended by Mr Puru) where the view is amazing overlooking terrace gardens and the Himalayan peaks in the background; adding to view, the sounds of birds singing, it is so serene. If you like more adventure, you can go on Safari in Chitwan, you can do rafting, Paragliding, and many more activities. Don\u2019t get discourage to visit Nepal by the earthquake of 2015, Nepal is very safe, only old historic buildings seen damage but hotels and new buildings are mostly untouched. Nepal is very cheap, the people of Nepal are very friendly, and honest. Nepal is a wonderful place not only for trekking, but also for vacation."

We considered changing out plan to go there in a few years and do somewhere else instead for our Christmas/New Year trip. However we decided that it would be better to support the Nepalese community now with our tourist dollars, rather than wait until things started to get back to normal, and I'm glad we did.I looked at lots of different companies to run a tour for my wife and I, and decided that we would prefer a local company rather than one based here in Australia. Not only were they cheaper, but to have true locals organising and running the tour I thought would be the better option, and I'm confident it was. From the get go Puru was excellent at helping me sort out our overall itinerary, advising what we should do each day, where we should go etc. I honestly left it all to Puru, when we arrived I didn't even know the name of the hotel we were staying at the first night - that was the amount of trust I had in his ability - and he deserved it.My wife and I had a total of 15 days traveling, including a 5 day trip in the middle to Bhutan. My advice to everyone is if you're going all the way to Nepal, spend a few days in Bhutan as well. It's very expensive there (because it's all run by the government) but the experience is definitely worth it.At all times we were extremely happy with our drivers and guides, who were always knowledgeable, polite, helpful and willing to change plans to suit what we wanted to do.I have no hesitation in recommending people to book with Above the Himalaya."

We contacted Puru through his website & found him to be excellent in his speed & clarity of communication through email.There was just myself & my wife & he arranged the whole trip well. Sadly, due to weather conditions we had to cancel the EBC trek & switch to ABC which he arranged within hours. As it was my wife's birthday on the day we were due to fly to Lukla he, very kindly & unexpectedly, took us out to dinner with his wife & son to a traditional Nepalese retaraunt that we would never have discovered.The next day we flew to Pokhara with our guide Purna & met our porter Sumain. Purna & Sumain were both brilliant ar their jobs & excellent company throughout the trek. The ABC trek was excellent & we soon forgot the disappointment of not being on our 1st choice.For those of you that aren't sure about whether to hire guides & porters, I would really recommend that you do. Apart from employing people who know what they're doing, having someone who understands the language & customs is invaluable - plus Purna was an expert at queue 'management' at the airport!!!We plan to return to Nepal in November/December 2016 to have another go at EBC & will be using Above The Himalaya again without hesitation.I'll be in touch soon Puru................."

There are a lot of trekking companies in Nepal and when I researched this companies reviews were impeccable so didn't need to go far at all. Thank you for making our trip 10 out of 10."

In rapid email succession we defined an attractive two-week program with a car and driver assigned to us full-time. The first four days in and around Kathmandu, spending nights also in Nagarkot (view of the distant Everest if it weren't foggy) and Godawari (Botanical Garden and a splendid rice-paddy view from the hotel). Lots of Hindu and Bhuddist temples with a very informative guide. Then two days at Chitwan National Park (a somewhat commercial place where the main excitement is to ride an elephant to disturb a sleeping rhino, but a full day canoeing plus birding drive back were excellent activities) with a very knowledgeable birding guide. Then a long but beautiful drive through the Terai to Koshi Tappu where one lodges in a very pleasant \"tent\" (more like a bungalow with a fully equipped bathroom) and then a day bird watching there, with again a very good and pleasant guide. We scored 95 species, many new to us. The 11-hour drive back was long but spectacular going over the mountains south-west of Kathmandu. The driver was extremely safe and very nice. Upshot: also arthritic elders who can't trek anymore are well-advised to use Puru's company."

This company delivered for us.At the inquiry stage, the company was very efficient in providing information about our desired Langtang area trek, which helped us decide to pay for our own lodge accommodation and food (they looked after permits, transport, our suitcases while we were on trek, and guide and porter). They provided a great team of guide and porter \u2013 Gyan and Mani were superb in their roles, helpful at all times, and were very accommodating and caring when we had our colds during the trek. We hope to come back to Nepal for a longer time. If we are able to do this, we would be very glad to have Gyan and Mani to help us again. They were professional at all times and, took safety issues very seriously. We were impressed by how they checked in with the company wheneve they could (if we had been on the Annapurna circuit a few days later in October, this would have been absolutely crucial - good communication between office and guides can keep you, the trekker, alive). The jeep transport was a good solution to the nature of the Dunche road, and the two drivers there and back were skillful and alert. Considering the buses we saw, the road covered, and the two recent bus accidents with multiple deaths, we thought we had very good value (transport from door of Kathmandu valley accommodation and back). Think of the jeep expense as a safer and more predictable flight, compared to flying to Lukla.Possible improvements \u2013 our combined load for our porter was less than 20kg (and Gyan and Mani could see/feel this when they came to pick us up), but it may help the company to weigh the loads before starting (and also for trekkers to weigh beforehand their potential loads for porters).What would we do next time: Go for shorter walking days with less altitude gain, especially going from the road at Shyapru up to Langtang village. Far better to spend more time enjoying the great scenery of the Lantang river gorge and cataract, and the surrounding forest. One of things we enjoyed most was the day walk from Tholo Syabru along the \u2018easy\u2019 route through Brabal to the road at Tholo Bharkhu (we did this because we had been delayed with colds). The route had very few trekkers, and some of the best scenery of the trek \u2013 forested and with views up the Trisuli valley into Tibet, and across to Paldor and Ganesh Himal."

His English is excellent and provided detailed answers to questions. He was also very understanding and accommodating of our changing itinerary, dates, and complicated logistics. Trips:We did 2 trips through Above the Himalaya. First we did a Kathmandu Valley site seeing trip. He provided us with an excellent driver and a nice car at reasonable price that made for an enjoyable and efficient day. The second trip was Tibet Overland Tour--8 days, Kathmandu to Lhasa. Although his company (being based in Nepal) cannot run trips into China, he set us up with a good tour partner in Tibet and handled all of the complicated logistics (including very complicated Chinese visa issues). Most noteworthy, he fought for us with the China tour operator when they overcharged us for train tickets from Lhasa into the rest of China. When he couldn't get them to refund us he personally refunded the overcharge. This was way above and beyond what he had to do, and made us feel wonderful about the whole experience, especially working with him. We would definitely travel with Above the Himalayas again if we return to this part of the world. Thanks Puru!"

I searched on the Internet and found Above Himalayan Trekking. I spoke over telephone many times with Puru, Managing Director and asked to arrange the trip for 25 days. Puru was young man of late twenties at that time, and I was not certain. But, he arranged trekking guide, Phurwa Sherpa, climbing guide, Lakupa Sherpa, both are reliable and I was satisfied finally. Since I was 60 years old and it was my first trip to Nepal, I gave up at 5,900m at limit of my power. It was unforgettable days. Years later, I tried Lobche East 6,100m, a trekking peak located west of Lobche village on the way to Mt. Everest, and asked Puru to arrange 1 person trip for 25 days. The trekking guide was Phruwa Sherpa, same as before, and climbing guide was Cetem Sherpa, a resident of Lobche. This time, with their suitable support, I climbed to 6,070m, almost summit, and safely returned. It was very satisfactory. In this November, I am planning with Puru 17 days trip with members of my mountain club to climb Naya Kanga 5,850m, Yala Peak 5,520m, located in Lantan Valley."

Above the Himalaya is an excellent company for organizing my short and tight plans in Kathmandu and Nagarkot.Mr Puru Timalsena is very prompt and efficient in communication and arrangement. I have to say that I am a very naggy, experienced and extreme picky traveller. He had ensure that all my arrangement and requests are up to my expectations. My trip in Kathmandu and Nagarkot is only 1.5 days. I managed to complete 95% of my sightseeing plans with the great, humble and experience nice driver \"Ram\". Though I requested for a female tour guide and end up having a male tour guide, I am alright with it as he is a very patient and nice male tour guide too.The price quoted to me was also very good. None of the operators were able to quote such rates except for one or two. However, I decided to take \"Above The Himalaya\" as Mr Puru has impressed me a lot.Last but not least, it was an overall pleasant and great experience with the combination of all in Nepal. If I ever come back to Nepal again or any of my friends to visit Nepal, I will definitely approach and recommend this company to anyone.Puru, thank you very much for everything!"

No other web based company came anywhere near matching Puru for communication.Once arriving in Kathmandu we met our guide Basu. We immediately felt comfortable with Basu and he reviewed our trekking clothing/equipment and went with us to Sportswear International to hire sleeping bag and down jacket, plus purchase a few items we still needed.Basu had a chat to us about how to enjoy the trek - stay clear of meat, drink 5 litres of water a day, trek steadily but not fast and give way on the inside (not outside) to animals and porters carrying loads. Basu was extremely attentive to our needs and when my wife showed disappointment in her face at not getting a private bathroom in Namche he immediately changed our room to one with a private bathroom. I believe Above the Himalayas stayed at the better tea houses/lodges on the trek and Basu always tried to get us the best rooms He was extremely observant to how much we were eating, drinking and whether our walking pace was slowing. He also would always ask how we were feeling and if we had headaches.The trek was fantastic but we did have some health challenges early. At Namche my wife was feeling a bit nauseous and flat, and Basu advised that this was just adjusting to altitude and another day in Namche would do the trick - of course he was right.Then when trekking from Namche to Tengboche I struggled with a bacterial stomach bug and was unable to complete the days trek. Whilst resting at a tea house Basu contacted the closest doctor and the consensus was that if I didn't improve I needed to see the doctor. Basu was concerned that we were at a very small tea house and that if I got worse in the middle of the night there was nothing that he could do. As I didn't get better, Basu hired a horse and I was transported for 2 hours to Khunde/Khumjung to visit the doctor. Not a fun ride,but a wise decision. I had already started taking antibiotics that we had,and the doctor was reassuring in advising that I was taking the right medicine.That night, Basu talked to my wife and myself and said if we both did not start eating and get stronger, that it would be unwise to go higher where you really need your strength to handle the altitude and cold. We discussed an alternative trek.Miraculously the next morning I was much stronger and eating so we agreed to continue the trek to Tengboche on the proviso that any repeat of illness meant turning around. Fortunately we had extra days up our sleeve.Fortunately the next 2 days went well and Basu agreed we could complete the full EBC trek, arranging with Puru to have our flight from Lukla resecheduled - he was happy because he wanted a successful trek for us. It was fantastic as we got up above the treeline and the landscape changed, and we were surrounded by large snow capped mountains. To reach EBC and to do Kala Patthar were highlights.Note, we did come across others who had to turn around due to altitude issues - fortunately as we went higher we coped well with the altitude. As the trek went on, we got to know Basu better and he was great fun and liked to joke and laugh. We cannot thank Basu enough for making sure we had a great trek. Upon returning from the trek, Puru made sure we were happy and comfortable in Kathmandu before returning home. We cannot speak highly enough of Puru and Above the Himalayas."

Because communication with this company was sporadic and unclear, I switched to Above the Himalaya. Puru answered each email inquiry promply and clearly. Skype was also used for our conversations. I explained to Puru my idea of doing the Annapurna circuit on a solo basis. It was a risky journey for me. I am a 65 year old female post cancer and heart attack. So why would I choose such a challenging trip?...Puru matched me with guide/porter Suresh. We travelled together for 15 days/ I was free as a bird to listen and watch all around me because Suresh took care of all the details that might stress a foreign trekker. He carried my backpack, knew the quiet and clean lodges, expedited the meal orders, ensured tea stops and took care of all the paperwork at police checkpoints. These things were not my concern. He was my mentor in the ways of Nepali custom. I have the feeling that travelling in large groups takes away the capacity to hear and see the many subtleties in the environment. I remember the language and moods of the Nepali village people, the smells of the pine forest, the spring flowering trees and shrubs, the aromas of incense and simmering curries, and the roar of wind and rivers.Yes, I took away more than I expected from this journey. It was a challenging trek. But the satisfaction and education that I received was priceless! Without the support of AHT the journey would not have worked for me. THANK-YOU ABOVE THE HIMALAYAN TREKKING."

Actually, it before he became the manager of \"Above the Himalaya\" when he was still a guide. I will not extend my talking about how outstanding guide he was, because he is the manager now. Nevertheless I would talk about how reliable and responsible this man is. While me and my partners were trekking the Annapurna circuit, the civil revolution(taking the King's rights and founding a general government) started. During the trek, we almost haven't felt anything, but when we finished the trek at the city of Beni, we found that there was no transportation. Also, all the roads were under a curfew. Allegedly, our deal with Puru was suppose to end there. Beni is not a touristic city, without any English speakers, and it is very hard to get along there. Nevertheless, Puru didn't leave as. He found us place to sleep, and at the day, he lead us to a double day trek, from Beni to Pokara, with no extra charge! Puru stood by us when we were in a non-easy situation, and that I will never forget. Therefore, I believe that with the same decency he treated us, he manages his agency.I also believe that he hires outstanding guides, the same as he is. So, an unforgettable experience is guarantied.Have funEviatar Kheneviatarkhen at gmail.com"

We had a fantastic time and all that was arranged by Puru and his staff and guides worked out great. Our guide Vasu and porter Hari were always helpful and obliging and flexible to our requests, ability and schedule. They looked well after us for the whole six days. City guide Anju also gave us a good tour of the temples and stupas of Kathmandu. The transport arrangements were always on time. An arrangement at short notice for the flight over Everest to fit in with our schedule was also appreciated, it was the one time when we saw the full extent of the mountains. Unfortunately, whilst the weather was very good during the trek, the mountains were hidden most of the time in a haze, but at times they did pop out. So our timing was unfortunate. We were warned that this might happen toward the end of the season (second half of May), but it was the only time we had available this year. I hope to get back sometime to trek a bit further up into the mountains or do agreater part or all of the Annapurna circuit. So thanks to Puru for a well arranged holiday.

We appreciated his company and his sense of humour. It was thanks to his advises that we could extend our trek an make the trek to PoonHill in the limited time we had. It was a wonderful trek and we would do it the same way with Puru and Suresh anytime again. Actually,I hope we will be able to make a trip to Nepal next time with our children as well and for sure we will arrange the trek with Puru and Above the Himalaya. Puru and Suresh, thank you so much for our wonderful trek!"

We admire his organizational skills, knowledge of the country and most of all his caring attitude.Puru arranged for us to stay in the home of his parents in a remote village.

For my boys at ages of 22 and 20 it was a profound and life altering experience.We looked into several online trekking agencies and based on reviews decided to go with \"Above the Himalaya\". Puru made all the arrangements and it was all reasonable and went well. Our guide Drubha was great. Both he and the porters were good fun on the trial. I have spoken to many people who have gone it seems there are 5 aspects to the trip that most seem to share\u00b7Awesome mountains and scenery that really defy description\u00b7Tremendous beauty along the trail set in magnificent surroundings\u00b7The culture of the Sherpa people who live with little but are tremendously present, happy and full of joy. A living example of Mahayana Buddhism. \u00b7A profound inner experience in the midst of all of it. Whether you call it spiritual or appreciation of awe it's something that sticks with you.\u00b7The humility that accompanies strenuous hiking. It's seriously high altitude stuff that demands respect. From people having done both it demands more than the Inca trail or perhaps even climbing Kilimanjaro.Here's are links to the trek photo gallery to Kathmandu which is a cool stop both coming and going. http://jqphotos.zenfolio.com/everest_trekhttp://jqphotos.zenfolio.com/kathmandu"

Mr. Puru, the owner of the company, devised an itinerary for a two week tour of Nepal. The price included transfers, hotels, breakfast, car and driver, and sightseeing tours with a local guide in each location. The price was less than one would pay for a group tour. I would recommend his company to trekkers and non-trekkers alike. He was personally available to us for questions and to make sure we were satisfied.The personal service and the quality of the guides and the driver were even better than we expected. Our driver was a very careful driver -- a rarity in Nepal. He did not frighten us with his driving. If you have been on the highways in India and Nepal, you know how important this is. The guides, since it was a private tour, adjusted what we saw to our interests and our stamina.We spent time in Kathmandu, Chitwan National Park, Bandipur, and Pokhara. We saw a lot of animals, many fantastic old temples, and a couple of cultural dance shows. When we arrived, Mr Puru suggested that we make one change and fly back from Pokhara to Kathmandu. It was a great suggestion-- listen to his suggestions.D & MGeorgia"

If professional, personalized service with a local flavor is a high priority, Puru Timalsena\u2019s Above The Himalaya is the trekking company for you. Our trip started a year before we set foot in Nepal, searching for a good, reputable trekking company to handle all of the logistics of our trek. Our group of 5 friends had decided to tackle the challenging Everest High Pass Trek which, rather than following the main trail from Lukla up to Everest Base Camp (EBC) and back, follows a circuitous route off the beaten track to reach EBC. In the process, trekkers climb through three high passes (the Renjo la, Cho la and the Khongma la) with each topping out well over 17,000ft. Needless to say, finding a trustworthy company was a high priority for us.After reading guidebooks and searching through countless websites, we had narrowed our search down to a handful of companies. E-mail exchanges and phone conversations were next \u2026 and after skyping with Puru, our decision was made. Above The Himalaya offered favorable rates, experienced guides and porters, and the luxury of a private trek (which ensured the flexibility to change our trek as needed). We were not disappointed. Puru and his staff capably handled all of the logistics, from our arrival in Kathmandu to our departure 21 days later. Our guide, Phurwa Sherpa, was tremendous \u2026 always cheerful, always helpful, he and our porters made the trip the experience of a lifetime. When a snowstorm closed the Cho la the day before we were supposed to cross, Phurwa smoothly altered our itinerary without missing a beat and we still made EBC and Kala Pattar. He was an exceptional guide and, I think I can safely speak for all of five of us, a good friend.We had a fantastic experience and I would recommend Above The Himalaya to anyone considering trekking in Nepal."

Regardless of what you want to do - bungee, paragliding, rafting, trekking or just simply hiking you can count on the fact that Mr. Puru will provide you with the best options at a reasonable cost. And is always there to help you out if you ever get stuck (like he helped us out with alternate arrangements when our flights got delayed in Pokhra due to rains).So, if you want a pleasant hassle-free stay in Nepal with a helpful and trustworthy company, I'd recommend you go directly to Above the Himalaya Trek.- Sanchit, India."

I normally do not write reviews of trips I have taken, but my recent trip to Nepal with my daughter for her college graduation was so superior to any other that I had to put it into words. I do my diligence when booking trips and I was struck by the variety and diversity of trips offered by Above the Himalaya Trekking (P) Ltd. and by its managing director, Puru Timalsena. I started corresponding with him almost a year in advance of my May-June trip. He was always very responsive to my many emails and always offered good, sound suggestions for a successful trip. We had limited time 9 days which is very short for a country like Nepal. I had traveled to Nepal 3 times before in the 90\u2019s for business so I basically knew what I did and didn\u2019t want to see. It was my daughter\u2019s first trip there, so I really wanted it to be special. We were professionally met on time at the airport by Puru along with traditional Marigold traveler garlands. We stayed in a five star hotel while in Kathmandu. We were able to tour the whole Kathmandu valley with all of its temple sites with a wonderful tour guide, Koumara, who was well spoken in English and a wealth of knowledge about the Buddhist and Hindu cultures and religion. We also toured the walled city of Bhatkapur. We then flew on the Mountain flight past Everest and the rest of the Himalayan range. Then, a quick flight off to Pokhara, again all connections were met on time by representatives of the company. Due to the heat of the season and my health, we opted last minute, to change our trekking plans and remain in Pokhara. Puru completely altered our itinerary and within 1 hour our plans were changed to accommodate our new schedule. New tours were added and all worked seamlessly. All for only a nominal charge since we were adding nights in a good hotel and not staying in tea houses as originally planned. My daughter then flew on a Micro light aircraft into the Annapurna range, truly a once in a lifetime experience! We toured the Pokhara valley and explored around Fewa Lake, truly a beautiful calming place after the hustle and bustle of Kathmandu. We then again were met by our driver for our drive to Chitwan Park. While en route we had a wonderful white water rafting experience on the Trisulli River (Class 3). We saw the diversity of the countryside and the way of life of the people of the region, everything was so GREEN! After the raft ride we drove on to Chitwan Park. We stayed in a brand new hotel with beautiful grounds, rode camels and then elephants! We then saw an excellent cultural show of the Taru people, half dance and half martial arts! The next day our elephant safari was terrific, although no tigers were spotted, we saw Asian Rhino\u2019s and spotted deer and a multitude of birds. My daughter then went for an Elephant Bath, where you ride an elephant bareback into the river and you get the full elephant trunk shower experience! She then rode her elephant back into town. After a wonderful meal prepared by our hotel staff, we packed for our flight back to Kathmandu for our last evening in Nepal, again staying in a five star hotel. We woke already packed and did a final walking tour of the city to Durbar square and some last minute shopping. Again we were met on time and whisked off to the airport for our trip home to NYC. As a parting gift we were each given a silk scarf as a token of friendship and safe travel. I would recommend Above the Himalaya Trekking to anyone wishing to go to Nepal. The itineraries can be combined or custom designed by Puru and fit into any travel schedule. They also have well designed preplanned treks throughout the region. They are a responsible, professional, honest, safety conscious organization, which you can rely on when booking from continents away. His prices are extremely competitive and a great value. I have visited over 52 countries and have never had better service! Jeffrey Gaal, New York City, USA"

Mr Puru Timalsena was excellent from the very beginning, replying to me emails courteously and VERY quickly. He was able to organise the exact trek we wanted, when we wanted, and was very happy to work around my travel times and flight changes etc. We were absolutely at ease when being transferred to and from the bustling airport - our pickup simply waited for hours until our flight, which was late, arrived. It's comforting to know that they will simply wait for you, and not leave if your flight is late!While on the trek, one of our group experienced acute mountain sickness, and required a helicopter evacuation down to Kathmandu. A scary experience! We had the travel insurance to cover such an event, and both Puru and our Guide (who knew exactly what to do), organised everything so smoothly. The helicopter was called, the doctor was visited, and Puru dealt directly with our insurance company (he has experience in this department) and took care of EVERYTHING. It was completely 100% stress free, in a worst case scenario. On top of this, the trek itself was highly enjoyable, thanks to a great team of porters and our guide, who took excellent care of us and made sure we had a great time! (Oh, and Puru really gives you the best price around, which includes tours of Kathmandu and a traditional Nepalese dinner and entertainment at the end of the trek! Great value for money!).If you want peace of mind that you are getting an honest and reliable company when booking your next adventure in Nepal, choose Above the Himalaya. They really go above and beyond your usual trekking deal. If I ever go back, or visit the neighbouring Bhutan, there is no doubt I will be giving Puru a call to organise it!"

We hiked to Mount Everest base camp and up to Kalapathar with an exceptional guide, Phurba. Without going into detail we were forced to modify our route rendering out trip shorter by a few days, and Puru was incredibly kind to us, even giving us a refund on the island peak part of our trip that we were unable to do. Our hike was still an incredible success, made all the better by our guide who literally carried my bag when I was at my weakest (I had gotten sick in Lungden), held my hand when I was scared while walking on a skinny, windy exposed trail, and whipped out a never ending number of chocolate bars when my energy was low. He even went back out into awful weather as it was getting dark to go find our porter who had gotten lost, carrying all our gear including my stash of daily contact lens! Puru, the organizer, met us at the airport, installed us into our hotel in Kathmandu, ensured we were picked up for our cultural tour, prepared us for our trip both via many emails and then in person, and then kindly helped us out when we changed our itinerary mid way on our trek. There are so many variables when choosing this type of trip, one of which is finding a trustworthy company to help you fulfill your dream. Puru is reliable, knowledgable, has excellent guides and is fair and kind. Definitely the sort of company you can trust your life with. He still keeps in touch today which is how I learned that my original, and much lengthier review, had gone missing."

Puru at Above The Himalayas quickly organised a custom tour for me after just a couple of emails. One of his guides met me at the airport in Kathmandu and basically took care of all my needs until I left 2 weeks later.The hotel he arranged for the first night was fine and looked after the luggage I didn't take with me on the trek. My guide, Goki, took me around some of the outdoor shops to hire equipment and collected me from the hotel the next morning for our flight to Lukla. Bad weather at Lukla meant we sat around at the airport all day until the airline finally cancelled the flight. We tried again next morning and after a couple of hours delay we were on our way. Since there was just me and Goki we were able to move more quickly than the typical larger groups on standard tours. Trekking at altitude was noticeably harder than trekking at sea level but the stages were easily manageable in 4-6 hour days and we made up the day lost at the airport. The trekking was brilliant and the scenery fantastic. On our final ascent day we couldn't get to base camp because of bad weather. With no spare days in this custom itinerary we had to turn around and head down the mountain. We shaved a day off the already shortened descent time and flew out of Lukla a day earlier than planned. Puru arranged a sightseeing trip around Kathmandu to soak up the spare day and one of his staff collected me from the hotel and took me to the airport the next day.At all times Puru and his team were friendly and helpful with a \"can do\" attitude. The custom package he organised was exactly as I wanted it and competitively priced. I thoroughly recommend Above The Himalaya Trekking for your Everest and surrounding areas trekking. I also recommend building at least 2 or 3 extra spare days into your itinerary to allow for delays caused by bad weather or acclimatisation issues."

They helped me organise my trekking gear and arranged all transfers including pick up and return to the airport. They supplied me with the best trekking guide in Purna, who I am now happy to call one of my life long friends. Accommodation and meals were arranged along the way in teahouses, were the hosts were warm and accommodating. I was able to set the pace of the trek, as I am not the most atheletic person and sometimes struggle at high altitude, which was a blessing. On talking to my guide he advised he was able to tailor it to suit the trekker, so anyone who wanted a trek at a faster pace would also be in good hands.The length of the trek was perfect for me and I got to take in the amazing sights of this beautiful part of the world. The highlight for me would be reaching Namche Bazaar and seeing the setting sun over the Himalyas. I also loved the bakeries, as they had a great selection of pastries and biscuits, must haves after you've been trekking a few days.Chitwan National Park was three days of more natural wonders, again a guide was supplied and all transfers included. The accommodation was lovely, I had my own bungalow and the meals provided were always brilliant and a good menu on offer. Visiting the local people and going elephant bathing were the highlights.You can be sure when you book with Puru and his team that you will be well looked after and all tours are value for money."

Puru is a logistics master as well as leading an incrdedible staff to support all the wonderful adventures that can be arranged.Since that time, Puru and I have remained global friends as well as business schemers together. I have had the pleasure to revisit Katmandu last year and meet with Puru and his lovely whole family. While I was there working on my business project I came across a woman from Peru, she had landed in Katmandu without any organized service to assist her. She was not in a good state as she had found it quite difficult to feel comfortable with what she had found. I told her, \"you are in luck, I know just the Man\". I hooked her up with Puru, a week later she reported she was having the time of her life. She thanked me and stated the biggest difference was the feeling of trust. Thank you Puru!"

He was quick and precise with his responses no matter how many questions I had for him. Every little detail from our airport pick up to our guide for the Annapurna Panorama Trek was looked after for us. Not a single hitch in any of the itinerary and we were most pleased with his choices. We spent a few days initially in Kathmandu and did two day excursions that were extremely informative and interesting. We learned so much about the Nepalese people and their culture from our guide Purba on the trek. A three night stay in Chitwan National Park completed our vacation. Another worthwhile portion of our time in Nepal. We experienced the jungle through jeep safaris and rode elephants in search of rinos. Many thanks to Puru and his staff. Everyone was extremely professional and personable and we left feeling like we had made new friends. I would highly recommend Above the Himalaya for any arrangements that you might need in Nepal."

I arrived in Kathmandu without any plans and was somewhat suspicious after being approached by someone at the airport who accompanied me to Adventure Master's Office. I met with Santosh who explored my interests and offered several recommendations. I was pleasantly surprised that there were no high pressure sales tactics. Santosh encouraged me to think about it overnight and get back to him the next day. I did so, checked out Adventure Masters on TripAdvisor, did a little comparison shopping and decided on the 5 day 4 night trek. Santosh offered a better price than the competitors. I would be responsible for purchasing food and beverages on the trek. Everything else was included and provided. My guide Hira was excellent. He had a wealth of knowledge about life and trekking in the Himalayas, introduced me to many locals during the course of our trek and was a pleasure to be with. The trek was physically demanding but Hira paced us accordingly. Given that it was the beginning of monsoon season, there were only limited opportunities to view the peaks. I knew this when I signed up. Nevertheless, the opportunity to experience nature and the local culture made the trek one of the highlights of my trip. I would trek with Adventure Masters and Hira again in a heartbeat and highly recommend them."

He also arranged for us to meet Jangbu and himself the evening before our departure, and had an informal debriefing with us in his office after which was very professional. Our only criticisms are that he did not introduce himself as a trekking organisation but claimed to be from the hotel before leading to his trekking office. Also the evening before we departed he gave us a \"schedule\" that he had \"made\". This was actually a copy from another camping trekking companies website that was not relevant to our own plans. Other than these small problems we were happy with his service."

When we initially arrived in Kathmandu we were brought to the office where we met Santosh, who was very transparent and open about the treks and our options. He organized a perfect trip given the amount of time we had in Nepal, and we headed off the next day to Pokhara. Our guide (and later friend) Raj was incredibly helpful with each little detail of our trip, from when we got sick to finding the best food. Super reasonably priced and the best way to enjoy Nepal's beautiful nature!"

Everything was arranged for a very good price. We did the Mardi Himal trek with one guide and one porter. The guide was very professional and anticipated to all our requests. A very good experience. The porter was unbelievable. Dragging 25 kg for 80 km and the smile never went of his face. This was the best experience ever. I would recommend this organisation to everybody without doubt. Good job guys ! Thanks for all!"

The company was able to work with my limited schedule to make the trek quicker, but also enough to be enjoyable and safe. Prior to the trek I was given good advice on how to maximize my entire time in Nepal, while also having enough time to enjoy the trek. I had belongings that I did not want to bring with me on the trek and the company offered to store my bag with no extra charge until I returned to Kathmandu.Hiramani was my guide. He was very knowledgeable. I started to notice as the trek went on that other guides would ask him questions. I didnt have to worry about anything (accommation, getting my own water, when we would leave in the morning, etc). His top concern was safety. Doing a high elevation trek bring many challenges, but I was able complete the trek with absolutely no issues. I noticed some trekkers that decided to go without a guide made mistakes that effected their ability to finish the trek."

This is different from the typical tourist type of things I have done in the past and I would highly recommend it to someone who has two weeks or a little more to spend in nature. You can book through Adventure Master and ask for our guide, Hira. He will customize the trek to your needs and is very good at telling you what is best for you. I definitely needed his advice for certain parts of the trek. It is possible to trek on your own, but I would advise to have a guide for the first time. Especially someone like Hira who has done this trek over a hundred times and was able to go down the trails completely covered by snow and basically invisible without any problems."

This agency was responsible for our tour, we handcrafted our tour together according to our 14 days availability. Our agent - Santosh devoted a great deal of his time in discussing our primary interest in having a great trek experience. Santosh was great in handling all the arrangements to include our hotels, personal drivers, buses reservations, private tours and doing a follow up afterwords. He had explained to us about Nepal situation at the moment - the crisis of fuel, gas and eletricity which didn't almost affect us. Thanks Santosh for your warm smile.During our 4 days trek to Poon Hill we had one of our best experience ever!!! We were able to see beautiful views, contact the amazing Nepali people, experience their culture, food and happiness. Without question what made the difference in our trek was our private guide - BHARAT KUMAR which spoke very good English, he was friendly, polite, knowledgeable, patient and funny. We had a great 4 days with BHARAT ; ) He really stands out from the other guides, he was always walking behind/next to me making sure to help me if needed it, he patiently waited me to get my breath back whenever I needed it, he was kind to us and to Nepali people, we had great conversations during our trek, he taught us some Nepali words, the name of the trees and mountains, he also let my husband win every card game round. lololololo One thing I had missed in our experience which was the connection with other travelers, I guess it was because of our tight schedule. Poon Hill trek was beautiful and magical. It is a very tranquil trek with a great atmosphere. I was very impressed with the structure of the lodges and restaurants along the way. If you decide to do a tour in Nepal, I would recommend the following:1. Make sure to ask for Bharat as guide ; )2. Learn to say Namaste/Bohini/Di di/Dahi or Bayi. These simple acts of respect go a long way3. Travel Light, Light. Light; did I say Light. You will burden yourself with Luggage if you do not heed this advice. 4. If you are taking buses, go Turist bus, first class or private car. It is well worth the few extra dollars. MAKE SURE WITH YOUR AGENT. 5. Try to avoid public transportation such as local buses which can be extremely overcrowded in the larger cities. Rush hour can be overwhelming. Take either a metered taxi or arrange for a private driver.6. Make sure with your agent the quality of the hotel, if you have heating/AC in the room and if the hotel is experiencing power outage - very common. Lastly, our trip to Nepal exceeded our expectations. I highly recommend this company and our guide for your custom handcrafted tour of Nepal."

We met Keshab from Adventure Masters in our Kathmandu hotel and he suggested a 3 day Poon Hill trek which would be ideal for our time available and our fitness levels. He clearly broke every cost down and we were so comfortable booking the trip and knowing everything was taken care of. The whole 3 days we didn't have to worry about a thing. All our transport and accommodation was taken care of and we had an excellent guide - Gopal. Gopal was quiet but very knowledgable (although sometimes difficult to understand) and he encouraged me up the hard stretches and let me go at a comfortable pace the whole way (as I'm not the fittest person!) The trip was an excellent experience and we felt it was great value for money. The only 2 negatives I have are that on the final day (Christmas Day) we let the guide know we wanted to be back in Pokhara early to celebrate Christmas and we descended the mountain really quickly to do so but then the driver taking us back to Pokhara was 30 minutes late so we didn't arrive in Pokhara until later than we had hoped. Also, on our return to the hotel the guide made me sit down at a computer to write this review (with him standing close by) when I am tired and just wanting a hot shower and to celebrate Christmas! Awkward! Apart from these things, I can't fault the experience at all. Amazing trip!"

A total of 10 of us from Malaysia signed up for the Annarpurna Circuit + Tilicho Lake trekking tour. We hiked along mountainous region of Himalaya Range as if we were in an expedition in the movie \"Everest\". It was strenuous and challenging at start. However, as time passes, our fatigue was entirely engulfed by the amazing views of \"Vanila ice cream with chocolate top\" - the snowy view of mountains.Not forget to mention, our tour guide, Keshab was a great young man who can speak fluent English and Bahasa Malaysia. He shared a lot of hiking knowledge with us. For instance, he didn't recommend for us to take medication for altitude sickness. He would rather suggest us to stay longer time for acclimatization. As Nepal is not a developed country like US, wi-fi doesn't come handy. Keshab would sometimes entertain us with his Nepalese David Copperfield-styled magic. Porters in the company were also very helpful. Please be more generous with your tipping, though they don't request it. Also, do hire additional porter if necessary. It is not an easy job to be a porter, carrying tens of kilograms of weight behind their backs.Overall, it was an amazing trip.

His prices were very reasonable considering gas is insanely priced in the country right now. We also were not happy with the bus service so Santosh sent a driver all the way from Khatmandu to Pokhara to pick us up and give us a ride. The driver was also super nice, did a day tour of Khatmandu with us and took us to see all the temples and now is supposed to take us to Nagarkot tomorrow. Pleased with the services so far."

The trek itself was fantastic, partly because Nepal is a beautiful country but largely because of our fantastic guide, Ram and porter, Padam. Ram spoke excellent English, which was great because he had so much knowledge to share, about the mountains, Nepalese history and culture. Ram was also very organised and made sure we had good rooms in the lodges where we stayed and was so helpful throughout our trip.We really enjoyed spending time with Ram and Padam, they were always in good spirits.I'd really recommend the EBC with Mountain Mart and if you have Ram as your guide and Padam as your porter, you'll be very lucky!"

From the moment we were met at the Kathmandu airport late at night on arrival to being dropped off after an amazing 15 day trek to EBC, mountain mart had everything handled. Unfortunately during the trek some medical issues required us to make some changes to our proposed route but these were handled seamlessly by the mountain mart team. Our guide (Kumar) and porters were the best even able to come up with a birthday cake and candles for one of our fellow Trekkers. I highly recommend Mountain Mart if you are planning any trips to Nepal or the surrounding areas. The owner of the company worked as a porter and then guide so has a complete understanding of the issues encountered on the trail and has the experience and connections to assure that you will have a trouble free, once in a lifetime trekking experience."

We had a wonderful guide Raju and a wonderful porter Nikki who really made the trek. Raju was patient, kind and very encouraging all the way thru the trek. Up and down. We would highly recommend asking for him if you arrange your trek thru Mountain Mart. Nikki was also helpful. They were both always smiling and appeared to really like this! I would however, be advised that for the day tour they provide, you are responsible for paying the entrance fees to all the places they bring you. We did this after our trek and found we were pretty tired."

            "review": "Amazing EBC Trek Experience. My friend found Mountain Mart Treks on TripAdvisor due to all its wonderful reviews, and after completing our trip with them on Oct. 19, I can also attest to their wonderful services! Their Managing Director, Dolakh, communicated all the necessary information for the trip and quickly answered any questions we had via email. The packing list they provided was very helpful--it definitely helped me figure out, and narrow down, what to bring. And I love how MMT offers the option to use their down sleeping back and/or jacket for the trip, as well as a duffle bag to be used on the trek.Since the day arrived in Kathmandu, MMT took really great care of us. Our arrival was delayed due to weather and we didn't get in until midnight, but our driver Bishnu and our guide Prem was waiting patiently for us and promptly got us to our hotel. MMT put us up at Hotel Apsara and they also provided great service--despite the kitchen being closed at midnight, they still allowed us to order some chow mein for dinner and it was really good!Our guide Prem came by the next day to take us to the MMT office to meet Dolakh, settle our balance, and get a sleeping bag and our duffle bags. Dolakh also was able to exchange money for us at a great rate.Prior to our EBC trek, we did have one extra day we used to tour Kathmandu for the day. We were picked up by the same driver who picked us up from the airport, Bishnu, and he was really patient and wonderful as he drove us throughout the city to visit 4 temples.For our EBC trek, everything went so smoothly! We really got lucky with the weather. We were able to fly in and out of Lukla with no issues, and our guide Prem and porter Sudip were wonderful! They both took really good care of us on the trek. BTW, I really appreciate the fact that MMT is willing to keep the travel groups small--I truly felt like they were invested in making sure we had a great trek, and that it was NOT about the money. I was the slowest in the group but I really appreciate how Prem would tell us \"bistarai, bistarai\"--\"slowly, slowly\", assuring me that it was ok that I was slow and that we would still make the next village in good time. And we always did! And our porter Sudip? I am amazed at how he seemed to carry our 20 kg duffle bags with no issue all throughout the trip! In fact, I'm just amazed with all the porters, as well as the local Nepalese who carried heavy loads of supplies between villages throughout the trek.I wasn't expecting much with the accommodations throughout the trek but I was pleasantly surprised. The walls are thin in all the tea houses, and the rooms got smaller as we got closer to EBC, but they all provided comfy beds with clean sheets and blankets. We were able to have private bathrooms until Namche Bazaar but we did switch to shared bathrooms for most of the trek. And all the tea houses provided meals that were included in our package. Prem and Sudip served us our meals and helped us eat what we couldn't finish. :) They also made sure that we had treated water every night and every morning. Prem also checked our resting heart rate and oxygen saturation each night, and often asked us how we were feeling on the trek. I really appreciated Prem checking in on how we were feeling.One additional thing Prem did that I really appreciate was that he helped get a cake for my friend in Tengboche for her birthday. He even was willing to pay a share of it, which was sweet but I insisted I would pay for it all.Prem was overall just a great guide. We were really lucky to have him on the trek. He made sure we had all we needed, he answered all our questions, and he was funny and easy to get along with.The EBC Trek was probably the hardest thing I've done in my life, but I'm so glad I did this with MMT because they were so supportive. They definitely do all they can to make sure the trek is a success. And their prices? I don't think you can get a better deal! I mean, we got our own driver to and from the airport as well as for our Kathmandu city tour, we got our flights to and from Lukla, and all our meals and lodging on the EBC trek were included. And the price they offered was the lowest among the trekking companies we looked at!I would HIGHLY recommend doing the EBC trek with MMT! I've already recommended them to all my family and friends who may be interested!MMT - Thank you so much for an amazing, once-in-a-lifetime trip!"

We visited various other agencies but Dalakh gave us a fair price from the start and inspired confidence. He arranged for us to meet our guide that afternoon and insisted that we should be happy before booking. We were ready to start our trek the following day (in the middle of Nepalese national holidays!). Our guide, Makar, and porter, Raj, were excellent. Makar was very knowledgable and ensured we were staying in the best guesthouses at each stop, booking in advance if it was required. They were both so kind, helpful and nothing was too much for them. We had great fun in the evenings as well, chatting and playing cards - exchanging Nepalese and English games - and they became good friends.Makar even came to our hotel to ensure we had the right clothing and equipment before commencing our trek. Dalakh kindly leant us a down jacket, sleeping bag and poles for the trek. Everything was included - breakfast, elevenses, lunch, afternoon tea, dinner. We ordered as much as we desired and always had full stomachs. The snacks (chocolate, cookies, fruit) were envied by our fellow trekkers using other companies. He even supplied a first aid kit, with Diamox (which we didn't need to use), analgesia etc.The circuit itself was amazing. We adjusted our itinerary for the last few days and Dalakh was kind to accommodate. He even arranged an airport transfer for us after we got back (for free). It is difficult to choose travel agents in Kathmandu but we genuinely think this company would be among the best. We felt we got good value for money and would not hesitate to book again!!"

Our guide yukumar was the best, he looked after me like i was his sister when i fell ill on the trek, and even arranged a helicopter back from lukla to kathmandu when the weather changed on the way out. they chauffered us around kathmandu to visit temples waited for us, we had a meal with dolakh and his lovely wife chatting about family, england nepal and politics lol.

Ask him to teach you some local card games (bring cards or other games!).

            "review": "Annapurna Base Camp Trek. The experience with travel begins with the arrangements and competency of the company organizing the trip (in this case trek). Originally, our vacation was planning to do the Everest Base camp (EBC) under a 12-day trek. However, Mother Nature changed the original itinerary. Doing EBC is all about getting into Lukla and sometimes the weather does not cooperate for several days. Our plan for EBC was abandoned since all flights into Lukla weer canceled for several days and lost our rest days for acclimatization. Mountain Mark (headed by Dolakh) deftly managed our expectations and suggested that Annapurna trek be completed instead. It was not a disappointment. Our guide (Tilak) and porter (Ram) were indispensable in making our trek very comfortable over a 10 day period. The guide watched over our needs during and after our daily hikes. Both guide and porter would cater to us during off times (meals, evenings). Making sure our dinner was ordered and arranging places to sleep in various tea houses. The visual beauty of the ABC trek more than offset the disappointment of missing the opportunity of trekking Everest. The key days involving the morning hike up to Poon Hill and watching the sunrise over ABC were perfectly clear for fantastic photo opportunities. The trek itself was overall modest in terms of difficulty...just be able to walk up/done stairs for hours at a time (about 4-7 hours per day). Thank you Dolakh, Tilak and Ram for a memorable vacation. We be back to accomplish the Everesr Base Camp trek during the spring of 2018.One suggestion for those doing EBC. It might be worth the effort to book several days flights into Lukla (aka 1st flights). Once a cancellation occurs on flights into Lukla then one gets bumped into the 3rd or 4th flight the next day and so on. With limited vacation time, the odds of doing EBC diminishes unless weather is perfect."

However with all the companies out there in Kathmandu offering 'the best' it's hard to distinguish what was.... That was until we gave mountain mart treks a go. Right from the booking process whilst at home in England, dolakh (MD of company) added my wife on whatsapp and ensured everything was answered. Upon arrival in Kathmandu airport transfer was arranged to our hotel and then we went with our guide to mountain mart in downtown thamel to meet dolakh and finalise things before our big day! The next morning filled with excitement we had an early transfer to the domestic airport and our guide (Lochan) sorted everything for us. Flights from Kathmandu to Lukla can be very weather dependant and as such is out of control in terms of organising, but Lochan was always managing to be at the front of every queue and ensuring we were on the next flight! When we eventually arrived to lukla after cloudy weather all morning we met our porter Sanuvai whom can only be described as one of the strongest men I have ever met, him and Lochan always were very attentive to us and at meal times ensured we were looked after well! Mountain mart treks were the only company on our 12 day trek whom I saw who had a fully stocked first aid and drug bag (including the provision of diamox, cold and flu tablets, throat lozenges and any other drug you would need), as well as a pulse oximeter which was used every night after meal times to monitor oxygen saturations and pulse rates all of which were recorded by Lochan. Mountain mart treks pride themselves on good customer service and I can tell anyone whom is debating which company to use to go with mountain mart they went above and beyond and have exceeded any expectation I had. I will return to Nepal in the very near future and mountain mart treks will be the first company I will use for my treks, A big thank you to Lochan our guide, who provided a very knowledgable tour throughout our Everest base camp trek;Sanuvai (sudip) our porter whom worked tirelessly carrying out bags and looking after us at meal times; Dolakh for providing great hospitality and support in our planning and organising."

The locals are friendly people with even friendlier and cute children who wish you \u2018Namaste\u2019 all the way. We were accommodated in clean and comfortable mountain lodges. Surprisingly these modest places had very comfortable beds, soft blankets, hot showers and scrumptious food. The guide even put extra effort and made special arrangements for our transport at the end of journey as some of us were too tired to walk anymore :) We really enjoyed this trip. We would highly recommend Mr. Dholak and his dedicated team to anyone who wishes to undertake trek in any part of Nepal."

Dolakh was very flexible and gave us a couple of options and we decided on ABC. Our guide, Ram, is extremely knowledgeable about Nepal and Himalayas. He is very attentive, patient, and speaks very good English. We felt very comfortable with him throughout our 10 days trek. Along the way, he will stop us and explain to us certain things that we see in the Himalayas Region and also tell us more about Nepal. He take cares of us and make sure we are okay throughout the trip. He goes out of the way to make us as comfortable as we can be in the mountains. Even when we were back in Pokhara, he was there to bring us around for sight seeing. Our porters, Kancha and Bobi, are so fast and strong! They are constantly smiling and very polite and never a word of complain. Overall, I am extremely pleased with my first time experience with Mountain Mart and I will definitely look forward to my next trekking experience with them."

Mr. Dolakh is always available via email/phone (usually responds withing a few hours) to answer any questions you might have. I had the pleasure to trek with a wonderful guide Nabin Thapa Magar. Nabin was very courteous, very knowledgeable about the mountains, local culture and cuisine. He was always ready to help with anything I needed. Nabin is very reliable.

Dolakh's help in putting all the airlift arrangements from Kathmandu office is much appreciated. We still cant believe Sherpa Chandra walked back from Namche to Tengboche to return our baggages for the airlift - in the middle of the night!Thank you Dolakh, Sun and Chandra for your warm and wonderful service..so that my wife and I could reach our dream - Everest Base Camp at an incredible 5364m!

I would however recommend to other travellers to ensure time for some flexibility around your trips and departure from Nepal, especially at this time of year, as we had quite an intense itinerary due to prebooked flights and this at times meant the trekking was much more intense than we thought it would be (sometimes arrow d 12 hours a day) and meant we had to slightly rush some parts of the trip and did not allow any time for hold ups so it is worth discussing this when arranging your trip.All round though a fantastic service and a company I would highly recommend."

Two days prior to commencement, I had two meets where all my questions were answered and was provided with any trekking gear I didn't already have! All equipment such as gloves and sleeping bags provided were great quality! I was luckily enough to trek by myself with local guide Lochant. Lochant was probably the funniest and most enthusiast person I've ever met! Full of energy ever day, always singing and dancing at night. Most nights we had the company of other Trekkers but when alone, Lochant did an excellent job at providing entertainment. Lochants knowledge of the trek, conditions and weather was beyond amazing! Each night he'd explain the next day's trekking path to amazing detail and answer and questions about steepness etc. As the altitude got higher, Lochant would continue to monitor myself and check for any altitude sickness symptoms. He definitely provided care to my self and had beyond adequate first aid supplies if needed (luckily wasn't needed). Any second we would have opportunities of good views, Lochant would be quick to request himself to take a photo of me-so I'm not short of photos. Lochants interactions with the locals also meant that our stays at well selected lodges went without dramas. Once the trek was over and we spent our last day together in Lukla, my flight was cancelled due to poor weather, Lochant arranged accommodation and flights and stayed with me for an extra day and didn't leave until my flight successful left. Where possible, Lochant and Mountain Mart picked accommodation with the best possible facilities such as hot showers and wifi if needed. Being the off season, little was open in most villages however Lochant was great at providing things to do. Having two acclimatising day-arranged by mountain mart, I felt no symptoms of acute mountain sickness and I was able to reach Everest Basecamp without feeling sick! I very much recommend have these days as the people we saw who didn't make it decided to skip acclimatising days. I very much recommend Mountain Mart and Lochant, I'll defiantly be coming back and using them. Small things such as providing chocolate bars and fresh fruit each day went far into providing excellent customer satisfaction. Despite the weather which was out of our control, I had the best experience with Mountain Mart, without any negatives. Even when times got stressful (when my flight to Lukla was cancelled) Lochant was able to provide excellent service and ensure I made it to Kathmandu. If you want to have an entertaining trek, I very much recommend Lochant!"

Look no further book with mountain mart treks!To be Honest I did not check the reviews before I stumbled open this office in Kathmandu. we spend half a day checking out EBC treking tours in Kathmandu the prices were very similar so we want to go with whoever offered the best service. I was immediately impressed by Mount mart treks. Their office is well presented the Manager Dolkah answered all our questions and queries directly and was very informative. Within 5 minutes we also met our Guide Prim. I wanted to meet our guide before we booked. he was very friendly and we got on well so we booked. Mountain mart offered us an all inclusive deal which included accommodation, water,snacks, chocolates, Tea and 3 meals a day this turned out to be very good value for money as it would have cost us more if we paid our selves. we averaged about 2/3000 rupees a day for food and Tea. The only thing i paid for on the trek itself was 3 bottles of coke and my sister had a shower at Lobuche which cost 1000 rupees! Absolutely no nickel and diming here and no hidden costs with Mountain Mart.The Trek its self was amazing. I myself have climbed Kilimanjaro before and I am used to altitude My sister has zero experience did minimum training or preparation (I told her to train before!) yet our guide Prim was experienced and set the perfect pace for both of us. Our guides timings were also very accurate! Lol this is Nepal but when he said 30 minutes more it really was 30 minutes more. Every morning our guide explained in detail what the day would entail and what to expect on the trek weather altitude gradient e.t.c another thing I liked about our guide was Im an amateur photographer so I like to stop suddenly, back track to get some yak pictures sometimes stray off the path and make everyone wait! But I did not feel any pressure at all from our guide or porter.The accommodation was acceptable and generally to a good standard dont expect the Hilton you came here to Trek! Guide supplied use with sleeping blankets and extra bedding when we needed it We got hot showers and electricity in our rooms up to Namche Bazar other Trekkers I spoke to did not have these facilities in their rooms.Our porter Lilet was amazing he catered to all our needs as best he could and I never caught him without a smile on his face! Try smiling while carrying 30kg using a head strap! Lilet also accompanied us on both our acclimatization day hikes and even all the way to the Base camp so he definitely went the extra mile.Bottom line I am 100% satisfied and I would definitely recommend Mountain mart Treks without hesitation as aspects of service were met or exceeded. Do your self a favour go straight to mount art and book your trip there when you arrive or email them you will save half a day shopping around! Then only thing they cant do is carry you up the Mountain, Though I'm sure Dolkah can arrange that if you asked!"

I highly recommend them as well as asking for Kumar if you do choose to go them if you want an unforgettable trekking experience!-J"

Mr. Dolakh provided essential information and tips to make me feel at ease and comfortable with this trekking. The guide, Lochan. The porter, Ramesh were superb!!! Lochan was helpful in every way and every moment. He spoke English, no problem with communication thru out the trekking. All tea houses (lodges) that Mountain Mart booked along the way were very good. And the safety along the way was exceed exceptional. I would highly recommended Mountain Mart for trekking trip in Nepal. Trust, safety, and problem solver are keys in EBC trekking. Mountain Mart and Mr. Dolakh certainly delivered all three. Thank you for making my trip to EBC possible. Best, Krid Asvanon"

We booked our trip many months in advance with Dolakh, as Mountain Mart Treks offered the best package and price of the several companies that we decided to try. He provided us with all of the information we wanted and also an exhaustive checklist that set us at ease about what we needed. We were met at the airport by our guide, Lochan, who was with us from that point on. I must stress how excellent he was throughout our entire trip; all of the trekkers we met along the way were envious of Lochan, as he was full of energy and enthusiasm. He helped to make our trip so memorable.All of our costs were included in the original deal, so we ended up spending about $5 on water whilst on the trek itself; everything else was provided. The trek was one of the msot enjoyable experiences of my life, and Mountain Mart Treks could not have been any better in making that so. I wish them all the best in the future, and cannot recommend this company highly enough to anyone."

The route was Gokyo valley, Chola pass, Everest basecamp and finally the climb of the Island Peak. Before choosing mountain mart I spoke to 5-7 other agencies in Kathmandu.Price /quality: I think the price level is just fair and right, not expensive and not low cost. I had no hidden costs. I booked an all inclusive package for the whole trek. If you only book the guide without accomodation and food you do not safe much. For me it was a great comfort not to worry or think about any expenses during the trek. I could always choose the meals out of the menu. One positve detail is that all mountain mart guides always have a well equipped first aid kid, including AMS tablets (Diamox). I have not seen this at other agencies. Guide: One of the key factors for a good trekking holiday in Nepal is a good guide. My guide was \"Raju Tamang\". I strongly recommend him, great person!!! His english is very good. He also has a high knowledge of the landscape/ nature, people and culture. He explained me many thinks. We also had lots of fun. Raju has a very good contact to the owners of the lodges. Therefore I always had some little extras, e.g. better rooms, food, ....I have to say... Thank you Raju and Dolakh for this great holiday! Hopefully I have time in the next years to visit Nepal again!"

Our wonderful guide Rawiti knew the best guesthouses and places to eat along the beautiful countryside on our 4 day Poon Hill trek. Along with our porter Nabin who had a great sense of humour and always got the wifi signal for us. My son & I highly recommend Mountain Mart Treks & Expedition, for their friendly, caring service and flexibility, our flight from Kathmandu to Pokhara was delayed several hours due to fog, so there has to be constant changes to timetables, our guide just quietly adjusted things for us without us noticing, and constantly took care of lots of details to make everything go along smoothly. Although we are back home we reflect back on our trek and are so grateful that we chose this company to bring everything together for us and have amazing happy memories of our time in Nepal.

Manaslu requires a special permit, which can only be obtained through a registered trekking agency. Therefore, you cannot do this trek on your own. But a guide and a porter make your life much easier anyways - in particular it is very helpful that the porter can carry extra gear. For the whole 15 days I have not met any other trekkers, which I enjoyed very much but if you are looking for more company, this is probably not the right trek. The trip was very well organized by Dolakh, though you should be aware that not everything runs perfectly smooth in such a rather remote area. In our case the next two lodges after crossing the Larkhe Pass were closed, which prolongated that day by approx. 5 walking hours. Therefore, if you are going in the off-season it might be advisable to specifically request that your group's arrival is being pre-announced (most lodges have telephone and can therefore be reached before arrival). I am pretty sure that they would come and open if a small extra fee is being offered. Due to that long day, we shortened the trek by 1 day and Dolakh was very flexible in getting the jeep to Besi Sahar one day earlier."

Our trip started off rocky because our flights were cancelled (due to the oil crisis) and when we landed (at 11pm) our hotel (hotel mi casa... don't stay there!!!) didn't have our room. Nevertheless, our trek started early the next day and Lochan was full of energy, ready to go! We landed at Lukla and Gokarna was there waiting to greet us with a smile. He picks up our bags and took us to our first place for tea (which you will eventually get sick of hahahaha). The trek start out amazing with Lochan very excited to tell us about the history of everything with Gokarna smiling and laughing along with us. This process continued throughout the entire trek along with Lochan and Gokarna cracking jokes, telling us stories and also a lot of singing from Lochan. Along our trek we meet other trekkers who were all impressed with our guide and porter. The other trekkers keep saying your \"guides\" are very involved and we had informed them one of them was our porter (Gokarna). Everyone said the same thing that they rarely even seen their porters or even interacted with them, but to have him interacting with us was impressive. Also there were a few trekkers who said they wish they had our guide (Lochan). The entire trek was beautiful and the weather couldn't have been any better! I would highly recommend Mountain Mart Treks to anyone deciding to take this adventure. Thank you Lochan and Gokarna for making the trek better than I ever expected!"

Due to bad weather, the flights to Lukla were cancelled for several days in a row so we had to change our plans. Mountain Mart was incredibly accommodating with a last minute change of plans and we ended up doing the Poon Hill trek. Due to our plans changing, Dolakh brought us out for lunch, and provided us with a free private city tour of Katmandu and paid for an extra night of our hotel stay in Pokhara. The trek was an amazing experience. Our guide, Lochan, was incredibly knowledgeable, speaks very good English, and is very funny. Lochan and our porter, Sudip, were really a treat to do our trek with and became our friends during our vacation. The customer service at Mountain Mart is top-notch. They provided all of our transportation around Kathmandu and made it extremely easy and relaxing to get around the hectic city. Dolakh runs a great locally-owned company which is important in a country like Nepal that relies so heavily on tourism. They really helped make our trip to Nepal special. We plan to go back to Nepal because we loved it so much and to go on another trek. When we do we will be using Mountain Mart again! Thanks Dolakh, Lochan, Sudip, and the rest of the team for an amazing trip."

Dolakh Thapa made all arrangements professionally, added with great hospitalities and a 5-Star customer service, from before I flew to Kathmandu, arriving there for briefing and checking (extremely important), to after the trek completed. It was impeccable. One note that this trek is very demanding and was meant for fit people, although I managed to complete it successfully as planned, albeit with additional trekking hours everyday. Also that it was much colder in winter. Now, the hero of my trek was none other than Kumar, my trekking guide, without whom I wouldn't be able to make it. He's a very trustworthy, strong, athletic, smart, resourceful young man who took care of me in every way possible. He's very experienced and know every nook and corner of this trek. Among other things, he would push me harder, motivate me, lighten up the mood by cracking jokes, help me in many dangerous and difficult paths. He would advised me on what to wear depending on weather, and at the end of the day, present a nice fruit platter, a very nice gesture. He made my journey enjoyable although I was dead tired. Now that I've completed the trek, I felt like a million dollar. A million thanks to Kumar, Dolakh Thapa, and Mountain Mart. I highly recommend them to anybody. My trek has ended, but the memories will last for a long long time. And I still hearing Kumar singing: \"Priya, Priya, oooh, Priya , Priya. Priya, Priya, oooh, Priya, Priya.\""

I found MMT to have all the required practical information I needed and a great price for what I was looking for (originally a 8 day trek to view Everest.) Upon my arrival in Kathmandu and speaking with Dolakh, I realized I had both the time and resources to make the 12 day trek to base camp a reality, so I went for it. Dolakh facilitated all the details and made sure I had the necessary gear I hadn't brought with me and off I went. Through a delay a 6 hour delay at Lukla airport due to weather, each day on the trail, tearing a ligament in my knee halfway through the trek, getting to Everest base camp and up to Kala Patthar and finally an emergency evacuation by helicopter back to Kathmandu, I was completely safe and very well taken care of. Every meal was always ordered ahead of time, I was encouraged to do day hikes on my acclimatization day, I met many beautiful people along the way, made lots of great friends and best of all fulfilled a huge bucket list item, to pay a visit to Everest Base Camp. My guides name is Kumar, a very kind, athletic young man with a great singing voice, who showed me a lot of patience and care through my painful knee injury and slow pace thereafter. What a journey, but one I couldn't have completed without Mountain Mart, Dolakh and Kumar, who went above and beyond the call of duty and base level of care for a relatively last minute client. When I say beyond the call of duty, I do truly mean that (Dolakh brought my personal items to the hospital in Kathmandu and drove me to the airport the day I left Nepal and Kumar came with me shopping in Namche Bazar to make sure I got all the warm clothing I needed last minute and then helped me to find a knee brace bandage in the interim.) They are wonderful people.I highly recommend!! You will have the best, most memorable experience! Good luck!"

            "review": "beautiful trekking Poon Hill. Trekking to Poon Hill has been a great experience for me and my friend. I trekked with a friend of mine who never had been to Nepal and who did not have much trekking and walking experience. But the Poon Hill trekking is, although at some stretches hard because of the endless \"stairs\", not too demanding. It is a \"low altitude\" trekking. The little villages are all worth a visit and it tells a lot about the culture and way of life of the people living there. We stayed the night at nice lodges who were all used to have hikers. Good beds, good rooms, toilet inside the building, some even had a shower!!! The scenery of the Poon Hill trekking is very various and that's why we liked that trekking so much. Walking through forest, through nice villages, alongside riverbeds, and always the Annapurna peaks somewhere in the distance. Poon Hill itself was awesum!!!! Beautiful sunset, which made getting up in the early morning worthwhile!!! Again we chose Mountain Mart treks to be our trekking agency. I have done many trekkings with this company and they never let me down. Good, friendly guides who know their way around an who can tell much about the history and people of the mountains. Most guides are mountain men themselves and thus very used and familiar with mountain scenery, mountain dangers and mountain difficulties. On this trekking Mountain Mart provided us again a good guide who took care of us very well. Also the porter, a young man who did not speak English, tried his best to make contact which we appreciated very much. All and all it was a journey to never forget..because of the beautiful scenery, the nice compagny and knowledge of the guide, the characteristic villages and the good weather!!!! I recommend Mountain Mart very highly!"

We was looking for some trekking and found this one to ABC where we got also a guide and a porter. His name was Rewati Parajuli but we called him Ray because he was more friend to us then a guide. We started from Pokhara to ABC where the trek was lasted for 11 days. Every day of our trekking was perfect for what we can really thank to our frined Ray who was guide us all to ABC camp. Because of him we was felling really safe up there and also very happy all time. He always had some storys to tell and learned us a lot about Nepal. In two words, very amazing and interesting person. I would definitley recommend Ray like a guide, porter and friend."

We decided to hire a guide and porters to help us along the way. Based on a friends reference, we hired Rewati Parajuli as our guide, and he arranged two porters Ganesh and Komol. The 3 of them were great. Rewati did a great job of organizing everything ahead of time, and made sure everything went as safely and smoothly as possible. You don't have to have a guide and porters to do the Annapurna circuit, but I found that it really improved the experience, and I'm glad we did. Rewati was present and attentive, but never overbearing. He was happy to let us do our own thing whenever we wanted. We had some great conversations where I learned a lot about Nepal, the culture, and the people. This is something I think many people miss out on when they go solo. I would highly recommend Rewati and mountain mart treks!"

I was traveling to Nepal to meet up with some medical colleagues to work at a hospital but we had a few weeks before to trek, and the Annapurna Circuit was the perfect length of time. One of the group members had done ABC trek the previous year with a guide, Rewati Parajuli. She recommended him to lead our current AC trek and so we contacted him. He was happy to lead our trek, my husband and I met him via email and were very impressed and convinced quite quickly despite doing a good bit of online research for trekking agencies. He was extremely accommodating and thoughtful via email, very organized and sent us a perfectly thought-out itinerary for the trek based on what we had communicated that we wanted, with room for flexibility, and for a very fair offer I might add. The day we arrived in Nepal, we met Rewati and went to Mountain Mart to cover the essentials and we couldn't have been happier with our choice. A great trekking agency focused on professionalism, safety, no hidden costs, and responsible tourism to start. Our trek had a few unforeseen complications (such as a lost passport which complicated things, but again Rewati handled the situation like a pro), and 10 days in, the massive April 2015 earthquake hit just a day after we passed Thorung La Pass. But through it all, our guide and 2 porters were phenomenal and honestly we commented so many times \"what would we have done without them?\" Rewati is the most kind and gracious person, extremely well connected within the trekking community and was able to navigate us to a safe place after the disaster. I highly recommend both our amazing guide to a group or solo traveler and also our two porters Ganesh and Komol who were extremely fun, attentive, and who work so well as a team with Rewati. We spent many nights laughing together playing card games, drinking tea, or just chatting and learning about local traditions in the villages and Nepal in general. After our trek, we were touched and so thankful to continue our relationship with Rewati as he so kindly assisted in helping us with logistics (that none of us Americans could perform well in a foreign country not speaking the language) related to transportation and lodging of volunteer medical relief workers when we arrived to Kathmandu. His assistance in networking our logistics during this critical time when he didn't even have a home to sleep in shows the dedication and caring nature of Rewati Parajuli. A big thanks to Rewati, Ganesh, and Komol for the best trek of my life, I hope to see you again in Nepal on those amazing mountains. Thanks to Mountain Mart for employing these great people."

Being my first trip to Nepal and first trekking adventure to high mountains, I have no slightest idea about Everest region at the time when I started trip planning few months prior to the intended departure date. Having done some online search, 3 trekking agencies was shortlisted by me. Frankly speaking, MMT was not my top choice initially, but after few email exchanges , Dolakh the MD, was quick to convince me with his professional presentation and personal attention to details. At age 66 and in average fitness, I was grateful to Dolakh when he made me a fair offer and a flexible itinerary totaling 22 days of solo trekking when my only 2 other buddies finally decided to drop out. The tailor-made itinerary included 3 prime destinations, i.e. EBC and Kala Patthar, plus Gokyo Lakes as an option. However, in view of unfavorable weather conditions and forecast, I decided to give up all three upon reaching Gorak Shep.Was I disappointed then ? Absolutely not ! Taking advantage of the flexible itinerary and being solo trekker, I opted to switch over to \"soft trekking\" from village to village, which I truly enjoyed after slowing down my pace and re-tuning my mindset. The 16 days trekking in Everest region is undoubtably a fantastic trip of a lifetime. The breathtaking scenery of towering snow mountains, the spectacular views along winding trails, the peaceful villages that nestle on rolling hills and valleys, the hospitality and cleanliness of lodges provided for overnight stays or for meals, the friendly and ever smiling Sherpa villagers, all these mosaic up a fond and lasting memory.Not forgetting to mention Lochan who was my guide/porter and an excellent trekking companion. He speaks fluent English and is a very cheerful, understanding and helpful person. He always stay within visible distance from me while on trekking and is most attentive in serving meals, drinks, fresh fruits and tidbits at lodges. On several occasions when the trail became too demanding on me, he never hesitate to offer taking over my backpack albeit a heavy load already on his back, He is well-liked friend not only to fellow guides and porters, but also to locals both in villagers and those passing-by. Lochan is indeed the super guide that I highly recommend to any potential trekker, be it on solo, or in group.Sadly, my wonderful trip came to an abrupt end at Kathmandu when a devastating 7.8 big earthquake hit Nepal. Luckily, I was safe, unhurt and managed to fly home despite flight delays. I was deeply touched when merely 2 days after the big quake, Dolakh came personally to pick me up and drove me to the airport, at a time when he was most needed for caring to his own family and members of his staff who were still enduring tremors from continuing aftershocks.A big \"thank you\" to Lochan, Dolakh and MMT !"

We have trekked around the world, and can honestly say this experience was second to none. This was in large part to a wonderful guide, Rawati, and porter, Buddhi. Mountain Mart takes great care of the clients, and our guide was excellent about letting us experience this trek as we wanted to. They take excellent care of porters, which was much appreciated, because we had a great one in Buddhi. He has a smile and disposition that can warm any heart. The 7 day experience was fun, breathtaking, and just enough of a physical challenge to keep us feeling like we were working for it (our longest day was around 14 miles). The terrain is challenging, a lot of stairs. Much like the Machu Piccu Trek for those that have done it. There is never a dull moment. The scenery is incredible. The lodges are surprisingly comfortable. We had private rooms at most of our stops, and a warm shower, and bathrooms that were much better kept than most trekking experiences offer. The food was good, although caution must be made in your food choices. Rawati brought snacks, etc. Overall, just an incredible and memorable experience. I cannot give any higher of a recommendation."

Our family of four just returned from a very successful trek up to Everest Base Camp, and we would like to thank and recommend Mountain Mart Treks. We decided to use a tour operator, instead of trying to organise everything ourselves, and are glad we did. Absolutely everything was arranged for us, completely hassle-free, from pick-up at the Kathmandu airport to drop-off there a couple weeks later. Lodging, meals and permits were all taken care of, even when we 'deviated from the original plan'. We looked at the various operators, emailed our top five, and chose MMT based on their quick and positive replies, and their willingness to tailor the trip exactly when and the way we wanted. We couldn't have asked for more. The guide and porters were very helpful, but didn't get in the way - allowing us to meet and spend time with many other trekkers along the way.We would also like to recommend MMT's guide Prem, who has personally trekked all over Nepal and in the neighbouring countries, and made more than 150 trips to EBC. His experience, level-headed counselling and friendship allowed us to make the important decisions we needed to make along the way, and maximise our good time! If we decide to return to Nepal, to do one of the many other interesting treks, we will definitely use this team again."

Was scary too but with him there, I felt safe.As for the managing director, Dolakh also known to us as mob boss because he looks like one. Lol. He's very friendly and was flexible with our itinerary.

What makes Mountain Mart Treks special is that Dolakh Thapa is a still young and energetic, and an intelligent person who has long-standing experience with guiding tourists to the remotest places in the country before he started Mountain Mart Trips. Young, experienced and enthusiastic, I would say. MMT also does international events like treks around Mount Kailas (Kailas Yatra) - the holiest mountain in the world situated in Tibet over passes above 5000 meters (15.000 feet) -and book trips to Tibet, Bhutan and other uncommon destinations I have known him for more than 15 years as a reliable friend, and it is therefore no miracle to me that 80 % of the clients who he has helped earlier return to him when they come again. You have to try and perhaps you will also belong to that \u2018club of 80%\u2019 or even more. Dolakh claims a success rate of his trips of 99 % - I wonder where that 1 % comes from?

Dolakh, who runs MMT, was very responsive from the first point of contact and provided all the information we needed for the trip. He also proactively followed up on flight information and details which were required for a smooth trip. After being picked up from Kathmandu airport, we were brought to MMT to meet our trekking guide and had our equipment checked out. MMT would make sure we had all the necessary gear and supplement any inadequate equipment. Coming from a tropical country, it was a really helpful step as some of our stuff was not suitable. During our 10 day trek, our guide Prem always made sure that we were trekking at a comfortable pace, had the best available rooms with hot showers and made meal times an occasion to look forward too! He would always tell us stories about the trail and life in Nepal. Trekking plans were dynamic due to weather and group speed, but Prem was always able to accommodate last minute changes by rearranging our accommodation plans via phone which was crucial due to the high demand of rooms from other trekkers. In many villages, we managed to secure a room while seeing many other trekkers being turned away. On our way up to ABC, we met many trekkers coming down who weren't able to summit due to the heavy snow and had stories of how bad the route was. However, Prem's experience came into play and brought us to our destination safely. When it came to the more treacherous parts of the trek, Prem would always ensure that we traverse them safely.In summary, Prem and MMT tried their best to ensure that we have the very best trekking experience and now I'm already planning my next Langtang trek with them!"

Some of our friends arrived at the time when the Nepal international airport was shut down due to the Turkish airplane fiasco. Of course this caused a one day delay but Dolahk handled it without a problem. Flights were rescheduled (to Lukla) and hotel rooms were booked instantly.Throughout our trek, our excellent guide Prem was on top of his work. He was funny, super knowledgeable, and provided amazing care for our group. The porters were great as well - they remained close throughout the hike, in case we ever needed something from our bags. I would 100% go with mountain mart again if we ever make it back to Nepal for another trek."

I went on the Everest Base Camp trek with a group of 6 friends with Mountain Mart from Mar. 9, 2015 to Mar. 19, 2015 and all I can say is that they are awesome. Our guide, Prem, was excellent, knowledgeable, made sure all of our needs were met, and genuinely cared for the safety of each person in our group. Prem had very good English and had many years of experience guiding treks in the Himalayas, including the EBC trek, and was always happy to share his stories. Prem's food recommendations were excellent. The porters were all friendly and superhumanly strong. The accommodations were on par with what you get in each village, although you need to temper your expectations as the higher up you go on the mountain, the worse the accommodations are. This is not because of Mountain Mart, but merely a reality of hiking the EBC trek.Now the important stuff. Prem made sure that we were taking appropriate measures to avoid symptoms of altitude sickness, including eating enough food so that we had the energy to complete the days trek, drinking enough water and taking diamox at the right time to minimize symptoms of altitude sickness. When members of our group did start to exhibit minor symptoms, i.e., headache (as is inevitable on the EBC trek), he made sure we were honest with our symptoms and made sure he was updated with how we were feeling at regular intervals. Our group had people with varying trekking experience levels and Prem was very good at setting a slow, but steady pace, especially on the uphill portions, so that we would all reach the next stop on the trek without being too tired or over exerting. Also, Prem demonstrated excellent route finding skills when it started to snow during the trek and the snow covered the trail. As an experienced hiker, to me this was a true sign that Prem was a very experienced guide. In addition, Prem's estimates on hiking time were amazingly accurate.Unfortunately, we had one member of our group that ended up with moderate altitude sickness despite our best precautions. However, I believe this illustrates how great Prem and Mountain Mart are. Prem was very helpful in identifying that the person could not continue because of the altitude and the difficulty of the next day's trek and arranging for a helicopter to come and take the person down. Prem was an invaluable resource in identifying a problem and providing a solution. For the EBC trek where weather and other issues can cause a delay or force you to change your itinerary, Prem's expertise was invaluable. I was very grateful for Prem's experience and judgment. Without a doubt, this is the type of guide you want for an EBC trek. While we always hope things go smoothly on an EBC trek, sometimes they just don't, and having a great, experienced, compassionate guide like Prem can help you get through the problems and still have a great experience.Mountain Mart is run by Dolakh and Prem. Both of them are honest Nepalese people who are trying to build a lasting business. I admire their entrepreneurship, kindness, commitment to service, and honesty and I hope this review leads you to choose Mountain Mart because I feel very indebted to Dolakh and Prem for helping make my EBC trek experience so memorable! I felt very well taken care of by Mountain Mart and can strongly recommend them to anyone looking for a great guide and trekking experience in Nepal. Thank you Prem and Dolakh!"

The tea houses Mountain Mart selected were some of the better ones we saw on the Mountain and we knew we could depend on Prem to steer us in the right direction in terms of what was safe to eat! The trek included food and hot drinks, sleeping bags that were actually warm in the subzero temperatures, down jackets, hiking poles, and superhuman porters! Our arrival at Kathmandu airport was severely delayed due to an incident at the airport, but Dolakh and Prem were on top of things with alternate options. Even before the trek started, Dolakh was very responsive, even from half a world away. We highly, highly recommend Mountain Mart!"

With any big trekking undertaking it's the little touches that matter and the tour went out of its way to provide these. Our guide Bodri organised us hot showers whenever possible, physically supported us through icy sections of the trail and yielded energy rich snacks during the more difficult moments. We ended up having a private group tour and with the all inclusive nature of the trek we only had to worry about acclimatisation. Over the course of the trek we ran into many groups that failed to make it past Lobuche (about 80% of total groups we ran into) but Bodri's ten years of experience completing base camp paid off and following his itinerary (which he had the ability to adapt readily to the changing weather conditions) we all made it with minimal if any symptoms of AMS.

Emails were replied to promptly and trek itineraries were recommended with great details. All quotes were transparent with no hidden costs! During our trek, our guide Tilak and his amazing team of porters took great pains to ensure that all in our group were safe. As some in our group were not accustomed to the high altitude, snow covered trails and extreme cold, it took longer than usual to complete each leg of the trek; however, our guide and porters were extremely patient & helpful. Despite the difficulties of managing a big group with different levels of trekking abilities, Tilak and his team were cheerful & caring all the way!All of us thoroughly enjoyed the Gosaikunda trek which offers spectacular panoramic vistas of the Himalayas & intimate encounters with the uber friendly folks that we met along the way... This has got to be the most memorable trek for all in our group and we all vowed to return for more! Utmost THANKS to the Mountain Mart team! Hope to see you all again soon!"

Awesome trip to Annapurna Base Camp via Poon Hill and all the villages in between, I was part of the Niven's Eleven group that had a fabulous trip at the end of 2014. All the parts of our trip were organised by Dolakh and his team, this included sightseeing in the Kathmandu valley, our trip to ABC and some post trek R&R in Pokara and a couple of nights in the very nice Yak & Yeti hotel in Kathmandu, it also including a flight to the top the world to see Mount Everest and the Himalaya. Although the extra bits were brilliant the main reason for our visit was to trek to Annapurna and this was made possible with the support of our guides and porters who were AWESOME. Cannot thank Tilakh and his assistant Guness for all their support and encouragement on the trip and also for their patience as we took photo after photo for 10 days.We also had a late request of Dolakh to organise a 60th birthday party at short notice on our return to Kathmandu, Mountain Mart organised the venue (K Too steakhouse) and the birthday cake etc. a memorable evening was had by all, Willie (the birthday boy) could not believe it when probably the finest chocolate birthday cake I have ever tasted was brought out after dinner. Superb.If you are considering a trekking holiday in Nepal just contact Mountain Mart Treks & Expedition and let Dolakh organise it all, before he hands you over to Tilakh for what will be the trip of a lifetime."

Thanks must go to our wonderful guide Tilakh and his assistant Guness for there support, advice, encouragement and effort to please our party of 12 walkers ( Nivens Eleven). I did a lot of research into reputable tour companies for this lifetime ambition and chose Mountain Mart based on there recommendations on Trip Advisor and there qualifications. Dolakh was on hand from day one of my initial enquires answering all queries and giving advice were required and giving me peace of mind. I had dreamt about this experience for 12 years and it truly was an emotional and rewarding journey. Equipment supplied was of good quality and some of the talker people in our group required larger jacket / sleeping bags and this was addressed. Our every need was catered for and the tea houses ( lodges) flushing toilets were of a very good standard and the food was very good (Dal Bat recommended). We enjoyed the company of both guides and the 6 porters assisting with our kit who tended to stay with the group and assist with directions, tea stops etc when required. Tilakh worked hard at ensuring we were well looked after and that was reciprocated with a wee dram (malt whisky) at night time when we had a night cap. The Lakeside Retreat in Pokhara was a great hotel and worth the swap of return flight for land journey which was a fantastic experience to see more of the culture and will live long in the memory of many in the group. On our return to Kathmandu Dolakh was very hospitable and took us to the K2 Restuarant for dinner that evening. If you are thinking about a trip in Nepal, we did the ABC, then I would have no hesitation in booking Mountain Mart and being in the trustyhands of Dolakh and Tilakh, you will be glad you took the advice..."

We went with Mountain Mart because it was the only tour operator we can find on the internet which offered the shortest trek up a Himalayan mountain. The price tag of USD380 per person which included transfers, meals and accommodation was also another attraction. We were not expecting much due to the low price tag, however 5-star service we received was a pleasant surprise. First of all, the company upgraded our land transfer from Kathmandu to Pokhara to a domestic flight without additional cost. The flight gave us an aerial view of the mountains and avoided a repeat experience of the return leg by land where we journeyed through mountain roads, busy towns and river crossings. For that, we were provided with a 7 seater Japanese MPV which made the 6-hour drive back to Pokhara a comfortable one. Our trek was accompanied by a guide, Prem Thapa and 2 porters, Ganesh and Nabin. I was surprised that they were quite young as all three were in their twenties. Nevertheless they were very professional. However, soon gave in to our chidings and we became friends quickly. The bond we built during the trek which were filled with conversations, laughter and even singing made the experience richer but less tiring. Even with our guards down, they were very careful not to cross the line between client and service providers. Prem also performed \u2018surgery\u2019 on one of our member\u2019s shoes which did an alligator. In terms of accommodation, they gave in to our request for en-suite bedrooms in the lodges in the hills which made our rest from the gruelling trek even more rewarding. There was also no addition to cost on this upgrade. On the last day of the tour, Prem acceded to our request to meet pre-school children in the Tibetian refugee camp in Pokhara where we distributed gifts we brought from Singapore. It was fantastic meeting the enthusiastic kids. And just before we were sent to the airport, we were taken to the office of our tour operator in Thamel, where Dolakh, the managing director, presented us with our certificates and a traditional cloth for good luck. It was a bonus that Thamel was shopping heaven for tourist to buy souvenirs at great prices for our loved ones back home. These last two visits were not part of the itinerary but was a very welcomed addition. There are many tour operators in Nepal but we would definitely recommend Mountain Mart based on our positive experience. They really took care of us and we felt the bond that we created went beyond business."

We booked our 12 day everest base camp trek almost one year in advance and were kept in regular contact with the team. Dolakh in particular was happy to reply to my constant emails during the months as I had plenty of questions! The team picked us up from Nepal airport and took us to see Dolakh at his office for a meeting before our trek the next day. He provided us with all the paperwork and information that we needed including all the gear that was promised to us. They even dropped us to our hotel after. We could not have asked for anything more during the following 12 days. We were transported to the airport and picked up at the other in end in Lukla by our guide and porter who were absolutely fantastic during the trek. Our guide, Lochan, was kind, enthusiastic, flexible and encouraging the entire time. If you're able to request him then go for it! We were fed all our meals and given plenty of tea breaks during the day which was all included in the price. As the trek got harder (after day 6/7) Lochan provided us with chocolate bars to keep our energy levels up which was a great help. Whilst we were on the trek we also noticed that porters from other companies would go ahead and leave the groups behind, meeting them at the guest houses later on. However, our porter (Super Binad!) did no such thing. He stayed alongside us every step of the way just in case we needed anything from our bags. He even told us that he knew we would feel more comfortable having our bags nearby. He even offered to carry my girlfriend up the final few steps when she was struggling with it all!! We kindly declined but the constant words of encouragement from them both meant that we were able to complete the experience. Lochan, our guide, was incredibly knowledgeable about the trek and the routes being able to give us a literal step by step guide of how the route and the terrain would pan out. Trust me, you will want to know where all the steep hills are! He was even able to educate us on what feelings were normal and not so normal to experience due to the altitude which we found very helpful and gave us peace of mind. When we were feeling unwell he provided us with medication and advice, all of which helped us. Due to both of their friendliness and warm heartednessnes we grew very close to them over the 12 days and this just made the whole experience more enjoyable. I couldn't speak more highly of Dolakh and his team and the incredible value for money that they provided us with. I really hope they rise up the list of trekking companies as the experience was one that we will never forget. We left Nepal with a once in a life time achievement and many some new friends. All the best guys!!"

From Dolakh at head office to the guides and the porters just an outstanding team they couldn't do enough for you and for that I thank them from the bottom of my heart. You made a dream come true. I just hope we can do this again one day !!!!"

Moutain Mart made everything super easy and enjoyable and they were very professional. Someone met me at the airport when I arrived at Kathmandu and took me to a hotel, then I met with Dolakh, the director (who is great and speaks excellent English) that day and we went over the itinerary and he adjusted it a bit to make sure it met what I was hoping to get out of the trek and he also double checked that I had everything I needed. The trek was fantastic and my guide, Ganesh, worked super hard to make sure we were staying in the best places and to make sure I had everything I needed. He was an excellent guide and though his English wasn't perfect, it was good and he made up for any lack of English skills with his eagerness to help, his kindness, and his willingness to teach me the basics of Nepalese. It also seemed like he knew every inch of the trail and all the places and people along the way, which was great. I felt entirely safe the entire time and felt like I was in good hands! I met other trekkers along the trail who were traveling with other companies and who felt their guides were trying to cheat them or who didn't trust their guides and I didn't experience that at all. At the end of the trek Dolakh again made sure I had everything I needed and even came to see me off to the airport, which was a nice personal touch. I would definitely trek with Mountain Mart again and hope to one day soon!"

I was happy for him when he could start his own business. He has traveled with me to remote places while organizing buses, airplanes - local and international - treks, permits, accommodation, money exchange and - last but not least - visa for India, including 'impossible' ones. He is a kindhearted and naturally helpful person and, if you didn't bring it yourself, he will give you the courage to act and enjoy. I am a low budget tourist, and usually travelling alone in the cheapest way, but for those who can afford it he will organize white water rafting, canoeing, 'jumping' off the mountain, helicopters to the snow and all the 'adrenaline' adventures you can have in Nepal.

Through strong recommendation by another friend who has trekked with Dolakh several times, we decided to engaged his service. Dolakh was really helpful, patiently and promptly replying our numerous queries through email. He helped put together a 15 days itinerary which included an awesome trek at Langtang, day tours in Kathmandu & a short safari at Chitwan National Park.Dolakh personally received us at the airport and was a perfect host. At Kathmandu, we stayed at the FUJI HOTEL, which is a short walk away to bustling Thamel area where we could easily stock up on our trekking necessities. A day tour of Kathmandu was arranged by Dolakh, we were driven in a clean & comfortable car to various Unesco World Heritage sites and given ample time to explore the fascinating sites on our own. We even witnessed traditional cremation rites at the Crematoria at Pashupatinath Temple!The ultimate highlight has to be our 8days trek in beautiful Langtang. Our guide TILAK and porter SUDIP were excellent, they were attentive and took good care of my friends who were on their first long mountain trek. The Langtang trail meanders through breathtakingly beautiful valleys with quaint villages and amazing terraced fields, precarious suspension bridges, magical montane forests, meeting the very friendly villagers and finally a climb to the summit of Kyanjin Ri (4779m).After our trek, we made a short safari trip to Chitwan National Park where we got close encounters with elephants, indian one-horned rhinoceros and many other wildlife. Particularly unforgettable was a canoe ride along a river with numerous mugger crocodiles & indian gharials basking on the river banks!!!Having enjoyed our Nepalese adventure so much, I'm already making plans for another trek end of this year... with Mountain Mart of course!"

Being a lone female traveller who has never tried this type of holiday before I was a bit apprehensive before setting off. No need to have had concerns!!! Right from my very first contact with MMT I received very prompt replies to all my queries no matter how trivial and very good advice on planning my trip. Then when I got there I was met at the airport and the first class experience started from there. Everything was organised for me and I never has to think or worry about where to next. The price of the trip was much lower than other options I had enquired about and included a lot more (food, equipment, etc) but the level of service and accommodation was excellent and don't think it could have been bettered. It was also great comfort to know that if I had any problems/queries at any stage Dolakh was there to deal with them. I would highly recommend MMT and wish to thank them for making my trip such an enjoyable and unforgettable experience. Thank you again Dolakh"

Mountain Mart Treks offers us a good price of trekking package, including almost everything we need during the trip such as transportation (both ground and air), meals (3 times per day + dessert), accommodation, medications, etc. Basically it includes all we need during the trip, making us feel home everywhere. Furthermore, our tour guard (prem) and porter (thapa) gave very detailed and clear explanations to all questions i put up, showing that they are so passionate and professional to their job.Despite that bad things kept happening to me such as Hotel breaking the promise of fetching us from airport, dropping phone, missing camera, etc...., Mountain Mart Treks also offers themselves for solutions to our problems. I am totally touched and impressed by their hospitality and services.If you are looking for a trekking agent, Mountain Mart Treks is your first choice.

On all trekkings I had such a great and wonderful time. Every trekking is different as to toughness, scenery, altitude, but I can honestly say that ALL trekkings are worth while doing if you like hiking, mountain people and some effort and basic conditions!!!Mountain Mart has proven a reliable trekking agency with trust worthy guides and porters, who take real good care of you. Beside that I find that the guides of Mountain Mart know their bussines very well. They can tell you a lot about the scenery, the people, the trekking, the altitude etc. They are real professionals which gives a feeling of easy-ness. It is easy to make contact with your guide which is so nice and important especially to me, because I was doing the trekking on my own. For woman alone trekking with a guide is always a kind of risk. You hear stories of guides who get too familiar. But the guides in Mountain Mart are discrete, and I never ever felt like a had to be on my gard. I felt safe with my guide. I recommend Mountain Mart to everybody who loves Nepal and wants to do some trekking. The prices are fair and there is still room for negotianion. Thank you Mountain for giving me a wonderful time in Nepal."

Having travelled South America with g adventures an intrepid I was leaning towards one of those companies but having seen the price difference I said I'd gamble (what I thought was a gamble!) and book with mountain mart. It was the best decision I could have made. Our guide Chandra was excellent 100% local knowledge brought us to all the right places to eat and stay! there sad no need for Imodium or motiliam at any stage! I cannot recommend this company more, all food was included in the price also. My girlfriend is quite afraid of heights and the care that Chandra gave her going over the suspension bridges was incredible so much so that when we were on the way back from base camp she was almost skipping across them. When we returned to Kathmandu Dolakh brought us our for a celebratory dinner and insisted on paying for it which just added a real touch of class. I really hope his company thrives as they really deserve it. The attention to detail and the organisation from being collected at the airport to bring dropped back was service to another level that I have never received from any other operators. Save your money and book mountain mart my best advice."

The Hike itself was tough but the scenery was incredible and the completion of the trek was rewarding. We had a private tour with a guide and a porter for two of us. The guide was extremely helpful and his english was good. He helped choosing appropriate foods to avoid sickness and stomach issues on the climb up and was always looking out for our best interests. The porter we had was an absolute machine! He had no issues carrying the extra clothes and supplies we decided to pass his way. The tour was very relaxed and we had the opportunity to provide our input as to what we wanted to accomplish and how quickly we wanted to accomplish it. I never felt rushed on the trek and the pace was set based on how we were feeling that day. The price and timing for the trek was also desirable. The trek with mountain mart treks was a couple days shorter than other companies which I preferred since it allowed for more time spent in Kathmandu and touring other areas. The price was also much less than other companies. Overall I enjoyed the trek and would recommend using Mountain Mart treks for your own trip in the future."

Everyone within the organization was extremely punctual and attentive, and very concerned with the well-being and happiness of our group. If someone felt sick and needed to go home early, or if someone was having trouble with something, or if any problem arose, the tour guides would personally make sure that the matter was dealt with, often times even going with them in a taxi back to the hotel to make sure they were safe and attended to. Our tour guides had a wealth of information that they were readily and happily able to divulge upon us, and no matter how tired and weary we became, they were able to manage us and keep us in good spirits. I took the time to speak with them one on one to just ask and learn more about Nepal, the culture, the religions, the political landscape, etc., and they were both excited and eager to tell me whatever I wanted to know. These were just altogether friendly, smart, and organized folks who managed to deliver a wonderful experience of Nepal for our group. I am incredibly grateful for their service!"

Balaram was quick to communicate and said it was doable to create a more customized shortened trek with one less day of acclimatization so I went with him. Initially I was disappointed because I was alone with my guid/porter and not in a group when I arrived to Lukla, but I am very glad for that in the long run, I made friends along the way and we made our own group, and honestly I am not sure I would've enjoyed stopping and waiting for others as selfish as that may sound. There were a few hiccups as is often the case with travel and I won't say that the trip was seamless however in the end, Balaram and his wife were lovely and communicative and I recommend the Everest base camp trek and Thamel travel and tours to anyone who is considering. When I come back for the Anapourna trek I will be sure to call them again."

I agonised over this review as it was a great experience overall, but the component parts of our trip do not reflect others on Trip Adviser (the reason we picked Thamel Tours).Balaram was great with his response to our initial enquiry; quick to answer all our questions including around reassurances of providing some kit we lacked. The guides, driver and porter were genuine friendly guys who tried hard and solved problems when they arose but there were a bit too many which added up to a more hassle-filled experience than we hoped for.The promised kit never materialised, we asked to move accommodation one night as it was filthy and substantially lower standard than other nights (I'm fine with teahouses but I don't want mould everywhere) and we're lucky something was available, we weren't told we needed things which we hadn't brought, the car broke down (can't be helped) and we had to rely on taxis and their availability for chunks of the journey so there was hanging around. We get the impression our tour was organized at the last minute based on a repeated request for our passport details (including one a 8pm the night before we were due to set off after I had called and then emailed to check everything was ok),lack of equipment, and poor choice of accommodation on the third night as well as something one of our guides mentioned about us \"booking yesterday\" when we had confirmed at least ten days beforehand.If I am being brutally honest our guide's English, although a million times better than my Nepali, did not appear as good as others and we missed chatting along the way as it was difficult to communicate naturally and a lot of our questions were misunderstood no matter how often we tried to rephrase them, and as a result I felt we missed out on learning quite a bit as we went along as well as chat over meals and tea breaks. Our guides 'lost us' on occasion. They were ahead of us and out of sight for large parts of the trek. While this was not a problem in itself we saw tonnes of trekkers on the route and NOT ONE group - no matter age or ability level -had a guide who was not with them seemingly at all times.While we enjoyed ourselves, cumulatively the organization fell below our expectations given other Trip Adviser reviews.Based on our experience I couldn't recommend Thamel Travels to others, but we do appear to be in a minority on that here.Finally, do check what you are signing up for. This trek was sold to us as 'easy' with a 'gentle climb' (up 3200 steps!). It's steep and long days of climbing- if you don't have a base level of fitness or dodgy knees think carefully before embarking on it. We, and many we met, were surprised by how physically challenging it was - even if the views are spectacular!"

Although he was also our porter he is licensed as a guide speaks good English and is extremely experienced. He has connections with lots of the owners of the tea houses so will always book with the best tea houses along the way. He has done the ABC trek 50 times!.

We didn't check our itinerary after it was altered. In my opinion our flight from Lukla to Kathmandu was booked too early which didn't allow us enough time to do the EBC trek comfortably. We walked 11 hrs one day in order to catch the flight on time. My suggestion is to double check ur itinerary to make sure u have enough time for trekking and be aware of flight cancellation due to weather condition ( it happens very often).

Thamel Travel was very accommodating, and was quite happy to adjust the itinerary based on our needs and interests. For example, instead activities such as trekking, we offered less strenuous activities, such as visits to handicraft workshops instead, or shorter walks on more even terrain. Thamel Travel was also flexible in adjusting the itinerary based on weather -- for example, we were supposed to spend the night at Nagarkot to catch Himalayan views, but because of bad weather, we would not have been able to see much of a view. So Thamel Travel just organized Nagarkot as a day trip, and we did not have to pack/unpack and change hotels unnecessarily."

We travelled several days through Bhutan and learned a lot about the country, its history and customs. We joked that there was only one other country where one is not allowed to travel by alone. But there all comparison with that country stops. Bhutan is a friendly country where tourists are really treaded as guests. Everyone is friendly and open. We experienced beautiful temples and dzongs, great eco lodges and hotels, as well as the hospitality of a local family in a traditional house (with a great hot stone bath). One of the most beautiful experiences was the trekking to the Tigersnest! In the days we were in Bhutan we became good friends with our (singing) guide and our vollllli5driver! We had a lot of fun together and became Facebookfriends to stay in contact!"

The sights he recommended visiting were fascinating and we were able to access parts of the city we would never have gone to without a guide. Balaram was also really easy to deal with - quick to respond to emails and very reliable. It was also excellent value for money and the price of the two day tour was much cheaper than we had been quoted by other tour companies. We enjoyed the tour so much that we used Thamel Tours to take us to the trailhead of the Annapurna Circuit - and again, Balaram supplied us with lots of useful information about the trek.

Balaram is efficient and hard working to answer the queries with good English. And finally we decided to go with thamel tours. In some points he also customized the itinerary easily. We appreciate his concern and comfort to meet our interest. When we arrived in Kathmandu, Balaram was there, he did not show us his card but amazingly came near us and could catch us. He is very cleaver that by some clue he could recognized us easily. After that we went to hotel and started our tour from next day. He took us Monkey temple and Kathmandu darbar square. They both places were amazing and the beautiful wood craft in darbar square was worth to see. And we did shopping and packing from the late afternoon. We pack up every thing.Next day we had Lukla flight it was first flight on Buddha air. Luckily we had good time and reached Lukla. From the day we were under the care of Rabin , who is our guide. He was able to book nice room at tea houses. He took good care of us during the entire trip. We reached to the Base Camp! This is what our mission is. It was amazingly beautiful\u2026.wow at some point we forgot all the efforts, difficulties to reach there.This is really worth to pay money for the Everest Base Camp. Who ever coming Nepal is highly recommended to go EBC. And without any doubt you can choose Balaram from Thamel Tours. He is honest and responsible person. Thanks to Rabin, he made our EBC trip memorable and we had a wonderful time."

Originally, I was supposed to travel with both a guide and a porter, but Balaram ended up combining them into one guy, which worked quite well. The porter/ guide was a nice guy in his early twenties, but his English wasn't very good, which was very frustrating at times.Overall, I had a great time and would like to thank Balaram for a great trip."

His recommendations for lunch places were spot on and the flexible nature of the trip (for example, when the views at Nagarkot were misty, adding a visit to Changu Narayan on the way back to Kathmandu and suggesting to visit Pashupatinath at dusk for a more atmospheric visit) really added to the experience of the tour, which was also very reasonably priced.

My full trip itinerary was organised from start to finish & was fully adaptable to suit my travel requirements & sight seeing to do list. All my questions were answered prior to my trip in a timely & professional manner. I was met at the airport & warmly welcomed. I stayed 2 nights with Balaram & his beautiful family at their home stay. I changed my trip itinerary in the middle of the week & flew to Pokhara. Balaram arranged all my internal flights additionally & my guides for hiking in Pokhara (nothing was to much trouble) Who were also excellent. I throughly enjoyed seeing all the sights in Pokhara & x2 days of hiking. I was fully accompanied by a guide, who again was very knowledgable, friendly & fun to be around. You totally have to watch the sunrise at Sanagkot, this experience was simply breathtaking. I spent time with the family exploring Kathmandu, Thamel & its surrounding areas. Balarams wife Saru spent time with me explaining the history, cultures & religions & answered my non stop stream of questions. The family were just a delight to be around. They were more than happy to take photos of me as we went along to ensure I could capture both myself & the moment. The mountain flight was just awesome, I would highly recommend this to anyone who visits Kathmandu. Despite it taking x3 attempts to finally get to view Mount Everest! Mother Nature was not on my side initially. This was also fully organised on my behalf.The guest houses & hotel I stayed at were all basic but clean & comfortable. All had wifi & could provide you with a good meal after a full days exploring, hiking or just wandering around this amazing place. Electricity is some what hit & miss in Nepal, so always ask when there will be power & get cameras etc charged during this time! I would also recommend to bring a torch for being out & about after dark. Sturdy footwear is a must as the streets/pavements etc are some what beat up. Despite much evidence of last years earthquake still visible, daily life continues as normal & everyone smiles, seriously they do, Nepalese are such happy & friendly folk. Thanks to Balaram, his family & my awesome guides, this trip was just the most excellent travel experience. I felt safe & in very good hands 24/7. Nepal is fully open for tourism, hiking & trekking. I will be back again for sure! "

When you go through thamel tours I highly recommend using him as your guide. Also before doing the tour I had a ton of questions and was constantly emailing Balaram, the man in charge. He was super responsive to me emails and also the tour was very customised to our needs and also one of the cheapest around. This trip was amazing and I highly recommend a Porter and guide unless u are strong and adventurous. Use thamel tours, Balaram and dipesh."

However, I can whole heartedly recommend Balaram for all your trekking/touring needs. The tour I did was a private Kathmandu day tour. The tour was a perfect introduction to Kathmandu to appreciate its history and get your bearings. My dealings with Thamel Travels and Tours were first class. From the incredibly prompt email responses, to taking me to try my first momo (wasn't part of the itinerary but I asked about Nepalese cuisine), Balaram's tours are fantastic. I will be recommending Balaram to every one I know."

The accommodation everywhere we went was exceptionally comfortable and our private taxi driver went above and beyond to look after us. Our trekking guide also impressed us, we have already decided we will use him again when we seek more adventure.This personalised tour exceeded our expectations of Nepal and made us fall in love with the people, food and culture.

We took a 12-day tour package that covered Kathmandu, Pokhara, Dhampus, Chitwan and Nagarkot. Balaram is a very friendly, calm, respectful, polite and a wonderful person. There was a fuel crisis and he handled the situation very well and ensured that we could carry on with our tour. He ensured on our safety and advised us not to go to Lumbini due to some unrest over there. At one point, there was insufficient fuel in the car we were travelling and he told his driver, Rabi to take his car instead. He also resolved immediately some hotel accommodation problems we had. His tour guides and Rabi are very friendly and polite. Rabi was a fantastic driver. We highly recommend Balaram and his team at Thamel Travels!"

Balaram, the owner, picked us up from the airport and whisked us off to our hotel in Pokhara. Everything went exceptionally smoothly and the trip was just as Balaram had quoted in his email. Our drive to/from Pokhara was exceptionally long. Expect at least 6 hours, but it took almost 8 on the return due to traffic. The roads are really bad, so consider flying if you dislike fumes, windy roads and slow traffic.Our hike was great and our guide wonderful. We left from Nyapul at 10am and were above Uleri by 4pm. The next day we walked to Ghorepani and then straight on up Poon Hill. No one on the summit except for us. The following day we hiked all the way down to Nyapul which almost killed us. We left at 8am and were picked up at 2pm by Balaram. We are in good shape, but the downhill over stones was torture on the legs. In retrospect we should have gone slower or taken another day.Overall, I can highly recommend Balaram and his company for hiking at great prices. Hopefully we 'll be back one day for a longer stay."

His wife, Saru, is lovely and welcoming and I got the fantastic opportunity to learn how to cook Nepalese food (including momos) right in their kitchen! I would highly recommend Thamel Travels and staying at Balaram's Raniban homestay while in Kathmandu. It is just far enough from the noise of city traffic to get some peace and quiet, but close enough by car to explore nightlife if that's what you prefer. Nepal needs tourists especially now since the tourism industry was heavily impacted by the earthquake and gas crisis. There are still plenty of historical structures still left standing and completely undamaged, so please visit soon if possible!"

Balaram is a really sweet and trustful person, he even booked our Himalayan flights without us having payed in advance. It was a pleasure being with them. We flew away for a week, forgot one toiletries bag in the hotel, and he went to pick it up for us. That's going the extra mile.Our second week Ravi took us to Chitwan Park, where we had another local guide, very knowleadgeable, and from there to stunning magical Pokhara. What a trip. Finally Balaram drove us back to the airport. We felt so well looked after. And all our guides were always on time, we never had to wait. I can't wait to go back to Nepal.

Nepal tour was mix of himalayas, jungel safari and heritage places. It was sightseeing tour and short hike. Bhutan was sightseeing of many monasteries and mid range mountains. For medium budgets I would rather suggest to prolong the tour in Nepal as the experiences are not very different."

I honestly contacted them based on nothing but their positive Tripadvisor reviews, and Balaram and company ensured they delivered to the standard. All flights within Nepal including Kathmandu-Pokhara and Bharatpur-Kathmandu (A small name discrepancy on the latter which was quickly sorted out by Balaram) were booked per time and request. Hotels stays except Chitwan (which I had booked myself) were done very well and the packages were quite reasonable compared to online rates. In addition, the company handles crises as well, amply visible by how they handled the flight cancellations which had happened due to the recent crash landing at Kathmandu airport. We were charged no extra cancellation or booking fees on either hotels or internal flights, and aside from 1 change in the schedule due to room availability, everything was the same as originally booked. Kathmandu as a city I found pretty disappointing, but the guides did their best, our Pokhara guide was pretty enthusiastic too. The only small note I would leave is that Balaram seems to the most capable among the team, and if for some reason he is away facilitating a trekking expedition, co-ordination with the company can get a bit difficult. However, if you're with Balaram, rest assured, you're all set."

Mr. Balaram Pandey from Thamel Travels did a marvelous job actually organizing our 4 full days in Kathmandu. We had everything from history, culture, everyday life, flightseeing of Mt. Everest, walk through Kathmandu Valley and so many other wonderful experiences. Mr Balaram had it organized incredibly well. Mr. Balaram was so wonderful at returning our emails so rapidly after we sent them. Of course that means he is up late hours just to keep up with email from the USA. What a marvelous job he did. To make it all come together in an outstanding way, our guide was Sushil Nepal. He was beyond belief!!! Just to watch him as he introduced us to the locals and their lives was extraordinary. He had such a way with people and with finding little happenings that gave us such a feel for the city and area. We even got to see Nepal's living goddess which is a \"maybe can happen event.\" He was so wonderful at explaining everything to us in such a way that we could grasp it all. I think the most outstanding talent that he possesses is his kindness and innate ability to see things happening around him and relay that experience to his clients. If you have the fortune to have him as your guide, you will have an experience beyond anything you can imagine.Kathmandu is EXTRAORDINARY! Enjoy it all!"

Starting here, we trekked for about 5hours and ultimately ended at a village. The hiking trail was plain, a bit uphill and finally downhill. The views of the himayas including Mt Everes was awesome. Our guide said it is the only trail from where you can identify Mt Everest from Kathmandu's suburbs. We were back at hotel about 5pm. It was beautiful day and our guide Gyanendra was so much friendly and knowledgeable."

Other similar well-rated companies were asking for at least $90. Galendra (I may be butchering his name...) was so knowledgeable, well-spoken and funny, and it was a blast spending the day with him. We learned so much about Hinduism, Buddhism, and Nepali history.This was an incredibly reasonable price to pay for a top-notch guide; if you are being quoted $90 by other companies, I would definitely aim for this option, as the service was amazing, and the experience is a positive and memorable one."

When traveling with young kids we always stay in 4/5 start hotel to have a comfortable \"base camp\" and then we explore daytrips with ideally a good and knowledgable local guide & car. This agent was a perfect choice for us, we emailed him first our generic wish list (how many hours per day, what sort of attractions to see) and Mr Balaram (the owner of the company) prepared a tailor made program. On the ground everything was well organized, always sharp on time and no bad surprises regarding price - all as we agreed upfront. All tourist fee,entrance tickets to the historical buildings etc was already included in the price we agreed with the guide upfront so we could plan out expenses perfectly and reliably upfront, so no extras or add ons during the days. The 8 seat off road car was very new, air con perfectlyworking and both the guide and the driver spoken perfect English. When traveling with kids we prefer relaxed pace so changing program during the day on our request was never a problem. The guys also arranged a 1hr sightseeing flight (through an established airline) to see the Mont Everest.

And together all of us had great time in Chitwan as well. They have great prices for their excellent arrangements. We are thankful to Balaram and his team for their great services.

It was a bit cold in Nepal but Thamel Tours took care of all the arrangements for us. All in all number one place to book in Nepal. Special thanks to Balaram, and our guide Rabin. Rabin had good enough elglish to communicate and he was a great help to Poonhill. Specially if the guide is not supportive or friendly our trek could have been a worse experience but it was great experience with him. Very friendly. And we got good value for the money we paid Thamel tours, we had booked on the most competitive prices among few agencies for the same services."

I'm 25, from Sydney Australia, and completed the Mt Everest BC trek with three friends through Thamel Travel. I wanted to try a local company, supporting the local workforce, rather than the over-priced, over-crowded Western companies. Best decision ever to book with Balaram at Thamel Travels.He responds to every request at the drop of a hat, and everything ran smooth. Our trip was the BEST, we had a funny, young local guide that was like one of the group. We even got to hang out with our porters. It was never like 'us' and 'them'. Accommodation was great, meals were AWESOME we got to have whatever we wanted. Western companies had limited menus, and groups of 20-50!! We were a group of 4. The best thing is Balaram would've been happy to cater for us if we each wanted a guide to ourselves, and be a group of 1 or 2 persons. He will go above and beyond- it's not just about the money at this company.Our guide even invited us to stay over at his mothers house after the trek, 4 hours out of Kathmandu in the jungle (they didn't have electricity). Traditional meals and celebrating the National holiday with a welcoming local family. You can't buy an experience like that. Shout out to Dipesh and Balaram :) If you're in two minds about which company to choose, don't be. Book with Balaram. On the trek we met and spoke with a lot of other hikers from different companies- I guarantee you Thamel Travels is the best choice."

Having lived and worked in another province in China for many years, I thought I could hire a local Lhasa travel agent to book our tours and get our entry permits. That local travel agent kept giving me excuses about why I couldn't get a Tibet entry permit, etc. My sister (who had just booked with Thamel for a Nepal tour) also wanted to come with me to Tibet, and she suggested I contact Thamel. At first, I couldn't believe that a Nepali travel agent could book a Tibet tour for me. However, Balaram responded almost immediately to all of my questions for several weeks in a row, and true to his word, he eventually got us our Tibet entry permits!The Tibetan tour guide who was assigned to us, Chongdak, was a sweet gal who tried her best to accommodate our every need. Our van driver, Phuntsok, was also very skillful in navigating gigantic potholes on the road going all the way from Lhasa to Shigatse to Everest Base Camp.Since we were on a budget tour, Balaram did warn us that some of the hotels on the way to Everest Base Camp would be a bit substandard. Mostly, I think the hotels had problems dealing with lack of water or water leaks. (Nonetheless, staying in small hotels beats camping in a tent any day.)Thank you, Balaram and Thamel! If I ever get to Nepal one day, I will certainly use your services again! (P.S. Do you do India tours too?)"

Apart from the friendliness and hospitality, which is a Nepali staple, like their rice and daal (lentils), Balaram impressed us most by reorganising and modifiying our program, stops and hotels on the trot. The vehicle - Toyota Haice, he chose for us was very comfortable and totally roadworthy. The drivers and guides he selected were very good and supportive. His recommendations of hotels and restaurants was spot on. We made many improptu changes to the program, mainly to suit the whims of the boys, from planning the everest flight, to white water rafting to paragliding, all which Balaram handled on the spot with a few phone calls.

We then booked a 7 night fly in drive out tour of Tibet, which was again organised for us down to the last detail, Balaram took care of our visas and arranged for a great english speaking guide, with extensive knowledge of Tibetan Culture.We would highly recommend booking any of you day trips, trekking and tours through Thamel travels.

He did great job by offering us very realistic price and provided with the most helpful guide Dipendra.

As a resident of Kathmandu that often has to arrange travel and transport for guests, I would be completely lost without Thamel Travels and Tours. Thanks to the owner, Balaram, and his very competent staff, I am able to book everything from airport transfers to hotel bookings to city and trekking tours.Thamel Travel has made themselves available to me at crazy times of the day including past ten at night and before four o'clock in the morning. I know I can count on getting in touch whenever I need them.While it's easy to find competent English speakers in Kathmandu, Balaram speaks excellently and is very easy to communicate with. I never have to worry that he doesn't understand what I'm asking for.Thamel Travel goes out of their way to make sure that I'm getting exactly what I need.

He was able to get me a last minute flight at a great price and was even patient enough to help me out with some trouble I was having with my bank back home in the US!!

We went to three different cities, Kathmandu, Pokhara and Chitwan, and we had a range of activities from paragliding and bungy jumping, to trekking and elephant riding organized for us.The prices were extremely good, and the tour company ensured our ultimate comfort throughout the journey. If we wanted anything, it would be fixed and organized with a simple phone call. The entire holiday was handled very professionally and Baralam (our tour guide and organizer) really gave it a personal touch.

It was our first time to Nepal and overall, we had a fun and memorable stay. In terms of accommodation, it was good in Khatmandu. Our stay was at Moonlight Hotel which was situated in the town of Thamel. Convenient for bargain shopping & sightseeing of the locals. We found 2 Halal restaurants around Thamel but we only dine at Anatolia most of the time as we only found the other one on our last night in Thamel. The food there was good. Our next stop was Phokara. I really liked our hotel in phokara. I must say that it was the best amongst all our stay. Equivalent to a 4* anytime. New, comfortable and up to international standard. Hotel name is Mt. Khailash Resort. However our stay at Anu Guesthouse (w/o aircond, fan or tv) was the most fun amongst all our stay in Nepal as we really get to enjoy our company together without gadgets interfering our attention to our friends. Our 2D1N trekking around Dhampush valley and hills plus the magnificent view if Anapurna Mt. was the highlight of our journey. Our guides speaks fluent English and was very helpful and descriptive in their explanations. We visited many heritage sites and both Buddhist and Hindu temples and did many unplanned activities such as cycling and ultra flight. We will definitely come to visit Nepal again one day."

The guide was very friendly and knowledgeable and the manager Balaram was always very efficient at answering emails.Although the walk itself was relatively easy, it involved some uphill and downhill stretches, so you should be reasonably fit (second and third day about 5-6 hours).The food in the hotels is relatively expensive, but it is possible to eat out in local restaurants for a much cheaper price.If you want nice views of the high mountains, it's probably better to go in autumn (October-November)."

From my first email exchange with the owner Balaram to the last day of our 10-day trip to Nepal, Balaram has never stopped to be responsive, patient, flexible, and overall we feel he's a kind guy with a smile on his face and good work ethics and he was never pushy and try to talk us into buying things or doing things so he can earn a bit more money. (that could be very stressful if your guide always wants to do that)Before the trip, I exchanged countless emails with Balaram to pin down our itinerary. He was very patient and thorough when answering my questions. He also has the best price that I found. you might worry, lower price means lower quality? Amazingly, this is definitely not the case, I might even said, other higher price company may not offer as good a service as Thamel Tours.We ended up going to various places in Kathmandu, Pokhara, Nargakot, and did a bit of trekking. The trekking guide Balaram hired for us in Pokhara, Laxman, is just as wonderful and thoughtful. At the end of our trip, we thought, if we came to Nepal, without a good and trustworthy guide like Balaram, our trip could easily turn into a nightmare. We actually felt very lucky that we found this company and Balaram on tripadvisor! we highly recommend this tour company."

I had sent enquiries to few of the agents in kathmandu but I had the best rates and services inclusions from Balaram at Thamel Travels. At the cost of my 3nights hotel accommodations in Delhi I had 5 days trip with hotel accommodations in Nepal. I spent times in Kathmandu, Nagarkot, and Pokhara. highly recommended and reliable; absolutely dependable!"

I must admit that from the very beginning of the tour to the end of my stay in Nepal, it was totally a different feelings. I did 3 nights 4 days eastern kathamandu valley rim hiking as well as mountain flights. The cost was very reasonable and the hike arrangements was excellent. The Chisapani-Nagarkot-Dhulikhel-Namo Bddha hiking became the smooth success with pleasure and is the best for short time schedule. Balaram, the owenr at Thamel Travel and tours, did arrange exactly as he quoted in the email conversations. He is even very fast in replying emails. The accommodations, guides, and the car provided were very good. Furthermore, the company also has its own resources like car, monthly paid guides, and a very good relationship at respective hotels. The company and the tour is highly recommended.Brian"

During our whole trip one english speaking knowledgeable guide and a very careful driver had accompanied us. Sandip, the guide and Shambhu, the driver were the perfect man in services. Balaram from the office continually was ensuring the best services and attention. He also informed all the booked resorts and hotels just few minutes ahead of our arrival so that we had nowhere to wait for rooms to be ready. At each of the places the staffs were waiting for us with smiles on their faces. It was the best holiday i have in Nepal. Balaram and Thamel tours are highly recommended. I am feeling lucky to have met such a flexible and honest tour company in Kathmandu. You can get best services at local rates. I also did Tibet tours last year with them. Namaste!Jansen"

I spent a two week vacation in Nepal, the organization by Thamel tours was truly above average, the tours were made to be tourist specific which made my time in nepal even better. I much enjoyed doing the worlds third highest bungee jump around the himalayan mountain ranges. The encouraging thing about Thamel Travels is that they truly allow you to indulge in the Nepalese culture with their vast knowledge of local tradition. Not only was i introduced to the overall nepalese culture but also to isolated villages and communities. Every little detail is completley taken care of by Thamel Travels with the obvious ingredient of knowing what you want as a tourist! regards, kareem."

I had one of the best experience in my life trekking through exotic places through mountain trails in the Himalayas. They were friendly, provided local accounts on the attractions and brought me to good spots to take photos! The transport, accommodation were also well arranged and timely. Even though there may be other tour agencies in Kathmandu, I would still go back to try Thamel Tour again because they leave me with such pleasant experiences! Regards,Stewart"

We found Balaram with Thamel Travel and Tours who set up a daily tour for us to experience the highlights of Kathmandu Valley including a day trip to Nagarkot to see the Himalayas. Balaram met us at our hotel for each day's excursion and drove us to the various sights. He answered all our attraction questions as well as those about Nepalese culture and traditions. It was a full schedule but done at our pace. The tour was a great value that took maximum advantage of our limited time in Nepal. Our son is getting a small group together to trek to Everest Base Camp with Thamel Travel next year. Ours was a wonderful experience. We would definitely recommend Thamel Travel to others."

When we booked our trip to Nepal, we had some really specific requests regarding places we wanted to visit in the Kathmandu Valley. Balaram came to us by online recommendation and I am here to pass the recommendation on. We are both professional photographers and we really wanted a driver to take us to some really off the beaten path locations. Balaram not only knew where these places were, he stayed in constant contact with us via email before our arrival, arranged a vehicle at a very reasonable price with a reliable driver and he was friendly, efficient and helpful throughout the entire process.It took a lot of stress off us knowing that we could rely on someone to get us to these places and we have a lot to thank Balaram's professional manner for! If you are thinking of heading to Nepal, we would really recommend Thamel Travels and Tours to you."

As it is winter in Nepal, it is a bit cold in the Himalayas trekking but I had the best experience through mountain flights and tours to Nagarkot, Bandipur, Manakamana, and Pokhara. The management of our tour by Thamel travels and tours was as something European tour operators commit and fulfill-very timely, at unbeatable rates and with adequate informations. I can recommend them from my both head and heart. The cars, guide and the hotels they provided me was unique in its category. There are lots of tour agencies in Kathmandu, for best services and rates try Thamel tours!cheers!Robert\u00ad\u00ad"
