It would be nice to see more of it staged as it was when the residents were there. Some of the art work seems out of place and not in keeping with the style of the home. Do go to the cafe for lunch or a drink. Inside is just as charming as outside."

The English tour was just ok. The guide was sweet and tried but there is nothing to explain except the style of each room. The first floor is the main museum and is made of different rooms decorated in the styles of different eras. Interesting but not anything fantastic. Plus they had some strange exhibit in the middle of these rooms of very modern furniture???? The second floor is only very partially open for viewing and the top floor closed. The basement had a photography exhibit but nothing to do with the mansion! Ok for a 1/2 to hour if you are in the neighborhood and want to spend money on nothing! The cafe outside is nice and the setting is a bit noisy but on a pretty day a nice place for a cup of tea or coffee. Visit the grounds in back they Re pretty and I imagine nice when it was built but very noisy in the middle of the city now!"

This museum is housed in the former residence of a prominent Argentinian/Chilean family (the Errazuriz Alvear family). The building was constructed using multiple materials and artisans from Europe and contains the art collection of the family and some really fascinating design choices. The main floor (floor 0 in the Argentinian numeration) contains several large rooms that, when traversed in a clockwise pattern, each is decorated in a style that is the temporal successor of the preceding room. This attention to era and detail is so great that even doors have different patterns on each side, with each side appropriate to the room it faces. The art is very interesting and includes several huge tapestries, many fine pieces from Asia, and even some Rodin and an El Greco painting. It's always fun in a place like this to think about the family and their personal tastes and try to trace threads of that through the different pieces. Outside there's a small cafe, and also a garden around back."

It did not disappoint. $20 pesos admission, $1.34 USD. It was very interesting with original furniture, paintings and sculptures. There are explanations written in English and Spanish.

You can sit at the side of a little pool under the shade of the trees when less than two block from noisy Las Heras Avenue and by Libertador. Don't hesitate, just go and visit."

I think there is a charge but as we arrived fairly late we were allowed entry for free- nice! I particularly liked the main reception hall, designed in a late Renaissance Spanish style. All the rooms are good but in some more inventive lighting would be appreciated though I guess the idea is to make them look more as they would have years ago (i.e.a bit depressing) Some very good and important works of art on the walls. There is a very pleasant outdoor cafe by the main entrance, great to visit after you leave the house. Highly recommended."

The fireplace was supposed to be designed by Rodin (there's a model of what it would have looked like) bur WWI got in the way.There is an unusual feature in the basement, and the description was only in Spanish but it looks like an old tomb with a wooden surrounding. I have no idea what it is. Too bad the description was not in English.Some of the art in the building is amazing, Rodin, Caneletto are two names easily recognized. But the other works by lesser known artists are well worth looking at.The miniatures exhibition is phenomenal. Most of the pictures are of unknown persons, but you will find Catherine II of Russia, Charles I and II of England, Admiral Nelson and Napolean. In one of the bedrooms you will also find Napolean II's death mask.After the visit, take 5 in the cafe on the grounds."

There isn\u2019t a great deal of information provided to explain the contents of each room, but the collection of unique works generally speaks for itself. I spent a pleasant afternoon wandering through the different rooms and taking everything in. In the basement, there was also an interesting retrospective of the work of a modern Argentine artist. There was also some sort of fashion competition taking place, with dresses on display by several local designers.

It was the so called \"Belle \u00c9poque\" and Buenos Aires was considered the Paris of South Am\u00e9rica! In 1932, this lovely residence was converted into a museum and has its doors opened to visitors since then. The mansion itself is a real gem! Gracious and full of history. The collection is nice, but since many paintings, sculptures, furnitures and objects were donated to the Museum by different philanthropists, the task of harmonizing so many different items is not an easy one. These items could be much better assembled and exposed, with the help of competent museologists and set designers. As a matter of fact, the collection as actually exposed, although a fantastic one - item by item, looks pretty much like a \"bric-a-brac\" or a flea market exhibition. But, I really enjoyed visiting MNAD, its premises and collection. Special entry fees for retired citizens! One last remark: MNAD is not far from MALBA Museum (at a walking distance) and you can easily combine both visits on the the same day. Enjoy!"

The Museo Nacional De Arte Decorativo affords a fascinating glimpse into the lifestyle of the Err\u00e1zuriz Alvear family at the height of Argentna's reign as the richest society on the planet. The palatial public rooms of the first level were intended to shock and awe visitors, still resplendent in all their petit Versailles elegance. Walking thru the ballroom one can almost hear the orchestra and the swish of gowns as you gaze into the mirrors that allowed porte\u00f1o high society to bask in the magnificence of their reflection amid the glow of the chandeliers. The welcoming and much simpler Grand Hall offers a welcome respite from all the glitter, reminiscent of the courtyards of a traditional Spanish colonial casa. The upper level rooms are accessed via the Tapestry Gallery that overlooks the Grand Hall and are much more intimate and warm, still quite grand but definitely more home like. The most beautiful of all is the exquisite Sala Art Deco that served as their son's room. This unique room just seems to shimmer and glow, the walls highlighted by stunning J.M. Sert panels and is the only room that reflects the era of the palace's construction. Also noteworthy is the master bedroom and bath with Sr. Err\u00e1zuriz's diplomatic uniform still hanging in the closet. The only element that is missing are the working areas of the house such as the kitchen, wine cellar and staff quarters, as they would offer a more complete image of life in that era. Free concerts are offered on Sundays in the Grand Hall and the caf\u00e9 in the caretakers cottage looked very charming and has outdoor seating as well. The museum also features exhibits of artwork with a very interesting collection of canine bronzes in the ballroom."

The entrance fee to this museum/historic house is very reasonable and it was fascinating to walk around and see how the very wealthy lived in the early 20thC. World War I resulted in the mansion not being entirely completed to plan; however, the collections from France, East Asia and other parts of the world are beautifully maintained and there are many excellent examples of superb craftsmanship. The tapestries and portraits are also wonderful - I found the portrait of the young child (their daughter?) in blue exquisite. Mrs. Erraz\u00fariz died in 1935 and the mansion was bequeathed to the Argentine government. So the National Museum of Decorative Arts was established here in 1937. We combined our visit to the Museo National de Arte Decorativo with the Museo National de Arte Latinoamericano - approximately 15 min walk between the two museums - check opening times as Arte Decorativo opened later on the day we visited. Walking through this very affluent area is interesting in itself eg. lots of dog walkers exercising a range of very pampered pooches! We had planned on having a light lunch at one of the museums but both looked very expensive for what we felt like (a simple sandwich). We walked along the street and found a pleasant little cafe. It would be wise to book at the museum restaurant as it was very busy. A great day out!"

I would put it very near the top of the many Museums of Decorative Arts that I have visited elsewhere on my travels. To begin with, it is a beautiful building in a lovely location. It was first established in 1937 in the actual residence of the wealthy family whose gift it was to the nation. The residence had been constructed by French architects 26 years prior making extensive use of European materials: wood, marble, mirrors etc. It has 4 stories beginning with the cellars, then the ground floor, interiorly endowed with many arches and alcoves, that gives access to a charming courtyard, and above is the first floor where the family lived. The latter two stories are crowned externally, facing the street, by a row of large Corinthian pillars crowned by beautifully decorated stucco images of leaves and flowers, surmounted centrally by a handsomely curved pediment and by large cherubs on each side.The uppermost floor was where the servants were accommodated (quite a change from the British social arrangement of \u201cUpstairs and Downstairs\u201d), and this story contains a continuous balustrade to conceal the windows. The Entrance Hall and Antechamber are richly illustrated on their walls by plaster allegories in the Louis XV style, and enclose the stairs to the next floor. The large Great Hall has an intricately decorated ceiling, large chandeliers, parquet floor, large fireplace, and walls draped by tapestries. It is reminiscent of a 16th Cent. baronial hall. Other notable rooms are the Dining room with Carrara marble, modeled on an equivalent room at the Palace of Versailles; the Ball room decorated in Rococo style; and the Winter room that joins the last two. The ground floor is completed by a room for the lady of the house that again shows a Versailles influence, and another for the master that is decorated by red velvet and contains several major paintings as well as a collection of Japanese lacquers.The collection of paintings and sculpture include major works by El Greco, Manet, Fragonard, Corot and Rodin. It is amplified by a large collection of French and Flemish tapestries, many of which are displayed in a first-floor gallery that surrounds the Great Hall, as well as oriental paintings, vases and jades, and porcelain from various countries of East and West. The Museum is the home of the Argentine Academy of Letters, and concerts are sometimes held in the premises. The caf\u00e9 in the open courtyard is a refreshing delight in the better weather."

The price for admission (20 pesos) makes it one of the best tourist bargains in the city.Its location in the trendy Palermo neighborhood makes it reasonably easy to find and it is a pleasant walk getting there. It is also not too far from a couple of subway stations including the Bulnes and Ag\u00fcero stops.The building itself was almost as nice as the museum. We went in about 45 minutes before closing at dusk and were amazed solely by the appearance of the softly-lit entryway. The fa\u00e7ade was quite impressive. The caf\u00e9, located in a separate building in front of the museum, looked quite elegant and gave off a warm glow as we approached the museum entrance.We only had a short time to see this museum but we unknowingly played into a wonderful aspect of this place as it is 90% visual. One can wander through and simply appreciate the beauty of the displays and not miss that much by not reading the placards if you are short on time. That is not to say that the write-ups were not informative as the couple that we read were certainly useful and, for example, gave a perspective on the history of the house. But the highlight is what one sees, not what one reads.Housed in a mansion built for an upper class family in the early 1900s, the first level of the museum was quite a grand display with a huge great room in the central area with balconies overlooking the room. The rear area behind the great room had several mannequins on display with elegant clothing from different eras (mostly from the early 20th century it seemed). The second level displayed several rooms in period d\u00e9cor with various beautiful pieces of furniture. There were some notable art works on display as well with the most memorable being an El Greco painting of Christ.Overall, this museum was one of the nicer ones we saw in Buenos Aires. If not for El Zaj\u00f3n, I would have dubbed it the best. It is without question worth taking the time to appreciate the architecture and decorative arts that make this museum special. You can also take the opportunity to enjoy Palermo when visiting this museum in order to make your day even more worthwhile."

I had read that it contained over 4,000 objects, but it didn't seem like that many. However, there were some gorgeous tapestries, very nice paintings and sculpture and some historic pieces of furniture. Additionally, there was some Asian art.

On the negative side: the museum has little light and some of the paintings do now have proper lighting. Pictures are not allowed and there are MANY MANY guards who make sure the rule is followed. To be honest... I really disliked their presence. I wonder why the museum does not put a nice and polite sign at the entrance stating that pictures are not allowed. The fee is entirely reasonable.

It would be one of many if it were a National Trust property in Britain, but here it's something special.\nSome nice objects on display including a truly glorious deep-relief ivory carving of literal clouds of angels."

Fascinating details of the house are still intact such as the lovely preserved inlaid wood floors, original art and tapestries on the walls as well as an interesting collection of chinese art. The original owner collected vases and drawings from the Orient. One room, which appears to be a sitting room, was fully constructed in marble - floors, walls and ceiling. Opulent and luxurious indeed as everything was imported from France and Italy! One disappointing factor was there was no guide at 2:30 when the website said there would be one. Apparently the guide did not show up that day! We had lunch at the french bistro in the courtyard and it was quite nice - croque monsieur!"

While you are walking round a Paris inspired mansion, built with all the finest materials from Europe, you are also looking at some of the finest works of art from Europe & the Orient too. The family had money and were big collectors! The great hall is awesome. Instructions were given that it had to be built large enough to hang 3 wonderful tapestries which had been bought before the house was started. The tasteful piped music helps you imagine the great occasions that must have been held in this room. As to the art - there are several statues by Rodin and upstairs in what was one of the bedrooms there is reportedly one of the most important collections of miniatures. In every room there is an English description of what the room was used for and/or go on an excellent guided tour for their very informative insight into the house & the art. We were tempted to list some of the amazing individual items - but say instead ..... go look for yourself - definitely worth a visit"

This is one that you can actually get into to see how the other half of Argentine society lived. The house and a great part of the collection belonged to one family and was given to the state. It has largely been kept intact. The woodwork and the floors are outstanding. The collection of decorative arts is modest, but the the numerous tapestries are noteworthy. When you walk into the Great Hall, it just takes your breath away. As a museum director I have seen more than my fair share of decorative arts collection and this one measures up to others-albeit modestly. You have to hunt for the oriental art exhibit and the staff was not particularly helpful in pointing out what there is to see in the museum. There are no wayfinding guides. Since the cost is so low, it is certainly worth a visit.  The museum shop was interesting in that EVERYTHING was in locked cabinets and the shop staff were completely ignoring patrons who walked into the space. One was reading a newspaper and the other had her back to the shop doing some sort of paperwork and did not even look up. It is bad merchandising theory to not have items out for people to pick up and touch. It helps people make the decision to buy. We had pesos and were willing to part with some of them, but the lack of staff attention and the locked cases made our pesos stay in our pockets."

Quoting from the brochure: \"The museum's heritage consists of more than 5,000 pieces of art, including tapestries from the 15th to the 18th Centuries, as well as paintings made by El Greco, J.H. Fragonard, E. Boudin, J.B. Corot, E. Manet and sculptures made by P. Chinard, A. Rodin, A. Bourdelle, O. Zadkine and A. Lagos. Furthermore, the museum exhibits a prominent collection of European furniture from the 15th to the 19th Centuries and the most important collection of European miniature portraits conserved in Latin America.\" We also enjoyed champagne and a light snack at the museum's outside cafe which added to this very pleasant experience."

Walking through this house really gives you a taste of what Buenos Aires luxury was like, and looking at all the well-preserved artifacts was great also! Right outside the front door, on the grounds, there is a small, very charming cafe! Definitely recommend this place!"

The attraction of this museum is the building it is housed in; an enormous and well-preserved mansion of the kind middle-class mortals don't usually get to see inside. It's amazing to get to see into the kind of palace you will be passing all the time along the streets of Recoleta. The exhibits themselves are nothing special and are mainly there as furnishings for the house."

Large doors, amazing woodwork, etc. It is worth the admission price just to see the home. Just outside in front is a small cafe.My opinion:If you have the time, then be sure to see this museum.
