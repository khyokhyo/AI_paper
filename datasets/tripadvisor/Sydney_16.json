On arrival it's clear Doyle's has the immediate monopoly on dining, with a wharf cafe (incl. takeaway options if you want to picnic in the park across the road) and then both mid and high class cafe/restaurants almost exclusively serving seafood. The walk up to Gap Bluff is comfortable and certainly the 360-degree views are well with any effort. A couple more cafes near the bluff looked good, but closed on Monday - which was a shame for us. Buses back to city via scenic suburbs are easy to catch, else jump straight back on the ferry."

I reached there by ferry from circular quey. Onetime, this island was actually fishermen village. Some lonely beaches along the national park and a light house is situated there. Water sports like snorkeling and Scuba diving on cove beach can also be enjoyed there. I would strongly recommend this island to visit."

We weren't there long, and rain was threatening, but we'll be back again one day to have a longer look. The ferry ride is pretty good too."

The ferry across to Watson's Bay was a magical (and cost effective) way to get a full perspective of the sheer size and magnificence of Sydney Harbour. Ferry was a supercat, so it only took 13 minutes from Circular Quay to Watson's Bay Wharf, with lovely views of Neutral, Double and Rose Bays on the way.Once at the bay, we braved the cold day for a quick paddle, then walked up to the Gap (just a few minutes stroll from the wharf). The view from here was amazing, all the way out to North Heads and south towards Bondi, and east across the Tasman sea. There are a number of walks leaving from here that explored the headland and are well signed.Back at the Wharf we queued with heaps of other tourists for our takeaway fish & chips from Doyles. The food was good, but we may have been better to eat up at the restaurant on the promenade, as the wharf shop was incredibly busy. We then bussed from Watson's Bay back to the CBD...enjoying interesting views of the palatial Vaucluse and Rose Bay homes on the way. A lovely day out."

Plenty of indoor eating options if the park is not your thing. Doyle's looked gorgeous."

We took the ferry service over, and enjoyed a day walking the trails and learning the history. We especially enjoyed seeing the lighthouse keeper cottages and the lighthouse itself. We were told we'd \"just missed\" some whale activity when we arrived, and we didn't see any while we were there. But I'd imagine that with a pair of binoculars, you could spend hours up there watching (an older gentleman that we met up there doing just that told me the secret was to \"watch where the whale watching boats go.\" Ha! Delightful. We took ferry service back (which was much busier than ferry service in), but still very easy."

Catch the 380 bus service from Bondi Beach or the ferry from Circular Quay. Both trips give you great views. Watson Bay offers great food and drink choices as well as a start point for different walks on the South Head. From the bus stop or ferry terminal, a short walk to the Gap gives you views over the Harbour to the west and out to sea in the east. You can then follow the walking tracks to South Head taking in more stunning views but if you are like me, you can return to the restaurants and bars at Watson Bay for a cool one and some food.Keep an eye on the ferry times and remember that if you are travelling on the Opal card, its only the Sydney ferries you can use. Two important things to note. Their time table and touch on machines are at the beginning of the jetty. You have to touch on before going onto the jetty to catch the ferry. You cannot \"touch on\" on the ferry itself. I saw so many people running back down jetty having been told that by the crew member on the ferry. Second thing is that there are lots of other ferry services calling at the jetty and these services have a myriad of timetable posters near the boarding gates. But the Opal card is not accepted on these services so you must refer to the Sydney Ferry timetable near the touch on machines.Bit long to explain, but a good couple of tips for this lovely little place which shouldn't be missed, even if you only have a day in town."

It is easy to get to from the Sydney Ferry.Watson Bay has spectacular 360 degree views of Sydney Harbour, the Sydney skyline and Cliffs and the Tasmanian Sea.Last time we just went to the top of Gap Bluff to look around. This time we hiked along the Cliff Walk in both directions, both towards Horny Lighthouse and towards Macquarie Lighthouse. The trails have some steep spots but are not outrageously difficult. You just need to be on decent shape to handle the entire cliff tops hike, which is about 5 miles total.If you have a half a day to kill this is great place to visit."

It was a short 15min walk from the wharf and the walk towards the lighthouse is very enjoyable. If you have some time, you can sit on one of the rocks and enjoy the cooling seabreeze - very therapeutic. I took a nice ferry ride from Circular Quay to Watson's Bay. The journey was approximately 30min and one can use Opal Card for the travel. Do note that if you take the ferry on Sunday, the price is 50% of the usual."

Originally was a fishing village but now is one of the most expensive area's of real estate in Sydney. Watson's Bay and nearby Vaucluse are situated on a peninsula with ocean on one side and harbour on other. Public transport from city is either via the 325 bus from circular quay or a public ferry. Both scenic options. Spend a day and make certain you walk to the \"GAP\" a popular ocean cliff face often unfortunately used for suicide, stroll along harbour side to Camp Cove and enjoy a swim or venture further along toward south head to Lady Jane beach where nude bathing is permitted. Doyle's famous seafood restaurants are located on the Watson's Bay public ferry wharf or on the beach. The boutique Watson's Bay hotel also has a great beer garden for a leisurely lunch with spectacular views of the harbour. Enjoy one of my favourite places in the world."

We sat at the jetty area and had fish and chips and other seafood at Doyle's on the Wharf. The food was really good and fresh, and top that off with the stunning view, it makes a great afternoon. After lunch, take a short stroll up the hill towards The Gap as you digest your food. And walk off more calories by walking even further up the gap path towards the lookout for some amazing scenery of the ocean and the cliffs. It'll make the short walk worthwhile!"

Great find!! can't remember where it is though. If it's summer and your heading this way, pack your swimmers. Worth the walk and the best swim with the view of the city.From memory, once off the ferry, turn left at the end of the wharf and walk along the water front then right up the stairs the try and keep walking left until you reach a very small park, walk through the park and there's a beach at the end."

So the boat for Watsons Bay was about leave so we thought let's take a punt with our water based oyster cards!Our trip was back in January, which explains why it was extremely busy. First stop was Rose Bay, followed by Watsons. When we got off, couldn't help but notice Doyles, but it was ram jam packed. So we followed it round the corner and bought some delicious fish and chips at the side of Watsons Bay Boutique Hotel. Again it was so busy to eat in the seating area, so we just crossed the road into the park and indulged whilst watching the world go by.So then we walk through the heart of the park, up the steps and turned left towards the view point. The Gap look out is the best part of this trip, watching hard waves crash into the landscape time after time does not get as boring as you think. Maybe, just maybe it was possible that we viewed the Tasman Sea at its finest..."

A gorgeous park runs down to the bay, with lots of seating, and space for the kiddies to run around.

We had a stroll around Watson's Bay, light and superb lunch in Doyle's on the beach watching the boats and ferries and then took the short walk along the front to a lovely, sheltered beach which we had almost to ourselves. We spent the afternoon there swimming, sunbathing, reading and watching boats and birds then , as the sun was setting, we walked back to the bar on the jetty which was buzzing and had a drink or two before boarding the ferry back to Sydney, viewing the city from the water once again but this time at dusk.

Here there are numerous little tenders upside down waiting to be used to carry the owners out to the yachts in the bay. It was a Thursday therefore very quite.

The staff were pleasant & friendly. the fish was a little dry (Hake often is when encased in batter) but overall well worth the cost.

Had caught the bus down from Bond as planned on going to Doyle's and after hopping off the bus just kept walking around. The weather in October was perfect and the area so calm, what started as a short walk ended with over an hour just spent enjoying the band, water and view. I had no idea how it all fitted together but seeing Sydney off in the distance over the soothing water helped place it all"

Great for naval history. You can buy take away fish and chips and eat in the park or on the sand. Or pack your own picnic lunch. You can catch the bus from Bondi Junction or you can take the ferry from Circular Quay. I recommend you come by one mode of transport and leave by the other so you cna experience both views of the harbour and the ocean."

It was an excellent way to see Sydney from the water and to get outside of Sydney. Once at Watson's Bay we walked up to Hornby Lighthouse. Beautiful views of the bay and Sydney off in the distance. Back down at the pier you can get something to eat or enjoy the park while you wait for the next ferry back to Sydney. A nice relaxing way to enjoy your time in Sydney."

There is a pleasant green near the harbour.I can see this would be very popular with older travellers, but within an hour we were done and ready to get back on the ferry.You get great views from the waterside restaurants and there are some nice cafes. The last boat back is not long after 4pm, otherwise it is an extended bus ride.In summary - pleasant but sleepy, good for older travellers, otherwise don't go unless you're in Sydney for an extended period."

We got off the ferry and cut through the park up to The Gap. You can walk along the cliff paths either to the left or right. We went right until the path ended and then walked back towards the ferry. We happened upon a great restaurant, Dunbar House, where we stopped and had a well deserved drink on the veranda. We were able to have drinks without reservations because we promised to vacate our table by 12:15 when people with reservations were coming in. By then it was time to head to Doyles for our 12:30 reservation. Had a fabulous meal along the water's edge and then took the ferry back to Sydney."

Come to that don't go anywhere in Sydney on Sunday......Very busy place, but surely not as busy as Manly Beach because at least here you can get on the ferry without waiting for two hours.Very pleasant parkland behind the beach. The beach is not big but you can easily find places to sit if you want.Several places to eat, I recommend the place right by where you come off the ferry from Circular Quay, a nice bit of barra with chips and not overpriced.Do it of the Manly Ferry is way to busy on a Sunday."

We never left the dock, so I can't comment on the area shops at this stop. I think stopping at these Bays are more about the journey. So many boats & water toys all over the bay. Note to file, however -- we went to Manly a Bay first. There is not a public ferry between Manly & Watsons. We had to pay separately for that ferry, & then rode the public ferry from Watson's to Sydney Harbour via Rose Bay. If I get back here, I'm going to ride in one of those sea planes!"

Having visited Watson's Bay several times previously, enjoying stopping off for fish and chips, and walking the length of the bay, my husband and I decided to do something different this time. We walked up to the cliffs through the park where a fabulous view of Sydney city can be seen. We continued south until we came to the huge Dunbar anchor where fiifty years ago my photo was taken sitting in the same anchor. We kept walking south until we reached the highest point, with spectacular ocean and cliff views the entire way. Then on the way back we walked downhill through a delightful rainforest, which I had never seen before. When back to the main road, we had a light lunch sitting outside at a small cafe across the road from the bus stops, then decided on the spur of the moment to catch one of the buses back to the city instead of going by boat. We would highly recommend the cliff walk at Watson's Bay- if one is more ambitious, the walk goes up a steeper way to the north side."

Take the ferry from Circular Quay to Watson's Bay and go to Doyle's for the fish and chips. Have them with some of their wonderful Chablis (the wine list is wonderful) and take in the view. The ferry ride back will be good for the digestion."

The ferries to and from are packed as are all the places that are recommended in Watsons Bay. Of course we had Doyle's Fish and Chips for lunch (the queue is very long) and sat in the park. Some of the party took a walk up to the lighthouse while others just stayed at the beach. It was a lovely outing with the family and will be taking more visitors to Sydney."

For those who prefer to wade into the water, there is access to do so, with comfortable seats to sit on and trees providing shade. There are a number of restaurants and cafes.

The ferry will take about twenty minutes and the coastal route will take you past some of the other lovely bays around Sydney. Watson's bay has a fine sandy beach with bars and restaurants lining the front. These establishments serve excellent food and it seems to be a hang out for some of the Sydney 'smart set'. If you need to walk off a lunch, or some liquid refreshment, there is a path that will lead you up and around the next bay to the lighthouse. Here you will have a smashing view of the mouth of the harbour and out to the sea. The walk can be managed by anyone with even modest fitness/mobility."

There are some good places to take picture of sea platforms. It seems they are man-made but indeed are natural."

Well, no, not Watsons Bay itself but the Cider Festival that's run here in October.Just came back from it and it's a shocker. $25 each if you pay in advance on line or $35 if you roll up on the day. For that you get a card with the names of around a dozen companies and it gets you a 50ml cup of each cider from each stall. That's an amount I would expect if I was sampling wine, not cider.If you're lucky, they may have a couple of varieties and if you're lucky you may get to sample more than one. Otherwise what you paid will get you between one and two schooners worth of cider. We were there about midday and it was relatively easy to have a sample. But within an hour, the crowds were such that it was close to a 10 minute wait for your small helping.After trying about 7 or 8 of the companies who were there, the wait became intolerable and we left. There was then a queue of people about 50m long waiting to get their cards. Little did they know how long they'd have to wait for a drink.He's some tips to whoever is running it. Offer tokens so that you can try a cider you like more than once. Get the crowds away from the stalls as soon as they've had their sample. Spread the stalls out so that there's some room between them. Make it compulsory that each stall has enough staff to serve the cider. There were 5 of us who went (and we went last year as well). There's five who won't be going next year. And I'd bet that none of those queuing to get in will be back either."

I suggest you do the slow ferry to Manly Beach before you do this faster ferry to Watsons Bay, or you'll be spoiled for speed:) There are scheduled stops at Garden island, Darling Point, Double Bay & Rose Bay. Taking the bus from Bondi Junction isn't half as fun as the ferry to Watsons Bay. Walking from Watsons Bay wharf, a few cuckatoos peck around the park on your way to The Gap. The fresh water drinking station is at the park's entrance, and the public restrooms are midway to your left by the shelter. It's a 10-minute walk uphill but The Gap provides magnificent views of the crashing waters. For a nature lover on a gorgeous day, it's stunning."

It has a big park without a lot of facilities. To buy some snacks or drinks/water, you do not have many stalls available. Restaurant are nice, well damn expensive and they do not provide the view. And as always, which is getting on my nerves in Oz, the so called Beach club is NOT on the beach and is a place for packing people.

Enjoy the fabulous views along the harbour until you get to Watsons Bay. Alight from the ferry and find a spot. No table free, no matter, you have your picnic rug!!! You have a bonus situation where you can add to your fabulous spread by buying fresh seafood from the canteen on the wharf. Watch your children as they frolic in the lovely beach with no big waves but just sparkling water!!At around 4pm catch the ferry back to Circular Quay and head on home with a tired but happy family!!!"

Take the ferry from Circular Quay and hop off at Watson's Bay. Treat yourself to an over-priced lunch or a drink in the iconic surroundings of the Watson's Bay pub. Once you've done that, grab a bus back to the city and gawk at all the houses and money-laden places on the way. A great way to spend a few hours."

I went on the ferry on a beautiful winter day and met family members who have three young daughters aged 2- 6 years old at the open garden of the hotel opposite the wharf for a relaxed and casual lunch followed by play on the beach and among tree roots a short walk to a superb gelati shop and of course lots of fun. There is a playground but it was not of interest to the girls. I know if some of the young boys in the family had been there it would have been one of the exciting aspects of the day. Some families bought take away fish and chips and not doubt some went more up market to dine at Doyles. There was a massive queue for the return ferry so I took the bus on a long meander back to the city. Highly recommended."

It about 20min in ferry to reach watson's bay Gap.It one of the most scenic place in sydney, as you can get the Sydney city view from the opposite end at watson's bay. The Gap is an ocean cliff on the South Head peninsula in eastern Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. The area, which faces the Tasman Sea, is located in the eastern suburb of Watsons Bay.In 1857 the sailing ship Dunbar carrying 63 passengers and 59 crew struck the rocky cliff at the foot of The Gap.The Dunbar's anchor was recovered more than fifty years later and placed on the cliffs at Watsons Bay with a memorial tablet.The place has exhilirating views of sydney and has a nice cliff walk to enjoy. Good family fun with children."

Nonetheless I feel I can give an unbiased review of its delights. Firstly, it is very popular on weekends and school holidays, so avoid peak periods if you don't like crowds. I also recommend public transport, parking is limited and scarce. A ferry from Circular Quay is a delightful adventure on it own and you can return by ferry (or bus, via Bondi Beach if you have time or a more direct route if you don't). Watsons Bay provides much for everyone.Takeaway \"Fish and Chips\" at Doyle's is good value for money and you can sit in Robertson Park and enjoy harbour views while you eat. There are a couple of upmarket eateries, including the original Doyle's, the Hotel and cafes in \"The Village\" on Military Road. The famous and notorious \"Gap\" is worth a look and if you are reasonably fit and up to a couple of hours walking, follow the road to delightful Camp Cove beach (coffee shop and toilets) and the walk to South Head and see the delightful Hornby Light, gun emplacements (relics of man's warlike nature), the light house keepers house and SPECTACULAR views of Sydney Harbour, Manly and the Heads. You may return to your bed exhausted, but utterly sated from the visual and culinary delights. Take water and a sun hat/cream.Slip, slop, slap, is great advice in Australia. Slip on a shirt, Slop on the 30+ sunscreen, Slap on a hat, Seek shade or shelter, Slide on some sunnies and sip to stay hydrated."

Once there, scale the cliffs for spectacular views, ocean and city skyline. Stop at the Watsons Bay Hotel and enjoy a drink and a meal or visit Doyles fish restaurant ( bookings recommended ). Alternatively take a stroll through the narrow streets of Watsons Bay and enjoy the lovely architecture, both modern and historic. A lovely beach on the Sydney Harbour side is a mecca for divers or simply plonk yourself on the beach and eat your fish and chips and watch the flotilla of yachts and boats go past. Very Sydney !"

Line up and get your fish and chips and then you can eat on the green or better still sit down and eat your lunch in Doyles behind where you queued. You can order a drink at the bar. The a la carte Doyles is about 40 yards away. You get a generous portion of fish and chips, a segment of lemon and a sachet of plum sauce. Soft drinks AU$3.20...do try Kirks Ginger Beer!"

Whether you have lunch at the hotel or fish and chips looking over the harbour, it really is a lovely way to spend a few hours. We visited on a fine Sunday afternoon in June and understadibly it was very crowded. Summertime l would definately recommend booking if you want a sitdown meal. We had a delicious reasonably priced, take away seafood basket from the kiosk on the pier. Finding a seat overlooking the beach we thought this really is a little slice of heaven. Ferries come and go to Circular quay frequently."

Perfect spot for picnic. Went further in and found a few restaurants selling fish and chips. The beach has a some rubbishes laying all around. The food served was alright. A little bland if not for the sauce provided. However, the fish and calamari were really fresh and good. Had gelato after meal and the flavours were rich and unique.

The Ferry service is busy in the weekends and you may not get on your ride first up, sometimes there is a queque to get on the boat. Services do cease early in the afternoon so depending on the time of year you visit, you will need to be aware of the last Ferry service out of Watsons Bay. There are a number of eateries there to choose from, Doyles restaurant and take away are both good choices. You can sit in the park and enjoy the harbour views, or go for a stroll along the beach. The area is certainly worth while on a fine sunny day. This will not disappoint you."

The fish and chips were excellent and clearly had been prepared as we waited, lovely Aussie beer and beautiful sunshine - what more to you need. Except, it was ANZAC day and the NSW Police pipe band were playing - for a Scotsman that was awesome. Walked up and viewed the harbour entrance and the ocean - amazing. Well worth the trip."

A really fun circuit tour in Sydney that is inexpensive and healthy is the Bondi Beach-Watson's Bay-Circular Quay circuit. From downtown you can either take the #378 bus to Bronte Beach from the Central Station, or take the metro to Bondi Junction and catch the bus there. The end of the line is at the south end of Bronte Beach, at the beginning of the Bronte to Bondi Beach Walk, a 6 km formal finished exercise trail along the beaches and cliffs that is easy and fun for any reasonably healthy person. From Bondi Beach, you can catch the #380 bus to Camp Cove on Watson's Bay. There you can stop for ice cream and lunch at Doyle's Restaurant on the wharf. The ferries leave from the wharf back to Circular Quay giving you a first class tour of the harbor, the Opera House and the the bay on the way, and all for the price of a normal daily transit pass. Of course, it is best to do this on a day with nice weather. Don't forget to take you camera. One caveat is that the last ferry from Watson's Bay leaves fairly early around 5 PM, so if you stay late there for dinner, you have to take the bus back to the city..."

Watsons bay is an old fishing village, with quaint historic houses, beautiful walks, old gum trees, a view of the harbour and a real holiday feel to it. Seagulls fighting for your fish and chips and a fabulous harbour pool to swim in, jump off the jetty. It's also minutes from Camp Cove a treasure of a beach."

The day was cloudy, but still spectacular views back to the bridge and the city. The food was superb, the location spectacular, the staff excellent and altogether it was a wonderful experience for all my friends from Bali, UK and Adelaide.."

Sun sparkling in Sydney Harbour, the homes of the rich and famous, with pleasure crafts, ferries and cruiseships passing by, you will feel you are living a glamorous life.Watsons Bay Hotel on the outside deck upstairs is the picture postcard view of the city skyline to enjoy over oysters and seafood. You can also get take away fish and chips near the wharf and sit under the trees, tourists head to Doyle's but it is overpriced and very touristy, so I cannot recommend it.Take off your shoes and walk along the beach, feel the sand under your toes.There is a good walk to the Hornwby lighthouse then back along he area known as The Gap. Sadly this is a suicide spot on the top of dramatic cliffs.You can get a return ferry trip, but I would recommend catching a bus back to the city as it meanders past other greqt views of the harbour and gives you a real insight into the mix of Sydney suburbs. You can also get off at Bondi Junction for some high end shopping then catch a train back to the city.The Watsons Bay Ferry half an hour before sunset will give you the killer views of Sydney backlit."

Avert your children's eyes from the nudist beach which is nearly hidden below the cliff walk. After about 20 mins you will be rewarded with great views across the ocean.

One of three places in Sydney I would recommend for Fish-n-Chips is Doyles (Boatshed at Glebe, and Balmoral Beach being the other two), but you need to book, particularly on weekends and in Summer. Worth the walk to Camp Cove, and to the Green Point Reserve lookout on the hill (between Watson's Bay and Camp Cove) which provides a spectacular view back towards the city, and is a great place for an impromptu picnic for those who would prefer to \"do it themselves\"). There is a small carpark at Green Point Reserve for those travelling by car.The Gap (a lookout towards the sea) is a short walk up the hill from Doyles and Watson's Bay, and worth a look (a nice view, but 30 seconds later you will tick that one off the list and move on).Including lunch, allow a good 3 hours in the Watson's Bay area. For tourists, this is a nice place than Bondi and will let you mix with more locals and experience the \"real\" Sydney."

Sunsets over the water, boats in the bay, stunning waterside venues, and views of the city curtained by the cliffs... it is surely one of the most beautiful little seaside spots in the world. I highly recommend spending a long afternoon in the Watsons Bay Hotel beer garden, or - if you'd like to enjoy some very nice seafood as the waves lap at the shore just metres from your table - Doyles at the Beach."

Well, we ate at the Harbor just before we got on the boat, unfortunately and couldn't take advantage of this opportunity, so for us, please give it a go! We've heard it is well worth it! Moving on to the island.....the guide on the boat mentioned to be sure to go to the far side of the island, but didn't really tell us what to expect! Well you are in for a treat! Follow the sidewalk up to The Gap fore some absolutely gorgeous views! Completely different landscape from the side you come in on. Over thousands of years the limestone has been eroded by the waters coming in from the Tasmanian Sea and has created some breathtaking views. Looking back the other way you see Sydney in the distance. Well worth spending a few hours here walking around and perhaps having a frozen yogurt in the park. A beautiful place to enjoy!"

Get there early as this place gets 'rammed'. Its a great place for lunch where you can drink and dine al fresco. It ain't cheep though!A must is to walk to Camp Cove Take your swimmers if you want to spend some time on the beach - safe swimming - or if you've left them at the hotel go onto Lady Jane Beach where clothing is optional), take the steps at the northern end and walk to South Head (a Mission:Impossible film had its baddie's lair here btw) and watch the boats on the harbour from the cliff edge. Wave to the seaplane as he flies over you to Rose Bay. See if you can see the white obelisks on the far side of the harbour and work out what use they have.Have fun. A great place to visit."

He suggested we eat lunch at the famous Doyles Restaurant. We did this and the fish was to die for. All seafood in Oz is absolutely fantastic and cannot be beaten. Don't miss it. We sat and looked across at the Sydney skyline (there is a ferry that will take you across to circular Quays). Then we went for a walk along the beach and were facinated to see trees at the top of the path that were so stunning we had to go and look. Some were 3 metres in diameter and the roots appear to come from about two thirds down the tree and grow above ground. Quite spectacular, my camera never stopped clicking. We then had tea and scones in a beautiful old property whilst we decided how to make our way back. We decided to go local and take the bus. Lovely trip, past a lighthouse. It took about half an hour and dropped us right at Bondi Beach where we headed for The Bucket List. One of our favourite haunts. (A bar and restaurant right on the beach. Serves everything from iced water - free - to jugs of sangria and everything inbetween. The food is also terrific) Check it out. All in all the perfect end to a truly perfect day."

Well, we did and we loved it. There is not much to it - some stunning views, a small beach, restaurant, fish & chip shop and cafe, and some coastal walks - but that is part of its charm. I did hear that there is now a nearby nudist beach but by the time we arrived I was too hungry to care!You can get there by car, bus or ferry (from circular quay) , a journey that takes approx. 30 minutes but we had spent the morning at Bondi beach, which is only a short bus journey away, and headed off to Watson's Bay to sightsee and enjoy lunch at Doyles, a famous seafood restaurant on the beach. The restaurant attracts a lot of hype but it certainly lives up to it as the atmosphere is delightful, the food (and choice) is fantastic and the service is all you would expect from a place with such a great reputation. It is pricey but, in my view, you get what you pay for here and we enjoyed a delicious lunch washed down with a bottle of wine for $127AU. A bit out of the way but well worth the effort."

The Dunbar was wrecked off the Gap, the gap is a notorious place for people hurling themselves off the edge in an effort to defeat their problems (?), the Watsons Bay Hotel is a great place to eat, especially the seafood. The Royal Australian Navy have their facility, HMAS Watson up on South Head and there is the South Head Light House. It is the start of the coastal walk to Maroubra Beach."

            "review": "Outstanding experience for visitors...... ....but not most jaded Sydney siders.Having lived in Sydney's eastern suburbs for a very long time, I can confirm Watsons Bay is universally loved by visitors to Sydney. Like a little enclave protected from the hustle and bustle that seems to impact most of Sydney.On a sunny day, there are no better experiences. The large park that adjoins the hotel and wharf is outstanding and always filled with kids, families and picnickers eating some fish and chips from the hotel. We generally take our kids early on a nice day considering parking is atrocious.The beach, being a harbour beach, is well protected and where we taught our children to swim and catch the small waves. Never crowded and always a joy.Heading east, the beach adjoining the RAN base is spectacular but better suited to adults. Being a little more exposed to the heads, the water can be choppy and rougher.The walk along the refurbished gap is absolutely spectacular. For the uninitiated, the posters advertising 'Lifeline' can be confronting and a constant reminder that this beautiful site is where some poor souls choose to end their visit permanently. However, if you can see past that, you will enjoy some of the closest and most spectacular views of the heads and the waves far below.We always finish a visit with a lunch at Watsons Bay Hotel, either in the fairly recently refurbished beer garden, which is convivial and usually packed on a sunny day, or at the adjoining Doyle's seafood restaurant. The pub is relaxed with greatly upgraded food quality yet family friendly and not overly pricey. Doyle's is pricey and despite it not being the best example of seafood in Sydney, I am yet to bring a visitor to Sydney here that did not fall in love with the location, literally steps from the sand.We sometimes use Watsons Bay as a launch point for exploring other parts of the harbour with the great ferry access it provides. 10 minutes on a ferry gets you to the CBD or to Manly so it's a wonderfully well positioned location.The only downside is the poorly available parking, which has been the case for the last 20 years. You'll also find some jaded Sydneysiders reflecting poorly on it - we have so many options to enjoy the water in Sydney it's not everyone's cup of tea. However, if the reaction from ever visitor I've taken is any gauge, it's a special location with something for everyone."

When getting of at the Watson's Bay wharf we encountered several steps which were not wide enough to turn or wheel my sons wheelchair. Luckily there were a few of us and we managed to bounce the chair on and off these steps.Watson's Bay is a picturesque bay with a few specialty fish and chips shops and local stores. From the bay you can walk up to see the ocean and Sydney heads. The view is magnificent, but again not really suited for non electric wheelchairs. The ramps are quite steep and there are stairs throughout all the walkways.Take your time and ensure you stop at the anchor of the shipwreck, the Dunbar.The ferry leaves and returns to Circular Quay and will cost around $24 a person or less if you can get hold of an Opal Card."

Take the scenic route through Rose Bay and wind up the back roads to Watson's Bay and you'll see the streets lined with old limestone buildings built back in the 1800s. There is some magnificent history in Sydney, you just have to look for it.Get to Watson's Bay and good luck with finding a car park. There's not a lot of shops or the typical 'touristy' bars and things there, that's not to say there isn't a pizza shop and Doyle's Fish and Chips by the water is a popular spot, but people come here for the beach and the walk through Watson's Point.Walk through the park and then turn left past Doyle's. Keep heading in the same direction through some side streets and you'll find yourself at the little beach at the end of the road. It's a highly popular spot with the typical Sydney beach posers, but irrespective, it's nothing like Bondi. The water is clean and there's very little waves, so you can swim out into the depths without any major concerns. A really refreshing spot to cool down and absorb some sunshine.After cooling down at the beach, we decided to take the walk to the lighthouse. On the way I noticed another little beach, down what seemed a very steep cliff face. Upon looking further I started to notice the people down there\u2026NAKED! Yep, all naked! A nudist beach! HAHA! I found one. Now as much as I'm all for the freedom to show your naked body, I wasn't quite prepared for all the bums and doodles and big bellies that beamed up at me in their naked glory, so I stepped up my pace and found myself looking across at Manly from the cliff face of Watson's Point. This whole area is really well maintained with lots of historical spots to read about on the way. The lighthouse is magnificent with it's red and white nautical stripes, and there are a heap of concrete trenches and gorges where old canons used during the war still lay. Quite a frightening reality to realise that Sydney had been invaded and it all got that close to our shores.Watson's Bay is a lovely day out, I recommend bringing a nice packed lunch and making a whole day of it. Taking your time to relax by the beach, have a light lunch in the park, then making your way along the path the winds you around the scenic view of the Point. A lovely place to visit."

We were seated overlooking the harbour with spectacular views across the water to the city and beyond. Although there was a big crowd everyone was attended to in a timely fashion with smiles all round! A must do when in Sydney!"

You have a choice of restaurant, pub or takeaway for food. The park is perfect for a picnic. Pick up a seafood boxed lunch from the shop at the wharf and relax with views across the harbour to the city. The park is great for kids too with plenty of space to run around and a great playground. Then walk off your lunch by heading up to The Gap and following the path up the hill to North Head for views across the entrance to the harbour. We have seen whales frolicking just off shore here! Lovely day out!"

Lots of young families appear to enjoy the beach location to take their children for a swim. Lovely park to sit under a shady tree with a picnic or to eat your fish and chips from Doyle's take away. There is a rather lovely looking tea house at the end of the bay and we tried to get a table there but it was busy. We took the bus home to our hotel near Hyde Park. That was an interesting ride as you got to see lots of harbour side houses and suburbs. It takes about 40 minutes but the bus is air conditioned and comfortable."

The Sydney to Hobart boat race starts on Boxing Day just near Watson's Bay so we took the ferry over there and walked out towards the headland. Watson's Bay itself is a nice little place with a couple of restaurants - apparently Doyles is the best fish and chip place but we didn't try it out ourselves. We found a great place to view the race and would come back the next time we are in Sydney to walk on out to the headland and the lighthouse. We used the normal ferry which gave us wonderful views of Sydney Harbour, the Bridge and the Opera House. The ferry crossing was about 30 minutes. A lovely place for a day trip."

The tip is to go in the late afternoon before the sun sets and you will get the most wonderful sunset photos of Sydney as the sun actually sets behind the skyscrapers and bridge in the distance from where you stand. Another tip, the fish and chips here on the wharf (I believe they are famous doyles brand) are wonderful and not too expensive either! Grab yourself some fish and chips, have a picnic in the park here, then walk up to the lookout for those incredible sunset views. Whatever you do do NOT forget your camera!"

The Watsons Bay faces towards the city with the sky scrapers in the distance and offers a truly amazing view perfect for photography. We timed our visit to coincide with sunset (I recommend you do the same) and we got to see the sun set behind the city with glorious oranges and reds filling the sky. Very relaxing place with a nice little beach there also (although I didn't see anybody swimming it looked very clean). I can recommend this place to anybody visiting Sydney and looking for a nice day/afternoon out.

You just catch the ferry here from Circular Quay (they run quite regularly but not super regularly). There is a lovely peaceful beach here also a park where you can eat fish and chips from the nearby fish and chips shop (I got the grilled fish highly recommended) but the best thing about this place is the VIEW. Lovely view looking to the City with the harbour bridge there in background. Tip - make sure you go in the late afternoon and you may well get the most incredible sunset setting over the city. Lovely for photos!!! Definitely recommend this place!"

This is just the best part of Sydney Watson's Bay Hotel for accommodation and great fish and chips for lunch, a huge Robertson Park with play area and of course great ocean swimming pool.We regularly visit Watson's Bay you can take a picnic or plenty of places to grab something to eat. Ferries come in regularly so there are surges at food outlets, so timing is everything. Car parking is limited and fills early in the day in Summer. Short walk up to the Gap with great views of the Ocean and back over toward Sydney Harbour Bridge. Don't forget to duck into Watson's Bay Anglican Church for the lovely stained glass windows.Just the best place sit relax and enjoy the best of Sydney."

Getting there is an easy c.15 minute ferry ride from Circular Quay (ferry route 7) and one can use a pre-pay Opal card (just don't forget to tap out....I learned this the hard way!)Once in Watson's Bay, you'd find a small, quaint neighbourhood with a beach and a few restaurants. There appear to be a couple of options to eat ranging from nicer (Doyles) to the Beach Club.Overall, if you have a couple hours to kill and you want to \"get out\" of Sydney, it's worth a look."

Get the ferry over from the city which is a lovely experience in itself, walk out to South Head or at least up to The Gap, depending on the budget grab takeaway fish n chips to enjoy in the park, or join in the atmosphere at the Watsons Bay Hotel. My US guests were shocked when a 'pitcher' of beer and 4 x fish n chips came to $125... but it's good food, fast and fun. Next step up is Doyles on the beach which we recently enjoyed very much for a milestone birthday. So probably the great thing about Watson's Bay is that there is an option to suit all budgets (bring a picnic and enjoy the park and a walk!). Safe swimming options and lovely to see the boats and beautiful homes too. I love this day trip, over and over again."

Took around 30 minutes with one stop on the way. Thankfully, had booked well ahead for lunch at Doyles on the beach, so were seated immediately and enjoyed wonderful seafood lunch overlooking the beach with Sydney in the backdrop. Interesting and easy 1 hour walk after lunch around the headland, past the lighthouse, then the ferry back to town. Great way to spend a few hours on a sunny Sunday - or any day for that matter!"

Someone from the UK had recommend a fish restaurant in the bay, with meals to die for. The barracuda and chips was supposedly priced at 30 Australian dollars (about \u00a317) which is a lot to pay for any meal, let alone fish and chips. However we set off for the ferry but being typical newbie holiday-makers, fell for the first kiosk advert we saw. It cost 174 AUD for 4 of us to catch the (hop-on-hop-off) ferry to Watsons Bay. (We later discovered the \"locals'\" kiosk where tickets can be purchased for 12 AUD.) So this was already a dear do. When we reached the bay, we found the chippy meal had jumped to 42AUD in the restaurant but to buy from the its sister take-away on the pier was only 18 dollars. Needless to say, we chose the latter. Watsons Bay is wealth worth a visit - just make sure you get the right ferry. It's a lovely place to walk round and have a picnic."

You could also do the 5min or so walk further up to Camp Cove Beach - a local's destination or stay in Watson's Bay for a quick walk on the beach and then enjoy fish and chips on the jetty - if you have kids on board, there's quite a good little playground there too. If it's adults only, there's a lovely little outside bar at the top of the Watson's Bay Hotel. I, personally, would totally avoid Doyles, the food is inferior and the prices are superior, it's for ill-informed tourists only. Sunset at the Watson's Bay Hotel Beer Garden is a beauty .... glass of sauv, calamari, the sweet view .... what are you waiting for?"

The fish and chips is a tiny bit expensive but it was beautiful some of the best I have had anywhere before. There is a huge park here where you can lie in the sun and relax and eat your yummy fish and chips! Also a hotel here where they have a restaurant with lots of seafood choices and of course cold beer!Best thing is the VIEW oh my goodness make sure you go in the afternoon/evening because you will get to see sunset over the city and harbour bridge. Amazing for photos!!! This was honestly one of the best things I did in Sydney make sure you go for the sunset but of course also the fish and chips and the relaxing park.

The drive their is amazing there are so many stunning views you will want to stop and take photos every two minutes. you can also catch the fairy which is a great trip too. Doyle fish & chips on the beach and Watson bay hotel are great for a casual catch up or with kids. Doyle's is amazing for a special occasion."

Just past the Doyle's take away Fish and Chips, continue walking past the beautiful Moreton Bay Fig Trees, then near the VYC you will find the delightful Tea Gardens. Better value than Doyle's. Would like to have lingered to enjoy the ambieance of a beach holiday, but we had a goal to walk up to the South Head Lighthouse. Perfect day for it! The harbour was at its sparkling best. Kiddies were enjoying splashing around at Camp Cove, and a few nudists were still sunning themselves as we passed Lady Jane Beach. My Godson enjoyed exploring the headland battlements dating from 1856 (against the French). The lighthouse could do with a coat of paint, but still a picturesque perched on South Head. Unfortunately we couldn't find a way around to The Gap from there as HMAS Watson (Naval training base) limits access. You can access The Gap directly by heading straight up the street from the ferry wharf. Both the beaches/lighthouse walk & The Gap involve some steps. Wheelchair access only within Watson's Bay immediate prescint from what I could see."

Unless its v windy, the afternoon sun bathes all of Watsons Bay with its gentle glow. There is the great fish and chippery (complete with seagulls) or the pub or restaurant on the beach inviting all with a laid back, glad you came here to relax emphasis.The lovely park alos perfect for kids makes Watsons bay a perfect family locale. Why not enjoy your food, walk along the strip of sand that is the beach, paddle in the harbour by the boats and congratulate yourself on your smart decision to spend time at one of Sydney's best spots. Then enjoy the sunset over the harbour to top it all off."

Take the time to walk to South Head and the lighthouse, taking in the views on the way. Then a refreshing amber at the local before catching the ferry back.

It's a shame you can't actually see the opening of the harbour here but it was still good to see the rugged coastline and listen to the crash of the waves. I had the salt and pepper squid at Doyle's which wasn't great; wish I'd had the fish. Easy bus ride to Bondi and then walked to Bronte. It was lovely."

Plan your trip to leave Circular Quay at around 10am. Once you arrive at Watson's Bay jetty, hop off and head up the hill to the Gap. It's a decent incline, but it's doable for anyone..fit or not. The Gap is amazing and the views are stunning..if it's the right season you may even spot a whale or two...however, whatever the season the views are worth it. By now you'll have worked up an appetite so head on back down the hill to Peter Doyle's takeaway fish and chips or eat in the restaurant. I enjoy the fish and chips wrapped in paper, sitting on a bench on the beach. But, beware of the seagulls, as they will swoop and pinch your food if you're not careful. It's well worth the trip across the harbour."

Watsons Bay is an exclusive neighbourhood in Sydney with multi million dollar homes overlooking the gorgeous harbour. Get takeaway fish and chips and then sit in the park above the ferry terminal or along the walkway overlooking the beach. The fish and chips are a bit pricey and you will wait in line on a Saturday or Sunday, but the portions and quality have always been good in my experience. My husband and I were in Sydney recently and we took our two children up to the playground area after lunch which they enjoyed. When we do not have our children we head up to the Watsons Bay hotel for a beer or wine and ask to sit somewhere overlooking the water. There is also very good takeaway coffee below the hotel. For a full day, I recommend heading to Watsons Bay by ferry but then walk up to Military Road and catch the bus down to Bondi Beach. Alternatively, walk up Cliff Street and around from Watsons Bay to Camp Cove which is another beautiful yet much quieter and more secluded little Sydney Harbour beach. Be aware of the ferry timetables as ferries do not run late in the afternoons and evenings. If you miss the ferry back to Circular Quay from Watsons Bay you will need to get a bus from Military Road into the city and that takes approximately 50 minutes or so depending on the time of day, though the upside is that it too takes you through some lovely parts of the Eastern Suburbs of Sydney."

Take a train to Circular Quay and board the F7 ferry at Wharf 4. The ferry ride is quite scenic with the Sydney skyline behind you, and is quite comfortable. We reached the bay early in the morning, which we definitely recommend, since it may get quite crowded and hot (even in winter) towards lunchtime. There are a map at the wharf, showing the directions to the looping trail, either towards the Gap first or the Hornby Lighthouse. We went towards the lighthouse first on an extremely scenic route. There is some amazing flora along the route, and some nice beaches in strips. The beaches here are quite small compared to the Manlys and Bondis of the world, but they are definitely a lot quieter and the white sand and crystal clear water certainly can match the big beaches. The route also have some 'interesting' attractions along the way. Nudist beach and plastic cannon anyone?The Hornby Lighthouse, itself, isn't that amazing, and it's a shame that you can't go into the lighthouse. But the views from the lighthouse is utterly breathtaking, in my opinion better than the ones at the Gap. Both places shows stretches of the Pacific Ocean, but the lighthouse have the Sydney skyline in the background. One of our friends have some incredible luck in seeing some whales from the lighthouse. Apparently, during their migration season (especially this year), you have a slim chance (as our friend demonstrated) in seeing those amazing creatures in the distance.And finally how can a trip to Watson's end without lunch at Doyles on the Beach. We suggest reservations if you want any of the outside seats, as we found out later. The food is not the best value for money, but you pay for the iconic status, fresh seafood and the lovely view.Overall, brilliant, somewhat quiet day trip from Sydney."

For those with very little ones there is a lovely big grassy area which is great for kicking a ball or there is an even better fully fenced large playground area complete with swings, slides and climbing frames. For those wanting more scenery, you can venture up to the gap for a fantastic view of the open sea. If you visit on a weekend you might be lucky enough to watch a wedding ceremony at Dunbar House.

You get the views back towards Sydney as well and can just about see the city.We ended up getting fish and chips from the takeaway and eating them in the park area as the weather was lovely.

We got to see a lot of the harbour on the ferry - lovely to see all the sailing boats on the way enjoying the nice weather - before we arrived. Obvious attractions were the fish and chip takeaways/restaurants, the well manicured park that led up to the famous Gap with it's sheer cliffs and rock platforms and the beaches. The only negative we found was the indifferent customer service at two of the places we had food and then a drink - it didn't encourage us to stay for more. But it was an inexpensive trip and well wroth the visit"

The main tourist reason to come here is to get fish and chips from one of the Doyles properties from the take-away (eat in the park) option, the sit in the popular hotel/bar and order food for your table option to the sit-down, waiter service and best views of the city skyline option - each depending on how much you want to spend.Another option is the Dunbar house option across the park which looks like an English country house which is not that expensive as you might think.Another option is to walk around to the great harbourside beach Camp Cove and hopefully the beach kiosk will have what you want. Take a swim here on a warm sunny day and relax.For the more energetic, take a walk to the Gap (steep cliffs to beware) or go the lighthouse and get a great view of the harbour and stand on South Head to see North Head the entrance to what is one of the most beautiful harbours in the world."

This way you get to enjoy the beauty of Sydney Harbour from the water, and step ashore at Watson's Bay Wharf. At the wharf you will find the famous Doyle's Seafood Restaurant, which also has a take-away counter so you can enjoy your fish and chips under a shady tree in the adjacent park, or watch the children play on the small sheltered harbour beach beside the ferry wharf. The park also has a large fenced children's playground area. A short walk through the park brings you to the cliffs overlooking The Gap, and the rugged coastline of the Pacific Ocean. There is a walking track up on to the top of the headland reserve from which you can see the Entrance to Sydney Harbour, and watch ships coming into port, or look across to Manly in the north, and watch the Manly Ferries ply the Sydney-Manly route."

Public transport in Sydney isn't cheap hence, I would recommend purchasing of My Multi 2 or My Multi 3 (if going Manly beach) card. It give you unlimited train, bus and ferry rides within the city. Price is $54 and $63 respectively. Can be found in the NSW transport website. For me i took the ferry from central wharf 4. Departure timing can be found on the screen before the wharf entrance. By taking the ferry, you'll be brought through the view of the harbour bridge and Sydney Opera House as a whole, as well as Double bay and Rose bay. If you wanna catch and full view of the city from far, ferry would be the way cheaper way.In order to reach Hornby Lighthouse, from Watson Bay, you would need to walk towards cliff street and up the trekking pathway at camp cove beach. The hike would consist of some steep slope and stairs. Generally it is a very easy trek that takes about 15-20mins slow walk to reach the lighthouse. Additionally, along the trek, there is a nude beach call lady bay beach. It is a very small beach, if you are interested in getting nude, that is one of them in Sydney. I would suggest to stay till sunset, the view would be magnificent and majestic. Great view of Sydney central as well as the Tasman Sea. Do bring along some food for picnic. Its worthy!!P.S. Do remember to check for returning ferry timing, as the return ferry might cease earlier on certain days. But fear not, there is always bus 324 325 and 380 to nearby train station or to central.As for dinner, there are a few restaurants near the wharf area. I had my dinner at Eastern Bay Thai. You can try that for authentic thai food. I have written a review for it as well. Do read up! Hope this is useful! Cheers!"

Depending on where you want to travel too, they cost around AUD$40.00 plus. April is a great time to catch the great Sydney weather. The sun is still bright and not too hot. The journey from the Rocks to Watson bay will allow you to catch all the key landmarks- Opera House, the business centre, the zoo, grand homes along the shore area, and also a bit of the green lung that is still left in Sydney. Watson's Bay is the spot that meets the ocean. Homes here are pretty and its famous for its fish and chips. You can disembark at the end of the ferry trip, stroll around and have your meal, mix with the locals and hop back at the ferry a couple of hours later. A great way to catch the magic of Australia at your own pace. Highly recommended to those who enjoys the sun, and to capture scenes of local life."

The Ferry itself is reasonably priced and provides wonderful views of Circular Quay, the Opera House, Bridge and the general Bay area. It is also spectacular if your return is timed at dusk, when the city neon takes over. Our ferry was met by a real live pelican on the beach and, after landing, my wife and I set off on a walk adapted from one in an old Dorling Kindersley guide to Sydney, which showcases the differences in the two sides of the peninsula. Firstly we walked to Vaucluse House via Gibson's Beach and the supension bridge across Parsley Bay. This route takes you past impressive residential properties ( particularly The Crescent). Vaucluse House and gardens looked impressive, but we didn't have time to go in. Next was a bit of a hike along Cambridge Avenue (not much shade on a hot day) to reach the ocean side of the peninsula and a walk towards the South Head taking in the Signal Station, Jacobs Ladder, Dunbar's anchor and the Naval Memorial Chapel. The attractions here revolve around the sheer cliffs above the crashing waves. Sadly, there are several reminders that this spot has attracted several suicides. The paths around the northern part of the peninsula were being redeveloped and are not well signed, but will eventually bring you back to near Camp Cove Beach where you can follow the coast back to to the ferry terminal, where there is a pub/hotel and Doyles fish restaurant and cafe. This walk took around 3 hours and offers spectacular and varied scenery and restaurants at the start/finish with a great view of the Bay."

There are two restaurants on shore, with one specializing in seafood, but we had to leave after sitting down and looking at the prices; just a bit to dear for a lunch meal. However, the same restaurant has a take out counter on the pier and then a small enclosed sitting area with a bar also on the pier. That's a much more economical way to grab a bite and a glass of wine before catching the ferry, especially if you looking for something like fish and chips or basic grilled seafood."

The fish & chips were pretty good, nothing was cuisine but it was wholesome enough for fried food. I had no idea what beer to get, so followed the advice of a patron and got something called \"ExtraDry\" which was pretty good.The famous Doyle's is next door but had a line and looked more expensive--I was not in the mood to wait so the Beach Club suited me well.Next time I will do the walk before lunch."

Having fish and chips on a summer's day at the original fish and chippery is a great way to pass an afternoon, and you can finish up with a drink in the beautiful waterside beer garden at Watson's Bay Hotel.Really recommend it for a half-day out of the madness of Sydney."

Also, warning, you do pass a \"clothing optional\" beach, but the bodies are pretty far away. Back down near the ferry there is a bathing area and public bathrooms where you can change.

It gets chilly pretty quickly after sunset, at least it did in November, so don't plan to linger by the sea for too long."

Not expensive to travel from City, yet I would always recommend ferry as it gives you 30 minutes trip to enjoy. Of course, if it is raining, ferry will not make it better, but once you are there, there are plenty of places to look and fall in love. Good food, nice beaches, beautiful parks and Iconic walk with famous Gap to take a photo that will look as if you been to the end of the world and back. Go and see lighthouse, have a lunch at \"Doyle's on the Beach\" fish and chips... will not be disappointed."

It is astonishing to view the amazing North Head and the wide yawning gap of water seperating the two heads. At South Head which the trail ends, there is a little red lighthouse and some old abandoned military pillboxes and fortifications where you can see the circular well where canons used to be placed.Tip: Please please take the South Head Trail to view the magnificent Tasman Sea and North Head. It takes about 45 minutes to an hour to walk along the trail (Bring water!) but the views are simply stunning!"

It has some restaurant selling seafood freshly caught. Beyond the ferry terminals, there are many more nice beaches with crystal clear water as you walk further away, including a nudist beach of Lady Jane Beach. There are some interesting life forms living on the rocks formation by the beach too"

Watson's Bay itself has a great little beach with soft sand, trees to stay in the shade, restaurants and a nice fish and chips joint. There is also a kids playground in the middle of the park. I am always captivated by the big cliffs and huge waves on Gap Bluff. You can climb the stairs on the left or right as you approach the cliffs. If you have trouble climbing stairs you can still marvel from the bottom. The views are just great and you can see the different colours in the water as it crashes against the rocks. On one occasion I took the ferry to Watson's Bay from Circular Quay and it is a very pleasant ride."

By taking the ferry at very modest cost you will have a harbour \"tour\" as well as a short cruise. Much nicer trip than on the larger ferry and choppier ride to Manly Beach. When you alight at Watson's Bay, and if you don't fancy fish & chips, turn right on the promenade and make the short walk to the cafe opposite the open air swimming pool. Very pleasant place for a coffee and a bite to eat. Afterwards head up across the park and you will have great views of the ocean and an even better one looking back to the city skyline, including the Harbour Bridge. Afternoon return ferries stop early so we took the bus and stopped off at Bondi Beach on the way back, and then at Westfield Shopping Mall a bit closer to the city. A great day out and much better than an expensive organised tour."

Sadly we didn't give ourselves enough time to explore, as had not realised that there was so much to see and do, in a relatively small place. It was visually beautiful and there is the added advantage of the Gap to see, complete with cliff top walks. Make sure that you have a few hours to explore and to get some of the famous fish & chips. We got the ferry back to the harbour and it was a really nice journey back, with some lovely views along the way."

I can't comment on the fish as I only had chips but they are frozen reconstituted chips! How is it every chippy in the UK can make real chips from potatoes yet Doyles have to serve up the frozen variety?!The last ferry back is at 4:30pm. HOWEVER what they don't advertise is that Sydney public ferries stop at 3pm!

It's where you start getting towards the affluent end of town, with homes that have their own beach frontages and boats to travel across the harbour in. However, packed amongst the seafront homes, albeit modest in comparison to places like Vaucluse, is a Sydney institution. Doyles. Doyles do,or maybe even are Seafood in Sydney. They have been going over three generations and what started out as an upmarket Seafood restaurant, has now expanded to a pub (hotel) and fish and chip shop as well as the original restaurant. I last ate at the pub. The food was variable, depending on what you ordered, but the atmosphere fabulous. The restaurant is still the place to go if you have the cash. They also have an outlet at the Sydney Fish Market.If you really want to splurge catch a water taxi back across the Harbour after indulging in Sydney Rock Oysters and freshly caught fish, even if its from the fish and chip shop!"

If you are hungry you can taste some seafood from one of the famous Doyles restaurants on the wharf or beach before starting the walk. From the wharf walk through the park to reach the walk trail. You can either walk towards the left for a loop to see the Hornsby lighthouse. There are many historic places on this walk and the views of city skyline are stunning. You can take few detours through small unmaintained tracks through bushes if you like little adventures. From some of the viewpoints if you get lucky you can even see the humpback whales in the open sea during the whale migration season. The walk right side of the Watson's bay wharf leads to old south head, the gap and the Macquarie lighthouse which is Australia's first lighthouse and still operational. If you are tired and don't feel like walking back to the Wharf, you can catch a bus to city from the bus stop near the Macquarie lighthouse. The walk requires at least half day and don't forget to carry plenty of water. Plan the walk on a sunny day and I bet you won't forget the experience."

You have now worked up an appetite for a wonderful sea food lunch at Doyle's a family operated business since 1880. We caught the mid afternoon ferry and it took us out into the Tasman Sea. Very rough but great to see the headlands from the sea and experience the difference in the sea, bay and harbor. You can return to Sydney by bus which will take you through some very upscale neighborhoods. We had had this tour by a friend from Sydney so we stayed on the water. The views from Watson's Bay were probably the best we experienced in the 5 days we toured Sydney Harbor."

There are nice eateries on the wharf - with both a pub, more expensive restaurant and a takeout on the wharf (fish and chips). Have visited both during the week and the weekend. Weekend was MUCH busier - you need to book a table at the restaurant then! We went for a walk round to Camp Bay which is a must-do. The little Bay is so picturesque and sheltered from winds etc! Overall, will definitely be going back - as soon as I get a day off!"

Brilliant coastal walks, Fabulous Fish & Chips at Doyle's. Also the Tearoom near the library serve excellent breakfasts amongst other things. Watson's Bay Hotel is the place to sit and sip cocktails and watch the sun go down and enjoy every last minute of your day.

The Watson's Bay was a pleasant day trip about 2-3 hours, which can be reached easily from Sydney Harbour through the numerous ferry boat along the pier.The trip is short, about 10-15 minutes to do absolutely by boat, the photos are amazing and can be reached easily by bus from Bondi beach or Bondi Junction but the route is much longer. Once landed in the small harbour you realize immediately that you'll get in another world, it seems one of those villages where the inhabitants live peaceful and in turn transmit the tranquillity that characterizes this place.There is a walking path that leaves from the port and reach the lighthouse, through a lovely Park.This route is very scenic landscape level is due to the presence of the many outposts and disused bunker left now after decades as a witness.The route is circular and has a duration of 40 minutes before arriving at the lighthouse, but I have to mention the presence of a nude beach on the left of the path called Lady Bay. After the tour we return to pier, from here you can go back to town through the bus or waiting for the ferry boat lunch in one of the restaurants along the beach."

This is an experience that is perhaps overlooked by some travelers, but I had spent about two years researching the places we were going to visit in Australia. I found that Watson's Bay had a lot to offer.It is quite easily reached without a car. I simply took the train on platform 24 at Central Train Station, which was about 200 yards from our hotel (Rendezvous Suites on George Street), and rode the train to Bondi Junction. Bondi Junction is close to Bondi Beach, and has excellent shopping and eating facilities. Like most travelers, I caught a bus to Bondi Beach. Those buses run all day and into the night. They come by often and so it is easy to get to Bondi Beach.After visiting Bondi Beach and having a fine and filling Aussie-style breakfast at a cafe along Bondi Beach, I caught bus 380, which took me to Watson's Bay within about 25-30 minutes. It was easy and simple. At Watson's Bay I took advantage of the walkway next to the road, which overlooked the ocean. The churning ocean lay below the cliff, just like a scene out of \"The Count of Monte Cristo.\" Wow!The walkway was paved and had different levels. It is an easy visit if you have no limitations. With physical limitations, you have to exercise some restraint, but it is still well worth the visit. I was inspired.There is a park there and the world-famous Doyle's. Get great fish 'n chips from the takeaway along the harbor, then catch a fast ferry to Circular Quay in downtown Sydney. The fast ferry reaches Sydney in just a few quick minutes. From Circular Quay, you can do so much. From there, you can catch a ferry to many locations within the harbor or catch a but or train out of downtown. Nearby is downtown itself and also Darling Harbour.Go to Watson's Bay if you have the time."

Awesome views over the Heads and then turn around and awesome views over the Harbour back to the city. I had takeaway from the restaurant on the ferry dock, decent chicken and yummy ice cream.

Only if you want to impress an overseas friend would one want to go DOYLES ... yes it is on the tiny beach, if you book ahead and are lucky enough to get a table... the meals here are extremely overpriced for 'fish and chips'...so be warned !! If you are adventurous there is a walk/trek down to a very secluded beach...only the locals can direct you... but it is worth finding it. Watson's Bay is Sydney of yesteryear ... lovely!!"

If its your first time in Sydney then go for it but be warned that it is not cheap, compared to other great seafood restaurants in Sydney. Head to the Fish Markets for lunch there if you really want a super seafood experience. Doyles are down there too."

One path goes via a couple beaches (including a nude beach), to end up at the lighthouse at the tip of the peninsula, overlooking a rocky cliff and amazing sea views. The other path goes straight through a park, to another lookout over the sea. We only had time for one path (they take about an hour each), so we opted for the lighthouse. The views and the scenery made the trip and the hike well worth it, the relatively isolated beaches were very picturesque, as were the lighthouse and the cliff. You could almost make a day of Watson's Bay, between the trails, the beaches, and the waterfront dining. But even a few hours will make the trip worthwhile."

There's a great pathway with lots of great views over the harbour and the heads. We didn't have lunch there but there was a lot of people in Doyles and the pub on the corner at the wharf. We did go into the pub for a few drinks after our walk.A really nice day out, easy to get to on the ferry."

Magical way to spend a day out on the harbour. Take your camera for views of the harbour on one side and views of the ocean on the other.

It is worth spending some time exploring the cliff top paths just beyond the gap. Remember to take your swimming costume as there is also the beach of camp cove to enjoy or if you are more adventurous you can use Lady beach just a short walk further on. It is a nudist beach open to all. Further on is the south head walk that takes about 30 mins to go round, worth leaving some time to explore the old WW2 gun emplacements and the lighthouse. There are other walks available such as the one out to Bondi but it is worth just hanging around Watson Bay! Another I deals is to purchase a multi trip day ticket for the ferries and go exploring on the various other ferry routes to really see the whole harbour. The ticket costs $21 and allows unlimited trips that day."

Little hard to get a seat and peak times, but just grab as takeaway and head to the adjacent park which always has a lot going on. A good agenda is to take the ferry out from Sydney, have lunch at Doyle's (or one of the other places, I have always been happy with Doyle's takeaway), then hike up the hill to take in the amazing view off the cliffs of the Tasman Sea. There are some short hikes along the cliffs to help burn off the fried food. Come back down to the center of the town and there are two gelato shops next to the bus terminal. Get some dessert and either return the ferry or opt for the bus back. If you take the 380 bus, it returns to Circular Quay the long route, via Bondi Beach where you can stop or just keep riding. Good views of the town of Bondi which seems to go on forever as you head back to Sydney proper. Watson's Bay is nice and easy day trip. The perfect lunch stop if you are doing hop on-hop off on the ferry. Oh -- and Doyle's has a lot of other non-fried seafood including some intriging looking salads and sandwiches, but I have never been able to resist the fish and chips! Reasonably priced, fish and chips around $13, more if you add things on."

When you board the ferry for watson's bay at circular key's for the first time it is something akin to a young child going into a sweetshop for the very first time with his mother and being told to pick a sweet, except one sweet is never enough, and this is what it is like when you visit watson's bay. When the ferry pulls in at the landing stage you are greeted with a view of a small beach to your left as you dock, with a beach which has golden sand and quite simply clear water which on a nice day just lap's up the shoreline, plenty of small and medium sized boats abound the shoreline and cove. On the shore you have both Doyle's eating establishments, one alongside the wharf as you step off the ferry and the other one just a little bit further on to your left, you can cross the road and then enter a park which has a drinking fountain sited as you enter the park, this has a facility that allow's you to refill your water bottle, which is a very good thing to do on a hot day, you can now proceed through the park which has quite a steep climb to the top of the park, and if you cross the road and climb up the concrete steps(20 to25) you will then be greeted with a quite magnificent view of the Gap, where the cruise ships as well as other ships come through on their way to Sydney harbour) the ocean views are quite stunning.

I went by bus, but I'd recommend taking the ferry and coming back to the city by bus. Lunch at the seafood restaurant ended up being a \"must do\" as did a walk through some of the streets and the visit to The Gap."

Watson's Bay Hotel is a nice enough pub that has great views and lots of outdoor seating. Doyles is also here and is one of the most over-hyped restaurants in Sydney with ridiculous prices and very average food. Eat at the pub instead and then go for a walk up to the Heads for incredible scenery and spectacular views of the entrance to Sydney Harbour."

Watsons Bay has gorgeous views of the Sydney skyline, parks and walks. We chose to treat ourselves to an afternoon at the famous Doyles restaurant where we had a table by the beach and a fantastic view. We took the fast ferry back to Circular Quay and back on the 380 bus to Paddington. If you are on a transport ticket do be careful to get the ferry home by 3:50pm on weekdays as that's the last government ferry of the day, and if you miss it you will pay the private ferry as we did. The harbour is so lovely that we enjoyed the ferry, but we could have saved $9 each."

The Gap is quite spectacular with crashing waves against the rugged shore and views way out to sea. Watsons Bay forms South Head and Manly North Head both locations are part of the entrance from the ocean to Sydney Harbour. Camp Cove is a pretty harbour beach which is quiet and protected. Well worth taking the ferry from Circular Quay past Garden Island, Darling Point, Double Bay and Rose Bay. Enjoy fish and chips on the grass and sand or lunch at one of the cheap cafes and restaurants. The Watsons Bay Hotel also has a thriving beer garden and offers a counter lunch."

We had lunch there before we left; just did take away and sat in the gorgeous park looking at the view. If you go into the cafe I believe it is licenced if you fancy a beverage. As you come off the wharf just walk in a straight line up a gentle hill and that puts you onto a walking track; we turned left on this one. You walk along a ridge with breathtaking views of the ocean as this is where the harbour meets the sea. Stunning and an easy walk for children too. At the end of that we dropped down, walked along a road with the most charming houses on it, and onto the bay with the golden sand. Great place for a swim depending on water temperature. Then you follow your nose back along there to get back to the wharf. Highly recommend taking an afternoon out here!"

By the time we've reached the bottom the sun was almost ready to set on a beautiful Saturday. However don't waste your time buying take out at Doyle's on the weekend unless you are super hungry. I went to enjoy fish and chips while watching the sunset over the bay and a view of the harbour bridge. All I have to say is....I missed the sun going down while waiting for my food at the Doyles counter. Literally stood there for over 30min and once I returned to my friends with food the ball of fire over the bay was GONE.Once it was dark we walked back up the same trail we came down the hill on. The view of Sydney completely changes at night. I'm glad I got to see both day time and night time views of the bay and Sydney CBD skyline. Truly magnificent.

As we had enough fish n chips since we arrived at sydney, we did not dine at Doyle's. contrary to stories of it being very crowded, there was only one table filled when we arrived at 2pm. We walked to the gap, and the view was truly amazing. Great photo-taking opportunities there.After that, we walked towards the Christiston Park where the Macquarie Lighthouse was located.We cut across the Gap park on our way from Gap Bluff to the light station. Theres nothing much to see, and the park is located on higher ground, away from the road. As such, its better to avoid the park for personal safety reasons.After the light station, we took bus 324 back to the CBD but along the way, we saw plenty of shops and settlements, which sadly, we did not visit as it was raining outside."

The walk around the South Head headland is really worthwhile, with a great lighthouse, and a clear view over to Manly and back to the city. You can see The Gap which is spectacular (the drop into the sea). The harbour water and sea are just minutes' walk from one another. Less populated than Manly and way, way less commercial. Great swimming."

Take the ferry from Circular Quay to Watsons Bay, then walk out to South Head via Camp Cove for views of North Head etc. Allow 45 min for this walk. Unfortunately, when you get of the ferry there is no directional signage or information about the South Head walk or direction to \"The Gap\" Park. Most people just seem get off the ferry and stay in the area near Doyles, the Hotel and the park, eat their fish and chips and go back on the next ferry. The walk via Camp Cove is interesting and has the historical marker as the place where Lieut Phillip came ashore in 1788. The loop walk at South Head has interp signs about the light house keepers cottage, the light house and the gun and miliarty periods. After completing the South Head walk, proceed up to \"The Gap\" park near the bus stop for views of the Gap and paths that climb up to look out points. After this your options are to catch the bus to Bondi Beach, walk further along the top of the cliffs towards Bondi or return on the ferry from Watsons Bay Wharf."

Many private fishing boats including those after big game dock at Watson's Bay wharf after a day at sea. To get to the Bay, you can catch a ferry from Circular Quay, catch a bus, or drive. In the Park is a restaurant and what remains of the old Council Chambers. The Park is a favourite wedding and photo spot, so you may happen upon one on a weekend. It is worth taking a walk along the water's edge to the nearby coves and harbour beaches, or up the hill for a spectacular view of the Harbour from South Head itself. Just a short amble away on the other side of the Park is The Gap, a dangerous high cliff which falls away to the sea. It is infamous for providing a final solution to many a jilted lover. The Innkeeper at the Pub there has many a story to tell of those he has coaxed back from the edge on a dark night. So Watson's Bay can match your every mood and dining requirement and all in the ambiance of the stunning body of water that is Sydney Harbour."

Most seem to oblige by strutting their stuff whenever they see anyone on the path - so be prepared - they seem to take great pleasure in posing !Go up through the park and you will find another cliff top path which is really dramatic and well worth the visit. It's quite a climb and you begin to wonder about the merits of going further but keep going. Not only do you get away from the lazy ones thronging around the initial viewpoint but the path runs parallel to the main road which conveniently has bus stops to take you back to the western suburbs and Sydney rather than going all the way back again to get the ferry."

I recommend taking the ferry to Watson's Bay and the Bus back to the city.Allow yourself time to walk around a bit - visit the Gap and stroll up along the ocean side of the headland as well as the harbour. There are pretty little cottages along the Camp Cove Beach - so worth a wander down those little by ways.As you get off the ferry you will see the Doyle's Fish and Chip shop. You can buy some takeaway food and eat it in the Doyles area where they supply restaurant type facilities. (Dont confuse with the more elegant Doyle's restaurant a few buildings along the bay. My experience of Doyle's restaurant is that it is expensive, poor service and unexciting food although it does have a great view)"

If take away is your scene or a picnic there is a huge park to let the kids go wild in. Here you have the fabulous Gap but also a lovely walk around South Head. Views straight up the Harbour and across to Manly. There are the old Fisherman's cottages, worth a fortune these days and the enclosed swimming beach as added attractions. a very, very good day out."

The ferry ride to Watson's Bay is enjoyable.From the pier there are two walks that both deliver spectacular views at their acme.If you do not have a brochure or walks guide there is a sign at the pier, near the Doyle's on the Wharf take away and bistro. After you exit the ferry, walking towards the beach, the sign will be on your right.Pressed for time and need to catch the next ferry back to Sydney? The walk to The Gap is the quicker of the two. Walk up thru Robertson Park up to the Sydney Harbour National Park at Gap Bluff. You'll be rewarded with a great view from the Coastal Clifftop Walkway.Military Rd. is on the left side of Robertson Park, Clovelly St is on the right side of the park. At the top of Clovelly, make a right and there is a small market if you need a water or soda.The other walk is out to South Head and the Hornby Lighthouse.Cliff St. will get you to the start of that walk. You can walk up the left side of Robertson Park to Cliff St. Or, walk along the Marine Promenade (the beach walkway that passes the main Doyle's Restaurant), then Short St. up to Cliff St. Turn left on Cliff St.From the Hornby Lighthouse at South Head you have a view of the entrance to Sydney Harbour and North Head. On the walk up to the lighthouse there is a nice view of Sydney, looking back into the Harbour.Bring your swim gear and towels. Several nice beaches and changing rooms in the Watson's Bay area. You'll see Camp Cove on your way down from South Head. Lady Bay nude beach is on the way up to South Head if one is so inclined. :-)Doyle's Restaurant? Nice for lunch at one of the beach side tables. A little pricey, and I'd have to say the fish and chips weren't the best I've had while in Sydney. A good venue/ambiance. This past trip we skipped a sit down meal and bought ice cream and snacks at the market after a hike up to The Gap."

One can take a ferry to Watsons Bay from Circular Quay. Watsons Bay is also very accessible by bus. I took bus service number 325 from Rose Bay to Watsons Bay.I like the crashing waves against the rocks of the Gap Park. Somehow, looking at the works of Nature while I was at Watsons Bay made me feel humbled. The air at Watsons Bay is very fresh too. This is quite an inspiring place for any one who would like a sketch.Nearby, the beach is welcoming. For a treat to good food, consider the seafood from Doyles on the Beach at 11 Marine Parade, Watsons Bay. It is said to be the site of Australia's first seafood restaurant. I was rushing for the last ferry to Circular Quay and did not have the time to have dinner at Doyles on the Beach.If you are interested to have activities at the beach, please bring beach-wear.The good news is that there is no admission fee to Watsons Bay. Perhaps the only cost is the transport expenses to reach there?"

If you keep on the footpath, you will come across a cove where nudists enjoy sunbathing (this is either a warning or a tip for fellow travelers and what they are comfortable). Even further, and next to a military base, is somewhat of a bluff that has tons of coves, is great for light rock climbing, enjoying seclusion and spectacular views of Sydney proper.

Always good for a drink in the beer garden or above on the balconies.I find the food at the Pub and other Doyles restaurants to be average and over-priced - tourist traps - so better to go to Eastern Bay Thai just up on the main road along from the bus stop for dinner or walk along the beach south to the swimming baths with the Tea Gardens behind it for cafe food & drinks during the day. Or bring a picnic and eat on the beach in front or park beside the wharf.There is branch of the Woollahra library on the side of the Tea Gardens Cafe that has free internet, daily papers, etc etc, so a nice place to chill out only a 17 minute ferry ride from the city.If you have children there is a really cool, new-ish, playground in the park (Robertson Park) and a Gelatisimo ice cream shop at the top corner of the park.There is also a chemist and corner store on the main road on the top of the park, in case you need medicine or coffee and basic food etc.There is also the Gap across the road at the top of the park which is nice to look out to sea or down at the rock platforms.You can also walk up along the cliffs in either direction for a nice walk with great views back to Sydney and across to North Head, Middle Head and Manly.If you miss the last ferry back to the city (at only 350pm during the week!) or want to see another nice park / beach, then it is easy to catch the 324 or 325 bus all the way back to the city if you want - the 325 goes past Nielson Park which is also a nice beach in a park with great views from the headlands. There is also a good kiosk and restaurant.You could get off the bus at the Rose Bay wharf and catch a ferry back from there as well (last ferry 7.46pm) to catch the sunset behind the Harbour Bridge and the city lit up for you.Nice way to spend a day in the beautiful outdoors in Sydney.I love it, hope you do too..."

Walk north to Camp Cove and Lady Bay (if it's hot strip off to your birthday suit and have a swim) walk up to South Head then back via 'The Gap'. Then walk south to Gibsons Beach, then there is a short road walk going past and Parsley Bay and Vaucluse Bay to Nielsen Park (have another swim, but keep your swimmers on here...it's NOT a nudie beach and it is netted in case you are worried about sharks. Check out the 1920 changerooms). Good coffee at the Kiosk. Keep walking south along the pathway past several other small beaches (OK, swim some more) and end up at Rose Bay and catch a bus or ferry back. One of Sydney's best walks. Pick up a map of the walk to get more details. It is really great and not to be missed."

Watson's Bay has a relaxed, village feel, a great seafood restaurant and wonderful views of Sydney Harbour. It also has the 'not to be missed' spectacular sandstone cliffs of The Gap and the beautiful walk out to the lighthouse at South Head. There is a small, nudist beach along the walk to the lighthouse but you are warned well in advance and it is not overly obvious unless you are keen to have at look. Watson's Bay is at the end of a beautiful car or bus ride that can take in Bondi Beach and will take you through some of Sydney's most expensive suburbs e.g Rose Bay, Vaucluse and Bellevue Hill. Watson's Bay can also be reached by ferry. Taking the ferry to Watson's Bay is the most relaxing way to get there and it enables you to see some truly amazing and otherwise hidden Sydney Harbour mansions."

Since then we have returned regularly to sightsee at the Gap or for a swim in the flat waters of Camp Cove at the mouth of the Sydney Harbour with views out to the Heads. On the late January day that we last visited we had to make a number of circuit laps looking for what turned out to be very limited parking for cars unless you are lucky enough to find a spot as someone left (and on what was to be our third and last lap, we did). A small kiosk is available at the Camp Cove and we purchased ice cream as we relaxed after our swim. Because of the number of vessels in the water, there was often a very strong smell of fumes and an oilness appeared at times in the water. Serviced by Sydney Buses, the beach maybe a bit out of the way unless you have your own transport but it is in close proximity to a Naval base."

Taking a ferry to Watson`s Bay is one of Sydney`s highlights, with wonderful views of the Harbour Bridge, Opera House and cityskape as you make your way on the ferry. Once at Watson`s Bay. it is such a great place for walks up to the cliffface, with views of the Heads (there are of course some very sad tales here as well as this is the area known as the Gap, where too many an unhappy person has ended his/her life)...but back to the positives, in the other direction there is Camp Cove. All this area is a real walker`s delight!Then there is the no better place to enjoy fish and chips...either tak away and sit on the grass, or the pub or of course, if you feel like a spluge, the restaurants with Doyles the best known.Just a wnderful way to spend a sunny afternoon in Sydney ( I have yet to have any visitor I have taken be disappointed!)"

It's located right on the beach, adjacent to the sand, with wonderful seafood, ambiance, local chatter, and views back to the city skyline. Next door on the other side of the pier is a huge park where picnicking is popular, or just sunbathing. There's a little hotel at Watson's Bay too, for anybody looking for clean budget accommodation and a place where there's quite a bit going on."

There are two Doyles, one is a proper restaurant with wonderful views and quite expensive but an certainly an icon. You can however just get takeaway fish and chips which are just as delicious and much more reasonable. They have tables where you can also sit down, or if you prefer you can sit on the grass or benches and still have the magnificent view."

The bay is kind of generic, served by the ferry system, being scenic with the usual marina and boats, but has an excellent (albeit expensive) seafood restaurant (Doyle's). But the NP is something else and more. It showcases the coastal cliffs, geological formations and weathering effects. The trail head is easily accessed from the bay (5 min walk). The trail has some moderate climbing on steps or sloped path. There are vista points along the way. View of the ocean is just as spectacular. After visiting here, Sydney can be more than iconic landmarks and fresh seafood."

The ferry ride is part of the fun -- how can you not love public transportation by boat, sailing in Sydney's beautiful harbour? Once you arrive, walk along Marine Parade and then Cove Street, checking out some of the beautiful Portugeuse balconies and restored fisherman's cottages. Then walk around the park near Camp Cove -- there's a lovely beach, some relics from a WWII boom that protected the harbour from submarines, and a monument marking when explorers first landed at this spot in the 1700s. Keep walking and you come across an old canon; from there, there are incredible views of Sydney's harbour and CBD. It is really a stunning vista! Keep walking -- if you don't mind seeing a few naked guys, there's an interesting little beach at Lady Bay with some pretty dramatic rock formations (worry not, the nude beach is well-signed). Then you can keep walking to South Head, where there is a large expanse of rock and open land that offers a perfect place for a picnic lunch, some reading, and some relaxing. You can stand on the edge and have a view of the bay to your left at Pacific Ocean to your right -- stunning! There's also an interesting old light house. Walk back to the ferry dock, and then go up the hill to explore the vegetation at the top of The Gap and more dramatic views of the ocean. All in all, it's probably a 3km walk (some uphill) at a slow pace; I spent about 3 hours, including time reading and relaxing at South Head. When you're back near the ferry dock, there are places to eat (fish and chips at Doyle's, yum) and a large park with great views and a community feel -- as a visitor, it was nice to get out of the CBD and spend some time that offered touristy-like things (great views, hikes, etc.) but also clearly was a place where Sydney-siders hang out. A unexpectedly wonderful afternoon -- worth a visit!!"

It has a lovely park, some nice walks, some great views and some very nice seafood restaurants. Doyle's is the most famous one, although be warned this can be quite expensive. The best thing to do at Watson's Bay is just sit back and relax. the views from the park, or the benches that border it, are VERY good. You can see Sydney in the distance as well as the boats in the bay and in Sydney Harbour.If you want to explore it's only a short walk from Watson's Bay to The Gap Park which has some great views of the entrance to Sydney Harbour. If you're lucky you can also catch some views of passing Humpback Whales during migration season from there.I mentioned how Doyle's restaurant can be quite expensive but it is really nice. They mainly serve fish but also serve steak for people that don't want to eat fish. The views are really nice and the atmosphere is great. Try to eat on the terrace if there is room there as you will get the best views. They have a few establishments in the area - the one next to but not on the pier is the main one.Overall Watson's bay is worth visiting. You can get there by boat from Circular Quay, by harbour cruise from Darling Harbour or using the Explorer buses which stop a short walk from the coast."

Then meander through residential streets and a small beach with perfect sand to the South Head, which is part of Sydney Harbour National Park.A round trip of perhaps 1.5km awaits, past a nudist beach and HMAS Watson naval facility. Watch for numerous honeyeaters devouring the nectar contained in banksia and bottlebrush flowers.At the midpoint tourists can view the beautiful 1857 or so red-and-white striped lighhouse along with the lightkeepers' and assistant lightkeepers' most attractive cottages, all erected to protect the thenColony's ships from being dashed onto the South Head entrance to Sydney Harbour.After walking back, choose one of the Doyles' restaurants or cafes or other nearby venues, and then enjoy a quick trip back to Circular Quay.A wonderful walk and midweek, the crowds are absent."
