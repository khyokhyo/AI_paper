The Melanzane is a must and for the Tiramisu lovers: this is your place to go.I visited during lunch time and was presented with a 3-course meal optikn that was very affordable (approx $25 per person). It was two of us: ordered six different plates (two appetizers, two entrees, two desserts) and none of them disappointed. Plus the portion sizes were just right.I recommend this restaurant over other tourist traps in Bs As. Let's not forget the Italian influence in Argentina. This restaurant is worthy of your time regardless of the fact that you're in a city where steak restaurants are the main gastronomical attraction."

Several travel guides and reviews have mentioned that dog owners and walkers in Palermo don't pick up after their dogs, with resulting hazardous and unpleasant walking on the sidewalks. No more! I don't know if they passed an ordinance or what, but people walking dogs are now conscientious about cleaning up. Some parks have bag dispensers. Palermo isn't my favorite place--it can be a little bland ana shopping oriented, but dog poop is no longer a factor. Good going, Palermo!"

The people were also very helpful and kind. I was alone with my son for the majority of the trip because my husband got the flu and everyone was kind to me and my son. I never felt scared or threatened. Also, the metro is close so you can get to just about any area in the city for pennies (which we did and my son loved it)."

We always felt very safe and walked at night to and from dinner and to and from church , also at night. The area is on the green D line for the metro and bus line takes you all the way into town. We took many taxi's and only one cost us more than the equivalent of $5 US . They are very reasonable. Porte\u00f1os, as they call themselves are very very kind and helpful. They do not walk around smiling at you on the street but when asking for directions, in my bad Spanish, a woman walked us nearly to our door only leaving us when we told her we recognized where we were. Then she kissed our cheeks (common there) and walked BACK toward where she come from! This is only one of several such incidents of help received. People went out of their way making sure we found the right bus stop or street. Palermo was a perfect choice as a location for our vacation. Safe, well located, not super expensive, lots of close restaurants. You'll love it!"

I felt safe and green, with lots of street trees and parks (the most of any district in BA). The area was convenient for shops and restaurants, just a few blocks form the beautiful Botanical Garden and close to the subway to Recoleta. And our boutique hotel was a gem. Look for that in a separate review."

Its youthful vibe also attracts a large number of ex-pats hence an international gastronomy scene.

It's baking hot in January, so not pleasant to get around. We should have booked a guided tour, by air-conditioned car, as that would have been easier and more pleasant way to see the sights. As it was, we visited the Opera House (great), a cafe (fun), the Eva Peron Museum (mixed), and a tango show (great). I had seen the cemetery on a previous trip but that's a must. However, that's enough of Buenos Aires for me. But then I'm not 25, not into night clubs nor shopping, don't like the heat, and struggled with the state of the pavements.

The metro line runs on the outskirts so if you're headed toward the lakes you're in for at least a 25 minute walk. But it's a beautiful walk so take it if you can."

It is nice to go there in warm days or nights that is not raining. Try to avoid to walk alone in quiet streets during the night. I was told by one of our waitress that there are robbers in the area. Beside that it is a great place to visit. I recommend it."

Our boutique hotel was located Palermo and it was very nice. There are also a few good restaurants. Other than that Palermo is packed with lots and lots of small restaurants and bars. Not much variety to offer tourism wise and my wife and I felt somewhat unsafe even in the daytime. We took taxis when we went out after dark. Overall I cannot recommend Palermo or anywhere in Buenos Aires to tourists. If you would like more detail as to why see my review on Recoleta and the opinions I expressed there."

Very nice apartment, big city style. Buenos Aires is a big city, much like New York in that the buildings are narrow but tall and packed in right next to each other. Many have store fronts or kiosks at the street level and flats above. Palermo is very cosmopolitan and trendy with lots of great boutique stores and restaurants. Palermo is safe to walk the sidewalks at any hour and there's usually some little store open all the time. Palermo is easily navigated by walking. Everything you need for an extended stay is walking distance. It really helps to speak Spanish in Buenos Aires, but in Palermo, you will find plenty of people able and willing to speak English. I highly recommend the Palermo area for short or long-term stays in Buenos Aires."

Its worth it just to stroll around (go early in the day to avoid crowds but you will miss the sparkle and street life as a result), or head out to Palermo at night and see the fancier and best heeled part of Buenos Aires at play. Note that in recent decades Palermo has become divided up into specialist areas like Palermo-Hollywood (named for the presence of television and movie facilities and the people they attract) and Palermo-Soho. The parklands of Palermo are also definitely worth visiting as are the Botanic Gardens and Zoo."

Beautiful neighbourhood, with nice, low-rise buildings and cobbled tree-lined streets, huge nightlife with numerous nice bars and restaurants with courtyard, terraces or tables on the pavements, young crowd, design and fashion shops. Staying there as a visitor may not be the optimal solution though, as you need to get the metro to the main attractions of the city and with taxis being quite cheap it is very easy to visit Palermo at night."

A fun place to shop, eat and people watch but to be frank, Palermo may be slightly over rated, especially if one is to compare it to the soho areas of New York and London. That may not be fair, but the comparisons have been made. Still worth a walk through. We visited twice and on one of the nights, a summer deluge began and the streets became flooded with both water and garbage. Watching people jump, walk barefeet (to save their shoes) through the water was the evenings entertainment as we ate."

Plenty of good restaurants, bars, and clubs. And tons of shops for miles on end. If you are looking for a place to stay in the capital city of Buenos Aires, I would definitely recommend Palermo. My apartment was super close to the subte, making it easier to get around, and only one stop away plus a short walk to the Universidad de Belagrano (University of Belgrano) where I had my Spanish class."

            "review": "Off the beaten track in Palermo in Buenos Aires. What you need is one full day out of your busy schedule in Buenos Aires to fully comprehend and absorb the neighbourhood of Palermo. You need the full day actually to have three meals in three different classy restaurants, some good amount of time to walk around the blocks and a dedicated time exclusively to observe the people who can range from being stylish, to fashionable to outright outlandish. Think of approaching the exploration of this neighbourhood of Buenos Aires from the perspective of arts and not from science. What I mean to say is that do not follow rules, there are no theories or tips to tell you to start from point A and then take a right to eat at restaurant B and so on. You get the point right? You should have the right mindset to explore Palermo from the perspective of art so that it is abstract, it is very personal to you and subject to your own interpretation. From our experience of this fantastic part of the Argentine capital we will share a few discoveries we made which are worth sharing and chances are very strong you won\u2019t find them in Lonely Planets travelogues.First was the serendipity of surrendering into the numerous aroma of Tealosophy. Secretly located between the Avenue Armenia and Gurruchaga, this place is the treasure island of all things tea! You will fall in love again with your sense of smell when you will enter into this place. Never before we discovered something like this. The shop itself is very cosy where the varieties of tea in pots are stacked neatly in the shelves. Spicy, Clementine, Darjeeling, Jasmine Flowers and many more permutation and combination of tantalising tea all under one roof. Don\u2019t forget to buy a few cans of your favourite flavours as souvenirs. Just next to this place was an antics showroom called Paul & Co. Step in to get lost in time with carefully decorated vintage furniture, cutleries, beds and sofas. There was a strange mystery in this place. Both these places being next to each other and slightly inside hidden from the main roads in Palermo added to the extra intrigue of discovering them by chance and not by plan.Being amazed by these hidden gems in the neighbourhood, we stepped out to look for more such unique discoveries. We didn\u2019t have to go that far as the Schlifka Molina gallery was just on the same road. This was a contemporary art gallery that represents and exhibits works of national and international artists, with the aim of making galleristic curatorial practice and experimentation as a practical platform to other fields. The way this gallery was designed and the artefacts displayed resonated very strongly the creative vibe of Argentina. You will have surely thought to visit national museums and galleries to know about Argentina\u2019s past history but if you really want to know the story of the creative lot of Argentina and where the country is heading in terms of arts, you have to visit this gallery. Most notable here was the exhibition titled \u201cEl p\u00e1jaro del brujo\u201d \u2014 The bird of the witch \u2014 where the Argentine Vilar\u2019s exhibition was striking, unusual, and unnerving in equal measure, drawing influence from Kenya Hara\u2019s Japanese book of poetry \u201cWhite\u201d. The artefacts were strewn across the floor in a way making full use of the available space on the floor. It created as if a 3D experience of total immersion into the art. That was not the end there. Palermo is a true hotbed of creative genius. While walking randomly we then stood in front of the workshop and gallery of the Veron Mora- Morada. The way he has created his exhibits using day to day objects that will leave you in awe. You will have never thought of making a piece of art out of pencils, would you? Or what about nails? Other than getting struck by hammer to hang your photo on the wall, you will be surprised to see the same nails being used to create a piece of heart or something of artistic value, innovative we had to say. Palermo was one place in Buenos Aires where you will get to see clothing brands and retails outlets you will have not seen anywhere in the world. That meant that the brands were either local or regional and that increased their appeal. Boutique shops, designer showrooms all with pure Argentine roots and creativity were there for your discovery. Again, don\u2019t rush in Palermo. Just wander around, take a pause and move on."

We walked from the subway station, I believe it was the Plaza Italia and then weaved up the roads into the central parts of Palermo. They center has a beautiful square with restuarants, bars, and artisan market. There\u00b4s lot of chic shopping. Cheaper than big shopping in NYC, London, or Paris, but it was all expensive for BA standards. We didn\u00b4t buy anythign. but window shopping was fun."

I then went out and about and discovered the area does have a certain charm about it even with all the broken sidewalks.Daytme is quiet and a lot of businesses are closed except for the clothing boutiques and art galleries,most restaurants open later.Nighttime is when soho comes alive with a good choice of bars/restaurants and outdoor cafes.There is a visible police presence,however I did not have any safety concerns but as a tourist I remain alert.Palermo is great at night but I prefer Recoleta In the day."

With the highest number of restaurants, cafes and bars per capita, Palermo neighbourhood offers plenty of dining and drinking options without the crazy crowds and with added peace and quiet from a lack of major traffic. Palermo Hollywood is a little quieter and the bars and restaurants are a little more trendy and upscale, but Palermo Soho has a stronger variety of quaint cafes and many bohemian dining options as well. Both districts have many outdoor dining options, and with the somewhat lazy traffic and wide streets it is comfortable to enjoy a meal or drinks on the patio. If you are able to endure the sweaty metro (subte) or willing to spring for a taxi, staying in Palermo offers a more relaxing experience with easy access to the microcenter if you're looking for a larger tourist crowd (although, majority of great discos and bars are still in Palermo so technically, you never need to leave)."

You are in BA!Use the Subte to explore this amazing city, pocket change will take you to all corners. Rent bikes, use the bike lanes. And did I mention wines for the same you'd spend on your latte at home?Finally you HAVE to hook up with Mariano for free walking tours BA from Teatre Colon daily, highly recommended. (Just remember to tip Oz)"

We stayed in Palermo Hollywood for one months in a lovely apartment(loft) in October/November 2012, we enjoyed the area with fine restaurants, fast food and the famous Santa Fe street with many shops and the supermarket Koto. Many buses are nearby to take you anywhere also the subte is available. The zoo is in the area also many parks and gardens are close. This year 2013 we hired an apartment at micro center very close to the obelisk, at September/October for one month. Although we enjoyed our stay at Palermo last year but from our new experience this year we recommend staying in Micro center for one more important reason which is to save many bus trips ( although bus fare is not expensive at all but bus trips are time and effort consuming) . We loved Palermo and we loved more Micro Center."

Stay in bed till midday and take your time... we arrived in the market area around 3 pm and saw people messing about with market tables - we thought they were packing up - as it turns out, just setting up! The restaurants at Plaza Serrano are quite possibly very good - god knows they're popular. If you eat two or three blocks away, staff will coddle you and the prices are waaay better (see review of Magdalena's) - Anyway - lots of chic shops, many gorgeous art nouveau buildings, diabolical footpaths but that just proves you're in BA. Really nice way to spend a crisp, sunny, winter's afternoon. And remember - the metro is only $2.50 peso per trip - less than US$0.50. Get out there and resist the urge of the concierge to taxi everywhere...."

Plenty of places to eat and even groceries stores in the event want to cook at your place. I found the convenience of buying at Cotto Supermarket, especially junk food and breakfast items. There is also a Claro cell company for your cellular needs in the event you carry your unlock phone with you. There is a bank and plenty of stores to shop. What really threw me off was the condition of the sidewalks and the general appearance of the place. Most of the sidewalks are cracked, there is trash and graffiti everywhere. Do not understand why the government makes the owners of the business clean their store front and have someone clean up the cracked sidewalks. It is suicidal for females to walk on high heels. In regards to the graffiti I was told by the taxi driver that the graffiti was due the free expression that most Argentinians enjoy today as oppose to the times when Argentinians were suppressed to congregated and stand in the corners to smoke a cigarette. I do not really know what are the causes to this problem, nevertheless the graffiti , the trash and the cracked sidewalks are there to stay."

Collectively these neighborhoods are know as Palermo. Most foreign tourists would do better to stay in Palermo than downtown or in another part of Buenos Aires. The streets are generally safer, and there is generally more that can be done without taking a taxi (e.g., shopping, eating, etc.). Be forewarned, however, that the sidewalks in Palermo, as in the rest of Buenos Aires, are a crumbling mess, and that trash and graffiti are everywhere. In other words, a stay in Palermo is not like a visit to Miami or London."

We have been to Buenos Aires four times and each time stayed in different places Congresso, Recoleta, and San Telmo. Each area has a certain charm but the best place we have stayed is Palermo Soho. We rented two different apartments in the areaIt is a suburb away from the heart of Buenos Aires but easily accessible on the D line from the Plaza Italia stop. It is hip, interesting, safe but above all the food is wonderful. I had never had a really good meal in Buenos Aires until I found Palermo. We would go out each lunch and dinner to a different restaurant and were rarely disappointed. Neighbouring Palermo Hollywood has abundant and good restaurants. Our favourite restaurants were Freud and Fahler. The lunch menu (3 courses from 18 pesos) is great. We walked by Don Julio's every day and thought it was another 'meat' place even though the food looked good. By the time we ate there it was the day before we were to leave and we ended up eating the rest of our meals there. Another favourite is Cluny. But there are lots of supermercado if you want to cook your own meal. Eventually we missed foods with spice.What I liked about Palermo was it was quiet compared to Congresso or San Telmo. The streets were tree lined and the houses were interesting to look at. There are lots in nice apartments to rent and most are as trendy as the area. The shopping is good and stocks a lot of local brands. There are lots of artists who set up shop weekends in the Plaza Cort\u00e1zar. (Well it closed while we were there and protestors (vendors) wanted it reopened).If you like to walk there are lots of areas to explore. At least twice we walked downtown along Avenida Santa Fe."
