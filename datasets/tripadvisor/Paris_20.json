The view of Paris from there is really spectacular. There's lots to do, depending on how much time you have. We walked around a bit and then took the bold move to climb up the 300 steps to the top of the church's tower, steps that were spiraling up for the most part! Tiring but worth the entrance fee and the effort to climb. You can also see the Eiffel Tower from here. Avoid carrying bulky things that can hinder the climb up. The trip down is at another point. Then we stopped at the garden to view the artwork of the many local artists - very pretty. The whole town is a beauty I must say. If you loved gamlastan in Sweden, you would really love this rather quaint place. Everything about this place is suited for photography!"

Visit the musee Montmartre as well and see not only the well known artists connected with having lived and worked here, but also the ancient photos of the can can dancers of the Moulin Rouge.

The food and wines were superb! Aaaah, the nougat.... The views from Montmartre are so wonderful, much better than those from the Eiffel Tower. We left on foot and wandered down little winding streets until we emerged in lower Montmartre, Boulevard de Clichy, near Moulin Rouge. The entire afternoon was spellbinding. The arts history of the place, the local culture, the locals themselves, were fascinating. Please give yourself at least an afternoon to drift around in this district."

Our first morning after arriving in Paris and we only had a few hours before having to go on a planned tour so walked up to Monmart from our hotel.

Great views of the city, including the Eiffel Tower and the church Sacre Bleue is a beautiful building."

A thorough waste of money and time. The nearly 3 hours of slow walking was about 50% commercials for local businesses and 40% info that was directly from Wikipedia. No place for 'rest stop'. If it had been a hot day, folks would have dropped from the heat. If you wish, take the white tourist 'train' that moves along the streets with an audio recording (6Euros each)."

It's architecture beauty, history and views of Paris make it a favorite of locals and tourists. But remember than getting there is all up hill. Just a short walk around the corner is the artist area with fewer artists than you might think. I was a bit disappointed in the number of artists painting on the streets and especially the prices that charged for the work, but it is Paris. Back down the hill is what one might cionsider a shadier part of town where one might become more vigilant of the surroundings and people. Although the Moulin Rouge is an attraction it a one time thing to walk by, take a picture and keep moving. There are many restaurants that are very good in this area as well as plenty of souvenir shops. The entire area has its benefits. Visit and walk the area in the daytime."

You have to get away from the main tourist thoroughfares and the area is charming. I suggest walking from Sacre-Coeur to Cimetiere de Montmartre. You have to take random roads though!

But Montmartre is also home to some of the city's best music gear shops, best shops overall, and most interesting artists. It also has some great cafes. It is probably the most \"hilly\" part of Paris, so be prepared that walking around will involve going up and down hills more than the rest of the city. Don't miss the Two Windmills cafe, as seen in the film Amelie (and which has tasty food, btw), and enjoy all the little shops along the way as well as let your kids enjoy the various ornate merry go rounds one seems to run into in Montmartre."

This site is a must visit, metro has a station 5 mins away at Anvers, I travelled solo on a Sunday afternoon, I visited the church which in itself is an imposing figure on mont matre, the way up is great as more and more of Paris gets visible, \" an elevator train \" vehicle is available up to the foot of the hill. Entry into the cathedral is free, however \u20ac6 fee is required for access to the dome where an excellent panoramic view of Paris won't disappoint. The ascend via the stairs is energy sapping and can cause a bit of dizziness if one goes fast. The views are so rewarding I would ascend again on another visit. A powerful camera will come in handy as the glare in the afternoon can affect the picture panorama. Inside the cathedral, care is to be taken , respectful silence and dress as this is still an active sanctuary for Catholics / faithful. The splendor of the architecture and interior design of it can not go unmentioned. A must visit site, I didn't need to book in advance and not many queues typical of other Parisian attractions."

Some streets seem a bit tatty, others are charming and beautiful, all of them interesting. We saw everything by foot and felt safe throughout. The area is a residential abounding with shops, restaurants etc. It is also only a 5 minute metro ride to the centre of Paris near Notre Dame.One of the anchors here is the Sacre Cour Basilica, requiring a good climb but offering some of the best panoramic views of Paris. The Basilica itself can be a wondrous experience if you have the time to linger around a Sunday mass, which adds incredible life and ambience. Another highlight for us was finding long established mid-priced restaurants mostly patronized by area residents, not by tourists.I'd say take an afternoon and get creatively lost, it's worth it. I suggest branching out from Sacre Cour along the local streets winding downhill to some interesting main avenues."

Of course the landmark basilica is atop Paris\u2019 highest hill. We labored up 237 steps and were greeted by street artists who wanted to do our portraits. It is an interesting area. Lots of artists. Years ago on a visit here, I bought a $35 oil painting (signed by Jean Salabet). He became slightly famous and I sold the Paris street scene for $480 much later. It\u2019s now worth at least $2,000. There were no similar bargains on this visit. We found there was an easier way to get to the top, a lift of sorts. We admired the bright white Sacre Coeur. The Sacre\u0301-Coeur is not the favorite piece of architecture for Parisians. Tourists love it. The structure\u2019s bone-white exterior is due to its secreting calcite when it rains, bleaching the walls.We were too tired to enjoy much, hardly getting our cameras out of their cases. We trudged down the hill, found a pizza place and had a late breakfast of pizza primavera, featuring bits of hard- boiled eggs. We washed it down with bottles of Heineken. It\u2019s best to be rested when doing Montmarte. And use the lift."

First found our way to Sacre Coeur and climbed up there and down. Lots of streets with lots of shops and cafes. Lots of cobblestones and lots of hills - so be forewarned. Loved the scenery. Artists are there doing their work and some offering to sketch you (beware of the cost before agreeing). Just as I read, there were folks trying to put bracelets on people and then charge them for it. I had to actually pull my arm away - they're kind of determined. Beautiful for a 2 hour visit, but I wouldn't plan to spent a whole day there."

I recommend visit the night view it is incredible . you can reach there buy metro or a mini bus from Pigal . You can visit the Sacre - couer Basilica as well , in a walking distance . strongly recommend . don't miss it."

However, this time we went, we found that we had more time on our hands so made a visit to Montmartre a priority!We went via the Sacr\u00e9 Coeur which is another wonderful site to see and climbing the multitude of white steps and being rewarded by sweeping views across the whole of Paris is absolutely worth it.From the Sacr\u00e9 Coeur; Montmartre is just a short walk away and the cobbled streets and diminishing traffic let you know you are nearly there! The quaint shops, restaurants and whole ambiance is wonderful, we cannot help feel it is just full of Parisian character and exudes romance and the charm of yester-years!The shops sell everything from necessities to the never-ending trinkets and souvenirs. As previous reviews suggest I will agree that there are quite a few artists there but never once were we pestered, they did ask if we would like our pictures painted but when we declined they couldn\u2019t have been more polite and wished us a good day with the most amount of sincerity.We did enjoy watching an extremely talented \u2018one-man-band\u2019 Lady with the most amazing singing voice and if she wasn\u2019t singing she was whistling tone-perfect!If you find yourself peckish while in Montmartre you will never go hungry, there are so many places to get treats, ice-creams, lunch, dinner and many more things besides!If you go to Montmartre on a sunny day the whole feeling you get from this place is even more enhanced (if that is possible) as it is just so easy to while away your day watching the world go by and taking in the whole atmosphere that Montmartre has to offer for both tourists and locals alike."

It is now part of the historic core of Paris, and not to be missed if you are there for more than three days. This is where the Moulin Rouge is also, at the base of the hill in a seedier neighborhood. But the upper parts of the hill are so clean, quant, with many artists painting in the streets and galleries. Many restaurants, and unfortunately tourist tomohawk shops but I just ignored them. The rest was great. The best restaurant of our trip was there (Comestibles by) Jeanne B, wowza! Fantastique!!!"

You can take the metro to get close then a nice energetic walk to the top (there are other options, but we needed some exercise). Sacre Coeur is a beautiful basilica on the top of the hill with sweeping views. Go inside and take in the stained glass windows, saints and history. Light a candle for a loved one and take a moment to enjoy. After visiting the basilica, head around to the plaza. There is live music on the way and an ever-present lady who plays a giant music box and sings old french songs. She has been there as long as I can remember. Make your way down the street for a cr\u00eape or try a famous sausage made in a giant grill.Make your way over to the artist where you may want to purchase some local art or have a portrait made. Overall, I would put this on a must visit place. Yes, it is touristy, but what isn't any more. If you want the best of both worlds, then go to Montmartre and get lost in the little windy streets. You may discover something new and get away from the crowds for a while. It is simply beautiful up there."

However, it's interesting to stroll through the narrow streets and discover things off the beaten path, like Place Marcel Ayme or the poem on the fence/wall near Dalida's bust.

Some of the art works in the small square are rather nice but they didn't seem very cheap. You may find yourself accosted by people wanting to sketch you, for a cost. My noticeable beard caught the attention of a number of these artists. Quality of the sketches varies but I did succumb to one guy who did a very good job. It took 10 minutes in my case because of the level of detail.

The atmosphere in the coffee's are incredible!!! Preparer you camera for a nice shots of the neighbourhood and Paris. Is close to metro station. Sundays is really bussy, is better if you can go in a week day."

Songwriter Charles Aznavour in \"La Boh\u00e8me\" , sings of a painter that recalls his youthful years in a Montmartre, one that has ceased to exist. \"I no longer recognize the walls nor the streets, that had seen my youth. At the top of a staircase I look for the workshop of which nothing survives. In its new d\u00e9cor Montmartre seems sad, and the lilacs died\" The words reflect the end of a bohemian period enjoyed by artists such as Dali, Monet, Picasso. And so it is - now filled with artists plying their mass production talents to tourists, and empty restaurants serving characterless world foods such as Burgers, pizzas, pastas. Where is Paris, where has the essence of France gone? Where is the character for which the world once hung on every food, art, or couture development. Its long gone, drowned in a chaotic mess better represented perhaps by a Jackson Pollock of abstract impressionism. Dull, dull, dull disappointing place filled with tacky souvenir shops, empty restaurants serving food lacking both imagination and character, filled with selfie stick wielding tourists buying artwork the artists themselves are prostituted for. France/Paris it is NOT. As the song concludes, \"it doesn't mean anything anymore..... but go and have a look. Then tell the truth or it will never change. The Emperor is not wearing any clothes."

We didn't get to see the Dali museum nor did we get to spend a lot of time in the galleries. We also missed the funiculaire.The only downside was the constant approach of artists asking if we wanted our portraits drawn and sometimes following us around. As a mother travelling alone with her 2 teen daughters, I didn't appreciate this extra stress. On a cooler day, we would have eaten outside in one of the canvas covered restos in the square.

This is an obvious tourist stop. There are souvenir shops everywhere and there many artists offering their paintings. Some might approach on the street willing to do your portrait for a price. ($$$)Recommend you take the little sightseeing train. You can see and learn a lot about the neighbourhood in a few minutes and it's reasonably priced."

Bought a small painting from a local artist as my favourite souvenir. Many people were having portraits drawn. We got some tips from the Rick Steves' walking tour guide as to locations to visit while walking through Monmartre. One of my favourites was visiting the Cafe de 2 Moulins (Cafe from the Film \"Amelie\"). We found a nice Gelato shop. Walked by the Moulin Rouge, but never went inside.

There are a few nicer shops but they are more a rarity than the normal. As you move away from Sacre Coeur, this appears to be a working class area and shops are associated with every day living."

Our hotel was in the Montmartre district, right around the corner from the Moulin Rouge. A lot of that area was full of weird sex shops and unsavory-looking people. Be careful around there because a lot of pickpocketing and late-night crime can happen around Pigalle. Otherwise, it was lovely. Be careful of people near Sacre Coeur; there's a gang of men who will harass you to buy things or make you pay for a \"friendship bracelet\". The restaurants around here are good. We found a lot of little places that sold great chocolate and other sweets. Most of this area also speaks English. Just be polite and ask (in French) if they speak English. Tons of little shops with neat arts. I bought a few cat figurines and knick-knacks from hole-in-the-wall places."

Amazing views of Paris buildings and rooftops from the top. Lots of little streets and cafes and shops at the village at the top. Even if you don't go into the Sacred Heart Church at the top, it makes for great pictures from the outside and people were taking selfies galore. Also the place to get your picture drawn by one of the many artists around the little central market place. I would watch them do someone else first as some were better than others and all had different styles, so worth taking the time to see what you want. Some people were wandering around with sketch books also offering to draw people, but you might want to go to one of the ones where you get to sit down and they take their time drawing you. It wasn't cheap to sit down and eat at any of the places up there, captive audience I guess, but not that bad if you want a takeaway crepe or something. And if you want to buy the little coloured Eiffel Tower key-rings, they sell for 50 cents each in the shops up there, but the guys selling them from the floor on the main steps up, are doing 5 for 1 euro. Don't be put off if you can't get up all the steps, there was a tram up and also a little train going up the road. It is quite cobbled though, so be aware of that for pushchairs, wheelchairs etc. Also beware of the bunch of men hanging out at the steps near the bottom, as we were coming down, they were grabbing us to try and tie a string around our finger to then make a bracelet to force you to pay for it. They were quite aggressive, so I suggest making no eye contact, keep your hands in your pockets or balled up so they can't grab your fingers and trap you, and just keep walking. If you like skyline views, it really is worth it though."

We learned this time that the tram takes metro tickets, so we used those to try to save our kids legs for the stairs, but we probably wouldn't do it again. We love the area, and truly enjoy the hike up the stairs to experience one of the most amazing views. My 2 young kids (4, 6) made it to the top without a problem, and loved seeing the Eiffel Tower and the city. We walked through the church on the way out, and there was a service going on, which was great to experience.

This part of Paris felt majestic, from the cafe in the movie Am\u00e9lie to the shared residence of Picasso, Modigliani, Van Gogh, and so many others.If you're looking for something different than the typical Paris tourist attractions, go visit Montmartre! And make sure you seek out some history and guides, as they really help bring the town to life!"

Montmartre can be a bit of on the tacky side, with all the street peddlers, pickpockets and gaudy shops stuffed with merchanduse aimed at the tourist trade. There's obviously a reason. One is the charm of the steep old streets. The crowds of tourists themselves are compelling to people like me who like to watch Thorpe human parade almost anywhere Sacre Cour is a dominating element from most of Paris and it returns the favor wit steps and other aeries. As a compulsive about cathedrals from a secular view, I also cider the divine either as designed or just occurs. Despite its considers appeal due to its site and meticulous construction and richness of detail, it is too studied and not to the minds of many. Not very inspiring as architecture.

This is definitely a place to visit off-season, but if you must go in-season and want to see it without being buffeted by the tourist hordes, take the small Montmartre bus from the 18th arrondisement Hotel de Ville up to the top, just past Sacre Cour, near the main place and get off if the crowd is reasonably sized or, if not, just stay on the bus until it returns to where it had started.

On another trip to Paris I said to my wife I am going today as I have a 1936 pre-Nazi print of the steps of Montmartre by Brassai on my wall. That print kept sucking me in wanting to see those steps with the lamps posts in the fog. We went and the church was immediately evident but could not find my steps until I rounded a corner and there they were. A bucket list item crossed off. The whole experience was fantastic. Go and see it all but don't miss the steps. One last comment, all of the cab stands that day were refusing to take Americans!! We had half of Paris to cross to get to our bus at the place de la guillitine and would not make it on time on foot...we saw an empty cab double parked got in and waited for the driver and told her where we wanted to go, begrudgingly she took us. They were nasty that day unless you came out of a large hotel, then they would take you and that's how we got to Montmartre in the first place, getting back was different. We were last there in 2014."

Yes, if you are on your own, or a couple please be extra careful and try to walk or be with a bigger crowds. I think especially you are visiting during the early hours on a Sunday where it's less crowded as no police will be around.So this was what happened. I was with my friend and as soon we walked in to the the lower level entrance to the Montmartre at round morning 9-9:30am hours. We noticed on the ground there were lots of colorful strings and on the top of my mind I thought there might be a celebration or something. We both were approached with 2 black men grabbed our arms and trying to tie a string to our thumb and making a bracelet to us. We were saying 'No' 'No' 'No' but they kept insisting and then say they are from South Africa and we have to treat them with respect. Hence not wanting to cause any troubles I then let them be while they distracted my friend to one side. They would then ask for money for the bracelet. If you do, please never, and I mean never took your wallet out and as soon they spot how much you have they will take your money. This is their tactics as another men of their team will come over and start threatening you. They took \u20ac20 euros of from me a or should I rephrase, \"They robbed \u20ac20 euros off me\". So please be extra careful and spread awareness to anyone whom might be visiting the place. I felt disgusted for their act and it's not fair and nice to daylight rob any tourists they approach and there were no policemen at that time. Please don't be victimized by any of these thugs."

Heading back there with my family, I was nervous it wouldn't live up to my memories, but it did! Seeing all the artists in the square is just an amazing thing. I love strolling among the easels and viewing all the different styles of art. I had a wonderful charcoal portrait done of my teens for a very reasonable price. There are wonderful cafes for meals or snacks. To me, a trip to Paris is not complete without a visit to Montmartre."

And, of course, the Basilica of Sacre' Coeur at the top of the hill is worth a visit in itself. It is the highest point in Paris, and it is a gorgeous Roman Catholic Church.When we were in Montmartre this summer, though, there seemed to be more illegal gambling than we have ever before seen. We saw several unhappy \"customers\" who were losers in the shell games that are played every few feet in the middle of the streets. The gendarmes try to keep the illegal activity under control, but there are so many customers who think they are sharp-eyed enough to win, it is difficult. There are lots of shops with interesting and often cheap (in price and quality) merchandise for sale. Wear your important documents and money close to your body. "

The restaurants immediately near the church were fully booked, but further down the hill we found a wonderful family-owned restaurant with a delicious meal (roast duck). An apple dessert topped the meal."

I was looking forward to a walk I'd planned around Montmartre, seeing the house where Degas lived, the windmill famous from the Renoir painting, and Sacre-Couer. I did not like it. Boulevard de Clichy is like 1985 Times Square but seedier. I started my walk at the Moulin Rouge and then realized I was in the heart of the Paris sex district. Not cool when your a solo woman. I skipped much of my planned walk and just saw Sacre-Couer. It was getting to be dusk so I opted to take a taxi back to the city center. I wouldn't recommend this area to a person like me, but I'm sure it's fine as a man or with a group or others, or maybe even earlier in the day. I'd planned to arrive at Sacre-Couer at dusk to see the sunset over the city."

Montmartre has beautiful views with a lot of historical buildings, although some of that is tainted by the number of touristy set ups and gift shops.

Generally the more populated paths are okay, but if your exploring the smaller streets beware. That being said the restaurants off the beaten path are better experience than the tourist packed area by the artists corner.Also the stairs coming up from the abbesses metro station is not for the faint of heart. The walk has gorgeous tiled art as you walk up, but the stairs are steep, spiral and seemingly never ending. I believe there is an elevator but I have never used it."

My suggestion is to take a walk on Montmartre, enjoy the atmosphere but have your dinner somewhere else."

The restaurants on Place du tertre can be good place for a drink but I would not advise you to eat there : the restaurants pretend to be typical but they have to serve so many people and have so much pressure (running a business in a place like that means that you pay a very big rent) that you won't find anything but meals heated in the micro wave."

A part of Paris not to be missed.If arriving on the metro from either Anvers or Abbesses walk up to Sacre Coeur via the steps and linger near to the top and take in the view to the west - especially as the sun goes down. If it has been a hot day and you are felling weary you may wish to take the funicular railway to the top. This is located to the left of the steps. You can use your metro ticket for this ride. Do take a moment to walk down a few steps to take in the view.The area is still populated by artists and in the summer you can purchase paintings - be careful as the paint may not be dry!Be aware of groups tying string around fingers and then demanding money. As in any city be careful about making eye contact with these people. These were located at the bottom of the steps on my last visit. There are lots of good artists offering to sketch you. They are open to bartering on their original quote.The main square is very atmospheric even in the winter. There are many cafes and restaurants around the area and eating simple chicken and fries in the square with a nice glass of rose in the summer is most agreeable.The cemetery may be of interest and a quick check on Google will give you an idea of notable people interred there.If you walk through the square to the south west and turn right/west at the stairs there is a fine view, just a short walk along, of the Eiffel Tower between the roof tops.I am male 67 years old.I first visited Montmartre when I was 21 years old. My next visit was when I was 23 and decided that this was the place to propose to my now wife - so be careful."

It's also home to a lot of bars, cafes, and restaurants that serve well into the night. As you move away from Place de Clichy along Ave de Clichy, towards Canal St. Martin, you'll watch the neighbourhood deteriorate into a ghetto. This area is also home to the Sacred Heart, which is one of the best attractions in the city. But if you don't mind a little loud music into the night, and few dodgy folk here and there, it's not too bad of an area. Watch out for scam artists in and around the Metro stations in this area.

There are many stairs, lovely cemeteries with such beautiful headstones, cobbled streets, cafes, bakeries, grocery stores, plenty of every day scenes. As we got closer to the Basilica, souvenir shops, galleries, cafes, artists at work abound. This area is very popular with tourists, and as the day progresses, the crowds grow. Make sure you get plenty of time to watch some of these amazingly talented artists producing portraits and silhouettes on the run. Others are working at watercolours and oils. It is truly mesmerizing to watch them at work. The basilica is lovely and unique and worth a look.

If you can, do not take the funicular, it is not worth it paying the ticket - true, there are stairs but not so so many. Also the views from Sacre Coeur will reimburse you. Be prepared for lots of tourists, but when we visited, the queue was very small and we entered very quickly! The entrance is free, but you need to keep quiet. There is someone at the door that apparently reminds you to keep quiet, but when we visited he also did not allow a girl to enter the church as she was wearing tiny shorts-apparently they seem to check dress code, but we did see other girls and ladies with shorts and skirts. Also, a visit to the place du tertre with the artists is a must, but this is a tourist trap. Do have your portrait made, but ensure that you go around and check that indeed they paint from scratch, as some seem to simply be painting over already made paintings... Take the time to see how the artist draws another person."

My wife and I found it much, much easier than London. That said, over several days in Paris, the only place we returned to was Montmartre - and we returned here twice. It was a lovely neighborhood with lots to enjoy. We found some of the best food in Paris here and enjoyed just strolling around the area, especially the steps up to Sacre Coeur, where the views were great and they had people just lounging around listening to street performers. There is a little chocolate shop/museum in the area that is worth finding. It not only has great chocolate, but giant replicas of Notre Dame, the Eiffel Tower, Gargoyles, and more, made completely out of chocolate. It was pretty neat."

If you're able to find a parking spot (like we did...very lucky!), you'll see how cool this place is. There is a square filled with artwork and surrounded by restaurants with friendly waiters. If you walk further you'll turn the corner to an amazing church that is free to enter! In front of the church is the amazing view of Paris.

We were only harassed one other time during our week-long stay by the Louvre, but it happened at least 8 times between getting off at the Anvers metro and getting to the top of Sacre Coeur. Ladies with petitions, large groups of men clogging up the pathway pretending they found your jewelry and not letting you pass, people following very close behind you trying to snatch your purse or wallet. I was aware that these were issues in the area but it was a lot worse than I thought it would be. I had to be very verbally aggressive, in French, and literally push them out of the way to make them back off. I had no jewelry or electronics and spoke only in French so do not even know why we would have been targeted. I'm glad I got to the top of Sacre Coeur for the view, but we were out of there immediately after that and I would not go back to this part of town on my next trip to Paris."

If you walk past the church and down the road you come to this area that is full of shops and cafes trying to get the tourists dollars. They have the so called artists who will draw your picture for a fee.I looked at my wife and was like.. \"Let's get out of here. This is stupid..\" The neighborhood is nice, but certain areas scream \"tourist trap\". I like to go where the locals go and those certain areas detract from your Parisian experience. Walking up there is a bit of a challenge too. The roads run circularly around and up. A map is ok, but GPS on your phone helps the most. Plenty of small restaurants with really weird hours. You will see them, but the majority are closed until they open late in the day."

There is a funicular if you don't fancy the steps up to sacre coeur but to be honest it hardly seems worth the effort of ticket buying and queuing! In summary if you're visiting Paris and you have got a few hours to do some site seeing this is a lovely part of the city which has a real buzz to it, and providing you're reasonably fit (for stairs and steep hills in places) it is a must do on your list of things to see."

Once you arrive on the metro, you are at the lower, kind of smutty end of it (near muolin rouge). From here, take a cab to the cathedral at the top of the hill (it is a pretty long hike up). Tour the sacred heart cathedral - it is amazing, I liked it better than Notre Dame. Then hang out on the lower steps to watch street performers - there is tons of talent here. Locals will bring you cold Heineken beers, this is enjoyable but watch out for the rip-off. They are selling 9 oz beers and their opening price is 2 for 10 euros. With some stiff negotiating they will quickly drop to base price: 3 for 5 euros. Don't be intimidated or feel you have to accept their price because they opened it and shoved it in your hand as soon as you expressed interest. If they don't give you a fair price, hand it back - it is not your fault they opened it. Then mosey down the hill for some amazing food, drink and atmosphere. You will also discover some amazingly talented portrait artists in the square here. Keep working your way down hill and you will eventually find yourself back at the metro."

The area has all sorts of different types of bars and shops some classy and some quirky. The obvious standout attractions are The Sacre Coeur basilica and the Moulin Rouge, both are worth visiting if you are staying there a while. There are numerous other things to do like the chocolate shop they have there down one of the side streets which has some of the most incredible chocolate you will ever see including a large size Notre Dame Cathedral made out of chocolate. There is a dark side to the area to beware of monty men sometimes are around the area. These are the guys who use the three disks, shuffle them and you try to pick the one with the white dot on. You will never win from this type of game as they are using sleight of hand, the people you do see winning are in on the act with them, so don't bother be careful of even watching them as they will most likely to have pickpockets working in their group as well. The best thing to do would be to get as far away as possible. At night time the drug dealers, pimps and prostitutes come out, just ignore their advances and they probably won't bother you too much. For me I have generally enjoyed my visits here and had some great experiences. I would recommend visiting the Montmartre but with a bit of caution."

Montmartre is an area laden with artistic and cultural significance, but now transformed from its past seediness into a clean, safe, and attractive area suitable for strolling, dining, or taking in nearby tourist attractions such as Sacre-Coeur or the Musee Montmartre. If you stay north of the Boulevard Clichy, which is still dotted with sex shops and tawdry storefronts, the charm of the neighborhood quickly emerges. Walk along Rue des Abbesses, the key thoroughfare, for the widest array of shops and restaurants and access to other attractions."

First we stopped to admire the view of the city from the steps of Sacre Coeur, then visited the church before venturing around the square. Artists and cafes dot the main square, and there is even a Starbucks -- great place to pick up a 'Paris' mug if you're a collector like we are.Behind Sacre Coeur is a church which is said to have been built on top of the site where early Parisian Christians were martyred. In those early days of the city Christianity was forbidden, and Christians were killed for their faith - then outside of the city on top of the hill where Sacre Coeur and the oldest church in Paris, St. Pierre de Montmartre, is located. That church is small but has a wonderfully spiritual feel to it. Both churches are free to enter, but be prepared to have your bag checked (at Sacre Coeur and also at other important monuments -- a sign of these times). In the square are many artists -- our guide cautioned us that those who approach tourists to have their likenesses painted are not as good as those who do not -- personally I wasn't sure if that was truly the case but in 15 minutes time if you're willing to sit you'll take home a portrait. The later you go into the day the more crowded the area becomes -- but a fun place nonetheless."

It is easy striking distance to the main attractions of city center for walkers, and even easier by bus or metro. While it is certainly popular, it is nowhere near as overrun with tourists as several other parts of the city.We stayed at a delightful little boutique establishment called Hotel Joke (part of the Asotel group) on Rue Blanche, which gives way a block and a half north to the delightful Rue Lepic, at the Moulin Rouge corner."

The biggest attraction in this neighborhood is the Sacre Coeur Basilica, which I highly recommend not to miss. We walked from our hotel (which was about 2 blocks from the metro) to the Sacre Coeur and found some cool streets. The Montmartre area has a lot of hills (some pretty steep), so if you are someone with physical disabilities (bad knees, etc), I would not recommend this area to stay, but definitely visit if you can. I believe a cab from the Latin Quarter to Montmartre was about 20 euros."

Avoid the Place du Terte if you can - too touristy. But do enjoy the view out front of the basilica. The streets can be very steep, and there are a lot of stairs to climb, so just be aware and go slowly if you need to. Enjoy this beautiful part of this fantastic city."

Also worth paying the 6 euro to walk up to the dome lookout. 300 narrow winding steps to get there but the view is amazing. After lunch we walked down the hill towards Moulin Rouge. The little village along Rue Lepic was gorgeous with some great shopping especially the cheese shops! Caught the metro back from just outside Moulin Rouge. Great Day, definitely worth a visit if you have a spare day in Paris!"

To reach Montmarte, it's a climb up the hill but worth every step. (There was a bus driving through the streets but we drove partway and then walked.) The colony boasts of former residents like VanGogh, Monet, Picasso, etc. and artists still gravitate there. In my 14 year old granddaughter's words, \"It's just what I always pictured Paris as being like.\" She fell in love with the ambiance of the area with its street artists, street-side cafes, shops, etc. It's not your usual tourist trap and you should plan to do some leisurely wandering and exploring. While in the area, don't neglect to spend time at the landmark Basilica of Sacre Couer on the top of the mount. We were there on a Sunday and the music was as beautiful as the building."

We climbed back down also after about an hour, before the trains closed for the night. It took us about 20 minutes or so to get back down, a different way to a different subway station. But walking through all those back streets late at night was interesting. Not sure how safe it is, but there were three of us, so we felt fine. The buildings in the area are beautiful and so are the streets. I would almost have to recommend walking up and back through all the small streets rather than taking the trains or however you get up there normally. However, you need to have a good sense of direction, though up is up and down is down, but there are many ways to get there, and I do not remember any signs."

Walking around the area for 2-3 hours is something I suggest travellers should do."

So many artists, musicians and writers have lived in the area (including Picasso, Van Gogh and Renoir) and still nowadays the district is still very lively and popular with younger crowds at night. It is full of little restaurants, shops and cafes as well as a few churches and the beautiful Sacr\u00e9 C\u0153ur Basilica. Well worth a visit. I personally fell in love with this district of Paris."

A group of 6 or so guys who will pester tourists and try to get you to have a bracelet of string from them. One of them will grab your wrist, and even after saying I had no money they insisted, and are so forceful they will just hold onto your wrist until they get their way. They chat and seem nice enough, and eventually when he finished he asked for money, but as I reached for coins in my pocket he said no he wanted only notes. I said I had none and he pointed to a square bulge in my pocket saying it was my wallet and he needed at least 20. Once I showed him it was a battery pack for my phone he said coins will do, and he just took all the coins I had which was probably close to \u20ac8. What makes all this more annoying is when I informed some gendarmes walking around the area they didn't care, they were patrolling the entire area except where the string men worked.Once I got to the top I wasn't in the mood to go inside the church as now all my coins were taken, and the experience ruined my visit. Obviously this isn't an accurate reflection on the church itself, but the area is a hive of pick pockets and scammers and no one seems to be doing a thing."

Avoid the crowds by taking the Metro green line to Abbesses early in the morning (9am is good) and walk around the streets on your own, guided by the large tourist maps around and remembering that Sacre Coeur is at the top of the hill. Ignore the souvenier shops and the tour groups around Sacre Coeur and Place du Tertre and use your imagination to recapture the atmosphere that existed here early last century. The view of Paris from the steps below Sacre Coeur is amazing, and the narrow cobbled streets and the beautiful apartment houses are delightful. If you go on a Sunday there are services in Sacre Coeur and singing, as will as a carillion from the bell tower. Le Caf\u00e9 Templier in Rue de Abbesses serves two courses for 15 euros and quite a reasonable sauvignon. We visited on a rainy day and this probably kept the crowds down, but added more atmosphere"

Once we walked around the building, we found the tourists. Definitely worth the visit for the amazing views. The square located around the corner from Sacre Coeur was fun and festive with many artists displaying their wares. We followed a walk outlined in a Rick Steve's book that took us beyond this very touristy area past the stomping grounds of Picasso & Van Gogh. We ended up having lunch at Cafe Bruant on Rue des Abbesses, where I had the largest bowl of mussels and fries (Moules & frites) I've ever seen in the garlic & olive oil. In America, you'd get half the mussels for twice the price. Since my return I've read some mixed reviews on Tripadvisor but that wasn't our experience. The food was fine and the price seemed fair.

Didn't realize Van Gogh lived briefly in Paris. At the foot of the hill we skipped the theatre and stores and enjoyed our recent memories."

The bookstore is some antique French book shop which sells only French books. I was walking around and taking pictures, picking things up gently and putting them down when the devil herself sneered at me. She demanded to know \"do you want to purchase something?\" I said, I was just browsing and then she proceeded to push, literally shove me out of the shop. And just then I thought after all the nice people I'd met, including a shop owner just on the next street who gave me free batteries for my camera, this was the REAL RUDE PARIS I'd wanted to experience and I'd got it. I got a similar vibe from this woman on the Champs D'Elysseys who was manning the movie theater ticket booth, but she didn't have a chance to rise to new levels of rudeness. Anyway, Monmartre . . . it's that place where Amelie's cafe is. There are cobblestone streets, a beautiful church and a sweeping view of Paris. It is the must-walk-through place in Paris. Even Moulin Rouge is nearby. Walk to it, enjoy."

There's plenty of walking tours in Paris and all of them would have offered a walking tour of Montmartre. It's a great way to spend the day.Start your day with a hearty breakfast at Le Grenier \u00e0 Pain. Located just at the foot of Montmartre, this French bakery has won countless awards including the right to supply bread to the French president! It\u2019s definitely one of the best baguette I had in Paris (very likely due to the \u201caward\u201d effect). Look at that ham baguette. I\u2019m just wetting the floor yearning for this.Secret steps up and down Montmartre, to me one of the most charming way to explore Montmartre. Even random streets look so pretty on Montmartre. One of them is Rue du Calvaire and from below it leads you straight to the main square near Sacr\u00e9-Coeur, the Place du Tertre.Montmartre grew around this village square and today is surrounded with restaurants and cafes. Sitting in one of the cafes, you can watch as artists, painters, even musicians tend to the flock of tourists that visit this square.In the early 1900s, Montmartre was a magnet for what we would today consider the best artists of the 20th century. Monet, van Gogh, Picasso all lived in this hill overlooking Paris. These masters of impressionist art found inspiration here. If you venture on the the top on Place du Tertre, you can still artists gather, selling their paintings and offering to put you in one of the masterpieces you can take home as a souvenir.Just around the corner from Place du Tertre you can find a gallery dedicated to the art of Salvadore Dal\u00ed. Before you step inside, soak in the view of the city. It\u2019s a quiet corner.The \u201ccrown\u201d of Montmartre, the Sacred Heart of Jesus, aka Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur. Compared to many other basilicas, this one is pretty new as it was completed only about 100 years ago. The square outside offers perhaps the best panoramic view of the city of Paris.On a cooler winter\u2019s day and blessed with a blue clear sky, I sat myself down on the steps of the Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur and try my hardest to inch this view into my memory. The sound of a harp playing nearby, the bustle of people up and down the steps, the cool breeze of the wind, it\u2019s just perfect."

We started at Moulin Rouge and worked our way up to the cathedral at the summit. Our guide had very good knowledge of the history of the area and pointed out where Van Gogh and other famous people had lived. The cathedral site is very crowded but offers a good view of the city. Avoid the area directly below the church on the east side as it is very touristy."

We walked through the little square with lots of stalls and people asking to draw your picture surprisingly there was a Starbucks which I would never of guessed might of been there similar prices to home so we had a nice coffee and cake before making our way back down. A lady suggested that the safest metro line to use was Anvers so we walked down the long flight of steps then through a road full of shops and men doing the pea under the cup gambling game. The station was very busy and people were significantly pushing so much so we lost a member of our party who managed to get on the train but she waited for us at the next station.

Lots of great artists lived and painted there, and the place also has a very interesting history. You never know when you might be walking through a painting... Furthermore, many artists currently paint and sell their beautiful art there for affordable prices. If you love art and would like to support them, you can get some paintings as original gifts and souvenirs.Also, the film Am\u00e9lie (2001) was shot in certain locations there, and, as a fan of the film, it was interesting for me to see them live.It's definitely one of my favourite places in Paris, but I really did not like the super crowded main streets."

If you're touring around Paris, the Metro is the fastest and cheapest way around. The Navigo is the easiest pass and least expensive. In Montmartre, the church is well worth the visit. There are far fewer painters on the square than in years past, and they are very aggressive in wanting to sketch your portrait.

I've been visiting here for over 20 years but yesterday while walking up from Pigalle is was disgusting. People were trying to sell us everything under the sun every step of the way. At one point on the stairs some guy grabbed my hand and tried to braid some string on my finger- I had to literally tell him to step away and don't touch me. The city should really curb this behaviour. So, do go and enjoy the church, scenary and surround neighbourhood- just beware."

The place is well connected by Metro (Anvers Metro station), offers decent food options and is just next to the sacred and beautiful Sacre Coeur Basilica. There are some stairs which you would enjoy to climb unless you want to use funicular to go to the top. The view from the top is breathtaking and perfect for a panaroma. In my opinion this place offers much more variety of souvenirs than anywhere else. Just keep soaking the warmth of the village while you walk you would feel like you are in a different Paris. There's a museum dedicated to Salvador Dali which is worth spending your time in case you are fond of his work (Museum offers a discount if you have a valid Paris Visite pass). While roaming the streets you would be surrounding by artists who would be willing to paint your portrait in a quick time. Overall, this place should remain a must visit place in your itinerary and should ideally be clubbed with your basilica visit."

I love watching the artists doing caricatures and portraits and it wasn't until this year that I finally decided to dio one myself and out was well worth it. The ship's have allot more art to look through and the food is always great and there are allot of choices. Most restaurants up there are also great for people watching while you eat because of all the people that that make the trip up the hill to see the church. Good atmosphere is what I think makes this place a must see for anyone visiting Paris. Oh yeah, and the church is beautiful inside and out which is a bonus for getting up that hill."

This neighbourhood was in bloom when I visited it and there was a great feel of peace. Aside of the Place du Tertre and the basilique du Sacre-C\u0153ur (which are well worth visiting) there's the quiet cobbled streets. These places don't receive as many tourists (that mainly go through the Sacre-C\u0153ur and the Place du Tertre) but are incredibly picturesque. One of the most memorable experiences was (late in the afternoon) sitting under a tree in a small park, eating a sandwich. It was so enjoyable and the best thing: hardly any tourists in the most visited city in the world. If you go to Montmartre I would seriously recommend you get off the beaten track and take in the village atmosphere."

And I'm sure it's a pick-pocketer's dream, the \"artists\" in the main square probably make a fair buck, but so what. Standing in the square with the bistros, the artists, the trees, the lamp-posts, well it certainly brought a smile to my face!

Ive been to Montmartre twice: first time did tourist route (metro to center by Moulin Rouge and walked to top--a good workout). The top area is square with artists (who have to pay to be there) but it is really just a major tourist trap. Second time I went on walking tour (Sight Seekers Delight--see separate review) that was much easier route winding up the hill at manageable pace. Still saw windmills and Scre-Coeur Basilica (built in 11th century), but avoided all the tourists and crowds (except when at the church and the top main square). There is a lot to see here besides the awesome view of the whole city of Paris: the \"I Love you wall\" (Square des Abbesses) and the \"Walker through Walls\" sculpture (Place Marcel-Ayme: a story worth googling) and all of the creative, unique art tucked on walls, doorways and buildings. The area is basically a seedier part of town (the Red Light district--historically where the prostitutes were). There are some better shops and eateries, but you have to get away from the main drag (Pigalle station). It is lively area and definitely worth checking out--but be ready to walk up hilly cobblestone streets and do stairs."

Sett off from the Moulin Rough (Blanche Metro) and stroll up hill twards Sacre Ceur. If your feeling flush take a beer or glass of wine in the square and get great pictures if the city from the church. The Montmartre museum is worth a fascinating cheap detour to see where Renoir (among others) stayed for a while and painted. Remember to keep looking up for wall plaques (eg 'Vincent Van Gogh and his brtother Theo live here')"

It is a great stop for the weekend traveller who is wanting to take in the real Paris as this has a very special feel to the area. Great views can be had from the Sacre Coeur but do watch out for the street sellers as they are very forward which can be quite intimidating and they will also target children so please be warned."

There are A LOT of artists roaming around talking tourists into having their portraits drawn. Be a bit careful of this. We decided to have ours drawn after my husband low-balled the artist into a reasonable price. I would recommend talking the price down, I think the original offer from the artist was the equivalent of $150! The results of the drawing are varied, the portrait looks like us.... but not really. A fun experience none the less!"

It is best known for the beautiful Sacre-Coeur Basilica on top of the hill as well as the legendary cabaret of Moulin Rouge. Montmartre was originally a village located just outside of the city limits. Although it has long been part of the city of Paris, this area still has that charming village feel to it. This lovely district has always been popular among artists. Many famous painters, such as Salvador Dali, Vincent van Gogh, and Pablo Picasso, worked and lived in this area. Even today, Montmartre is still well known as being the artist district. This area is full of cosy caf\u00e9s, restaurants, and lovely little shops. You could spend a whole day wandering around the crooked little streets, exploring this wonderful neighbourhood, and absorbing the charming atmosphere."

The village enables you to see the Paris from an upper and wide angle. It is very nice, lively, small place where you can feel some relaxation. Actually, I cannot say that you should go there and there in Montmarte but you should visit there. There are some lovely small streets, street artists, lots of people from many countries... I think you can fee the Paris there. By the way, if you walk around the Montmartre area your walk would end up with Moulin Rouge.If you go to Montmartre in the evening you should care your personal safety (especially pickpockets)."

We stayed in the outskirts of Paris and travelled on the Metro to the heart of all the action. Our first stop was the Notre Dame which was spectacular and hearing the bells ring was truly wonderful! Such a busy busy place full of eager tourists to see the sights maybe just too busy for us so we continued walking along the south bank admiring the views and fabulous shops. What I really wanted to see was THE tower! and I wasn't disappointed! a magnificent sight, breathtaking! We had purchased skip-the-line tickets with a guide (strongly recommended!) and our guide Nico was full of knowledge and great stories. We went to the top level and the views were truly spectacular and although very busy we enjoyed our visit immensly. Our second tour was with Delicious Paris and the lovely Olga who showed us around the beautiful Montmarte and Sacre Couer. She showed us around and told great stories of the artists and painters who had a great time living it up! We shared a delicious cake from a pristine patisserie, drank coffee in a quiet cafe away from the hustle and bustle and sat in a beautiful courtyard taking in the views and atmosphere. This tour was so much more enjoyable it was very relaxing and Olga was in no hurry to rush us along, a lovely warm and engaging person who really knows her history and showed a great interest in our history too! She recommended places to eat and showed us some lovely areas which we would never have explored on our own. All in all a very unique and very enjoyable tour which took us off the well beaten track and showed a different side to the Paris we all think we know. A place I hope we will come back and visit many more times."

On a clear sunny day on the steps of the church you can get spectacular Photos of Paris and its surrounds. Or you can go the extra mile and climb the 300 or so steps to the top of the church dome and get a 360 degree uninterrupted view of Paris.If you decide to return back to the St Pierre district via the grounds in front of the church, be aware that this is a popular hangout for pickpockets and scammers. Don't stop, if they follow you make sure your bags are closed and secure, they usually only follow you if your show interest in their games.

We utilized Discoverwalks.com to book a walking tour of Montmartre (the area where many of the Impressionists lived, worked, and partied) that included skip-the-line Musee d'Orsay tickets. The walking tour of Montmartre was very, very nice. Our guide took us through the neighborhoods where the painters lived, recounted colorful stories of what happened at various venues, and took us to locations not frequented by tourists. Unfortunately, the original studies where many of the Impressionists lived and worked (Bateau Lavoir) was destroyed by fire in 1965. However, it has been rebuilt and there is a plaque on the building. The building is not accessible to the public. The tour also takes you to the location of two of the remaining windmills from the 19th century. Windmills were famous gathering spots for picnics and later breweries and cafes. You will be taken to the Moulin de la Galette, the setting for one of Renoir's famous paintings. The tour ends at a lovely garden behind Sacra Coeur that affords you a beautiful vista of the church and is a great location to take selfies. The garden itself is very nice and is away from the tourist crush. After the tour you may wish to go to a nice local cafe, or even the Moulin de la Galette (although it is priced for tourists). We chose to walk to the front of Sacra Coeur and take in the great view of the city from this vantage.After lunch or a snack, with your Muse d'Orsay tickets in hand, go and enjoy the art there. We were fortunate enough to attend on a weekend when the museum was punctuating the art with musicians of all kinds. Of course, in the Impressionist room, it was string quartets. It was a lovely atmosphere. But even without the musical performances, seeing the great works of art is stunning."

Walking up to the top of Sacre Couer we were accosted by a group of Men who lined themselves up on both sides of the walkway so you had to walk past them to reach the top of the hill where the church sits. They insisted on grabbing you to show you a bracelet they wanted to make for you. All this is probably a ruse to take your money. They held onto both my husbands and my arms. My husband told them to let go and they refused. He had to yell at them and then they acted offended. Police were everywhere for security reasons, just not in that location till our decent which helped. The view was beautiful from the top but between that experience and the numerous attempts to divert our attention with requests to buy iPhones and \"do you speak English\" we were on edge to keep our possessions on our persons. We ended our visit to the neighborhood on a worse note, someone tried to pick pocket my 6ft 250lb husband while we boarded the metro. He did not take too kindly to this and grabbed the thief, pulling him back onto the train where the guy dropped the phone and my husband proceeded to shame him. Maybe this was just a random experience but we will never step foot into that part of Paris again. There are too many other wonderful neighborhoods to visit."

After a couple of minutes stop at Maison Georges Larnicol on Rue de Steinkerque for a macarons treat ( 6 pieces for 4 Euro) I payed a 90 minutes visit to the Basilique du Sacr\u00e9-Coeur, which you can get either by stairs or by a funicular (the cost is one metro ticket). Passying by the St. Pierre de Montmartre Church in Rue de Eleuthere, I took a walk through the Place du Tertre, the headquarters of French street artists, went North on Rue des Saules to see the Clos Montmartre and the famous cabaret \u201eAu Lapin Agile\u201d, got up the stairs to Rue Girardon to reach the Place Dalida, continued on Rue Girardon to the crossroad with Rue Norvans where \u201eLe Passe-Muraille\u201d, Jean Marais` sculpture passing a wall is located (Place Ayme). At the South end of Rue Girardon I found \u201eLe Moulin de la Galette\u201d, the oldest mill in Montmartre painted by Renoir, Picasso and Lautrec, housing today a restaurant, then going South I entered the Rue d`Orchampt looking for the house where Dalida lived for almost 15 years. After a stop for a beer at \u201eLe relais de la Butte\u201d, walking on Rue Ravignan I got on Rue des Abbesses. To the left I found the Rictus Square, where the Wall of Love was erected. Turning right on Rue des Abbesses I got to Pigalle and the Moulin Rouge, where my tour to Montmartre came to its end. It was a walk to remember."

If you want to get inspired, see artists and their works in the street, and get the vibrant Parisian vibe, but also the silence of a church, go to Montmartre and then end you journey in Sacre Coeur. From the top you can see a panorama of the city - and if the weather is good it will be fantastic. I just loved how the artsy energy blended with the travellers in that neighborhood. Interesting thing was that you could spot old cabarets in some places."

It's the highest point in the city and without a doubt, carries its own aura and character. It looks like a small village with its windy roads, narrow alleys, cobbled streets, and Old World feel. There are plenty of cafes, restaurants, and shops to occupy a full day here, so stroll around the district and visit the famous Sacre-Coeur Cathedral atop the hill. To get here, the nearest metro station is Abbesses on Line 12. If you plan on using the metro frequently--which isn't a necessity because Paris is a fairly walkable town--buy a carnet of 10 metro tickets for 14.10 euros, rather than paying 1.80 euros for each ticket individually. The 1-Day Mobilis tickets (for unlimited 24-hr use of public transit) are only economical if you plan on using public transportation more than 4 trips per day since it costs 7 euros."

Many years ago my husband had a bowl of French Onion Soup in a small cafe there and was determined to find it again if it was possible. Well we actually found it right on painters square and of course he had his soup which was great and I had the beef stew which was also really nice. Meanwhile a very persistent gentleman wanted to do my portrait and after a couple of glasses of wine I finally gave in! He actually did a wonderful job and spent about a 45 minutes while I was munching away. You will be pestered if you venture into this area but he really did an excellent job so I can not complain. A small word of warning, there is a stairway and also a hillside tram that takes you to below Sacre Coeur. We took the stairway to try to find a cab back to our hotel. This area is not really great and made me very nervous walking around there so we found a cafe and got them to ring for a cab. I definitely would not be comfortable walking around this area at night as it is a tourist magnet and as a result attracts a lot of seedy characters."

Montmartre, located in the heart of the 18th Arrondissement (district) is a most beautiful experience for the mind body and spirit. As you approach the town the rich architectural and historical ambiance captivates your senses. This is a special place. As you stroll up the main street lined with shops, cozy restaurants and boutiques your eyes lock in on the Towering Majesty of the 12th century Sacre-Coeur Basilica Church which reflects the sun rays by day and glows in the moonlight from high atop Mountmartre. As you approach, a sea of what seems to be endless stairs unfold cascading upward in stages to the top. If you are a strong stair climber enjoy the trek, if not hop on the incline car and motor your way up while enjoying the views. At the top, the Architectural Majesty of the Sacre- Coeur and the 360 Panoramic Views are Heavenly! You can tour the magnificent interior and or stay for Mass. Easy to get to by bus and then some walking. Bus 30 ,31, 80 or 85 all stop at the foot of the Church."

Montmarte has 3, very easy to access Metro stations that get you anywhere you want to be easily. We liked using the Abbesses Metro stop because the street that it is on, has so many fun restaurants and shops. So the bonus of staying in Montmartre is that not only do you have easy access to Paris but Montmarte itself is amazing. The tour buses even go through it now because it has so many interesting places to see. Montmartre is now my first choice of places to stay in Paris."

Best time to go is the early morning to watch the sun rise over Paris and have breakfast from one of the local patisseries."

When I refused they grabbed me very painfully and despite my yelling and obvious discomfort they would not let me go, and no one came to help. It took all my strength to get away from them and I was quite sore from their rough grasp. Meanwhile my husband was surrounded by them and couldn't help me either. It was an unpleasant experience to say the least. The rest of the area is full of hawkers and cheap outlets, and was not really worth the metro ride out there.

Take the metro to Anvers M (line 2) then up Rue de Steinkerque which is a steep short street to either climb the many stairs up the hill or ride the Funiculaire Monmartre- Station Superierure cable car to the top if you prefer. We chose to walk the narrow, steep stairs and found it fun, if work, to get to the top. However, if you need a break there are many little rest stops along the way in the form of bars and restaurants with a couple of funny guiding remarks carved into the step fronts on the way up. At the top is Sacre Couer/Sacred Heart Basilica and if you follow the path around and slightly uphill, the artist's village. There is a square of sorts with painters and artwork displayed throughout as well as a few meandering cobble stone streets to explore. This is a great area to take a sidewalk table to peoplewatch while you eat. We chose a restaurant in the midst of the square. While touristy in pricing, the awnings and atmosphere were great and we enjoyed a late afternoon lunch in the shade before shopping the artist's displays. Once you have enjoyed the atmosphere and character of the artist's venue, move to the front of the Basilica down the front steps to enjoy the view with a pleasant plaza, park and path meandering down the hill you climbed earlier in the day.There are many natives and tourists enjoying pleasant afternoons in this plaza area so take a moment, sit on the steps and enjoy the view and good weather!"

The artists on the block are ever-changing. Ignore the hustlers to draw your portrait - the good ones don't have to hustle if you want it done. The little shops range from unique to tourist commercial (would have been nice if they zoned to protect this area from commercial tourist shops). Great place to buy gifts however. Lots of good, cheap restaurants if you walk away from the block or if you love people-watching then go for one On the block. From the RER Abbesses, take the first street to the left (Yvonne). Go 3-4 short blocks to a glass greenhouse looking structure for the funacle or stairs (on left). You metro pass works for the funacle (lift).

Eating or shopping in this tourist area near Sacre-Coeur is a tremendous mistake, but you'll want to visit the gorgeous church there both for the church itself and moreso for the wonderful vistas of the entire city.Montmartre is believed to be Mars Hill or similar from the Romans and is one of the higher points in the city with splendid views. Take two hours or so and walk from Metro Abbesses up the hill through narrow streets to the church, but avoid shopping or eating near the church.Closer to Metro Abbesses or Blanche is the real residential part of Montmartre which is home to 2 or 3 of the best baguette/bread shops in Paris and many other splendid diners and such. This is a great neighborhood for walking and shopping and people watching and unlike the part on the hill, has far fewer tourists and more residents. Of course further down near Metro Pigalle is the Moulin Rouge area and the sex shops and so forth which is worth a quick visit but not really worth exploring further or staying in that area unless you are buying dirty magazines or sex tools and so forth."

It was an interesting place to visit. We then walked up through some absolutely gorgeous streets with stunning views to the Musee de Montmartre (originally the house of Renoir). This was a small but beautifully laid out art museum that housed some amazing art and details of the history of the artists, the commune and bohemians who lived there in the late 1800's - certainly worth the visit.I loved it! Onwards (just around the corner) to the church of Sacre Coeur which was not finished until about 1902. I thought the interior reflected the art of the time. The view from the Church was stunning - overlooking all of Paris! I would definitely go back to Montmartre!"

We had an apartment in Rue Tardieu, very close to the bottom of the funicular up to Sacre Coeur. It's a wonderful neighborhood with many restaurants, bakeries, shops, places to wander. Some of the best restaurants in Paris are within a short walk. We loved being there -- people singing, accordions playing; it's a very lively place. I also want to say that in the several times we were at Place du Tertre or Sacre Coeur, we were never bothered by pickpockets or scam artists -- one woman approached me to sign a petition for the deaf, I said \"no,\" clearly, and she went away. Yes, if you're having a drink on the Place, the *portrait artists* (not scammers) will solicit your business, but if you just tell them no thank you, they'll move on to someone else. Montmartre is a wonderful place to stay; just stay on the west side of Sacre Coeur, away from a very touristy area to the east."

It has a different feel, a different city structure, and a different, amazing view. The feel is very small-town; I loved it. All the shops are small and quaint and there was a really amazing street artist market in the central square. This part of the city has tiny, poky streets instead of the big avenues of the heart of Paris, and the view from there shows all of Paris, since it is the highest point in the city. If you stand on the steps of the Sacre Coeur, you can see the entire skyline and its wonderful."

Admire the Sacre Coeur and climb to the top where you can have a fantastic view of Paris. Take your time to enjoy each part of it. Going down you can have a coffee at the Cafe de Deux Moulins ( where Amelie was filmed) at Rue Lepic or try any of the delicious pastries and sweets in the many boulangeries around. And let's not forget the Moulin Rouge - a little salty, around $190 euros for the show and a glass of champagne. But, hey it's Paris and have fun with \"la vie en rose\" and some very good wine."

All the way mounting are traditional souvenir stores. The sight of Paris that high on the hill is breath taking. You can go up using other way than the stairs , but climbing on feet gives you the opportunity to look at every detail and look behind you at the wonderful sights. Reaching the top you can visit the Basilica and also the Dali museum. What I found so charming, although a lot of people don't, is the square with the many artists who are paining the scenery or who propose to paint your portrait. I think these artists make the place look more alive . Pass by a coffee shop on your way down or eat in a pastry shop it will make your visit a bit charmer and longer . Hope you will enjoy the visit as much as I did ."

We rented an apartment thru Airbnb that was well located to join new year festivities as well as lazy morning breakfasts in the Place du Tertre and watch the world go by. A Viti to Montmarte must include a visit to the beautiful Basilica Sacre-Coeur but don't just pose out the front for a happy snap-go inside and experience its beauty. Wander down the cobble roads and take your time so you can admire the architecture and soak up the history as you head toward the city."

If you don't like to walk the many charming stairs up to Sacre Coeur you can take the funiculaire for the price of one metro ticket. There are plenty of nice looking restaurants.

The only thing we are not happy about is that they put restaurants in the park where the artists use to be. They are still there, but on the outside of the park. I guess this area got so popular the restaurants had to expand. I also love visiting the Salvador Dali Museum/gift store. They have my favorite perfume there. You should stop in and get a spray of Dali's perfume. The bottle it comes from is a sculpture of his wife's lips."

You can easily spend a half day visiting both Montmarte and Sacr\u2019e-Coeur which is just a short walk from Montmarte. Also getting up to this area I want to warn people there are numerous steps to get to the top. However there is a funicular that will take you up to the foot of Sacr\u2019e-Coeur and then you can walk from there. When you do get to the top you will be rewarded with a beautiful view of Paris. Try to visit Montmarte on either a Saturday or Sunday when the market area is filled with artist selling their art work. There are several different artists showing their art of Paris and there are also artists that will do your portrait if you would like. Always ask the cost up front so you are not surprised once they are done, and present you with their finished artwork and the BILL!! If you are interested in getting a portrait done, take some time and walk around and see who you think will do the best work for you. The best artists are the ones in the park working in their stalls not the ones that are walking around and approaching people, these people are usually just out for the money and are not the most reputable.I always try to remind people to be aware of their surroundings and what is going on around them. The Montmarte area and the area around Sacr\u2019e-Coeur is known for \u201cPick Pockets\u201d so just be alert and you will be fineHope you have found this information helpful and if I can be of any additional help please contact me. Paris is a beautiful city, so while visiting, be adventuresome and venture out and see what all the City Of Lights has to offer.Lary1047"

The atmosphere is just really cosy and romantic. Even in winter the atmosphere is incredible. I especially enjoy the fact that even when it's cold the terrasses have heaters and everybody is just sitting outside."

This year we found a dramatic view from the Centre Pompidou.The interior is perhaps smaller than an exterior view across the city would suggest, but well worth a visit.My favorite memory of Montmarte is from Christmas Eve 1992 when I stood outside the chapel at midnight as snow fell and voices raised in song floated out into the night. April of 2015 we visited the interior one sunny day."

A little commercialised with portraits done cheap and on the spot. It's very vibrant and quirky. I'm not an art connoisseur so I thought it a nice experience and enjoyable. Experts in art review it as average and pricey. I think it's a part of Paris's historic past and a guided tour is advised if you want to learn about why it is a tourist area. As a solo traveller wandering through uniformed, I just thought it was a lovely area and different. I smiled walking all through these streets and lanes."

After we had visited the cathedral, we decided to explore part of Monmartre on foot. We headed down the narrow street directly in front of the cathedral. This street was called the Rue de Steinquerke. It would have been an interesting street, if you happened to have a particular fascination for souvenirs and cheap ladies\u2019 clothing. The street was home to many souvenir shops, cheap clothing outlets and cafes. Other than that, there wasn\u2019t much else. After a cursory glance in a few of the shops, we then walked on until we reached the Boulevard de Rochechouart, where we turned right and headed in the general direction of the Moulin Rouge. This boulevard had the potential to be a beautiful city street. It had a tree-lined walking path and park area in between the two traffic lanes. However, it was spoilt for us as, we moved closer to the site of the Moulin Rouge. In this area, lining either side of the boulevard was a large number of sex shops and sleazy strip clubs. Not exactly the type of area where you would want to go walking, if you happened to have children with you. Fortunately, we did not.When we finally reached the Moulin Rouge, we had a quick look at it and then began our return walk to the hop-on, hop-off bus stop. We had been to the Moulin Rouge at night-time during a previous visit to Paris. The building looks much more impressive at night-time than it did on this occasion, during the daylight hours. In summary, we were not greatly impressed by the part of Monmartre which we saw during this walk. Sacre Coeur was by far, the most impressive attraction which we saw in the area. Perhaps we should have done more research before we went there, so that we could have seen the nice arty part of Monmartre."

We loved the little shops and bought wine, bread and cheeses for our picnics. It seemed a bit quieter here than being in the Paris hub area. We had visited Sacre-Coeur on our last trip to Paris, so this time we chose to view some other attractions. The metro makes it so easy to access all of the other arrondissements. I suggest that you become familiar with the areas you want to visit ahead of time, so you don't become lost. As for Montmartre it is a great little area, but beware there are a lot of steep streets and walking uphill was part of our daily routine. I would not suggest this area for a person who has fitness issues. Finally a caution, it was necessary on about four occasions to use a taxis service. Make absolutely sure that the driver is shown your destination location on a map. We had number of unpleasant experiences, in which our driver took us to the wrong location or on circuitous route. You may end up paying far more than is necessary for your ride."

What we did find were a lot of crowds and street vendors. The art would have been interesting but it was clearly produced by a formula to paint a certain scene and it was exceptionally overpriced. We also did not find Sacre Couer to be as amazing as Notre Dame or Saint Chapelle. If your schedule is tight, we would recommend prioritizing other areas of Paris."

Even better, find a hotel close-by and take even more time to discover what this part of Paris has to offer. Everybody will warn you for pickpockets, they operate especially around Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur and Pigalle, but in October, when it is slightly quieter than in summer, we've still seen tourists with open rucksacks on their back. Handbags are sometimes pulled off and the thieves disappear on a scooter. Quieter times makes people careless but it really is important to remain vigilant, especially here."

Not really to make a paining of the nice square but more to make drawings of the tourists (on demand) and sell overpriced paintings. Not very authentic but nice to walk around.The area around the square with the painters contains several art galleries and many old buildings and is nice to walk around. You can even find a small vineyard on the hill. We walked down through the streets and ended up at the subway station catching a glimpse of the Moulin Rouge."

Beautiful area with small streets and cafes all over the street and the amazing art work. I was told this is the area where most artists live and u can definitely see that.. Go during a sunny day and enjoy this beautiful area. We didnt book a tour guy, we just enjoyed walking all over it. Highly recommended"

There are a number of souvenir shops around and also few second hand branded clothing shops to suit choices! There was a local live band performing. The best way to reach here is by the Petit train starting from Moulin Rouge. We got to see the whole of Montmatre sitting in the train and also saved time by not having to climb up to the top. The hop on- hop off train journey is just amazing and not to miss!"

Here , on top (of the world) is a miraculous view of the entire city of Paris, including the Eiffel Tower in all its glory. Here is where many artists spend their time painting what would become masterpieces, Picasso , Van Gogh to names few  We spent the whole day browsing here. It is a day to not rush. Take a good guide book and you do not need to join a tour. We felt it much more enjoyable to do this area at our own pace."

Absolutely in love with this part of the city, If you're looking for a romantic place to stay - its just perfect. Arrive to Abbesses metro station (line 12). When exiting the metro - \"Wall of Love\" is just in front of you - have few photos here and find words \"I Love You\" in your language than head to Coquelicot - small bakery and restaurant where you can enjoy one of the most delicious breakfasts in Paris. Have a friendly chat with the bubbly waitress who doesn't speak any english but still manages to make you laugh and get the order just right - (hot chocolate here is epic btw.) Fuelled by this great french breakfast start climbing the hill to reach Sacre Cour - have a quick glimpse at the Basilica and wander around the art market next to it. Yes there is some beggars around but just ignore them and they leave you be. Trust me you will love this place !"

I have bruising on my wrist as he was holiding me so tightly and i was very afraid he proceeded to walk me towards two other men and my husband was grabbed another man but being a man he just brushed them off i had to scream into his face before he released my arm and i felt very upset and taken back by the whole experience i was hoping to see a police man about but unfortunately there was none. These men were there in force about twenty of them and i think it should be stopped its very aggressive and annoying and my wrist is still sore today. I continued on up the steps to the church and i was not dissappointed the view from the top was class and the chapel i just loved it. Dont be put off by these men just be aware that they are there and be ready to refuse them your time i just didnt know what was going on ego the title one rotten apple dosent ruin the whole bowl.

In the left exterior side of the church you access to the cozy area: just turn left at the first street and then left again and you will arrive to the artists plaza that is surrounded by coffee terraces. Nice place but my advice is visit this area just if you have seen already the other major attractions as it is far away from everything and for me is not the best part of Paris."

Some of them are incredibly talented and you can purchase some beautiful work for a very reasonable price. If you are up for an adventure and don't get too turned off by aggressive street vendors , then you'll love Montmartre. Women should be especially careful, however, because some of the vendors can be very aggressive.

Beware of some people on the stairs to the Sacre Coeur trying to rip off tourist, they start talking in a friendly way but in the end they can be also intimidating, asking you to give them tens of euros for little string bracelets and not letting you pass.

Some of the paintings are really nice, but rather expensive. You can also have a beautiful top view of Paris from Montmartre. A must see over there is the Sacred Heart Basilica Church that is another magnificent and monumental structures in Paris. If you are in Paris, go and see the place. Don't miss it."

There are plenty of restaurants to choose from.The Church at the top of the stairs offers a spectacular view of the city. Worth the climb! We happened to arrive during a Sunday evening mass.

This is the first place recommend to us by friends and family that had visited Paris. The shops are filled with art and very reasonably (cheap) priced copies of artwork, 4 for \u20ac6 or at other places 5 for \u20ac8, we are looking forward to getting them framed and putting in our hallway. Be prepared to be harassed to have your portrait drawn and they will ask top dollar for it. We actually wanted our portrait drawn but only for a good price, we were offered a drawing of us both for \u20ac50 if you are poor or \u20ac80 if you are rich, I explained I was very poor so would pay no more than \u20ac30, still probably too much but I appreciate people have to make a living, it took around 20 minutes and after we were no longer harassed by all the other artists as we just showed them our rolled up portrait and we could wander around freely.We were warned about pickpockets but I did not see any and did not lose any belongings, however keep your eyes everywhere and your money in your front pockets as we know people who have been pick pocketed here.There are many places to eat crepes here and with the incredible views of the city outside the Basilica of the Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur they are best enjoyed whilst sitting in the steps just in front of the building."

Had a wonderful time browsing different little shops selling various wares. there was quite a lot of tourist traffic and with it comes the scammers, pickpockets and seedy types. Personally I have never had any real problems with them as I try to always be very aware and conscious of my surroundings. It does detract from the place that you have to be like this to feel safe, but alas that is the Paris of 2015. I have read several reviews complaining about these vega bonds destroying the very things that tourists go to enjoy and ask why the Police aren't doing more. Well it's really quite simple, they outnumber the police ten fold. Until the Parisian government address the issues of these criminals ruining these precious tourist attractions the onus is placed upon the tourist themselves to not become a target. Sad, very sad but true."

We found Dali's home while randomly walking around and one of the top 5 artisanal ice cream maker. This is also where you would be able to find Christoph Russel, a chocolatier who makes such perfect chocolates. They only have one store. There were also plenty of biscuits, chocolates and pastry makers which you can find as you walk around which makes it so interesting as each has different things to offer. We also found Plyones which is a French nicknac maker, and its worth to explore if you are looking at functional gifts for friends or family. We really had a good time checking out the sights and walking about in the sun and will definately recommend if you have a day to spare while in Paris."

It is famous for its artists in the Place du Tertre but you really can imagine when it was a village of its own, not just part of a major capital city. Yes, it's very touristy but it does have a certain atmosphere all of its own. The nearest Metro stop is Abbesses and then you can either walk to the top or use the funicular railway (you need to use another Metro ticket/use your travel pass etc for this part of the journey). There are endless cafes, restaurants and gift shops of varying quality and you might get pestered to have your silhouette cut or your portrait done but it's not desperately intrusive and is all part of the Montmartre experience. There are some great views over the city from the steps of the Sacre Coeur - if you can fight your way through the hundreds of students who all congregate there and slightly further down, there are a couple of viewing platforms too."

Take the metro to Anvers and walk up - unless you're disabled in some way the walk is not remotely challenging. Take your time enjoying Montmartre, and wander your way down to Abesses, and on to Pigalle - both charming areas in their own right."

But it was packed and there was one souvenir shop after the next all selling the same cheap gifts for too high a price. It was just tacky stuff. When we got to the bottom of that street, we passed a few clothes stores that had a ton of clothes thrown into bins outside and people were going through them and throwing them all over the place. Not my kind of shopping. Maybe it's better up more toward the Basilica and we didn't get a chance to do that."

First of all, we stayed down near the Eiffel Tower and found the metro to get to Montmarte was quite easy to navigate. I believe we got off at the Abbesses stop.This area of Paris is very hilly, so if you have trouble walking, it might be better to take a guided tour where they can drive you places.We went on foot and it was amazing. The city has an indescribable feel to it... It feels, well, Parisian. There are several shops and restaurants on the way to the top, but it was in the main square where all the action was. You'll find dozens of local painters selling their handcrafted artwork, artists will offer to do a charcoal drawing of you (they'll come up to you a lot, but they are nice if you politely decline -- for the most part), and you can really embrace the artistic culture.Further, we found some of the best food in this area. I can't recall the name of the restaurant we went to, but we had the best french onion soup and sandwich of the whole trip (best FO soup I've ever had). There is also a winery tucked into Montmarte that is worth a visit. We didn't get to do a tour or tasting, but it is quite a sight to behold. We bought a painting from a woman who did not speak English and that is perhaps our favorite purchase of the trip. Take cash when you go as many of the street vendors do not take credit cards (some do -- for us it was hit or miss).Plus, you'll experience some of the best views of the city from Sacre Coeur on the hillside.This, in my opinion, is a must visit area of Paris. The next time we go back, we will probably try to book a hotel in Montmarte and spend much more time there."

Montmartre is somewhere that you have to visit when in Paris, but you need to accept that every other tourist will be doing the same thing. We have visited at quieter times of the year, whilst less busy, the hustle and bustle does add to the atmosphere. The easiest way to get there is either via the Metro (the stop is Anvers) or on a hop on hop off bus. There is a small walk from the Metro through a street full of souvenir shops and street gamblers (don't get suckered in to the find the ball game as many tourists seemed to be). To get to the top of Montmartre you can either climb the steps or take the funicular railway. We opted for the railway! It uses the same tickets as you would use on the Metro. It was very busy at the top but we still had fantastic views over Paris. We stopped for a drink and an ice cream (not the cheapest but the restaurant owners have a captive audience!). Our main reason for visiting was that we wanted a street side portrait of our daughter. There were plenty of options, the artists were all very nice and not pushy. My tip here is haggle! We paid 20 euros having originally been quoted 60 euros. We finished our visit with a walk inside Sacre-Coeur. This was a major let down. Not because of the church itself but the tourists. Despite the numerous signs requesting people refrain from taking pictures, the building was awash with selfie sticks and camera flashes. Frankly, if you intend to visit but you can't respect the sanctity of a religious site, you should stay away."

This does get crowded though at peak times, but the funicular rail and tourist road-train do make it a fun place to visit. The artists are plentiful and there are fair ground rides for the kids. Gardeners are catered for too! The restaurants are plentiful and not too expensive. Of course for the Can-Can hungry there is the Moulin Rouge - book though, as tickets sell out quickly despite the high price."

Abbesses surrounds is charming too and plenty of eating places. A village atmosphere that is unique in a Paris. 18th district. Metro Abesse and take the funicular.

We started out at Ile Saint Louis, where we were staying, and walked from there to Montmarte through neighbourhoods less touristy than colourful in character, to say the least. But it was interesting - I enjoy seeing the other side. Close by appears to be wedding gown land, and very close is fabric land - then comes the steps to Montmarte itself, where the tourists (and locals perhaps?) flock. We did not feel threatened, probably the three machine-gun laden army people might have had something to do with that. The view from the Cathedral is truly awesome and we loved every minute of it. The site is bustling and it almost feels like Times Square in its craziness, even with a character like \"Paris guy\" (ok, picture the Elmos in Times Square, but a character dressed up with a beret and a baguette...). It was all fun. I loved the cathedral and the entire area, with its little shops and restaurants. This was my third trip to Paris, and the first time I had gone. It is worth the effort if you enjoy a bit of hustle and bustle."

Great Italian restaurant called Moriarty, reasonable and delicious. The area around church was very crowded and had lots of souvenir shops lining the street up to the church. The caf\u00e9 we stopped in was just average with below average waiters. The shopping was disappointing since I was looking for a more upscale painting. Most were cheap souvenir pictures. But that said, we did enjoy just wandering around and did manage to go to the Champs Elysees for my favorite restaurant and bakery on the Champs called Luduree. Opt for the French toast then go to the bakery and try French Macroons."

From there, go up the steps to take the elevator up to the street level. It is a long ride up as this area used to be gypsum stone quarries. Upon getting up notice the Art Nouveau metro sign (one of a few left in Paris). Continue down on your left to head over to the base of Sacre Couer Basilica. From there if you have a Paris Metro pass , you may choose the option to take the funiculaire cable car ride up to the Sacre Coeur, otherwise you may walk the stairs adjacent or the path in the center.Be careful of a lot of street vendors that come up to you. If you touch or accept their merchandise, keychains, selfie sticks, etc., they expect you to pay up. We actually saw one being arrested by undercover for selling their wares to passerbyers. Not a good scene but obviously this is predominant in this busy area of Paris.The views from the outside of the Sacre Coeur Basilica are great if the sky is clear as it is the highest point in Paris. You can view the Montparnasse Towers (highest bldg. in Paris), Pompidou Centre (famous for its red, blue, yellow, green, and white exterior pipes) amongst the rest of Paris. So much to see and do in this area as there are a lot of quaint shops -- this was the area where aspiring singers, artists, actors, and actresses hung out before they got famous- like Edith Piaf, Renoir, Van Gogh, and Toulouse-Lautrec. There are a lot of souvenir shops along rue Steinkerque. Be wary of people asking you to take a risk or gamble over some bet on the streets here. Very busy area. Shops offer a great assortment of Paris souvenirs and the prices are reasonable.The Place de Tetre has changed somewhat over the years as there are less street artists selling their work. Restaurants have taken over a good portion of the square and it is not that nostalgic as before. Just have to enjoy what artists there are and try to relive those memories from years ago of the old Montmartre.Make sure you visit the interior of the Sacre Coeur Basilica-a unique interior with the mosaic tile. No photos are allowed inside. All in all it well worth a visit to this area of Paris."

From the moment we got off the taxi that took us to the hill, to when we got into another taxi to leave the area, we were surrounded by artists offering to do a quick sketch, drawing or painting for us. I would have loved to do so and return to the U.S. with a nice memento of our Parisian trip, but I didn't want to slow down my traveling companions. We spent a half hour appreciating the panoramic vista of the city of Paris from the steps of the Sacre Coeur Cathedral, visiting inside the Cathedral, and lunching alfresco at the town plaza while watching some street performers sing some songs. On another evening, we returned to Montmartre for the Moulin Rouge dinner and show. The friendly taxi driver who drove us back to our hotel after the Moulin Rouge show, warned us that the Montmartre area is not as safe an area at night as other Parisian districts. I had formed a similar opinion of the area before he shared that with us. The streets and storefronts are not as kept up."

Try to avoid the \"tourist traps\", would be typical restaurants....and rather choose really typical brasseries down hill! ( along the rue des Abbesses for instance) Whrn on top, of course the Basilica of the Sacred Heart is something you want to visit, but there is a really small church beside the PLACE du Tertre (the famosu painters place) its name is \" Saint PIerre de Montmartre church\" ans it's really more interesting. There is a funny \"twisted pilar\" in it and one can't avoid it!!There are sometimes open air concerts in front of the church!Place du Tertre is quite a place. One can get a caricature, or an instant painting by local (or not) painters. Any style, you pick one! Other artisrts will make your profile with paper cuts!!!! in a couple of minutes. (you will decide yourself if it's a tourist trap or not) I'm a parisian myself, and I have benn to Montmartre many times, all seasons, there is always something new to shoot, or see!! and it's fun to be part of the tourists from all over the world! and Don't forget the Salvador DALI museum!"

Walking around we see amazing cafes, shops, and restaurants. Time to start our tour. But to get there after walking around the area on our own for a couple of hours first, we walked through about 10 blocks of what we found out later was the red light district. VERY red light. Nothing R rated going on there. But it was mid day, and the characters were still asleep, so what we saw were tons of sex shops and strip clubs.We started the tour at the Moulin Rouge. Quite a history of it's own, and an obvious favorite of our tour guide. We walked through a bunch of streets, each with it's own story. We saw the original Moulin Rouge, lots of cafes, and got a real sense of the Bohemian nature of the area and the time of Picasso. At the top of the hill we get to the famous cathedral. Tons of people. Live music. A little bit of a street carnival atmosphere. Very enjoyable and NOT TO BE MISSED!Once at the top, you are on your own to get back. We stopped at a couple of cafes for a little wine. And we continued strolling around when we happen upon a chalkboard with some restaurant specials. Best food we had during our Paris trip was here at a place called Alice Pizza. It's a very nice classy restaurant that doesn't even serve pizza or look like it has EVER served pizza. Wine was fabulous Food was fabulous. Service was fabulous. Which from me, is QUITE and endorsement."

It was quaint and looked interesting, but our timing was off. But not too early for the street artist, be prepared, they are very persistent. While my friend wanted her sketch I did not want to spend 50 Euros. My artist followed me around sketching while I was repeating \"no I dont want it.\" When he finished he pulled the sketch from his pad and demanded to be paid. When I refused, He said I insulted him and he took the sketch wadded it and threw it to the ground. By the way, I didn't think it was very good and certainly wasn't going to pay 50 Euros.My friend was happy with her experience, I didn't want to get seperated from my friend, so I couldn't go too far. It was a funny story."

While the Cathedral is wonderful and definitely worth seeing, the town surrounding it is wonderful! We spent all afternoon in Montmarte and could have spent a lot more if we weren't already so exhausted. One of the local artists in the town square did a charcoal sketch of our kids and it's amazing. I'm having it framed and will be hanging it in my house. Between the 4 of us in my family, we bought several pieces of art from local artists and they were all reasonably priced. We had lunch at one of the cafes - La Boheme - and it was wonderful. My husband had a huge steak and my daughter had an endless pot of mussels. We will definitely go back and plan a longer day in Montmarte during our next trip to Paris!"

The church itself was beautiful, and the small streets were quaint, but I had mixed feelings about the whole experience. There were hoards of tourists in a main square, and we encountered a teen gang of scammers/potential pickpockets as our Airbnb host had warned us. (Going up a flight of stairs, a couple teenage girls handed us petitions to sign regarding an organization for the deaf and mute. One column was for amount of donation, which we saw lots of people had filled out! I held my purse in front of me as I signed with the other hand then left when I saw that column. My teen daughter was behind me a bit--and she did the same, but as she tried to leave, she was swarmed by a huge number of quite aggressive people; I called out to her and she was able to push her way through, still clutching her purse. Think about it--you're distracted by holding a petition board with one hand and signing with the other, and at the top of stairs you can't easily get away. The police try to crack down on these activities but are limited because they're done by minors. (Then there are also police/government activities against entire Roma settlements--makes me queasy too.) OK. So then we went to a restaurant on a slightly less crowded street. Our family of four wanted to order and share two meals (my husband was going to leave to take photos then come back only for the company, and the kids don't eat much, plus the meals were expensive). The waiter got all huffy and stormed off. Really?! (If it's a problem for them, they should print a \"shared-plate charge\" in the menu.) We should have just gotten up and left at that point but were too taken-aback. Instead, a waitress then came and was really nice, bringing an extra plate and offering us water. Other restaurants, we asked for \"regular (tap) water\" and got it. This time, she brought a liter bottle and opened the top before we could say, \"Wait, we thought you meant tap water.\" The bill showed it was 7 euros; our total bill came to 50 euros, which is still a lot. One meal had included dessert, but it never arrived and we didn't realize until we were outside the restaurant and didn't want to return. The dessert might have been a mistake, but the bottled water after acting all nice--that felt like a revenge scam. Not really better than the fake-petition scammers in my opinion (except the fake-petition scammers' families were probably poorer). This was our only bad experience with any French people or in any French restaurant during our 10 days in France. I wish I remembered its name!! My conclusion: sites mobbed with tourists probably bring out bad sides of everyone."

I was initially apprehensive when our taxi entered the area. It seemed rough, the people somewhat coarse. Lots of motorcycles and mopeds zipping around. (we were more used to the areas closer to the Seine). Still, I'm glad I took the time to stay here. Despite it's reputation for petty crime, there is an honesty to this place, and it's people. It's touristy enough, especially the areas around Moulin Rouge and Sacre Coeur. Indeed, many tourists make the trip to Montmartre just to see Sacre Coeur, and rush off. But, it's really more fun just wandering around the narrow streets here, watching the unpretentious local folk, stopping for coffee in one of the cafes and stepping into the various stores (not all sell sex toys ) It is a former red light area, and when night falls, a vestige of the old area can still be glimpsed. Very safe nevertheless, we were wandering the streets till 11pm and felt no danger whatsoever. Highly recommended."

Despite some changes over the years in terms of decor this place is one of the few remaining cafes/brasseries to have retained an interesting character and a local feel and not to have been swept up in the increasing embourgeoisement of Montmartre which I have sadly witnessed over many years. I highly recommend the morning for a visit. Excellent breakfast (& cheaper than many that are less good) friendly staff and altogether a wonderful place to hang out. I love the place!"

There's just no better way to feel like you need a beret on your head, a baguette under your arm then to stroll through the stone streets of Montmarte, up and down staircases, gazing on flower boxes and quaint vistas in every direction. It's one of the few places in Paris that feels like Haussmann didn't get his hands on it. I generally love the \"sameness\" of Paris' architecture that he created, but that's why Montmarte is a must - the last windmills, the crooked little streets, the hills, the tile roofs. Everyone goes to Sacre Couer and Place du Tetre - do yourself a favor and get lost in the streets beyond."

We visited the church of Sacre Couer, then afterwards walked down the alley to the courtyard filled with artists. We looked at the different samples of their artwork, then settled on those whose work attracted us, having portraits made for 3 of us with different artists.We ate in the cafe at the corner, La Boheme, that served delicous mussels soup and other comfort food. Walking through the different shops selling souvenirs, paintings, accessories, etc., we stopped to sample some French Crepes and ice cream. It was a very enjoyable 4 hours spent in the place.

Still the history of the place is significant and worth a visit, just to walk in the steps of some of the greatest minds and artists at the turn of the 20th century.

It has a really cool vibe with lots of street action, restaurants, pop past the Moulin Rouge for a photo, visit the Sacre Coeur and definitely visit the Montmartre Cemetery.Take a stroll down little side streets away from all the above touristy attractions and you will find quaint restaurants and an amazing vibe."

When you have time, you have to go to Montmartre. Because I spent most of life in New York and I love the Village area, I find the same place in Paris when I visited the neighbor of Basilica of Sacre and I set on the step there looking on the old part of Paris from the top. I walked in Montmartre and purchased most of my memorabilia to my friend and family. I walked the high hill and narrow streets and visited the houses were the best painter in the history spent their poor life on it. There are too many nice restaurant. One of the artists insists to draw my picture which I agreed. I still have it even it does not have anything look like me."

We were delighted to see this tiny hilly area lined with shops and restaurants. It is quite touristy , but fun. We enjoyed people watching and the quaintness of the area. We went to a beautiful, peaceful church on top of a large hill and enjoyed seeing it as much as the larger cathedrals. We were able to look down at the city below and it was all very scenic. We stopped at a restaurant and sat outside enjoying the day with some good red wine, who could ask for more! On the way back we stopped for some Gelato, yum and headed for the Funicular for a ride down to the train station. All in all a very lovely afternoon!"

He was able to sketch both us in about two hours - so be prepared to be flexible with your schedule. The morning light was helpful giving pleasing textural hints for the artist. The square itself can get very busy - coach load after coach load are dropped off. Mr Lim says that visitors need to be careful when choosing their artist as the style and quality does vary greatly - as does the cost - there is some degree of negotiation open to you."

Montmarte is the most romantic neighborhood of Paris and the district earned its name after its 130m high hill. Painters and poets such as Salvador Dal\u00ed, Amedeo Modigliani, Claude Monet, Pablo Picasso, Vincent van Gogh used to live here.The area is best known for Sacr\u00e9 Coeur Basilica (Sacred Heart) and Moulin Rouge. Rather than having lots of things to see, it offers a charming area to take a stroll. Staircase streets, quaint windmills, and sweeping views characterize the area. Wander around on the narrow, hilly streets of Montmartre. Fall in love with streets like rue des Abbesses, rue des Trois Freres, and rue des Martyres.Find the windmills on rue Lepic and the famous Moulin Rouge near Blanche metro station.Stop at a patisserie for a freshly baked chocolate croissant, a taste of creamy brie or sharp bleu at one of the many fromageries, a succulent orange you'd swear was fresh from the orchard. Then relax in a 'petit caf\u00e9' to enjoy a caf\u00e9 au lait while watching people.Beware of the false portrait 'artists' on Place du Tertre. Some will quote a low price, and after producing something that does not look remotely like you demand a far higher price. It is recommended to watch them first before choosing one. Beware of pickpockets.An officially designated historic district, Montmartre is one of the most colorful neighborhoods in Paris so it's no surprise that this area is a favorite among tourists.Subway: Abbesses (M12) & Anvers (M2)"

The street that the Moulin Rouge is on is always fun to walk down but may not be the place for younger children who like to ask questions as there are tons of sex shops.

We were urged by our friends to visit the Basilica de Sacrere on top of the hill at Montmare,and we found the walk up to the basilica very charming for the streets were lined with little shops and there were beautiful houses along the way. It had a village atmosphere and Paris must have been like that in the olden days.In the square there were lots of cafes and artists around it, painting and selling; giving the whole place an atmosphere of what Paris must have been - the ultimate destination for budding artists!  On top of Montmartre we got an overview of the city. It was a bonus for us to experience a farmers' market just next to the basilica. The farmers from the province of Perigon came to display and sell their specialities like jam, fruits, rose oil, escargot, wine, foie gras etc.We had a lovely day at Montmarte."

Unauthorised street traders were plentiful, and ladies were harassing tourists for signatures and money. My son and I sat on the wall below the church and observed gangs of 3 or 4 working together picking pockets. These people are easy to spot as they have no bags or cameras with them! At the side steps of the church a street band of 3 men called prestige were performing and had drawn quite a crowd as they were very good. However, we took the side streets to the side of the main streets back down Rue Lebec and came to the main streets full of lovely little shops, where we stopped near the Abbesses metro stop for a caf\u00e9.

Both were fantastic. We saw lot many street with great character. Beautiful Houses with creepers and flowery plants. Then we went to a public plaza. which was full of street singers, painters artists and lot of food around. Few artists offered to make a sketch of my wife but we were in hurry. We bought few postcards from a shop a souvenir to friends in India. It was fun seeing Montmartre."

The highest part of the hill is where you can easily find Sacre-Couer, the basilica of the Sacred Heart. The area around and below the basilica is full of shopping, eating places and local artists and musicians. The Moulin Rouge is nearby. At times it is very full of people--beware of pickpockets!!"

There were many artists stalls selling their works and also artists doing live skectching.

What I did not realize is that it would transport me to a place that you see only in movies! A bustling street with various artists thronging the place. Small shops with colorful items, outdoor cafes, pizza places, and a high energy, happy vibe all around. Please check more pictures to understand what I mean. My sister got her caricature done from a 'real' Parisian artist and I tried out the Silhouette. Both turned out fantastic. One tip: Even though the artists charge 20 euros for any such sitting, we asked if they would do it for 10, and both of them agreed! I think basically they do it for the love of the art - not so much as a business. There was an artist selling the cylindrical tube in which we carried the rolled art work (3 euros). You get them for 2 in the nearby shops but they are not half as pretty. Or artistic. Our artist/seller even painted my sister's name on the tube. The information center is right around the corner and you will get a small map with the major tourist spots. Do check out the Dali museum, the Windmills of Montmartre, the vineyards, Le Lapin Agile - all in and around the area. Even the walk itself in the cobbled streets is an experience. Must, must visit."

The painters square is a must to visit just looking at the guys working and exhibiting great work is worth the trip. Could one afford one, maybe you're facing the next Monet, Picasso, Van Gogh. There is seriously good art in this little square. Then the cafes and bars, slightly over priced and cramped with people may add some to the bohemian factor. The let down are the pick pocketers and the conmen that almost force you into buying things you did not request or wanted. They stopped you, so eager to get money out of you, that it is invasive and rude behaviour. Be firm when you say NO, once you pass them you may enjoy your time puddling around the square. Hopefully some parisians will read this and understand that if you let people freely move around and approach you they will be more likely to strike a deal."

You'll fall in love and it won't be a moment you'll ever forget. The park beneath the church is gorgeous and great for sitting around taking pictures. After that just wander around and visit all of the great little custom shops that are great for jams, artisanal goods and souvenirs of course. Be careful of the somewhat aggressive group of men in the park that offer you \"free\" bracelets. They can be rather touchy. Other than that, the memory of Montmarte is one I'll hold close to my heart forever!"

Montmartre, famous for the Sacre Coeur, home to artists such as Dali, Van Gogh and Degas, this place of Paris history is also our home for the next three months.Being unaquainted with the Parisian arrondissements, the idea of the Artists area, set a little from the busy centre of Paris was appealing, I couldn\u2019t imagine being anywhere else. What ever you want, its around the corner, and if you can\u2019t find it you probably don\u2019t need it.Our discovery begins first with the famous white monument standing proudly as a bastion of French religious and political history - although a famous and auspicious temple inside, the real monument is the view from the steps looking out at the parisian expanse Beer is for sale on the steps of a church with a serenade by local musicians and a mixture of cultures, colours and creed, this place is truly one for worship. The local streets are lined with traditional parisian fare. Boulangeries produce the best bread we\u2019ve ever eaten and the smell of fresh chickens cooking fills the air. We indulge in traditional parisian pastimes enjoying a coffee and croissant watching the passers by. The fish monger makes no apologies for selling out of todays catch, and the Rue Du Abessess bustles with both locals and tourists alike. Our favourite meal has been from a little known Bistrot Poulbot, nestled in a side street far from the rabble of the busy sights. An entirely french menu tests our wit. For the full details of our meal you can visit our trip advisor review!! But with starters such as traditional ouef cocotte (egg in a jar) and ouef de pain we were excited to see the modern variations o these classics and were not disappointed!And while this indulgence might lend one to think about the waist line, and consider the need for restraint, the hills and steps of Montmartre ensure there\u2019s always an appetite and happy bums all round."

This sounds fun but at the end of the sketch, they roll up your portrait and demand $20-30. You did not ask to be sketched and were not particularly interested in buying this quick scribble.

            "review": "A Village Ambiance. This is one of the most charming areas of Paris, once you get away from Pigalle and the crowds at major tourist sites, such as Sacre Coeur and Place du Terte. Narrow, cobblestone streets bring visitors back to an earlier era. It is easy to imagine former residents, such as Picasso and van Gogh walking here. Some buildings bear plaques, describing famous people who worked or lived there. Little shops geared toward residents and small cafes and restaurants beckon as does Clos Montmartre Vineyard, which seems so out-of-place in a major city. This vineyard still produces a few hundred bottles of wine yearly. I recommend looking through self-guided walking tour guides at a bookstore to plan an itinerary.Sacre Coeur is, of course, a \"must see\" in Montmartre. Approaching this beautiful church from the rear is better than ascending the steps. Fewer people come this way and I've never encountered touts here. But they sometimes gather at the bottom of the steps, try to tie \"friendship\" strings around visitors' wrists and, if successful, demand payment. I just ignore them and they go on to someone else. The view of Paris from the top is simply stunning.Place du Terte, a reminder of famous artists who lived in Montmartre, is near Sacre Coeur and also draws huge crowds. Unlike the church, however, I do not think this square is a worthwhile stop. The artists with their easels are there to attract tourists, and many who sit for a portrait, leave disappointed with the result. Whatever you decide to do in Montmartre, consider taking the Montmartrobus. Its route goes from Pigalle to near Sacre Coeur and back, making ascending and descending those hills a lot easier."

I was with him and shouted repeatedly to stop, stop, stop and no, no no. This was about 9:30 in the morning and the crowds were light. No one came to help and after an eternity and lots of Engligh profanity, he released his grip. The thug kept shouting, \"I will get you when you come back this way.\" My nephew had no visible values, though I had a nice camera and a backpack for a coat. The thug had at least 3 friends who were checking out tourists working with him.Another tourist approached us and said they had done that to him too.We found 3 police officers in khaki with assault rifles 2 levels up by the front door of the cathedral and reported the incident. They didn't seem comfortable with English but did move down to the same level as the thugs. He and his 3 friends continued to approach other tourists but not to be have as aggressively. Not a fun incident to experience. Still wondering why he was targeted. Maybe to tie him up so another could rob me?"

They take you past the Moulin rouge and the crowded Parisian streets and walk you past where Vincent Van Gogh lived and where Picasso paid for his meal with a painting. You then walk up the hill to Sacre Coeur and you have the most fabulous view of Paris. I think what makes a place live is the stories, here Picasso stood, this is the famous blue door of Van Gogh, this is the place where the impressionist had their dinner. I love the history and the beauty. Lots of crowds, stuff to buy and lots of places to eat. It is probably worth reserving a table for when your tour finishes because the best places to eat were totally full when we were there. Go to Montmartre and take a walking tour so you really appreciate the history that makes this area what it is. Good teen friendly activity"

The home of artists and bohemians in the 19th and early 20th century, The vestiges of seedy nightclubs and cabarets are still present in along the walk from Blanch to Pigalle Metro stops. However, the area is also home to Sacre-Cour and if you wander the streets you can find signs of the bygone era when this hill was a rural agrarian setting: two of the over 40 windmills that used to operate on the hill are still standing.The Pigalle and the area immediately around Sacre-Couer were quite busy with tourists, but once you got a couple of blocks away things were much quieter. I particularly liked the area around the Vineyard and Au Lapin Agile (The Agile Rabbit)."

Missing our scheduled volunteer guide around the area, we had to find our own way around Montmarte using the maps provided by the tourist office. We visited the Basilique de Sacre Coeur at twilight and during the day; both times were busy with tourists and people selling tacky Eiffel Tower souvenirs but we didn't allow this to spoil our visit. The view from the steps of the cathedral over the city of Paris is absolutely breathtaking and not to be missed. I recommend a visit to the Musee de Montmartre which is housed in the oldest building in the commune where Auguste Renoir and other famous artists found their home. The Museum has a number of unique paintings, drawings and posters. During our walk, we found the two remaining windmills of the area (Galette and Radet) on our way to The Musee Montmartre which is situated not far from the Place du Tertre and the infamous Lapin Agile cabaret (opposite the Vineyard of Montmartre). We didn't have time to visit the Dahli Museum but saw some evidence of his work in the locality like a man appearing to walk through a wall. At nightfall, we took the Metro to Blanches in order to photograph an illuminated Moulin Rouge then sat for a while in the boulevard absorbing the sights and sounds of this historically seedy environment while all the time feeling quite safe. There are lots of good, value for money restaurants to choose from, but wouldn't recommend those situated immediately around or in the centre of the Place du Tertre; we were ripped off big time there, we each asked for a beer and were presented with large glasses that cost 17 euro's each, a sum we didn't know until the bill arrived and the beer already consumed!! So, make sure you are precise when you order and ask questions about cost if it is not obvious."

The walk to the funicular is dirty and full of cheap shops, the views from the top are not all that great and there is garbage everywhere. It seems to be a hang-out for young people. I hate to say it, but the highlight was a busker who did amazing things with a basketball. We were mesmerized by this performer and that was the extent of our enjoyment of the visit there (but for that alone, it was worth it). By the way, I hope it's okay to extend this opinion. You don't have to put money in a busker's hat if it doesn't interest you, but if you stop to watch and enjoy a performer, I think you ought to throw something into the pot! A lot of buskers make traveling interesting and fun and this is their living. So don't partake if you don't have any interest, but if you do, pay your way!"

In the square next to the church artists paint portraits or caricatures of tourists, the standard of some being very good. The area is thronged with tourists and it can be very difficult to get served in a restaurant, even when its not overly busy.Downhill where there are less tourists is better. You can find the Moulin de la Galette which is associated with the famous Renoir painting. Further downhill are quite a lot of good restaurants and bars around the rue des Abbesses and if you keep going to near Blanche Metro station you can find the famous Moulin Rouge.

Like many who travel, sometimes my expectations of what a destination will be like are never met. But Montmartre was exactly what I hoped Paris would be -- full of narrow, cobblestone streets, small neighborhood bars, shops and plenty of eccentrics. Downstairs from our apartment was a tiny shop that repaired lutes. And across the street was a preschool housed in an old abattoir. Even the children had their scarves wrapped as carefully as their handsome daddies. And the first night we walked home from the metro, a woman in a red dress leaned out her window smoking a cigarette. This is what we came to Paris for and we were well-rewarded by staying in Montmartre."

We rode here (on Velibs, our favourite Paris transport) at dawn - to miss the crowds and to see Paris awakening from the top of Montmartre. Rewarded on both counts as the hordes descended just as we were leaving. A beautiful church, amazing views in all directions, and a great experience wandering down the cobbled laneways of Montmartre afterwards. One massive surprise was having our best coffee so far in Paris at a little corner place called (not so imaginatively) Cafe Montmartre. In such a touristy area, this was very unexpected but the young fellow setting up chairs very happily stopped what he was doing to make us coffees and my 'noisette' and my partners cafe creme were both sensational. The older owner then came in and chatted away about local attractions and showed just how wonderful the French can be with tourists with only basic French to converse."

We went to visit Sacre Coure, which was beautiful, but I'd never go back. Upon leaving the metro, we stopped at a bank machine where there where sketchy looking people everywhere. We had several people come up to us and ask for money. We walked up the back way of the Sacred Heart, there were even more sketchy people who looked like they might rob us in daylight at any moment. I was genuinely afraid. Then when we got to the church we had a nice visit. It's beautiful and the grounds and views are spectacular. Yet when we left, we were accosted by the men outside trying to sell you the sting bracelets. One came at me and grabbed me and one followed my fianc\u00e9 and kept yelling at us. They even started to circle us when we jut took off very quickly. They will not leave you alone. I never once saw a police officer and don't know how they allow them to stand there and accost people. There were several local cops in the nicer areas of town, but not here where they are needed. Next, when we got on the metro to leave, we saw a man and his wife get attacked! A man was following them and wouldn't leave them alone, then pushed them down the stairs and went after them! Even with throngs of people around! Bottom line, unless you're in a large group with several big men, DO NOT go anywhere in this area. It's definitely the ghetto."

Ideal for breakfast snacks. The artists area is actually very tiny, and off season in February was not busy at all. The artists square where they have set up their work for sale is an interesting place. It is very nice to sit at one of the many cafes on the square and people watch. Of course there is the Sacre Ceour to look at, but there is much more to Montmartre than just one church.

Le Metro was fun as always watching folk sneak through the barriiers without paying and then meeting the Police.   We walked from Abesses Metro station to base of Sacre Coeur without problems - an interesting walk with lots of little shops to look in as well as the ubiquitous tourist junk shops.  We believed that the walk up to Basilique du Sacre Coeur would be heavy going but it did not look too bad so we took the walk rather than the little funiculaire which had a massive crowd gathered outside \"queueing\" (although this would be good for wheelchair users).  As we walked up the hillside, we were approached by about 5 men trying to give us bits of string, blocking our path, and then trying to take the rings off my partner's fingers - we rapidly departed up the hill.  There were many harmless folk selling bottles of water & beer who were not a particular problem, & several performing artists along the way who were also not a problem - we enjoyed watching them for a short time.  Sacre Coeur was interesting Despite the signs, some folk insisted on talking loudly and on taking photos, even with flash; but one was hurried along so we did not get to really study the building.  On the way down (other side) we were again approached by more men intent on giving us bits of string, whom we avoided more effectively.  At the bottom of the hill, we spent an interesting 20 minutes talking to the guys from the Compagnies R\u00e9publicaines de S\u00e9curit\u00e9 Police; they felt that they could do little about these men. We would not visit again; it is too risky to be able to enjoy it;  If you do go, take care, do not wear jewellery, do not carry expensive cameras and do not carry lots of money or credit cards.  But the chat with the CRS Police at the foot of Montmartre was very interesting for someone trying to improve his French language skills  If you do wish to visit, one can buy CS gas at amazon.fr http://www.amazon.fr/CS-Save-Gaz-5005-15-Dame/dp/B003LXLTWQ/ref=sr_1_9?ie=UTF8&qid=1425935840&sr=8-9&keywords=CS+gas"

Although the best way to see everything and enjoy the architecture, is to walk up the 'hill,' be forewarned - it's steep, tall, and a bit of a work-out. If you're not into that kind of exertion, take a cab to the steps at the foot of the Sacre Coeur, and walk up to the cathedral from there. This white church is glorious - and absolutely ethereal and magical in the early morning light. From there you are only a short walk to the markets, restaurants, shops, and outside artists of Montmartre. This is (yet another!) spot in Paris to be sure to eat in an outdoor cafe and watch the citizens and tourists stroll past - the perfect place to people-and-fashion watch. Many will have other favorite spots, but I believe the best cr\u00eapes in Paris are to be found in Montmartre. This is also the spot to have your portrait drawn or painted al fresco. If a full portrait is a bit too pricey for your budget, have your silhouette cut. Each of the artists we've selected to do this seem to have an unerring eye for capturing the subject, and the pleasant experience becomes a treasured souvenir of your trip. Be sure to take the time to visit the various art galleries and antique shops that abound.

We strolled and looked for just the right articles to take home. There are all manner of artists here. They are doing realistic portraits or caricatures or sketches. There are others doing scenery of the area or landscapes. Some are realistic, some are \"artistic interpretations\". We found all the artists friendly and welcoming. After the art purchases we just walked around the neighborhood full of all manner of shops. I found a great little second hand shop on the way to a wonderful lunch.

There are quite a lot of tourists in the area, but that is true for the whole Paris. There are many street artists drawing outdoors and touristic traps in a format of little shops and restaurants, so be ware if you decide to buy or eat in that area. If walking just outside the main area around the Sacre Coer,you might already found a bit more of authenticity. It's still possible to find some quite and interesting streets to just wonder around or a little simple bistro or patisserie."

The big disadvantage to Montmartre is all the climbing, just to get to the best bits like Sacre Coeur and La Place du Tertre. If you can find your way to the base of Monmartre, near Pigalle, then you can take the Funiculaire (the ski-lift type tram that takes you to the lower bit of Sacre Coeur). But if you are staying near the Seine, around the Rue de Rivoli, Hotel de Ville or the Louvre, for example, then instead get on the 67 bus and take it to its terminus at Pigalle. Then switch over to the Montmartrebus, a smaller bus which takes you up all the narrow winding roads to the Place itself, or any other place of your interest along the route. See pretty well all of Montmartre without all the climbing. Save your legs for walking around the interior of Sacre Coeur and all the shops/restaurants encircling the Place de Tertre."

When we arrived at our hotel in Paris I was excited because we were staying on the Champs Elysses thinking that we would be \"in the hub\" of all things Parisian. We had a beautiful view of the Eiffel Tower from our \"french balcony\" so we were able to see it light up at night, which was fantastic. But, as we walked and toured the avenue, we were disappointed because it felt so much like 5th Avenue shopping in New York City, and we didn't come all this way to experience NYC. (Don't get me wrong, I love NYC and the round the clock action, but I was looking for what I thought was \"Paris\".) We took a tour with a driver in a car made for 2 in the back seat where there is a window in the roof of the car. It was from that driver that we were reminded of what my aunt had told us before we left...don't miss Montmartre!AND, you have to visit Montmartre if you want to experience such a unique, quaint \"village\" that wraps you up in all things Parisian. From walking the cobblestone path up to the square of Montmartre, your visit begins as you are offered to have a sketch drawn by a local artist (though they range from highly skilled to apprentice-level in skill). Don't miss the opportunity. It's MUCH different than Americanized caracitures (sp) offered at theme parks. The one thing I missed doing was taking a picture of \"my artist\" with me holding his portrait of me. I haven't hung it, because it seems self-serving, but the drawing brings a flood of memories of Montmartre back, even thinking about it. We continued our walk with portraits in tow, and reached the square of Montmartre where you see artisans using about as many sources of medium to offer for sale. Though, they don't stop creating to \"pull you in\", they don't have to, their work speaks for itself. There are all types of cuisine that you can chose from small shops. We chose to have \"french\" onion soup, and nothing will ever be as comparable to the taste of the soup we devoured sitting at (I believe, St. Margaret's) an outside table enjoying the beauty of what this district has to offer. There is so much more to the experience, I can't possibly convey in words the culture, beauty, and adventure this visit added to our Paris experience. In fact, I sometimes forget to say I went to Paris, I usually say we went to Montmartre and would highly recommend it to everyone, unless you are in the city to buy high-end fashion comparable in buildings/concrete of New York City. DON'T miss it!"

I was charmed because it was my first experience of Paris and everthing I saw fitted my stereotypes of what Paris is supposed to be: cafes, streetside artists, piano bars...among others. Yes, yes...there is even a Starbucks there, plumb in the middle.What I wasn't prepared for was however this place is so incredibly touristy - we're pouring out of the woodwork! Then the shops, the unending shops selling the same damn things. The cafes selling overpriced stuff. Mediocre artists parading as portrait painters, paperless refugees sellingg you laser pointers or keyrings of the Eiffel Tower...But all said and done, the place is as central as central in Paris can be. The nearest is a scramble down a steep stairway or via the Funiculair (which is always fun with kids) and then...you're linked with the rest of Paris via their incredibly efficient Metro system. Staying at Montmartre makes sense if you're going to throw yourself around all directions of Paris. The views of the city are nothing exciting unless you're on top of the stairs at the Sacre Coeur and then that cancels all my other generalisations about the views from out here. I'd urge you to walk around the neighbourhood - that's a great way to check the lay of the land and learn more about the place. Pickpocketing being a fine career option for many of the city's more recent immigrants, be advised to hang onto your stuff dearly. Not just in Montmartre, but in all of Paris."

More fun in winter than in the summer crowds that is for sure. Stroll out the other end of Montmartre and wend your way past the cemetery and down to the Moulin Rouge. Very easy spot to while away a few hours,"

The ill-kept, dodgy streets and the sketchy people hanging around it have turned this once picturesque jem into the old runned down ruin it now unfortunately is. I remember this place in it's prime, when montmarte was a must-see destination for all travelers visiting Paris. In my eyes, it emulated the image I had in my head of a typical, authentic Parisian town we all have heard off or read in the movies and novels. You could loose yourself for hours, soaking up the atmosphere of the cobble stoned streets and narrow lanes accompanied by quaint boutiques and shops of all sorts. The place seemed to almost have an enchanting character of it's own. Little pastry shops and interesting caf\u00e9s lined the streets leading up to the main attraction. The view at the top of the hill was and still is breathtaking, thankfully one redeeming quality that has remained unspoiled.Though some of such caf\u00e9s and shops still stand, the essence of it all has been ruined. The artists quarter is now a relatively baren, deserted, and uninspiring location, far from the thriving centre it once was. To sum up, Montmartre is not like how I'd remembered it to be. It has failed to retain so many of its distinct characteristics I\u2019d fallen in love with in the past. If pick pocketing, dodgy characters, graffiti, run down metro stations, and a general thought of 'I hope this man doesn't steal my purse' is not enough to put any traveller off, I don't know what would. Stay as far away as you can. Au revoir Montmartre, I am never coming back."

We were told about the cathedral by friends since we were in the area we unknowingly walked there and got to a flight of stairs. I had a bad feeling about it before we approached as there was atleast 10 african men scattered arouns the area. This was at night and not many people were around. Against my instinct we approached the stairs to be hastled about showing a trick with string. I insisted no atleast 5 times and he went ahead and grabbed my hand and started tieing a bracelet. I felt uneasy but didnt know what to do. I was watching over to my partner to make sure she was ok and not being hasstled. They had got her to I questioned what he was doing and he just kept saying hakuna matata and making small talk at the end I knew he was going to want money im not stupid but giving the situation and how many of them with scarce amounts of people and way to many of them I knew I wasn't getting away easy. At the end when he asked for something 'some paper'. Another one came over and started hastling me saying 'give me 50 I give you change' I resisted and tried to get of easy for what felt like several minutes until I knew I wasnt going to get me and my partner away safely until I gave in. They ended up getting 40euro off me for both of us us. Which at the end of the day I was just glad we both got away safely and nothing else stolen. But I was furious afterward at the situation we'd walked into so close to 'must see' attraction. We see them everywhere with varies scams and im always alert and avoid them but this was secluded and no escape and no security or police in site despite this being such a common place for crime. An absolute disgrace that nothing is done about this. It definetely ruined my night and has painted a very ugly picture of that area for me and im hoping not paris as a whole.

It is located about two or three miles north of Central Paris and the Seine River. The area gets its name from the 130 meter hill in the center of the neighborhood. I thought this area is very interesting and think it is a must see district in Paris. Historically many famous artists (including Degas, Toulouse-Lautrec, Renoir, and Pablo Picasso) lived in this neighborhood as it used to be outside the Paris city limits and the rents were low (it is now a trendy and expensive area to live).I stayed here with my wife for a week in late October and really enjoyed this lively and interesting neighborhood. Since Montmartre is a hill, expect to do a lot of walking and climbing up and down the hill if you stay or visit this area. A funicular railway carries tourists and locals from the bottom of the hill up most of the way to Sacr\u00e9-Coeur (if you do not want to walk up the stairs). You need a metro ticket to get on it. While buying our metro ticket to go down the hill we were \u201chelped\u201d by a couple of scammers that tried to sell us tickets (that would most likely not be valid). We watched these people for a while as they tried to \u201chelp\u201d almost every tourist that walked up to the metro ticket machine. There is also a small tourist train (Le Petit Train) that runs around the neighborhood that you can buy a ticket and get driven around to the major sights (you get headphones and can hear about the neighborhood in English).There are many different \u201cparts\u201d of this neighborhood but Montmartre's most recognizable landmark is the Basilica du Sacr\u00e9-Coeur (you can even see it from many other parts of Paris). This area used to have many windmills but most are gone and the few remaining ones do not work (they are for show only). I enjoyed looking at these old windmills. There is also very touristy part of Montemartre but that is just a small part of this neighborhood. I recommend that you go on your own walking tour (download a tour map) or go on a guided walking tour. This is a great way to see most areas of the interesting areas of Montmartre (not just the t-shirt area below Sacr\u00e9-Coeur). While I enjoyed this area my one complaint were the bracelet scammers near Sacr\u00e9-Coeur that tied a string around your wrist and then asked for money and got aggressive if you do not pay them. I really enjoyed staying in this neighborhood and think it is a must see district when you are visiting Paris."

Tucked away in one corner of the city of Paris is the neighborhood of Montmartre \u2013 a hill in the north of Paris, long known for being the creative hub of artists, and in more recent memory, made popular by movies such as Am\u00e9lie and Moulin Rouge. Despite the urbanization, Montmartre managed to retain some of its distinct characteristics such as the old buildings, steep and narrow cobbled streets, and the rustic windmills.The best way to explore the village is on foot. You could either book a walking tour, or grab a map and start at the base of the village and make your way up the famous Basilica du Sacr\u00e9-Coeur. Anvers is the nearest metro station that gives you access right to the base of the village. You will immediately notice the difference in the character of Montmartre and central Paris. The walk uphill is steep, but reaching the base of the Basilica on foot is quite manageable if you are young and fit. Alternatively, you can even take a mini train ride that goes around the neighborhood and up the Basilica. When you reach the base of the Basilica, the sheer beauty of the white-domed church will take your breath away. Sitting at the highest point in Paris, it offers breathtaking views of the city and in my opinion, is one of the most beautiful churches I have seen. The steep stairs greet you to take you up the church. You can also opt for a funicular ride up.From here, we took the mini train that takes you around the neighborhood and an audio guide introduces you to the hill-topped district. At just 6 euros per adult and 4 euros for child, the ticket is reasonably priced and the ride itself is very picturesque.Many cabarets, most notably the Moulin Rouge, and erotic shows continue to attract visitors to the area. The Place du Tertre, where a once penniless Picasso lived, is also a reminder of the time when Montmartre was a mecca of artists, as even today every morning artists set up their shops ready to paint the tourists who flock the area in large numbers."

And that is exactly what the painters, touts, \"antique\" shops and restaurants of Montmartre want you to think!! In fact, the truly \"French\" part of Montmartre is only seen as you walk slowly down the narrow streets towards Place de Clichy (of Moulin Rouge fame). There it is like a village in the middle of a city (but not at all commercial).The touristic market place is solid with painters, who have probably painted exactly the same thing 1,000 times, and touts who will cut out silhouettes of your head for a princely sum (they start cutting without asking, so learn to say \"Non\" before going there!). The restaurants, where you will be treated with Gallic shrugs and Parisian pouts to make you feel you are \"really in France\" are good at overcharging for very average fare, so stick to light snacks unless you have a large bank balance you want to get rid of. Oh - and keep a tight hold on your valuables since the area is well known for pickpockets.Apart from that, it's brilliant!!"

The only annoying part are the pick pockets, some of which very brazenly make physical contact with you pretending to give you something. Just make sure you keep your money in a zipped pocket or your hands in your pockets.Once at the top there is the Sacred Heart Basilica of Montmartre Sacre-Coeur (reviewed separately). Up there is a beautiful view of the city.Behind the cathedral is I suppose what could be called a really touristy area, full of restaurants and shops. However, in the middle of that is the real gem of the area: the artist\u2019s area.These are not the cheap prints that you find along the River Seine but serious works of art, often hand painted right in front of you. We purchased two incredible works directly from the artist who was painting another as we purchased it. The art is not cheap, but the quality it worth it.It is unfortunate that the area is touristy and the pickpockets try to take advantage, but outside of that, the area is a must visit for the view and the artists."

It's probably a bit clich\u00e9 now but I still enjoy going there and wandering around the neighborhood, eating a nice warm crepe, looking at artists painting the old Paris or drawing people's portraits.Be careful though, for some people, drawing your portrait is a real business and they will harass tourists until they either leave or give in. Their prices are very high. For the same amount of money, or less, i'd rather go and see a true artist, on the square."

Lots of fun cobblestone streets to wander and get lost in - it is what one thinks Paris should be like. Many famous artists (painters, singers) once lived in Montmatre and if you know where to look or let yourself get lost and take your time you will find many hidden gems. Lots of authentic markets for fresh meats, flowers, cheeses, one woman was on the corner with a baby goat handling out samples - it's charming! Take a tour with a local that knows the history and can share sites and history no tour bus will give you nor would you know on your own...just not in tour guide books. Con's - as you arrive on the metro you will probably come out around Moulin Rouge, do not let this avenue of bars, clubs, sex shops deter you. This is the only negative for some. Head up the hill and you will experience something like no other part in Paris. Make it to the top and walk through Sacre Couer, Amazing."

Do the touristy thing & get a caricature or silhouette or something (I got a silhouette which was pretty good & not too expensive) - it's a fun experience & a nice souvenir, but also wander through the back streets & little lanes & experience the community as well. Stop in a little cafe for coffee, have lunch somewhere, check out the old vineyard, experience the street music, & appreciate the artists . One of my favourite things to do anywhere is to just go wandering in cities and neighbourhoods to get a feel of the place, and in this regard, I think Montmatre is one of the best places for a 'walking tour' anywhere. Don't even bother with a map, just get lost for a few hours & enjoy. It has such a wonderful 'vibe'. Be aware that it is pretty hilly with some steep steps in places, so probably not recommended for those with mobility issues. Fantastic day out!"

We left early and walked from our hotel on the Rue de Rivoli, despite people telling us it was too far to walk. It was a very pleasant walk and we began by going to the Sacre-Coeur. The place is very hilly with lots of steps so you don't want to make too many wrong turns, so my smart phone GPS came in very handy, as it wasn't the easiest of places to navigate. Then we went for a walk around Montmartre and watched street performers perform French music and dancing which was very enjoyable and added lots of ambiance to the place. We went for a wonder around the artists and purchased a little painting each from one of the artists. Beware there are some scammers, so we watched carefully and saw this artist put paint to canvas, and we love them as a little souvenier of this wonderful day. After this we went and had lunch at the Moulin de la Galette which was lovely, full of character and very nice food. Then we walked back to our hotel via the Moulin Rouge to see it in the day light. An extremely enjoyable day with lots of character and charm."

Hundreds of years back it was a separate village with its own vineyard even , a little of which survives today.

Hearing that music and seeing those young women play, colored everything I experienced up in Montmartre. We enjoyed touring a small museum featuring Utrillo and giving a history of Montmartre. We had a wonderful lunch outside. The food was really good but even better, we were served by an older woman and man who were VERY kind. I bought a bright little oil painting. The artist packed it carefully for travel. Whenever I look at it, I will remember that beautiful day up in Montmartre."

We visited for just one day, to see Sacre Coeur , and the only downside is the steps to the metro (there is a lift as well!). When we arrived, I was desperate for the loo, and although we later discovered there were plenty, on arrival we couldn't find one, so I popped into a local cafe and asked if I could use theirs. They were so accommodating and friendly, and I was extremely grateful! We used the funicular to access Sacre Coeur, which was absolutely gorgeous, so peaceful and beautiful, with spectacular views across Paris. Chris and I both felt completely relaxed on the grass, watching all the visitors enjoying the atmosphere which is so different to downtown Paris."

The shops cater for the throngs of tourist that invade the area, the \"artists\" want to draw your likeness and take your money. Too many people, too many shops selling ubiquitous eiffel tower souvenirs. Try to leave the top of the hill, wander down the streets to the bottom, the cafes there are a little more authentic, certainly less crowded and touristy. But, the view from the Monmartre is wonderful, the Sacre Cour is beautiful, but beware the scammers. Despite all this make the effort to go there, walk down the stairs in front of Sacre Cour and see the merry go round. Take great photos of the windmills, the grape vines, and of course the beautiful stairs. Remember, you are in Paris, love the city, in all its imperfect beauty."

We went during the wine festival in October 2014. The place was bustling. We had a fantastically sunny day. There are artists all over sketching and showcasing their art. The cathedral is beautiful and you have the most stunning view of the entire city of Paris from the top. There are numerous cafes serving great food and fresh salads. The perfect way to enjoy is to sit outside in a Cafe, soaking the sun, a bottle of wine, good food made with local produce, as you take in the surroundings and art. This is an adorable village area of Paris which is absolutely breathtaking.You simply cannot miss this!"

The walk took us to see Place Constantin Pecquer, Place Dalida, Maison Rose, Le Clos Montmartre, Au Lapin Agile, Sacre Couer, Eglise Saint Pierre de Montmartre, Place de Tetre, Dali Museum, Passe Muraille, Moulin de la Galette, the I Love You wall and Abysses Station where we caught the Metro back to Paris central.

You could catch the metro (best stop is Abbesses), or take an easy paced walk from the city (40-60 minutes) through a couple small Parisian city vineyards and passed beautiful French terrace houses. Definitely worth a visit, with plenty eateries around the area. Any of them are great. The clothing boutiques are fab too. Including a GREAT little vintage shop - although crammed it's tidy and has some of the best hats and coats at super prices (EUR 5-40)."

Favoured by the 19th C Impressionists, it is still home to artists, singers and poets and is often used as a location for films. This is as authentic as Paris gets, especially in the hidden back streets away from tourists. Behind the Sacre Coeur there is a small vineyard and the quaint bar 'Au Lapin Agile'. Nearby is St Vincent cemetery and a square named after French singer Dalida. Her mansion is close by. The restaurant Moulin de la Galette is worth seeking out. It was painted by Van Gogh, Picasso and Renoir. Fans of the film 'Am\u00e9lie' can find the grocers shop at 56 Rue 3 Fr\u00e8res. The caf\u00e9 where Amelie works is Caf\u00e9 des 2 Moulins on Rue Lepic, close to the Moulin Rouge."

The crest is quite steep, but you can take the funiculary if you are not really fond of climbing stairs. I advise you to take your time examining Sacre Coeur, which is one of the most wonderful buildings in Paris. After that, have your portrait drawn by a street artist: it's definitely worth your money."

While this tour recommends against lunch in the Place du Tertre, we prefer it. Otherwise, an outstanding way of doing this section of Paris. I have done several tours here and this was terrific! We were very safe and comfortable along the way and while there were some steps, most of the tour was gentle in that regard."

There is a small square where artists show off their works and even pretend to paint a bit. I last visited almost 30 years ago and this small square was packed with artists genuinely painting and less interested in tourists and vistors than on their works. Now its a totally commercial operation with bars extending their space into the square and limiting artists to only the fringes.I bought a couple of original pieces (the copies are done by art students) in one of the galleries (not on the square) and had a drink in one of the brasseries facing the square. The drink was of course priced according to the surroundings (ie. 50% higher than further down the slope).I could probably live with all this and accept it as part of the evolution of Montmarte. What I did not enjoy however were the quacks masquerading as portrait painters and hassling everyone on the street to have their portrait drawn. I especially did not like it when they kept on bothering me when I was enjoying my drink and watching people walk by...yet telling one of them to get lost doesn't automatically communicate itself to the rest of his tribe who keep on coming by hoping some poor desperate tourist will part with some of his hard earned cash to have his portrait drawn by a third rate (at best) artist. Montmartre is a must see for all visitors to Paris but accept the annoying touts as part of the experience."

Montmartre is an idyllic place, numerous restaurants and craft shops, the ideal place to be able to grant a self-portrait or a caricature made by one of the many artists who flock to the main square behind the basilica. It exudes an air more relaxing than the frenetic city. In a nutshell Montmartre is one of the top attractions in Paris."

We chose to get the metro to Ch\u00e2teau Rouge (not the station recommended for Montmartre) as it did not require us to change from Gare de Lyon where we were staying. After a 20 minute walk we found our self at the top of the hill without realising we had climbed it! The station was relatively quiet compared to the others around the area and may be worth using it as an alternative.The area is also famous for the Moulin Rouge show; whilst we didn't attend the show we did wander down to see it. Not a must see if you are not seeing the show, mildly disappointing. But all in all this area was my favourite part of Paris and felt distinctly Parisian (or what I imagine it to be)."

The Sacre Couer remains breathtaking but with so many people everywhere it makes it a little difficult to enjoy in peace and calm.

It is an amazing perspective and adds a special touch to your visit."

The ticket for the cable car is the same as the one for the Metro. The view from the hill is amazing! There are also street performers, many artists that sell their creations, painters that make portraits and caricatures and great local restaurants that have been there forever.

There is artful and antique neighborhood full of restaurants and shops leading you up to Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur Basilica. This beautiful cathedral sits on the top of Montmartre. The view of Paris is breathe taking from the steps of this cathedral. Before you walk back down, take a break on the steps and watch free entertaining street shows. I personally recommend the day view over night view. Best time to come is before the sunset and so you can leave with the sun."

I love, love, love Montmartre and in case you are wondering why that doesn't warrant 5 stars, it is probably only because so many other people love it, that it is always crowded with tourists. That in return draws a lot of crooks so be prepared and beware of pick pockets as well as those people that are trying to get a signature from you and then ask you very aggressively for money. Having said all of this, the view over the city of Paris is magnificent and Sacr\u00e9 C\u0153r is a beautiful church that makes the perfect backdrop for pictures. There are also gardens around Sacr\u00e9 Coer with a waterfall fountain that does not seem to be very well known, but it is peaceful and beautiful there so check it out. Fun is also the furnicula, even if the ride is very short. Otherwise be prepared for lots of stairs and elevations in this quarter."

It was raining the day we went, so the view wasn't as spectacular as it might have been, but still worth it.

Don't let anyone scare you away because of the pickpockets and scam artists. Hold your valuables close and be smart and you will be just fine. I was up for the annual wine festival last October. The parade is a must-see - hard to describe - you just have to see it. However, going up to the square during the wine festival is a daunting thing. My daughter and I managed to wade through the solid pack of bodies to get one wee taste of champagne but after that it was simply impossible to get a single drop of wine. There were so many people that you could barely raise your arms to lift your glass to your mouth. Soooo - come to Montmarte anytime but during the wine festival and be sure and wander the hilly, curvy streets away from the main square. Daytime is lovely and if you are up there at night it will feel just a bit seedy but still quite a delight - the night-time view of Sacre Couer is not to be missed.

I stayed in a hotel very close and visited around 8 pm . it was full of tourists and not a great experience ( France in summer ) and after having a pleasant walk to moulin rogue ( plus a few drinks ) I walked back around 11 pm to my hotel and it had taken a dark corner and quite a few homeless drunks that urinate on the stairs. Stay away late at night.However , at 8.30 - 9.30 am I had a run around the area and it was a true awaking. Very FEW tourist , mainly Asians . I would recommend to do this as you will have the place to yourself. Then make your way to more touristy sites that open up at 10 am. Note - you will miss the restaurants and artist doing sketches. Personally I found this something I could miss and restaurants were outrageousness priced. I paid 7.5 euro for a bt beer. Some restaurants are open though for a coffee etc.Tip - walk down the hill ( 500 meters ) towards moulin rouge and have dinner at one of the many outside / inside restaurants that were reasonably priced and better if going for lunch or dinner.  Watch out for the black African groups of men. Just turn around and go one of the many other entrances. They hang in groups of 5 plus. Otherwise walk straight through them and do not make eye contact. They tend to operate at the bottom of the main stairs.Lastly , they have a escalator , but it's a very pleasant climb up the stairs and a good way to work of the French cuisine!"

We visited this place on a sunny September afternoon, it was not really crowded and we loved our time there. Take your time to walk up (don't take the cable car unless u must!) and amble around all the alleys, savor the atmosphere and there are some really good eateries around. A lot of artists, painting, sketching and playing instruments its a pretty beautiful sight. We weren't really heckled by any souvenir seller but maybe we were just lucky..The famous Sacre Coeur is atop the hill and its magnificent and if its a clear day you'll have a lovely view of Paris! Give yourself at least 3 hours to enjoy and soak in Montmartre..."

As has already been said on these reviews, the souvenir sellers (of which there are lots!) seem to be much more pushy here and slightly more aggressive which spoilt the experience.

I started by walking up to Sacre Couer and then you can veer to the left at the top of the stairs up to the basilica and start meandering down through Montmartre. This can take you past the Dali museum, which is worth the fee if you like surrealism or Dali, and then through all the many streets with shops and restaurants. I had dinner at La Sancerre, but there are many wonderful little cafes to choose from (as in all of Paris!) At the bottom of the hill you'll encounter the red light district and the Moulin Rouge, which is worth a photo or two as well."

You can take a lift or a mini train up if you do not want to tackle the stairs. It was busy, but not crowded. There was a group of thugs working the crowd of people leaving with the friendship bracelet scam. I was an easy target because I foolishly wore high heels that day and could not easily walk away from them quickly. They quickly had me surrounded before they realized the 6'5\" giant among them was my husband that arrived a minute later. They ran when he appeared. I loved the three thrift stores we found on the short three block walk from the subway to Montmartre. Yes, they are crowded, poorly designed, and dirty.....but worth the hassle. I got silk scarves for 1 Euro and a pair of leather boots for 5 Euro."

Visiting Paris you will most certainly decide to visit the sugary white Basilica Sacr\u00e9-Coeur too, and now being there high up I recommend you not to miss the lovely Montmartre Museum with its charming Renoir Gardens only a few minutes\u2019 walk away from the basilica.Mus\u00e9e De Montmartre and Jardins Renoir highlight important aspects of Parisienne history as does Montmartre itself. We visited the Basilica Sacr\u00e9-Coeur on July 12, 2014. It is truly monumental, majestically situated as it is on top of Hill Montmarte (Butte Montmartre) with a most lovely view over central Paris downhill to the Eiffel Tower, Pantheon and Notre Dame. It was built as a symbol of atonement after the French Second Empire's defeat at Sedan on September 2, 1870 by Prussia in the French \u2013 Prussian War 1870 \u2013 1871 and the ensuing Paris revolution famously known as the Commune, which was bloodily quelled by the Third Republic, the political heir to Napoleon III's Second Empire. Construction started in 1875 and was finished in spring 1914, but the basilica was not consecrated until 1919 due to a new war between among others France and Germany, the Great War (August 1914 \u2013 November 1918). Butte Montmartre is a hub in French political history, both in the defence of Paris against the Prussians by the new Third Republic - it was from here that its defence minister Leon Gambetta fled the city in a world famous and spectacular way on October 7, 1870 by a hot air balloon - and when the new republic failed to do so the Paris Commune took over with such noted defenders as the famous \u201dRed Virgin\u201d, Louise Michel . This is also documented in the Mus\u00e9e De Montmartre. But today Montmartre is probably much more famous as a hub in French and European art and entertainment history, also documented in the museum. It all started when Paris artists moved from Left Bank's Latin Quarter, from Montparnasse to Montmartre because of the enormous reconstruction of Paris during the reign of Napoleon III (1848 \u2013 1870) with the construction of the new broad boullevards and very expensive new houses. In the words of Alistair Horne (Seven Ages of Paris. Portrait Of A City, 2002), which I allow me the privilege to borrow, the narrow irregular streets and low houses of what until recently had been a detached village, with windmills, vineyards and gardens in almost every way suited the artists better. An earlier generation led by Berlioz and Heine was followed by Pissarro, C\u00e9zanne, Monet, Renoir and Toulouse-Lautrec and later by Van Gogh, Picasso, Braque, Matisse and Duffy with the centenary year 1900 as a watershed. Together with the artists the famous cabarets, such as the Moulin Rouge, the Moulin de la Galette (eternalized by Renoir\u2019s and Van Gogh\u2019s atmospheric paintings) and the Lapin Agile were vital energy spots of the Belle Epogue and beyond.You may get a glimpse of the environment of that time, if you go out into the gardens on the back side of the museum. It\u2019s almost a time machine out there! It is so calm here. On your left side you see a wine yard, a left over from the Belles Epogue, still producing about 1.000 bottles of wine today, looking down the hill wrapped in grapes you will see the gable of a little house with \u201dLapin Agile\u201d painted on it. This is the famous cabaret - and it is still going strong!Entering into the second garden you may enjoy a real pearl, and I would not hesitate to say: the real Jardin Renoir. It is a place built for relaxation and contemplation. Its calmness and design reminded me of Renoir\u2019s garden and house in Cagnes-sur-Mer at the C\u00f4te d'Azur between Nice and Cannes.Henning Ballerup"

One normal metro ticket (\u20ac1.7) takes you one way up on the funicular. If you purchase 10 metro tickets at one time, there is a discount. The beautiful Sacre Coeur basilica will be the first thing that welcomes you at the top of the hill. If you look back, the view of Paris is behind you! Very nice! The view of the Eiffel tower is also possible but you have to walk 5 mins away from the Sacre Coeur. The first time I was here, it was raining. So we took the tram (ard \u20ac10 if not wrong) which tours around Montmartre. Not bad.Montmarte used to be a quaint village where artists liked to live in. Now it's a very tourisy place. There are still artists selling their artworks and some will approach you to have your portrait sketched. Good to spent a few hours here, visiting the basilica, absorbing the view of Paris and have a nice lunch! Beware of pickpockets and pushy peddlers."

I mean whatever Montmartre was before, it is no longer. You will walk up to the basilica and see a sea of people. Literally thousands. Walking the stairs are hundreds of tourist - camera in hand. Thrown in are the guys who throw a bracelet on you and then demand to be paid. They rush at you and god help you if you make eye contact. Personally, I would never go here at night. If it's scary in broad daylight I wouldn't take my chances at dusk. Then you have everyone taking photos. There must be a thousand cameras and iPhones out just snapping away. Selfies are king here. Whatever you want to call it.... it is the furthest thing from peaceful.Moving deeper and higher into Montmartre you will find little caf\u00e9s & restaurants. They were all filled and people seemingly happy. Perhaps the food is delicious and cocktails too? Give it a try - I did not as prices were a bit expensive. I would suggest drinking loads of wine - you'll need to. When you are there gypsies come at you like your made of gold and throw papers at you demanding you to sign. It's so their comrade can snatch your wallet or make you pay after signing. It's just sad. And couldn't be more annoying. You spend half your time protecting your belongings and saying \"no\"then looking about the area. I could not imagine living here. I feel so sad for the Parisians here. The tourist comes (me included) and so does all the crime and kitschy trash shops. Perhaps in a few years the bad will turn everyone away (tourist, gypsies, thieves) and it'll start to be like it's old self again...less is sometimes more."

When we finally decided to leave, we headed down the stairs... Which were covered in urine.

Note that there are some artists walking around with clipboards who will try to make a portrait.\u00a0 There is also a square with a bunch of seated painters who take longer-these are higher quality and a better experience."

I actually did not go into Sacre Coeur, but took a moment to scan the Paris horizon, take pictures, and eat my breakfast on a bench halfway up the stairs to the cathedral. I did, however, go into Saint Pierre de Montemartre. I believe it has four purple-ish columns dating back to Roman times inside? At first I though they were the two huge columns flanking the entryway, but look a little farther back from those columns, and you will see the nondescript, ancient columns you're looking for. Kind of cool to go to touch something from that far back! His tour takes you to a square which is surronded by cafes, and full of artist's painting pictures. If you want your caricature done, a portrait, or to purchase one of their gorgeous works, you can. I picked up a painting from a local artist, and I treasure every day I look at it! It's a picture of the square I bought it in, and these artists can even take credit cards. Nice souvenir, huh? Rick Steve's tour also takes you by the last standing vineyard in an area that used to be covered with them once upon a time. You will also see the cafe La Vie en Rose was debuted in, and the studio where Picasso began his painting in Paris. On the square by his studio, I was serenaded by an accordionist while children played nearby. Cafe de Deux Moulins from the movie, \"Amelie\" has changed name, and was a letdown from the outside, so we didn't even go in. If you want to see the Moulin Rouge, it won't be as spectacular as I'm sure it is at night when the lights are lit, but I got a picture anyway. There are also other neat windmills to see on his tour (as you can tell, I'm a windmill fan). Afterwards, we took the Metro to the Marais District to have lunch at the Dormouse in the Teapot. They have a mile-high lemon meringue pie."

The last time we were here, we found a beautiful painting by an unknown artist. We stopped at a little pub for a beer and water and got charged 7\u20ac for the water. I still think it is worth walking up to the church, as the Basilica is incredible and the views from up here are beautiful, but skip the shopping and eating up here. There are a lot of scam artists (African men trying to put bracelets on your wrist, or teenagers trying to get you to sign a fake petition, or a person asking if you lost a gold ring) around here, but they are easy to avoid.

Paris, especially Montmartre, is one of the most wonderful parts of Paris. The day time offers wonderful shops and small boutique style restaurants, while in the square, the artists are painting until the wee hours of the morning. Once the sun goes down, the whole mood changes as the cafe's start with their music and singing and there is excitement all around the square that is Montmartre. The back side of Monmartre houses such wonderul places as Moulin Rouge and other nightclubs that make this place the best place for artists to gather, while on the other side of the mountain (because Monmartre is on a small mountain in the city itself), lies Sacre Couer Cathedral which is a sight to behold in the morning sunlight. It is awash with white and can be seen from anywhere in the city where one can capture a view. The flower peddlers have their carts and wagons all around while the smells of fresh baked bread and freshly brewed espressos fill your head with overwhelming delight.If you visit Paris and go nowhere else, make sure to see Montmartre as it is every dream you ever had of Paris!"

I took my friend up there on a Sunday evening at around 8 which gives you an hour or two till sunset. By 9/9:30 people are barely climbing up to the Sacre Coeur anymore. Grab a seat on the stairs or if you like your space, find a spot on the grass and watch the sun set over Paris while you're serenaded by street musicians or entertained by random/weird dancers - you don't have much of a choice but to watch them however, its thoroughly enjoyable! The eateries are usually a little too pricey up there, so come back down to grab a bite - there's a ton of cool places of all cuisines to choose from.Also, if you can't walk up there, there is a funicular that will get you up right to the front of the Sacre Coeur!"

We were dropped off at the Moulin Rouge and that street is filled with sex shops and trashy stores, but if you make your way and go up hill to the left you will find a staircase of about two hundred steps. Once you climb them, the world changes. The streets are cobblestone and the sacred heart church is amazing, plus there is a breath taking view of Paris, great for watching the sunset. Walking past the church, the streets are lined with artists painting. There are also a multitude of stores and cafes. I loved my day there and highly recommend it"

We also had a very good meal at one of the restaurants that had extensive outdoor seating and the atmosphere was both interesting and vibrant. Yes, there are tons of tourists and there are definitely tourist trap shops and restaurants, but you can find a bargain if you have the time and tenacity. What among the supposed \"must sees\" in Paris isn't crammed with tourists, somewhat dirty and prone to be outrageously expensive during prime season?! Time of year can be everything.

Montmartre must surely be one of the most iconic areas of Paris.If you don't fancy walking up the famous hill, there's a small funicular railway that you can take.

Outside the church, there's a spectacular view of the city and it's a nice place to watch the sunset.Parts of Montmartre still have an almost rustic, village-like atmosphere: look out for the little vineyard and the Moulin de la Galette. For authentic French cabaret, visit the Lapin Agile. One particularly pictureseque area is the Place Emile Goudeau, a charming tree-lined square where you can find a recreation of the famous Bateau Lavoir, residence of so many famous early C20th artists, including Picasso. Indeed, the theme of art pervades Montmartre, with a large number of artists in the area who will paint or sketch portraits of tourists. Meanwhile, lovers of modern art will enjoy the Dali museum on rue Poulbot.Montmartre is also famous for its nightlife, typified by the world famous Moulin Rouge. There's a wealth of places to eat, including well known restaurants like Le Consulat.But there's another side to Montmartre which is not quite so romantic. It's so heavily frequented by visitors that some tourist traps and scams have inevitably sprung up. Be especially vigilant on your way to and from the Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur: the steep, winding paths leading to the church are the haunt of the notorious \"bracelet guys\" who aim to get money from you by manoeuvering string bracelets on to your wrist whether you want them or not. There are many cheap and sometmes tacky souvenir shops around and, of course, there's the red light district of Pigalle, with its seedy shops and theatres. Don't get suckered into bars or clubs with promises of free drinks or dances.So keep your wits about you when visiting Montmartre, but also keep an open mind and you'll find many intriguing places to explore in this legendary district."

Don't just visit the area around Sacre Coeur (though you should visit--the church is beautiful and there are wonderful views of Paris from the steps out front)--make sure to head down the hill and explore some of the shops and cafes away from the tourist-focused area. There are nice cafes near the Abbesses Metro. If you like a true French baguette, Montmartre is the place to find one! A few bakeries in the area have won the award for Paris' best baguette (the winner supplies baguettes to the French president). Cocquelicot, Le Crenier a Pain Abbesses and Boulangerie Alexine are all good options.Paris Walks is a group that leads English-speaking tours around Paris; they meet at a Metro stop. We took the Montmartre tour, and it was excellent; it really gave us a feel for the architecture of the neighborhood and the history (full of artists)."

We did the walking tour in the Rick Steve's Tour guide that starts at the metro stop, goes up to the Sacre Cour Basilica and the old village with its Vinyards and cabarets and finally to the homes of Picasso, Van Gough and other artists who lived here. All worth seeing, just watch out that this is a major area for street scams that seem to be better controlled in other areas of Paris.

Take your time to explore the narrow streets full of handicraft shops, young emerging designers and creators, vintage shops and cabinets of curiosities. Look for La Boutique des Anges, Tomb\u00e9es du Camion and Chinemachine, just to name a few. You can also find inexpensive snackbars where you can try the typical parisian cr\u00eapes and pastries. If visiting in the evening, pick one of the cosy corner bars around the Sacr\u00e9 Coeur and enjoy the view and the nightlife. Only one word of warning; Montmartre is a very, very touristic spot and loads of thieves hang around, trying to talk to you, to sell you stuff or get you to engage in illegal bet-games. Suspect anyone that approaches you, even if it looks as if they belong to a legit tourism company."

Therefore, I'll continue with my exploration of, now already, the eighteenth arrondissement, a part of the Right bank of the River Seine. After the visiting of the white - domed Basilique of Sacred Heart, I had started to descend by feet to feel the touch of the old cobblestones, firmly and solidly put in the twisting steeped streets. They are (the streets) more or less small by width or length, but they include in itselves a lot of happenings. Let's begin from the plenty of nightclubs, in which govern so lively ambience. Then, here, there is a little further from the Basilique, another older church, called Saint Pierre de Montmartre for which say, that is a site of the foundation of the Jesuit order of the priests. And definitely that is an area, mostly renown for the numerous painters who lived and worked here, like Salvador Dali ( the Espace Dali is in the Rue Poulbot), Amadeo Modigliani, Claude Monet, Piet Mondrian, Pablo Picasso, Vincent Van Gogh and many others. You ought to drop by the charming cafes in these ravishing streets and try the french coffee with croissants (crescent-shaped pastry roll).Here on the hill, in the 1814 during the Battle of Paris, the Russians- Cossacks first used the term of the \"Bistro\" ( in the russe, it means quickly) when they wanted to be served, and so it remained as the name of the cozy little restaurants in Paris. Very popular either before or now is the tour of the Le Chat Noir(the Black Cat) Cabaret, that is announced by the artistic advertisements hanging on the walls of the houses. Also I liked the very inclined stairs in the Rue Foyatier.That was beautiful adventure on the entrancing streets of the Hill Montmartre."

It's about three times more crowded now, but there are new little shops, the streets are cleaned up, the shop owners are friendlier, the cafes are busier and the entire nature of this neighborhood is more like what it was our first couple of visits. We were really encouraged. We hang out in Montmartre & les Halles now instead of \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9 because of the pissy shop owners in \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9. Montmartre is so fun that you'd be hard-pressed to not have a good time here or find something interesting. Even Pigalle looked a lot nicer. Normal people all over now, not just the seedy street looking people. There's still color & a bit of adventure but its not nearly as nasty as our last trip."

You can take the Metro to Abbesses and then walk, or take the Funicular up to Sacre Coeur. Note that there are a lot of very steep stairs up from the Metro station so take the lift if you need to preserve your energy for the walk up to Sacre Coeur. The view from the top is spectacular, however the area around there can be spoilt by the tourists and street vendors selling trashy souvenirs. There are loads of places to eat in Abbesses catering for all preferences and pricing.read less"

Just around the corner from the Basilica there is the artists' square in Place du Tetre, where local artists sell there paintings and also do a sketch of you for an agreed price. There are quite a few cafe/bistros in the square, and it reminds me of the tv series 'Allo Allo'. The best way of guiding anyone to this square is if you are outside Sacre Coeur, and looking directly at it, then the square is to the right uphill then bends to the left. Walking will take no longer than 5 minutes. Word of warning, I would not recommend staying overnight in Monmartre because a lot of it is quite rough with seedy x-rated shops"

So artists have full use of the square Nov - April, the coldest months of the year when it is very difficult to draw outdoors! What a shame it has lost it's charm and given over to commercialism where people think nothing of paying high prices for food & drink but would try and knock down the cost of a portrait from an artist, which I heard them doing. Another shock is the sight you see on leaving Anvers Metro station, a tatty shop with piles of clothes spilling onto the street and a bin piled high with rubbish. You have to have your wits about you walking up the hill. The wristband trick was tried on my husband, I'd read about it and promptly pulled him away, they didn't like that. We stayed until dark for photographs then walked down the side steps where a gang of the wristband bandits were waiting like a pack of wild animals. They were persistent and I had to be firm, once we'd shaken those ones off another came running after us, a firm NO and a hand in the face did the trick.The Police really need to do something about these bandits, soon!The once characterful shops in the village are full of cheap tat, there are too many restaurants, the artists presence is minimal, instead of feeling charming as it used to it feels dangerous as you cannot escape being hassled by Eiffel Tower souvenir sellers and wristbandgangs.We WILL NEVER return.

The views from outside the Sacre Coeur across the city are wonderful. It was fun to take a trip up the funicular and wander around the street. There are plenty of artists wanting to draw a portrait, if you are willing to sit for one. When we visited there was a heavy police presence so the many street sellers that others mention were scarce on our visit to the area which made it an incredibly pleasant experience. We enjoyed the carousel ride too."

It's decidedly grotty and rather dodgy - avoid at night unless you want to be mugged. The view from the top of the hill is OK too - you get a vista of the side of Paris nobody really wants to see -ie no famous landmarks.

This time I have to say I was disappointed. The area has become rather tacky and too touristy. It looked like it was in need of a good clean up and re-vamp. Of course, the Sacre Coeur was as magnificent as ever and the views are wonderful. We had been forewarned about the pick pocketing teams that frequent the area, and sure enough we were approached more than once. I didn't like being pestered by artists wanting to paint a portrait/ sell me a painting. I realise they have to make a living, but being constantly bothered is a turn-off for me. I'd like to see a better police presence and hopefully see an end to the pick pockets that don't encourage people to visit an area."

You're not allowed to take pictures in the church. There was a choir singing beautiful hymns which just made the experience even more enjoyable. There are quite a lot of stairs to walk up to the church but it's okay. The view from the top is stunning. We then headed to explore the streets of Montmartre. What a vibe! So colourful and buzzing. Artists all over the place painting a quick portrait. Lotsa restaurants to choose from. Plenty of souvenir shops. We shopped here for souvenirs to take back home. Look out for these export surplus shops on the main streets. It's messy but the clothes are really cheap. And if you're lucky you could get some really nice stuff.Please please beware of the scamsters!! DO NOT entertain these chaps who have these small black discs that they shuffle around on a table. They have one disc which is black on one side and white on the other. They will take money from you...and mind you they bet in denominations of 50 and 100 euros. Shuffle the discs around and then ask you to pick the black n white disc. Almost always it is the wrong one! They are a group who do it and include women too just to make it look 'authentic'. Same scam happens outside the Eiffel Tower. That's where my mum lost 50euros! Phew. A good lesson learnt."

Amble along the windy roads, uphill and downhill (beware the 'landmines' left by dogs!), and you find that this part of Paris is a different place altogether. It has such character and a soul that, to me, is the essence of Paris. From the charming little vineyard just across the Lapin Agile (where Picasso was supposed to have hung out during his formative years as a fledgling artist) to the impressive Sacre Coeur, Montmarte has much to offer. It is so easy to lose yourself in this corner of Paris. If anyone tells you that Paris is a romantic city, it's because they have been on top ;)"

And go to restaurants where you are the only American.This is the Montmartre I stayed in over a long weekend and fell in love with.Then we saw the 2%- in front of the sacre coer steps with the annoying aggressive peddlers, the sex shops further down the hill - this is not true MM, and if this is all you see, you are missing a great experience.Walk up Lepic and have a coffee on Rue Abbesses.

We read reviews and almost didn't go as we were scared we may be accosted by people selling wristbands and souvenirs. Then we thought, it can't be any worse than what we've already seen at the Eiffel Tower and Champs Elysees, so we went anyway - and we are so glad we did! I can't compare it to what it used to be as other reviewers have, and no, it's not romantic, it's actually pretty grimey; but if you go with an open mind and just enjoy the Parisian vibe, artists, cafes, churches and views for what they are, you'll enjoy it. We walked the cobblestone paths, bought some art from a man painting in artists' square and enjoyed people watching from one of the cafes.

One of the best ways to enjoy Montmartre (Reach it from one of the nearby Metro stations such as Anvers) is to climb the steps to The Sacre Coeur, look back over the panoramic view of the City, and then having turned back to face the basilica walk down the steps to the left which leads to the higher part of the area. You can then gradually work your way down to the lower levels taking whichever byway you choose on the way. Any direction you take will lead you to interesting places and there are many good cafes and restaurants to linger on the way.. Do not forget the excellent Museum de Montmartre which is well signposted. On a sunny day there is no better place (Try to avoid weekends when it is too crowded). The aura of the great artists and characters that frequented the lanes is long gone but there are many interesting characters and some of the portrait artist who offer to draw for you are very good indeed."

Your eyes will tell you who is good and who is...well not so. Many restaurants available but service isn't the best as it is a tourist hot spot so they don't rely on return customers. Watch out for pickpockets. Don't let that put you off, just be aware and careful. The guys playing their Carribean type tunes on the side of Sacre Couer are entertaining, but if you walk the block and come back, it's a fair chance they'll be playing the same song. If you want a good meal in Montmartre then I suggest you head downhill...somewhere between the top and Moulin Rouge so you are out of touristville.

Lots of tourists, of course. Couldn't be easier. If there are too many stairs for you go to the right of the carousel and there is a funicular to the top. I think it was 3.00 Euro for one round trip up and down. The Metro runs every two minutes. Easiest way to get around Paris. A lot cleaner and more efficient that US subways."

The only redeeming thing is the Dali exhibit, it's fantastic and worth looking for. Whatever you do to go there, though, come from the back and not from the Basilica. Avoid that place at all cost.

Situated on a hill north of Paris, this area is known for its street artists and the Bascillica of the Sacre Couer.We walked from Moulin Rouge to Montmartre at dusk. I must admit that I felt a bit uneasy about the neighborhood between Moulin Rouge and the stairs at Rue Gabrielle. Nothing happened to us, but not a walk I'd want to make at night. Those streets are dark, narrow and the graffiti hints that this is not a place for tourists to wander at night.The stairs from Rue Gabrielle to Place du Tertre will test your cardiac fitness, but its part of the Montmartre experience because when you take that final step its like walking into another world. In Montmartre time seems to pass at a slow, leisurely pace. People are strolling the streets looking at the numerous gift shops or engaging in casual conversation at one of the many bistros.We walked over to Sacre Coeur and did a quick tour of the Bascillica. We lingered on the steps for pictures as dusk turned to dark. The lights of Paris are amazing when viewed from the steps of the Bascillica ... a view that everyone should strive to experience.Later, we dined at one of the local bistros and bought a few pieces of art. The artwork is formula stuff, not investment-grade. However, the colors are vivid and the scenes are recognizable. Looks great in our familyroom with pieces we've collected on our travels.Many reviews have commented about beggars and pushy souvenir sellers. Those sorts are certainly in/around Montmartre. However, the presence of these elements should not deter your visit to the area. Montmartre has far less of this element than the main tourist sites of Paris (Eiffel Tower, Lovre, etc). We took a taxi from Montmartre back to our hotel (about 4 blocks south of the Eiffel Tower). The fare was a very reasonable 12 Euros. I am so glad we found our way to Montmartre ... and would highly recommend this as a must-see destination to those visiting Paris."

Something to note though is that the bottom of the stairs to the Sacre Coeur are crowded with guys who will try to aggressively sell you tacky souvenirs or worse, try to put a bracelet on your wrist or give you a rose and then demand money for it. Despite saying \"no thank you\" a number of times, at one point I had my wrist grabbed by one guy demanding that I give him a minute. My partner was also harassed.

I recommend walking up the hill. Take your time enjoying the gorgeous architecture of the Basilica Sacr\u00e9 C\u0153ur. Which is one of the most unique in all of Europe. There are a few cozy cafes atop and of course a few souvenir shops which proudly carry French made gifts.

It was very different scenery, as this is the home of the blatant sex trade that has flourished in the area for ages. The streets are lined with sexually oriented businesses. Pigalle is also home to the Moulin Rouge. To see the show at the Moulin Rouge and to dine there is expensive. Still, it is the part of risqu\u00e9 Paris that draws many visitors!"

The streets are rough cobblestone, and steep so wear comfortable shoes , and if not in good physical shape, hire a cab. A nice hotel, the Mercure Montmatre, is nearby and I suggest it as it is also near restaurants, the underground, Molon Rouge, etc. We were not plagued with beggars and aggressive peddlers as with most other parts of Paris.

The place has absolutely no character whatsoever and has just become an extremely tacky tourist spot. There is no question that the church is beautiful, but with so many beautiful churches in Paris, it's simply not worth the journey. The best thing the Catholic church could do is act like Jesus and cast the money changers from the temple. It is a beautiful place, ut one that makes you sad when you see what effect tourism has on the local environment. This should be a place of peace and reflection and quiet enjoyment.

Then you can just forget the route and wander among this hillside area, but always set Sacr\u00e9 C\u0153ur as a landmark and walk toward/around it. Arrange at least half a day and explore every lane and every corner, then you will spontaneously reach Lapin Agile, Place du Tertre, Espace Dal\u00ed, Renoir's garden, etc. It seems around every corner of Montmartre hill lanes there is a hidden gem waiting for your arrival. Never forget to have a coffee and a meal in a bohemian cafe. I strongly recommend Relais de la Butte at Rue des Trois Freres, opposite to Bateau-Lavoir. Wonderful restaurant in a very Montmartre atmosphere."

Grab a bottle of water from the monoprix and wander up the hill. Lovely shops;great cafe scene. Look out for the street art tucked away high on the walls. A refreshing trip away from the Centre of paris. Good views from the church. Watch your bags around the church itself; but don't let this stop you making the trip. Combine this with a walking tour - definitely worth it."

Of course, the cheap souvenir shopping was very good, but other than that it was crowded, and for the first time in paris I felt uncomfortable regarding security, pickpockets and the like. Seeing an obvious three card monte type game for what seemed to be real money made me more wary than usual. The views of the city were nothing to write home about. We have been through countless cathedrals in Europe, so there was no great allure in this regard, either. If you want your portrait sketched, there are many artists willing to do so, for a price of course and no complaint there. The highlight was the Metro station, one of the best of its kind and style. Do go, to say you've been, and I hope you enjoy it more than I did."

Naturally a historical neighborhood with amazing Parisian architecture was too good to pass up. I stumbled upon Montmartre after taking a walking tour of the Champs-Elysee. I raced over on the metro to make it to a second walking tour of Montmartre. Immediately upon arriving I fell in love. As a native New Yorker I could never leave New York City, but if I did I know it would be for a place like Montmartre or Rome. A place with an insane amount of history. This had nothing to do with the movie 'Amelie', I slept through much of that movie, this had more to do with the cafe's where Picasso had eaten, where Van Gogh had lived, and the bars where artists had drunk absinthe and the early 20th century art culture that still permeates through the air. It was a beautiful experience and a beautiful part of Paris; do stay away from the Senegalese hustlers at the end of the park however. They are really eager to confuse and hustle unsuspecting tourists"

The Monmartre Museum has a lovely garden overlooking hillside vineyards and the museum has many Talouse Lautrec paintings and which will educate you about Le Chat Noir and other historical cabarets in Montmartre.

Montmartre has changed very little in appearance from 1980s (my first visit), 1990s (my second visit) and 2013 (my third visit), apart from the invasion of tourists. Most people come to see the Basilica de Sacre Coeur and the Moulin Rouge, but there is a lot more to Montmartre than our eye can see - it's the history of the area. You can take the miniature train up and down the hill and narrow alleyways where the coach or bus would struggle to get through and you will get the gist of the place and the local people who live here. Or walk around the Boulevard de Clichy as you come out of metro Blanche or Anvers and look at the bars, cafes, bistros, brassaries, restaurants, lots of unusual boutiques and shops built at the beginning of the last century or earlier. See how many original dance halls, cabarets and theatres of the naughties you can spot apart from Moulin Rouge. Go into the shops like Darty, Sympa and Tatti in rue de Steinkerque where the prices are slashed to less than half their original. Walk up the hill towards the Basilica and turn right into rue de Tertre - you have entered a true boho territory of the artists, writers and musicians of the 19th and 20th century who lived and worked here; now it belongs to 21st century artists, writers and musicians who live, work or roam the streets struggling to make ends meet as their mentors/idols once did. There are more bistros and cafes here, one called Les Deux Moulin in rue Lepic - the 2 windmills of which one still survives today, as well as several museums dedicated to them. Spare one more day to visit Montmartre cemetary where some of the great artists, musicians and writers are laid to rest."

After taking the Metro to Anvers station (avoided Pigalle as it's probably a bit unsuitable for young ladies) we walked up through the streets towards the steps beneath the Sacre Coeur..what an amazing place.The streets were lined with souvenir and trinket shops but we pressed on, keen to get to the heart of the place and took the Furnicular Railway up to the top (if you buy a rover Metro ticket it is valid on here too which was really good value). Once at the top, we stopped at the Irish Pub on the left and had a Magners...and a coke...reasonable for Paris at 13 Euros for us both.The place was buzzing and full of all walks of life, young and old, plus some living statues..one of which was hilarious....he wasn't even attempting to keep still..was very jolly and couldn't resist waving at everyone ..and doffing his halo..think he was supposed to be an overweight, middle aged angel...think Chubby Brown covered in silver paint..lol.Then we went round the Sacre Coeur which was free and absolutely breathtaking..beautiful artwork and interesting insight to the Catholic faith...small side chapels for the various saints to pray to and even the confessional booths..most fascinating.Then we meandered through the streets to the main square where all the artists...nonw, unless you want to have your picture sketched...this is the best piece of advice i can give - take a piece of rolled up paper with you when you go and wave it at anyone asking you if you want a portrait doing..Or..what happened to us, might happen to you..We were approached in the street by two men in their early 60s who started drawing us right there and then without asking or even getting our approval...of course they were utterly charming and di wonderful drawing of both of us...so we couldn't say no and ended up paying out a fortune - eek...daren't even tell you how much..it was 40 euros each. Again, that oft heard phrase on our day in Paris was used again...well it IS Paris and we don't do this often. I was secretly furious but my daughter (who obviously wasn't the one paying) thought it was marvellous and loves her picture, but the only good bit in my view was, we were able to wave our rolled up pictures when we were approached umpteen other times.Really lovely atmosphere in the main square...after an hour or so we went back down the Furnicular - by which time was about 11.30am and the queue was ENORMOUS to get on the Furnicular, so we patted ourselves on the back and went off walking towards Abbesses Metro station where another cheeky beer was consumed before getting on the train.Wonderful experience....just be wary of being accosted into buying something you really didn't intend to!!"

Sacre Coeur is just around the corner and while being a magnificent church to visit also provides a great view over Paris from the steps.

As mentioned already, go early or go late.This is the former boheme neighbourhood of Paris, and most great artists have passed from here.Especially in the golden years of Belle Epoque, walking these streets would mean you mere almost certain to come across one of the living legends of the time.Nowadays, however, you'll mainly find a diverse hodgepodge of migrant portrait artists from anywhere in the world, having nothing to do with Montmartre, except that they work there.The 'early or late' suggestion at the top of the page, refers to the views of the city you can get fro the top of the hill. You'll have rather dramatic light over Paris earl or late in the day.While you are there, don't miss the Basilique de Sacre Coeur."

A place where you can overlook all of Paris, eat at fabulous restaurants, watch local artists at work and enjoy musical entertainment. I enjoy going there in the evening to see all of the city lights. I go here every time I am in the city. You can stroll, eat, snack, and mingle with the locals. Be careful of watching the city lights while walking, as some of the cobblestones are loose and one can trip (as I did)."

The problem is that it suffers from its own sucess, this means it gets very busy and full of tourist, con artist, tourist tack and poor quality resturants.Go early in the morning before 10am, and you get most of the place to yourselves, where you can actually see the place and enjoy a coffee and watch the excitment and tourist build up.If you are into Dahl, there is show of his sculptures at the back of Montmarte, it is sign posted, but you will need to look out for them.Tip,Go early or late to miss the crowds.Do not eat at Chez Eugene, (see its reviews, we were should of).Watch out for Gypsy pick pockets, their method is to ask you sign a petition for \"the children\", then ask you to donate some money, at that point a second child appears and watch you take and replace your wallet, while you are giving the donations, the first child distract you while the second takes your wallet. We saw them at work and took great pleasure in let the poor victims know and stopping them."

Hands down to whoever wrote that guide because it is the best day we have in our Paris trip.We got off at Lamarck-Caulaincourt station and continue our self paced walking tour. We saw amazing places such as Place Dalida, Maison Rose, Au Lapin Agile, Vineyard and Sacre Ceour. The guide will take you to 18 different spots in Montmartre and finishes off at Abbesses Metro station.The best part is that you see locals around the areas and not tourists and definitely no scammers that will hassle you."

I thoroughly enjoyed seeing the side streets, the windmills, the Water Tower, the Montmartre Museum, and a host of other places that a tourist would normally not see.

We walked to the Sacre Coeur Bascillica and chose the trolley to get to the top. The Basicillia is just outstanding. All of the intricate paintings and carvings....then you get to see the city of Paris which is great. There is a statue on a pillar right at the bottom of the stairs and as you get closer you realize it is a real person......amazing.

Montmartre is a hill in the north of the city,in the 18th arrondissement,a part of the Right bank. Its claim to fame is not the cool shops,the exuberant galleries, but the white- domed stunning Basilica of the Sacre-Coeur, at its summit. However,once your diligence in paying respect to your maker is done,the area is nightclub central. Many artists had studios or worked around the community of Montmartre,including Monet, Dali,Picasso, Modigliani and Van Gogh. A sway of films have centered this precinct in its epics. To get here could not be easier. Its served by the following stations:Metro line 2.... Pigalle, Anvers & Blanche with Line 12 offering Pigalle, Lamarck-Cailaincourt, Jules Joffrin and Abbesses. If you get lost.....ask someone!! The word Montmartre originates from the latin \"Mount of Mars\",which became \"Mountain of the Martyr\" ( Saint Denis who was Bishop of Paris as well as Mayor,chose the cathedral on the outskirts of Paris). The hill has been used by armies,both local and foreign,to bombard the city with artillery. There is a memorial sign on the wall of one of the eateries in The area that says:on 30 march 1814- here the Cossacks first launched their famous bistro and thus on this summit occurred the worthy ancestor of our bistro\". This is a popular drinking area,freewheeling with decadent entertainment (yeeppee) at the end of the 19th century. In the popular cabaret,the Moulin-Rouge and Le Chat-Noir,some of France's greatest artists played to filled houses. With the urbanisation of Haussman underway,it drove the inhabitants of the effected areas to the edge of the city to Clichy,La Villette and the' hill' with the view of the city, Montmartre. Stroll along the boulevards,while you hum Charles Aznavour's 'La Boheme',his best song lamenting the fading bohemian scene and see if you can spot the sites of the movies, La Vie Rose which told of the life of Edith Piaf and her times in the slums of Paris. Who can forget Amelie, which is set right here in contemporary Montmartre and back in 2001 Moulin Rouge,with my favourite artist Toulouse- Lautrec. Down hill,metaphorically,is the red light district of Pigalle which hosts a large variety of instruments... not those types,naughty.... .but guitars and rock music stores.  If you are too lazy to make the assault up the hill,there is a funicular railway to take you up. You will look like a burk,but you wont raise a sweat!. Come and join me and 350,000 people for the very popular Fete des Vendanges of Montmartre during the 1st weekend of October. Its a sensational event. You must be exhausted and famished by now. Get your Euros out,but skip the tres- ordinaire eateries and head for the terrific restaurant...La Mascotte...... Read about this in my forthcoming review. Bon appetite."

At the summit of the 'butte Montmartre', the highest point in Paris (after the top of the Eiffel tower), stands the Basilica of Sacre Coeur, a beautiful church which is well worth a visit and the views of the city from here are fantastic. It can be reached by the metro (Anvers station), a short walk and then climbing hundreds of steps which is exhausting but there are seats at different levels (alternatively you can take the funicular railway to the top). Once home to many of the great artists such as Toulouse-Lautrec and Picasso and famous for the Moulin Rouge and its nightlife, Montmartre is a very busy, vibrant area with a bohemian atmosphere. The cobbled streets are packed with artists, buskers, beggars and tourists. In the square the artists try to sell you their paintings and to paint your portrait. Restaurants and cafes abound, most with outdoor seating. Prices are 'Parisien' but more affordable than in many of the other districts. There is also an abundance of tourist shops selling cheap souvenirs. Montmartre is definitely one of the tourist highlights in Paris but it is not for the fainthearted."

But at the top of this hill you will discover the true joie de vivre, cafes, artists, street dancers all in a setting of winding cobble streets and narrow stone buildings. We stopped at a corner caf\u00e9 for a drink along the sidewalk to take in the ambiance. We enjoyed it so much that we returned later for dinner and a bottle of wine, superb! While in the district you must also walk by the Moulin Rouge which is at the bottom of this area, just because it is such a landmark. We did not have any trouble with scammers although we did see some young black men carrying colored strings for making the bracelets that we read about here. We had no trouble on the stairs and as with any city just ignore unwanted approaches and keep walking. We left the area before full darkness so perhaps that would be our recommendation if you are at all nervous. Definitely a must see area to spend time in the artists square and a tour of the Cathedral. We paid a few euros to go up to the top of the cathedral to watch the sunset, fabulous!"

We walked past picturesque facades, a couple of windmills, curio and souvenir shops, and cafes teeming with people - all of which made us realize that we were finally in Paris! There were street performers, scooters zipping up and down the streets, and a myriad of pleasant aromas as you walked past specialty shops and restaurants. At the end of the long walk was the Sacre Couer basilica (which in itself was a gem) and the best view of Paris bar none! We took the steps going back down, which in retrospect was a better idea because climbing those stairs would have been harder and much less interesting than the back street route that we took to get up the hill. The only thing that took away from the overall experience was the number of street hawkers/vendors/hustlers that always seemed to be in your face trying to sell you their wares."

The paintings are quite formulaic (obviously created for the tourist trade) but they are hand painted and I guess would make a good souvenir - the artists didn't seem to mind people taking photographs to their work and of them painting.You can also have your portrait done for you on the spot (natural or caricature style) - quite expensive I think, but still a good souvenir.For eating, check all the cafes thoroughly, they all have various deals, pick one that has more people eating there as that will probably be better quality."

            "review": "Beautiful in most parts. Montmartre is big enough that you can't stick it all in one box. It ranges from beautiful old cobblestone postcard-worthy streets to \"gritty\" working class areas at its far eastern edge. It also ranges from quiet and local to some parts that are so overcrowded with tourists that it's a huge turnoff. Throw in the sex shop strip near Place Pigalle and you've got it all. Don't let any one part of the neighbourhood cloud or rarify your view of the other areas. Overall it is definitely worth seeing. Are the tales of scammers near Sacre Coeur true? Yes, although probably exaggerated and overly cautious. There are a lot of people, some of them are sketchy, the vast majority aren't. 99% of the people in the area, even in Pigalle and in the far eastern side along Clingancourt and into la Goutte d'or near Chateau Rouge Station, are just minding their own business and will leave you alone. The 1% that don't can be pretty annoying, but remember there is a pretty thick line between annoying and dangerous. I'm not saying nothing bad ever happens here, but just exercise as much caution as you would in any major city, especially around subway stations and in very crowded areas, and you'll be fine. You'd be doing yourself a real disservice by not coming to Montmartre. We stayed in the area and spent three or four full days there, plus plenty of evenings out, and really enjoyed it. Best parts are Rue des Abesses, Caulincourt, the Montmartre cemetery and the actual Sacre Coeur church. View from the top of the church dome is spectacular. Lots of activity in front on the steps down the hill too. We were intimidated at first but went there at sunset one night to soak it in and ended up sitting around with hundreds of other people (and a few machine gun toting soldiers) so really no trouble at all. This is probably one of the nicest neighbourhoods in Paris save for a few spots that are overrun with tourists and the scam artists that inevitably follow them."

The streets are crowded with the worst kind of tourist tat for sale, all of it rubbish, think 3d postcards, model Eiffel towers, plastic sun glasses and the like. The worst experience of all however, comes when you attempt to reach the cathedral. there are guys at the base of the steps leading up trying to \"offer\" you some kind of rubbish string bracelet, these guys are really pushy and aggressive, literally grabbing hold of you and not letting go.It made for a very poor experience and we will not be back."

Once you have got through that there are the conmen card tricksters, illegal street sellers and pickpockets. Once you get to the top you have a fantastic view and the building itself is stunning. But just avoid eye contact with anyone. Anyone who talks to you will want your money. Very sad.

Lovely cobbled streets and old buildings to wander around. Down near the Moulin Rogu\u00e9 you just have a load of tatty sex shops. Men and women will be hassled by ladies trying to lure you into strip clubs. In all honesty I'd say half a day is enough to get a feel for the place. There are some nice bohemian streets and shops but the majority is sleaze and a sense of unease. The armed police and soldiers have a good presence there and the conmen and bracelet sellers move quickly away when they arrive only to set back up again immediately after!"

If you do please remember the phrase, \"Non, merci.\". That way the rose guy and the artists who will try to charge you 80 euros for a bad sketch of yourself will not bother you. Montmartre is beautiful and charming and tons of cafes near the abbesses that you can just leisurely enjoy the day. I spent five days there and never saw a homeless person or someone urinating on the steps.

There were all the tourist traps I had heard of up there... the girls with petitions, the men trying to tie bracelets around people's wrists and people selling handbags and metal Eiffel towers.

It's an easy walk from the Metro. We walked up to the Church as the funicular had a long line due to one car being repaired. The ticket office is around the left of the church. We bought a crypt and dome ticket but the crypt only takes a few minutes. The dome ascent give you a beautiful view of Paris including the Eiffel Tower. We had noticed that Montmatre seemed to be the same height as the Eiffel tower when we visited it. Difficult to take photos on the dome due to the sun glare reflecting off the white stone. The kids liked the climb and were not bored. Afterwards we had lunch at one of the restaurants on the way back to the Metro. Would definitely make it a must do for your visit to Paris."

It is on a hill overlooking Paris, great panoramic view. There are local artists who,have a license to exhibit their art in the square and then shops along side streets that sell the Chinese knockoffs of Impressionists. Viewing the art work, I think there must be a lot more value in receiving a permit from the city to exhibit than the value of the art for sale. There were too many little stalls selling souvenirs and junk that it felt like a border town along Texas-Mexico border. I did find one store that sold tapestries made in Flanders that were nice quality. It was crowded, way too many charcoal portrait sketch artists, and pickpocket heaven because it was so crowded. The basilica, Sacre Couer is located in Montemarte. Be prepared for long lines to go in and the vendors selling mementos. It all had a carnival atmosphere. A tip for sewists that visit Montmarte. skip the artists in the square and take your money down the hill to the fabric stores along the street where the carousel is located. Remnant ends of fabulous fabric are for sale. The remnants may be 3/4 meter to 5 meters and if you buy the fabric called coupons, you buy the entire folded amount. I bought Italian wools, silks, and Italian men's shirt cotton, lace, buttons, trims. It was a favorite part of my trip. I found one piece of silk that was from the scarf/fabric designer, Celine. If you check eBay for Celine scarfs you will get an idea of the fabulous fabric available. There is also a local art gallery there that has a lovely coffee shop and sandwiches. I hired a personal guide prior to arriving in Paris. She works as a costumer for the French film industry and she took me to all her favorite sewing shops. Her help and expertise was well worth the fee. The stores at the base of Sacre Couer that I recommend are Sacres Coupons and Tissus Reine. There is usually at least one person who speaks English at the shops. Marche St. Pierre has changed ownership and fabrics are not the quality of selection as reputed in the past. Pictures are not allowed in the shops. August is not the best time for all shops because August is the holiday month for Parisians.Lastly, bathrooms are limited in France. Public restrooms are not pleasant, but if you go to a coffee shop and buy a coffee or give the waiter a Euro, you can probably use the bathroom."

My first day starting out at about 9am after flying in from Australia, after a quick shower and power nap I turned left and headed off across the bridge straight across the cemetery. Cemeteries in Paris are surprisingly interesting places and this one houses Degas as one of its guests. I just walked in no particular direction without a map. August is a time when most Parisians go South for the holidays and so though it was a Thursday it felt like a weekend. The little cafes however were pumping. The streets are lovely, pretty flower boxes filled with geraniums, gorgeous trees lining the streets, just what you expect to see in Paris.There are charming delicatessens, patisseries, boulangerie and specialist stores.This little adventure took me up the back steps of Sacre Couer. Not a tourist in sight except for me. Locals sitting in treed alcoves, so charming. It's a different story when you reach the top as there are hundreds of tourists on the site. However, it's lovely, the view is spectacular and though I didn't venture into the church on this occasion, it's still a very nice experience.After taking some shots and doing some people watching I ventured down the hill and into the throng.You need to be prepared. Read all the internet sites about how to keep what you have. I walked into the abyss. I don't buy in areas like this as usually they are more expensive and also I don't want anyone to see where I go for my money. I stopped to watch a game of stealth to see if I could spot the scam.The next thing I realise I am being drawn into it! I see two girls each win 50 euros each and the man tells me to choose as the girls did. I say no I'm not interested. He gives me E50 and says now tell me, I say no and try to give the money back. He shows me which one to choose and then gives me another 50 euro. I end up with 200 euro and he asks me to swap it for two x 100 Euro notes. I guess this is where I show where my money is and I take his arm, shove his marked, possibly fake notes into his hand, tell him I have no money and I don't want his and walk away. I'm sure I was marked. I am alone, a small woman but not a stupid one. Don't let people like this spoil what is in fact a very interesting part of the city of Paris. My walk took me down some very lovely streets and then into Pigalle which is the red light district. The same as red light districts in most cities of the world. Not that I'm an officiando, I have on a previous visit been to the Moulin Rouge show and though it is squashed and expensive, it's not nasty or sleazy. The thing I remember most is the comedian they had then, was the funniest I had ever seen. It was all mime and just wonderful. It's summer so it's light until after 9pm so I have been out to dinner, but I don't walk alone at night as I wouldn't anywhere. It's life with all its variables!"

Sadly, the once unique and Bohemian neighborhood of Montmartre, the setting for La Boheme, the Moulin Rouge, and so many other tales of artistic striving and nostalgia, and centered around the majestic Sacre Coeur basilica, has been transformed into a burlesque of itself--- a Hollywood version of Bohemia with a Las Vegas underbelly. It is overrun by tourists wanting an instant, authentic experience, surrounded by shops loving international money but staffed by xenophobes, swarming with thieves and aggressive scam artists picking out their marks as soon as you disembark from the Metro. Altogether, this is an unpleasant experience for travelers searching for emotional purity but finding a purity of greed and survival. Mind you, the basilica is still majestic, if you can find it within the hoards of people pushing to get in, or walking around alternately talking loudly and shushing each other. The climb to the dome and the crypt are worth the extra charge. The view is beautiful, although not much compared to the view from the Notre Dame tower or the Eiffel Tower. Everywhere in Paris, as we posed for photos, people (such as tram conductors) shouted out in English, \"One, two, three!\" As well, I wish that just for one day in Paris, I could go through a single day without someone shouting out \"Arigato!\" \"Ni hao!\" or other race-baiting phrases. I am Asian-American, but I speak fluent American English and good French. It is assumed that Asian-appearing tourists are subhumans who are incapable of understanding insults and therefore---maybe---deserving of being insulted. A lamentable situation. I know that these are not representatives of Parisians, but it does not give a visitor warm feelings. As in other tourist areas of Paris, most of the shops sell very forgettable merchandise. One of the shops selling genuinely fine merchandise is a Fragonard parfumerie at the base of the funicular. Their website is here:http://www.fragonard.com/parfums_grasse/GB/fragonard/paris/the_boutique_montmartre.cfmMany of the sample perfumes are exquisite, alluring. We spent more than 100 Euros on perfumes and soaps. Despite our purchase, they could not direct us to any bathroom nearby. As we were leaving, my young son bumped his hand into the door and began crying in pain. He sat down on the step near the door. Because he was crying too hard to explain what hurt, I examined his hand and his legs, to make sure that nothing was bleeding. This took about three or four minutes. During the entire encounter, the staff of the shop (5 or 6 employees) stood in the back of the shop, talking amongst themselves, looking at us, not speaking to us or coming to our aid. I wish I hadn't purchased anything, and if it wouldn't have taken more time in the shop, would have returned the merchandise. The perfumes might be exquisite, but they now have the stench of condescension. American dollars welcomed, Americans, not so much. It is a jarring experience to see these resplendent sights in an atmosphere of meretricious mockery."

The hassles are a bit of a gauntlet, but just hold onto your bags and keep going. The small winding streets with cafes were the best part. Get down into the gritty part of the city and it's not so great. We took a walk down to get a look at the Moulan Rouge, took a picture and climbed back up the hill for the calm and beautiful. There are other moulans behind the sacre cour that we never got to, but are apparently more authentic....another trip."

We had heard that this was a neighbourhood not to be missed so we hopped on the metro from our rental on the Left Bank and got off near Sacre Coeur. Our first stop was at a convenience store to get a drink and my youngest son was bitten by a cat inside the store when he (unadvisedly) tried to pet it. Not a a good start.As we approached the cable car by the church, we found ourselves among dozens of groups of dark skinned men who were hustling tourists. They would tie a string around the victim's wrist and then quickly braid a bracelet and then tie a knot and ask for money, now that the bracelet is knotted and therefore, impossible to remove. I saw them entice a little boy and only stopped when his mother physically pulled him away, and then they approached my teenage son. We eventually managed to rid ourselves of these men but not before my son almost got caught in the scam.The cable car ride up to the church was brief and underwhelming, as was the basilica itself. We had already been to Notre Dame earlier in the week so we had had our fill of churches. The view was okay but obstructed somewhat by trees to the west. The little studios, galleries and shops on the cobblestone streets were quaint but rife with more hustlers wanting to sell you trinkets or paint your portrait. We had a decent dinner in a little cafe and then walked to the Moulin Rouge for a photo before heading to the Pigalle metro station to go home. Going through the turnstiles, my husband was pushed from behind by a fellow who appeared to try to sneak through without paying but as it turned out, he quickly had his hand in my husband's pocket, and, even though the pocket was buttoned, managed to steal his wallet. My husband realized right away but those guys are so fast and work in teams so we had no idea where to go after him.So that was our experience in Montmartre. Personally, I would not recommend this area to families or any tourists unless you are on a chartered bus with a private tour. There are so many other wonderful areas of Paris where you do not feel so vulnerable and uneasy. Having said that, anywhere there are tourists, there are going to be hustlers so keep a sharp eye out for potential pick-pocketers and keep your valuables at home. Bring with you only what you absolutely need and keep that in a money belt under your clothes whenever you are in big, jostling crowds. We managed to cancel our credit and debit cards before they were used but this guy got over 100 Euro (we had just been to the bank) and caused us a lot of inconvenience. Thankfully, my husband wasn't knifed (or worse) but we certainly didn't expect this kind of experience in broad daylight in a historic Paris neighbourhood. Be warned!"

I bought some tasty food from a small store, and ate it in a children\u2019s playground. It is not easy to find a public bathroom in Paris, but here there is a fancy and free one. You do not even have to flush the toilet, and after each use, the entire toiler will be washed and dried. The downside is that it took much longer time. Nearby you could use your metro ticket to ride a cable car to the top of the hill, where the Basilica of Sacred Heart sits. This is the highest ground in Paris, and offers a beautiful view. Historically many fought to control this place. After I visited the majestic basilica, I walked downhill. Many just sat on steps to enjoy the view. A black athletic young man climbed a lamppost, juggling a football. People enjoyed his performance."

If crowds bother you then you might want to get up early and head up to Montmartre and the beautiful church, Sacre Coeur. It was a very warm, sunny day when we arrived and instead of the 'finicular' (tram), we decided to walk the curved stairway up to the top. I've been here before but always took the funicular. This way up was much prettier and gave us more opportunities for great picture-taking! The little shops that line the 'square' are, for the most part, full of the touristy stuff. If you'd like to have your portrait drawn, there are many different artists to consider! Smack-dab in the center of this square are a couple of outdoor restaurants which are always packed with customers. We ate at one of these and found the service to be quick and the food very good with portions, huge! However, when ordering food, I would avoid ordering a drink of any kind. I ordered iced tea and when the bill was presented was amazed that it cost 12 euros!! The church, Sacre Coeur, is quite lovely and is worth a look. Again, if the crowds are there, it will take awhile to get inside. Once inside it is quiet and serene...filled with beautiful mosaic work and soaring ceilings...quite beautiful!"

And, though much of its original history is preserved, the neighborhood definitely has more of the newer resident\u2019s vibe. Montmartre is filled with little specialized food stores and markets, as well as boulangeries, brasseries, caf\u00e9s and restaurants. People in Montmartre like to eat, and like to eat well, that\u2019s why a nice stroll along the neighborhood finds a great closure on finding a charming place to have dinner. The neighborhood is safer than the Sacre-Coeur basilica at the top of the hill, so it\u2019s not a problem to tour around at night. That\u2019s why I\u2019d recommend to first go straight to the top, visit Sacre-Coeur and then take your time around Montmartre streets."

The boulevard is lined with kebab shops, cheap souvenirs, and sex toys shops, so you won\u2019t want to linger, unless you\u2019re into that sort of stuff ;-) As for the Moulin Rouge, frankly it looks better in pictures, although I hear the show is quite spectacular\u2026 Snap a pic yourself and then head up the hill, turn on Rue des Abbesses, find a nice sidewalk caf\u00e9 (preferably around one of the small squares in the area) order a glass of wine and set in for an interesting people-watching experience. You deserve it!Once rested, explore the area around the basilica, which some call Paris\u2019 response to the Village in NY (although just as in that case, artists and writers no longer can afford to live here, and it\u2019s now more of a tourist attraction). Nonetheless, it\u2019s a neighborhood with plenty of character and lots of history. Ultimately, you\u2019ll get to the top of Montmartre, where the imposing Sacr\u00e9 Coeur basilica (100 years old next year) presides over the hill, the highest point in Paris. It\u2019s very crowded, therefore somewhat difficult to enjoy (especially with all the accompanying trinket peddlers, gypsies, etc.) but it also offers a nice Paris panorama, from a different vantage point. I've been to Paris 3 times and have amassed a lot of information. Check out my blog, full of ideas, recommendations, etc.:\u2026blogspot.com/2013/07/paris-mon-amour.htmlHope you enjoy!"

We didn't stop or go to a show. The entire many-block neighborhood is filled with sex-oriented shops, giving us a very squeamish feeling! And I'm not a prude! If you have lots and lots of time in Paris, you could go there, but take some vehicle/route that doesn't leave you much of a walk through that neighborhood. Eat somewhere else, all the cafe's at the top of the hill looked very so-so.

We had been warned about scammers and pickpockets so I was sort of ready for them, but it was scarier than I had expected. I'm a small woman and was traveling with my 14 year old daughter, and as we were heading up the ramp to the cathedral, we were blocked by a menacing group of very dark men, arm in arm creating a barrier so we'd be forced to walk through the rest of their gang. My daughter was terrified, so I was trying to hang on to her while holding my bag to my chest, and one of the guys grabbed my arm to put a piece of string on my wrist (for which he would later demand money, had he succeeded). They do this to get your hands off your purse so they can get into it. I had purposely purchased a travel bag that was difficult to get into, so they didn't succeed at that, but it was very scary and I was very, very angry. I agree that Paris needs to do more to curb the thugs, thieves and beggars that are EVERYWHERE there are tourists. It could be a great place to visit--the sights are beautiful, the history rich, but it is not worth a visit when you have to be fearful everywhere you go.The cathedral itself was very nice, but the area is very crowded and very unsettling. We didn't even get the benefit of the great view as it was cloudy. I could tell it had the potential to be pretty amazing, however (as long has you a firm grip on your kids and your valuables as you try to enjoy it)."

This is a most interesting neighborhood that was far enough away from the center of town that it was technically outside of the city for centuries. We got off the metro at the Blanche stop (avoided Pigalle and the sleaze this time) and just walked around until we reached the top of the hill that is the high part of the city. A few decades ago it was the part of the city where you could find many artists and writers and a rather Bohemian lifestyle. I suppose there is still some truth to that today. There are a few things that you might not want to miss if you go there and walk around like we did. Near the Blanche stop is the famous Moulin Rouge nightspot. On Rue Lepic and Rue des Abbesses there are tons of food shops and restaurants. On Rue Lepic is the brasserie/cafe called des Deux Moulins where quirky Amalie worked in the French film of the same name. Van Gogh's brother Theo lived on the same street. Keep your eyes peeled- You can probably spot a couple more windmills. This is the neighborhood where artists Utrillo (no one showed Montmartre better than Utrillo and he's one of my favorite painters), Modigliani, Picasso, and Renoir and singer Dalida used to live and with luck you will find markers for some of them. Look for the strange statue of a man walking through a wall too (Passe-Muraille) which is exactly what it says. Keep looking and you will even find a vineyard and a cemetery. You can visit a museum dedicated to Montmartre. Near the top of the hill is the famous square- Place du Tertre which is lined with places to eat and drink and swarming with tourists and artists trying to sell their visions of Paris (especially Montmartre) and others trying to convince you to select them to do your portrait (some are good and some are only cartoonists). Bargain carefully if you are tempted. And finally, at the top of this famous hill, is the rather new church known as the Sacre Coeur. Great views of the city and a few con artists and thieves are drawn here too. You can walk up the stairs from the bottom of the hill to get to Sacre-Coeur or also use a metro ticket to get up part way in a sort of elevator/tram. We chose to slowly walk up as I described earlier and then walk down the stairs after walking through the church. You can have a great afternoon walking up the hill, finding places for a drink or snack in order to break your climb, and enjoying the haunt of many famous people, and one of the most famous churches in the world."

It is worth the climb to visit the Sacre Coeur Basilica, however walk on into the village square where there are artists galore, found a lovely couple to sketch our daughter's portraits, try & find Fleur and her partner on the Eiffel Tower side of the square, they are lovely people. Warning: It is worth pointing out that there are scammers, stringmen & pickpockets around, if you are sensible, can say no and walk on, and are not distracted, you will enjoy the area immensely. This is common around all the tourist places, you must have money belts hidden under your clothing in Paris.But it remains a great place to visit."

It was very pleasant there, and while there were some street vendors, they were gracious and did not force themselves on you once you said \"No, merci.\" Food was very good here, as well. I would suggest that if you go to Paris and have the time, definitely go up to Montmartre--and you will see a great view of Paris along with the rest of the experience."

The tour was good, but the area is rather rough with many pickpockets near the transportation areas. It's the only time during my visits to Paris I had to forcibly push a pickpocket away. They are mainly 11-13 year old boys, but they want what you have and the Police do little to stop them. Sacre Courer was impressive and the view was nice, but overall, I wouldn't take the trip to Monmartre again, nor would I recommend it for anyone else. There are too many things to do in Paris so spend time there."

My 9 year old daughter and I stayed in Montmatre, and if you stay focused on enjoying the area, and ignore the annoyances e.g. the number of tourists in parts of the area, the people trying to sell things, then you can coexist with the locals well. It is like living in real Paris as we got to stay with locals and explore the streets. We found the best bread shop in the world, we believe! The area is full of things to do and my girl loved every part of it. It is easy to deal with the people trying to sell you things; we found that being polite and saying no, we were left alone. Also, just being aware of what is happening around you gives you the enjoyment every tourist should have! The best part was getting off the beaten track and just walking through the streets. The Sacre Coeur was magnificent, and another cool thing to do was to people watch on the stairs in the front. Lots of fun!"

To us, it was quintessential Paris--sidewalk cafes with music--even if it was all for the tourists. There was other street entertainment as well--jugglers, dancers.

Jean Paul is friendly, informative, fun and provides a very interesting time with up to 8 people (so it's still very personal) touring, eating and drinking in some of his favorite spots. The restaurants were local places and he knew the folks well and provided a bit of history about each one of them. The food was delicious and the wine was great too. Jean Paul is able to keep you entertained, fed and happy for 4 hours in Paris while you learn a great deal about the special places authors and artists frequented in the past....what could be better than than!I will add that booking this via info@culinarytoursofparis.com is easy and efficient. Jean Paul answered the email in a timely way and we paid via paypal before our trip so everything was all set. The other option is to pay in cash when you arrive, which some folks chose to do. Jean Paul asks the right questions about you so that he is prepared just in case you have any food allergies and/or other issues. In my case, I am a vegetarian (which is a big problem in Paris generally) but I do eat sea food and cheese occasionally, so that worked out great!We traveled France for 2 weeks but my two teenaged daughters continued to talk about the two days with Jean Paul and how much fun it was to experience Paris with him.

It took me a while to realise that I couldn't find any of the beautiful places in Montmartre that I had seen in 2005 because they no longer exist. I've been a little bit disappointed by the whole thing. Perhaps I was naive back then as I was a teenager on a school trip or perhaps it really has changed...Anyhow, the people are shady in certain areas and the place is riddled with beggars, \"salesmen\" and fraudulent \"games\". There's a game that my partner and I fell victim to which involves slight of hand and also trickery. It is a rigged game. I won't get into the specifics but Wikipedia or google \"shell game\". Anyway, basically please do not get close to anyone, do not engage with strangers no matter how friendly they look and absolutely trust no one. Keep your wits about you. Mind your belongings and make sure you know where they are at all times. Montmatre is simply not that romantic place that it is in our heads. Sacr\u00e9 Coeur is beautiful and I recommend going up the back way - it feels much safer and you don't get harassed at all. Although going up the stairs is pretty impressive I think you only have to read other reviews to know that it's just not worth it.Moulin rouge is underwhelming and the area it is in is truly offensive and dangerous. Particularly the street it is on.The must see's are Sacr\u00e9 couer (the safe way), place du tertre (real painters and artists who want to paint you not just for money but because they genuinely love what they do and are talented). Other than that, it's just a tad shady to really recommend much else."

All this while, Montmartre kept nagging me, I was determined to visit this outer district and discover for my self what here charms millions of travelers every year. So on the last day we set out for the Anvers Mtero station, coming out you can see a bustling street called Rue de Steinkerque, leading up to the funicular going up to the Basilica of the Sacre Coeur. On the way you will find souvenir shops, street artists, musicians, carousels, fast food shops and the time just flies.At the top of the hill, we had a hard time deciding which way to face. The Basilica with its lovely dome and steps full of artists and tourists bewitches you. But behind you is the most spectacular view of Paris, one that rivals the Eiffel tower. After clicking a lot of pics, we moved to the next metro stop called Pigalle. The walk from Pigalle to Blanche is amusing as this is the red light district of Paris. We did it for the experience and had our share of laughs, gasps and cat calls. Moulin Rouge is close by if you are in to that sort of entertainment. Overall, an afternoon well spent."

Our backs got a little wet as we ate lunch in the big square (we were at the edge of the tent), and all of the smoking is unpleasant, but it's pretty much impossible to get away from the smoking anywhere in Europe.

Accomodation was significantly cheaper in Montmarte, which we appreciated, but I actually enjoyed staying here more than in busy central paris. A village like atmosphere, with lovely local parks, good food, and the beautiful Sacre Couer on the hill, it was totally idyllic. We also got very fit with the many stairs and hills in this area - which was a bonus for us however if mobility is an issue, or if you have young children I wouldn't recommend staying in this area due to this, but for everyone else, it is a perfect Paris experience."

The Moulin Rouge is located in Montmartre on one of Paris' seediest streets, lined with every kind of sex shop imaginable as well as numerous sex show houses. This is the red light district, to be avoided except maybe for the curious, who can safely take in the scene from the walkway along the street's center island. I must say that our favorite place for ribs in Paris is located directly across from the Moulin Rouge. This is the area served by the Pigalle metro station. To avoid this part of Montmartre, take the train one more stop, to Abbesses, and you will be rewarded with one of Paris' most delightful and spectacular areas. It has everything; steep winding streets lined with picturesque shops and restaurants, pretty churches, and the wonderful Butte Montmartre, with it's panoramic view of the city high on a hill topped with the iconic Sacre Cour Church. You can walk to the top or take the funicular for one metro ticket. It is on top where you will find Paris' foremost artist community, mostly evident in a square teeming with tourists and where the artists will gladly sketch your portrait, for a fee, of course. The same small square is shared by a dozen or so restaurants of varying quality. Overall, Montmartre is a varied and interesting part of Paris and should not be missed."

The area we stayed in was very safe, however, looking at some reviews, there are some areas that are less desireable and use common sense when it comes to tourist areas like Moulin Rouge and Sacre Coeur as con artists and pickpockets may be present. There are several metro stations and buses in the area so map your route of things you want to see and pick the best station. Abbesses takes you right to the bottom of Sacre Coeur and you can head to Moulin Rouge or Sacre Coeur depending on which way you go. Be forewarned though, if you take the steps in this station, be ready for a long climb. There is an elevator that will take you up. Since you will be climbing up to Sacre Couer, might save you from some sore calves. Spend a day here or better yet, stay here and walk in the footsteps of the artists from many moons ago."

As others have said once you leave the busy and vibrant,colourful area directly around the Basillica the streets become less crowded and you can see how old they are. I was amused to see better quality shops tucked in amongst less salubrious ones.

Here are schools and kindergartens, play areas, the remaining two of forty windmills, a tiny vineyard, St. Peter's church consecrated in 1147, the statue of the beheaded Patron Saint-Denis and the oldest street which dates from when it was a farming area. The varied housing shows the varied social mix in the area. You will also recognize streets and buildings painted by famous artists in the past."

This is one these places where you wish there would be no tourists; and then you realise you are one of them, and if there were none it would probably mean it is not worth a visit, etc... As a result, it is just a must when you are in Paris; however I would suggest you wander away in any direction from the heaving center, and you are likely to discover gems of authenticity and current Paris."

Alas, while we found many charming shops and cafes, we never spotted the artists we'd heard so much about. Ended up jumping on the little train to see if that would steer us in the right direction - and learned if we'd only walked around the SIDE of Sacre Coeur, they were there all along.Again, we never felt accosted and found some lovely original watercolors to take home. One peddler did try the bracelet scam, but a stern NO was all it took to get rid of him.Best shopping for us was at a ceramic studio on the top of the hill.

Worth the visit for the view and how most people think of Paris.

There was also a group offering \"free hugs\" but they didn't bother individuals passing by. Be aware though, this is an extremely busy place (we were there on a Saturday) with the crowds so thick that it was hard to move or get close to the artists' stands. The Sacred Heart church was also packed, not to sit down, but people shuffled around the perimeter of the inside clockwise and then as a pack shuffled out. The steps were also very crowded, but it was a gorgeous day and I can inderstand why everyone was out...it's been cold and rainy and a beautiful day is cause for celebration. Montmartre is definitely worth a visit. We took the funiculaire up the mountain, for which you need a regular metro ticket. Also, should you arrive at the Abbesses metro stop, take the elevator up to the top, otherwise you will be climbing and climbing and climbing a lot of stairs!"

I would recommend downloading a tour or taking an organized tour to get the most out of your walk - it's nice to know a little bit about the history of what you are seeing. We used the TA City Guide app to locate a cafe for lunch (we chose Le Consulat - nice people, good food). The only time we hit crowds was at the Basilica and the Place du Tertre - other than that, we had a lovely relaxing walk around this picturesque neighborhood! Note - We did finish our tour at the Moulin Rouge as some of our party wanted to see the famous landmark - those of you with children need to know that this area is one sex shop after the other with graphic items on display. My almost-18-year-old daughter was rather surprised and proceeded to tell her friends about it later - those of you with small children might want to avoid this area or be prepared to answer a lot of potentially uncomfortable questions."

The Eiffel Tower in the evening is stunning.Of course the area has it's share of tourist shops and catering for all restaurants, but where does not?A sunday morning in the area was full of locals shopping, patronizing cafes and it really felt like a community with atmosphere. A stroll down Rue des Abbesses, Rue Lepic and the surrounding streets was a treat.Much has been said on TP regarding hawkers, pickpockets and scam/con artists. As with any major city, be sensible: keep your wallet/valuables in an inside pocket, bags strapped acorss your body, be observant and just be assertive when dealing with any unsavory characters.

Tree lined streets with Paris boutiques and cafe's is just wonderful. Duringt he ascent to the top of the hill you take in the numerous stair cases that provide access to many levels of this picturesque town. We took the \"Petit Train\" ride back down the hill to Pigalle (about EUR 5.00 per head but well worth it) where we hopped off and walked the main strip. This is also home to Moulin Rouge but beware as the strip is full of strip places and adult stores (probably not good for the kids!).

The area is full of hustlers, from some dude wanting to perform a magic trick by tying string on your finger ( when we refused the one actually grabbed my husbands arm) .. to the artists..who want to draw your portrait but refuse to give you the cost before hand , but tell you that you are under no obligation to buy ...yeah right!!!!!! the restaurants were dirty and cramped ... do not waste your time !!!!!!"

My sister and I ended up having our caricatures done by a smooth talking artist. 2 of us in a drawing for 40Euros, seemed like a bargain until we realized the chap next to him was doing 2 for 25Euros.

I had 5 days in Paris; the first 2 I spent travelling from Spain and on \u2018must-see\u2019 touristy attractions \u2013 the Eiffel tower, the Louvre museum, the shopping areas of Galeries Lafayette and Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, and then the remaining 3 exploring neighbourhoods. I was ready to agree that the City of Lights is indeed overrated at the end of our 2nd day; but the charm of Montmartre and the Latin Quarter (in another review) changed that. Where we stayed & how we travelled aroundWe rented a studio apartment on Rue Bobillot in the Gobelins neighbourhood (13th arrondisement), a suburb that\u2019s about half an hour away from the city. There are 2 metro stops near where we stayed \u2013 Place d\u2019Italie and Tolbiac. We bought a 3-day Paris Visite (about 20-plus Euro) pass that lets us shuttle between metro, busses and trains, primarily using the metro to travel. Metro rides are something that I enjoyed too in Paris, as it\u2019s really easy and kind of fun to navigate around and you get to your destination fast! I recommend getting this pass if you\u2019re planning to explore Paris on your own.Montmartre!Stopping at Chateau Rouge metro stop, we were at first taken aback by how crowded it was. But I guess, the trick when you\u2019re travelling independently is to walk on like you know where you\u2019re going (even if you don\u2019t, like we didn\u2019t most of the time!). We wandered for a bit, consulted our maps discreetly, and ventured into little shops selling unique souvenirs, before finding our way up to the Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur Basilica. This is the summit of Montmartre. As you can see from the picture, it is a vivacious neighbourhood bustling with activities! Walking down and about, the street curvatures lined with caf\u00e9s and shops, I suddenly remembered that Montmartre is where the caf\u00e9 featured in the French film Amelie is located! Map in hand and with the aid of Google on smart-phone, we traversed more curvatures, passing through Place du Tertre \u2013 a popular square with artists, asking shopkeepers for directions, walking down quieter residential lanes, to locate Rue de Lepic. It was a long walk down! We finally arrived at Caf\u00e9 des Deux Moulins, where we enjoyed a nice dinner of Roast Chicken with Tarragon Sauce and Baby Potatoes each and shared a Cr\u00e8me Brulee! The food is good and the service staff friendly. After dinner, we walked further down to the nearest metro stop, Blanche. And there, diagonally across this metro stop is the infamous Moulin Rouge. We didn\u2019t plan on finding it, we chanced upon it! I reckon this stretch is the sleazy area (what with \u2018SEX\u2019, \u2018GIRLS\u2019 and more \u2018SEX\u2019 plastered on window shops everywhere I turn to!) and so after a few shots of the Moulin Rouge, we made off. Blanche is your stop if you\u2019d like to visit the Moulin Rouge and/or head up to the Caf\u00e9 des Deux Moulins the shorter way.This was how we spent our 3rd day in Paris and this was when I started falling for the Parisian charm. One day, I will go back to explore more Parisian neighbourhoods."

Between these two churches one finds a huge number of street artists asking to portrait you - I had no time but if you're interested, it takes a few mins a its not very expensive.The artistry aspect of the visit continues with the french singing lady in front of St. Pierre church leading to Place du Tetre where you can enjoy several artists selling their work and working on one of their peices in front of you. Once there you can several restaurants which offer french cuisine.Views from Montmatre are generally speaking nice but not outstanding. I would not personally visit the area for the views but rather more for the aspects I just mentioned. I would definitely recomend a visit here given it offers something that the rest of Paris (and many other cities) do not!"

If you need to do souvenir shopping, there are many places to buy nice gifts including prints and paintings (I found some for 1 euro each). When I think back on my trip, my time in Monmartre is one of my most fond memories.A word to the wise, there are pickpockets and people that try to do the bracelet scam.

Once you get over the tacky street by the Moulin Rouge (lots of sex shops which we chuckled at) and climb Rue Lepic up and round towards the Sacre Couer, you discover a different part of Paris. There's more character up in Monmartre, more variety in shops (although lots touristy) more variety of cafes, bistros, patisseries, boulangeries, etc, lots of stairs to climb but the view is worth it - and the Sacre Couer is beautiful. We found visiting this area in the evening our favourite, at night it's just as popular. Cute cobbled windy streets and lamposts line the way. The Sacre Coeur is open to go in, and the artists square is lovely. I did note some of the prices... Ouch... But who can put a price on art??The view of Paris is good but limited view of the Eiffel Tower (can only be seen from a certain point which got busy). If you want a better view the Montparnasse Tower can give you that.The downside of this area is the amount of beggars outside Sacre Couer. It's sad to see. At the bottom of the lift there were also a bunch of men who were extremely pushy in selling us something, and started physically pulling my boyfriend to one side to get him to buy. They're hard people to shake off so be wary. Rose sellers also v annoying!!! Didn't see any pickpocketing but just be careful as you would be any place that's busy. Overall this area was our favourite. We enjoyed the challenging hill climb, people watching, little bistros, shops and overall ambience of the area. Tres Paris!!"

As the cost of most restaurants etc for NYE in Paris was very high and also many restaurants are closed we purchased a picnic and went up to the Sacre Cour in Montmartre. Unfortunately it was raining and windy so the beautiful service inside the church was a welcome surprise and shelter from the weather. It was extremely crowded but we did manage to find a space to look over the city. The view is beautiful. Unfortunately it is a \"pickpockets\" dream so be very careful that you keep hold of your wallets, phones. There were two incidents right by us and understandably some very upset people. These items were actually in their pockets and being lifted and handed on straight away so difficult to pin down the culprits. What was a great shame is there was not a main firework display. I had read several reviews before going and it was a mixed bag, some saying there are and others saying not. We could see a few in the distance but certainly no main one was visible. The Eiffel Tower was lit with beautiful gold and silver at midnight and as the law allows anyone can let off fireworks wherever they stand! I am sure in better weather it would have been more enjoyable but perhaps worth booking a meal in a restaurant nearby beforehand so at least you can sit in the warm until the magic hour."

We did a walking tour, and without a guide would have missed details such as the apartment that Van Gogh lived in or the studio were Toulouse and other artists worked. Make sure you are physically able to handle the winding cobblestone roads and the hilly terrain. You will want to reach Sacre Coeur located at the highest peak of Paris.

To me, there are three separate components that make this place special.First is the Sacre Coeur Cathedral, which is simply amazing. The architecture and interior design are spectacular. It is definitely worth spending 30 minutes walking through.Next is the artist village and area atop the \"mount\" where you see how Paris likely looked even 80 years ago. The artist square has legit (and illegit) artists drawing personal and scene scapes. It's fun to watch them in action. The area is also nice to walk around. You can see some sights, like Toulouse Le'Trec's house and other features, as well as just stroll around a fun, vibrant series of streets.Lastly, is the area further down the mount, which is a bustling part of Paris. Lots of evening activity (including the famous moulin rouge) and shopping areas. This area is a bit \"fringe\" much like the east village was in New York City up to 10 years ago. Not all streets are nice and some seem a bit shady. But overall, it is a rich area with lots to see and do. There are also some excellent restaurants around here, including La Balancoire and Marguerite.Definitely carve out a few hours to spend time at Montmartre, ideally during the day but maybe also into the early evening."

Montmartre can be intimidating since it's far from central Paris, requires a metro ride; and once you are on the hills, the streets are twisty, narrow, confusing, and littered with scam artists. However, a visit to Paris wouldn't be complete without exploring Montmartre--a realm all its own, with art at its very soul. Everywhere you look, you will find art of all sorts and a charming atmosphere that can simply not be compared with any other spot on the planet. Just arrive prepared for climbing stairs, spotting scammers, and getting a little lost.When at Montmartre, visit Sacre Coeur, Saint Pierre, Place du Tertre, Dali Museum and the Moulins. Sacre Couer\u2019s pure whiteness and delicate lace-like details are gorgeous miles away but better up-close; the interior pales in comparison to its exterior, but do pop in for a look. There's no entrance fee unless you visit the crypt or climb the dome. When finished visiting Sacre Couer, you might wander the top of the hill and enter nearby, much older Sainte Pierre church which is built on an ancient Roman temple to Mars (Montmartre is originally named after the Mount of Mars). Also nearby is Place du Tertre which is full of the artist stands and cafes that we often expect of Montmartre\u2014charming although touristy. If you have time, visit the Dali Museum off Place du Tertre. You might want to wander then to find the last of the still-producing vineyards in Paris and the moulins (windmills) of Montmartre\u2014Moulins de la Galette is on Rue Lepic and the more famous Moulin Rouge is beneath the hills of Montmartre, steps from the Blanche Metro stop.TIP: If you aren\u2019t fond of climbing, then you can take the little tram that runs up the side of the stairs in front of Sacre Couer to access the church and the top of Montmartre. Also, you could always approach Montmartre from its backside. Get off at the Lamarck Metro stop rather than the more popular Abbesses stop. (Beware of Abbesses station since the climb out of the station is a HUGE trek, alone!) Take Lamarck Street until you see the back of Sacre Couer. You will climb a relatively short set of stairs, past a hidden Montmartre park. This approach is not only less crowded and less demanding on the legs, but it is also beautiful."

I'm sure most of the artists are honest and straightforward but this is what happened to me today. Just be aware of this \"angle\".Valentino the 2nd - that's what he calls himself - tells me that for two it will cost 140E but for one 80E. That's the catch. We begin here: I show him two photos: one of four people, one of two people. We agree the one of four isn't clear enough - the one of the two people is better. He then says \"you want two for 140E or one for 80E?\" I say \"well, we agreed that you'd do the one photo - 80E\". Okay - agreed. I come back two hours later.I go to hand Valentino the 2nd 80E and PRESTO! Voila! He says it's 140E. I say that's not what we agreed on and he takes out his little menu again and it says beside 80E \"personne\" meaning person. He argues that it costs 80E a face! I walk away - he's left with the sketch - which was quite good. After 40 minutes, I return and fall prey to the same scam anyone else would: how many times will you be in Paris? I pay and I go over to another artist. She sketches me for 50E.Be clear - VERY clear what you're paying for. I think this is a regular and routine scam and well - it didn't ruin my visit because I have the joy of spreading this trick to all of you - and this trickster's name. I doubt he'll be suing me under international law and I'll not be suing him in Parisien Artist's court!"

I should have posted this review sooner but when something unpleasant happens you try to put it out of your mind, don\u2019t you? On this trip we did the requisite trip to Sacre Coeur because the day was clear and we knew the view would be spectacular. I started the walk up to the church ahead of my companions who were taking pictures. There were men selling Eiffel Tower key chains (5 for 1 euro). Having just pushed past the gauntlet of key chain sellers I was unprepared for the next falanx of petitioners with their sign up sheets and wailing \u2018for the blind and deaf madame\u2019. I could not move so could not avoid looking too long at the sheets - which I slowly perceived were rubbish - scribbles for names, no place for full addresses and - hidden by a thumb, a place to commit to a subscription of 10 euros. I finally pushed my way through. One companion, pointing out a site with her arm outstretched, found herself enwrapped by a string bracelet seller who demanded \u201c10 - ok 2 euros madame\u201d. Furious, she complied. Our other companion, happily and unconcerned carrying a two year old on his shoulders, found himself being patted down by a multitude of hands while the petitioners shoved their forms at him.I don\u2019t like to advertise products, but when things work the way they are supposed to, I think it\u2019s a good time to pass that message along.One of us had read Rick Steeves thoroughly so recognized the petitioners for what they were. Tilley clothes with velcro pockets, Merrill jackets with zipper pockets, Mountain Equipment Coop jackets with zippers and velcro everywhere and Baggelini purses that rest at the front with a multitude of zippers all work as they are supposed to.We needed all of that and luck. We were shaken by the experience, but the rest of our trip has been as lovely and joyful as this happy traveler could possibly wish."

Our main two attractions in this area were Sacre Coeur and The Museum of Salvador Dali. We worked our way up to the hill with the Funicular, which was a lovely experience. You'll face the annoying street vendors even before you enter the Funicular, and you'll meet a whole lot more when you get out from it at the top of the hill, below Sacre Coeur. We didn't show any interest to them, and passed them quickly, so they didn't really bother us. However, if it wasn't for the annoyance of the street vendors and their scams, I would rate this as an excellent attraction.Anyway, the views from the top of the Funicular are wonderful. Sacre Coeur is magnificient close-up. Pictures are not allowed inside it, which is understandable. Montmartre area is full of lovely, little streets. We walked through few of them on our way to Salvador Dali. On our way there, we passed the central square of art, where the artists are drawing and painting their works. It looked pretty artsy there.The street leading to Salvador Dali's Museum is beautiful. The Museum itself is amazing. I'm a huge fan of Dali. Thus, it meant a lot to me to see this place. Working our way down from the hillside was nice, going down a whole lot of stairs. We eventually came down to Moulin Rouge from our Montmartre trip.The area has lots of nice little cafes. Step inside one of them and have Crepes. We did, and enjoyed them a lot."

The small streets play host to many artists (yes, many want to sell you a painting or paint your portrait), charming and reasonably priced restaurants and shopping opportunities aplenty. Even now, it is easy to see why artists flocked there to spark creativity. A long walk from the Sacre-Coeur down through Montmartre is wonderful and offers a lot of history as well as you can still see many former residences of great artists like Van Gogh and Toulouse Lautrec. This is certainly a must do for any visitor to Paris who hasn't gone before or anyone enjoying a romantic getaway. Beware of scam artists and pickpockets near the metro entrance and at the Sacre-Coeur."

We followed the Frommer's Walking Streeting recommendation which took us about 2.5 hours bringing us to all the nooks and crevices of Montmartre. There were quaint little arts and craft shops, dotted with many souvenir nic-nac shops and artists soliciting for individual sketches of tourist. The highlight was the scenic landscape of Paris in front of Sacre-Coeur Basilica, the view was magnifique! As you wind down the streets, surprisingly you will pass by a vineyard which was grown out of nowhere on a small piece of land in between many Parisian-style houses. The hilly residential area will sometimes reveal beautiful street corners of houses overhang with evergreen groves and tiny little parks for rest. As we wind down the street, we also pass by the apartment that Vincent Van Gogh and his brother used to stay before stopping at one of the cafes for lunch and ending our walk at the huge Windmill ---- Moulin Rouge. Late summer with its cool weather is the best time for such a walk."

Take the funicular up to Basilique du Sacr\u00e9-Coeur. In front, you'll get a chance to see artists performing some unique acts, sing and the likes...Sit on the stairs and be a part of the show while simultaneously enjoying a spectacular view of Paris! It really is breathtaking. I enjoyed it more than being at the Eiffel Tower.Don't just limit your visit to Sacr\u00e9-Coeur. Go around the baslilica, into the winding streets and soak in, the atmosphere. Blessed are those who live there. The houses are beautiful, painted in pastel colors...It's just amazing!

It is 130 metres high and gives its name to the surrounding district, in the 18th arrondissement, a part of the Right Bank. Montmartre is primarily known for the white-domed Basilica of the Sacr\u00e9 C\u0153ur on its summit and as a nightclub district. The other, older, church on the hill is Saint Pierre de Montmartre, which claims to be the location at which the Jesuit order of priests was founded. Many artists had studios or worked around the community of Montmartre such as Salvador Dal\u00ed, Amedeo Modigliani, Claude Monet, Piet Mondrian, Pablo Picasso and Vincent van Gogh. Montmartre is also the setting for several hit films. This site is served by metro line 2 stations of Anvers, Pigalle and Blanche and the line 12 stations of Pigalle, Abbesses, Lamarck - Caulaincourt and Jules Joffrin.Montmartre big area in Paris in good location for eat cakesand drink coffee.excellent night life if you are looking for nightlife."

We went on a Free Walking Tour which meets here as there is only one exit from Blanche metro. Grab a coffee, not Starbucks, try a French one and head up the hill. Take your time to explore the side streets. The Free walking Tour took 90 minutes at stop start slow pace with an excellent guide on the way. We had kids (3,9 and 12) with us and they enjoyed walk. At top enjoy the view. We went to main square and enjoyed a wonderful, reasonably priced, lunch. For 60 euro we had the 3 kids drawn by one of the many artist in the square. Small hint, watch them draw for 5 min before you choose who is going to draw. Very touristy but still a wonderful experience. 3 year old feel asleep while being drawn and we had to hold his head up, most amusing. A nice slow trip down the hill with an ice cream topped off an excellent day. There is a cable car but walk is nice"

Shortly, we hit the funicular on the left and rode up the hill. Once on top, we took a right directly to the beautiful Sacre-Coeur Basiliaca. After viewing both the cathedral interior and the immense panorama of Paris below from it's steps, we walked the small alley toward the Place de Tertre where artists abound much like in the days of Van Gough, Gaughan and many others who lived in this virtual artist colony. We stopped for lunch inside one of the cafes rather than under the canopies on the square since the weather was nippy but still could view the activities on the square.After browsing the area along Rue Norvins and others, we headed down Rue Ravignon, bobbing and weaving down the hill past the Jean-Baptiste Clement House, the patio at TimHotel, the St Jean-de-Montmarte cathedral, and other interesting attractions. We ended up on Boulevard de Clinchy at a cafe sipping coffee across from the Pigalle metro station before our return to the hotel.We both thoroughly enjoyed our wandering through this historic, Bohemian area of artists and cafes with the fabulous views of Paris. There is no doubt that we will return to Montmarte again."

We only had 7 days in Paris but ended up going to Montmartre twice - that is how much we enjoyed it. The first time we went was a nice sunny day. We took Line 2 on the Metro to the Abbesses stop and walked from there to the Funiculaire, which takes you up the steep hill to the base of the Basilisque du Sacre Coeur. The view from the grounds of the church is incredible, one of the best in Paris. We also took pictures of the church but did not enter that day as it was very busy. Just beware of the many \"vendors\" on the steps up to the church that will try to sell you cheap trinkets/knockoff purses/pieces of thread to tie to your wrist. Don't even say anything, just walk by them.After seeing the grounds of the church, my husband and I went wandering in search of Place du Tertre, which is a famous area in Montmartre for street artists and performers. It was amazing! The streets are all cobblestone (so beautiful!) and full of old buildings. Although there are many touristy souvenir shops and galleries in the area closest to Sacre-Coeur, if you keep walking past that area there are more unique shops and restaurants. Some that stick out in particular are La Galette des Moulins (patisserie with the most amazing strawberry tarts and eclairs I've ever had), La Biscuiterie de Montmartre (amazing macarons and biscuits), and Galerie D'Art (handmade pottery store). The two sweet shops are located on Rue Norvins and the pottery store is located on Rue des Saules. It is so worth the time to spend your day wandering the streets and immersing yourself in the area that famous artists such as Van Gogh, Toulouse-Lautrec, Renoir, Dali etc. lived and worked. My husband and I both agreed that Montmartre most closely matched our romanticized idea of what Paris would be like. Not sure if this matters to anyone, but we were surprised to find that so many people in Montmartre spoke English so well, as it seemed to be the least touristy area we went to.After spending the afternoon there, we headed far down Rue Lepic (where Van Gogh used to live!) and towards Rue de Clichy, where the Moulin Rouge is. It was something I have always wanted to see but it honestly wasn't worth the long walk - it's in Pigalle, which is the area below the Butte Montmartre. Very seedy and sketchy neighbourhood filled with sex shops and strip clubs. Whatever magic it may have had in its heyday it has lost now. I think this must be the area that people in these reveiws are discussing when they say they didn't like Montmartre. As long as you avoid this area (unless you're desperate to see Moulin Rouge) then I don't see what's not to love about Montmartre!The second day we went up there, we actually walked up the steps to Montmartre instead of taking the Funiculaire. They were made famous by a Hungarian photographer who took an amazing picture of them. We also got the chance to walk around the grounds of Sacre-Coeur without being bothered by vendors, as it was pouring rain and I guess they decided not to be out in it. We also got the opportunity to go inside Sacre-Coeur this time and it was beautiful. We spent the day wandering through the cobblestone streets in the rain and loved every minute of it - one of the most romantic days of my life.If we were to ever go to Paris again, we would stay in Montmartre. It was truly incredible and I recommend taking at least a day or two to head up there and experience it for yourself!"

And if you're looking for a taste of that bohemian atmosphere, it's pretty much been replaced with souvenir shops and street vendors.TIP: if you want cheaper souvenirs, walk down the street toward the Moulin Rouge. It's maybe a 10 minute walk and the souvenirs get cheaper the further you go down the street.Also, many Parisians told me to watch my pockets in Montmartre, so please do the same. It can get crowded and some of the street vendors here are quite bold.

The beautiful Basilique du Sacre Coeur and Eglise St. Pierre nearby. The many reminders of great artists who lived and died here -- where they lived, worked, loved, drank, laughed and died. Many are buried at the Cimetiere du Montmartre.The narrow, winding cobblestone streets, and numerous steps leading you up and down the Butte. The squares and gardens and windmills and museums and vineyards, scattered hither and tither.The cabarets , grand ( Moulin Rouge ) , old ( Lapin Agile ) and otherwise. Place Pigalle and the surrounding district. Place Blanche which reminds one of Amelie. Place des Abbesses with its charming square , Belle Epoque Metro station and Carrousel.The tempting artisanal boulangeries , award winning patisseries , boucheries and fromageries and eateries of all types -- you will be spoiled for choice.It's all there and its genuine.

It would be a great place to go with your lover. You could sit up there and kiss. Then walk arm and arm down the cobble stone street. The Eiffle tower sparkling through the grape vines on the wrought Iron fence. I think it is my favorite spot in Paris. Montmartre is the place I try to go every day or night when I am there. There was also a health food store across from Van Goghs place , that had the best Wheat Free baguettes . So you do not have to miss out if you are on a wheat free diet."

Go ahead and hike up all of those steps to Sacre Coeur if you can make it to see the basilica. Great views atop the city. The only other spot for views like this is the L'Tour Eiffel. Walk around the surrounding streets to Sacre Coeur. You will find small gardens to walk in and great places to stop for a snack. We got here in the afternoon and really enjoyed ourselves. **Watch out for performers or shady people on the big steps. I thought my mom had held on to my arm while walking up, it was about 10 seconds later I realized it was a man in a mask sneaking around holding on to me."

The little shops were full of tempting goodies, vintage clothes, covetable bags and shoes, amazing lamp shades and home accessories. After the grandeur of the Louvre, the splendour of the Champs Elysees this was paris on small town scale. It was all the books I'd read brought to life. Go, enjoy."

There's a choice of routes to the top from the tube.. take the street on the left, and theres a meandering series of steps through the fairground or the 'fennicular (?) steep train thing. The right hand street leads to about a million steps and a few kebab shops. Go left and follow the crowd!The view is a big part of the attraction. It must have been used in a thousand films, and explains why this place is so busy at sunset. Then there's the courtyard which has local artists queing up to paint your picture, either normally or as a charicature. Loads of Restaurants and pavement cafes all doing pretty much the same thing. Like many places though, being there is fine, but it's when you look back you realise how nice a place is. We'd never go to Paris again without visiting Montmarte and would recommend you do too.If you're reading this review because you've been there and are using other peoples views to reminiss (we all do) watch the film 'Amelie' if you haven't already."

This time when I was there, there was a musician playing harp making the whole visit more perfect! If you have the time & energy I suggest you to climb up the dome.

Rue St. Vincent immortalized by the Yves Montand song - I wandered around the St Vincent cemetery enchanted by the elaborate memorials. We ate our lunch in the front garden of the oldest cabaret in Montmartre - the Lapin Agile (we did not know this at the time - we just thought it was a lovely little house with an open front garden). Rested on a bench in a divine little park with a memorial to A Steinlen (the Le Chat Noir artist). There is something exciting and relevant at every turn. All presided over by the ever-present Sacre Coeur basilica which seems to spring into view at the most unexpected moments. If I ever return to Paris, this will be my first stop."

He had many happy memories of his previous visit there, many years ago. When we arrived, the area seemed rather tacky. We took the funicular, which is not really necessary as the walk is quite short up the steep hill. Sacre Coer was very beautiful and the view over Paris breathtaking if not a little overwhelming with its sea of buildings seemingly going on forever and with so little green. But a spectacular sight. When we got to the little square where the artists used to be, we found that it was largely occupied by a group of eateries that had been set up there in a makeshift camp for the summer and the artists were crowding on the pavement and the little space left for them. The eateries looked very unappealing, dirty and depressing, with few patrons. And such a pity that this area had been taken over by the eateries when it was famous for the art and artists it used to be known for. It all had a tawdry mass touristic atmosphere that was disappointing and very off-putting. Walking back down from Montmartre to the metro we were unimpressed by the dirt and decay all around us despite some picturesque little houses and flats. It all appeared very seedy and all we wanted to do was leave. What a shame for what should be one of Paris' attractions. I would not recommend it to anyone. It was our only disappointment in Paris."

Montmarte is a great place from which to glimpse views of the city, but the views are not more spectacular than those you get on top of the Eiffel tower, and it is quite a bit out of the way for most tourists. There is a great map of Montmarte that you can get for free in the airport tourist information center which points out the attractions of the quaint, cobbled streets around this part of the city. They include an outdoor city square filled with artists selling their paintings, two windmills, a museum dedicated to Dali, and, perhaps, most famously after the Sacre Coeur church, the Moulin Rouge cabaret. Don't bother with the little car that takes you up a bit of the mountain to the view; you can easily take a train that gets you closer to the church and views without paying for the funicular. A caveat: The neighborhood is not very nice. It seems rather overrun with indigent people trying to sell things or beg, and though the absolute center of the area is filled with tourists and feels very safe, some stations near the area don't feel safe. Bathrooms are at the foot of the Sacre Coeur church. They are clean and free, but the people who clean them request donations at the end."

Sacre-Coeur is such a beautiful place and it was nice to take a few minutes and reflect on our trip while inside. We walked along the side street and found a great place for dinner. We loved the hustle and bustle that was missing from our side of the city. Surprisingly, we did not feel any more unsafe than we had in any other part of the city. The cobbled stone streets, cafes, and storefronts are truly the epitome of Paris to me. I do hope there will be a movement to clean up the area and perhaps eliminate the vendors hawking flying plastic birds, glow sticks, and the like in front of Sacre-Coeur. It cheapens the experience as it is a distraction. Like anywhere else you will travel, be aware of your surroundings and trust your instincts. This is a great place to visit, perhaps pick and choose the time of day you go. I stayed off the Barbes metro stop when I was in college and know this area feels rougher than most.

Restaurants in the area are still good and plenty to choose from but rundown. Choose carefully and watch your bags"

I spent 4 days in Paris and this is my favourite part of the City.I consider this to be the 'real' Paris or at least how I imagined it - narrow cobbled stoned roads, lined by beautiful buildings with shutters and people cycling in the street.Wondering the streets and exploring by foot is great - the lonely planet has a nice walking route that I followed which took in the main sights - Moulin Rouge, the cafe from Amelie and Sacre Coeur, among many other things.There is also some cheap, delicious food from the local pattisseries and boucheries, as well as some touristy shops to get cheap souvenies and postcards etc.Sacre Coeur itself is an amazing building - a sight to behold on top of the monmartre mound. A tour inside is free and to get views from the top costs around \u20ac10 (I didn't do it as I had been the top of 3 other buildings and am a student running out of money! ha). But the views just from in front of the cathedral are still fantastic as you are quite high up. There is also a lovely garden/park leading down to the town, where you can enjoy a relaxing moment eating lunch etc. The only pain are the gypsies who hassle you to buy there goods."

Don't miss the Sacre-Couer and the spectacular views. There are a number of good places to eat away from the busy tourist shops. The prices in the souvenir shops vary significantly, shop around before buying if you have the time. Avoid the art shops with the mass produced paintings, instead shop the artists in the square, however this quality varies significantly as well. Be prepared to spend some money if you wish to take home an original painting. A few of the artists are quite good, expect 100 Euros for a small painting of excellent quality, 40 Euros plus for a small piece of good quality art. There are multiple portrait artists in the square as well, avoid the ones walking the street. Restrooms are scarce, plan to visit a cafe to enjoy a beverage and use the WC. Explore the side streets, many beautiful spots, just wish there wasn't any graffiti. Avoid Pigalle and beware of the red-light district. It is noted as harmless but it is unpleasant when walking with your family."

This is the higher part of Paris (aka Butte Montmartre) where you can find the area with the painters (Place Du Tertre) and the Sacre Coeur basilic delivering a wonderful view on Paris. It\u2019s an excellent spot for makings photos or camcorder recordings. I always love to stroll and have a look on all those artists (perhaps you meet the imitations of Popeye and Napoleon) and painters, this is Paris at its best if you have a creative mind! Unfortunately it\u2019s also very crowded, especially the many busses with Japanese tourists are infamous\u2026But I don\u2019t mind and focus on the fact that in the 19th century the Montmartre was the place where famous painters like Van Gogh (go to the Rue Lepic where he lived), Degas and Monet once roamed. If you keep that in mind, you will even more enjoy this area. Recommended: take the subway to Montmartre very early on a clear day and go to the top of the stairway of the Sacre Coeur, what an awesome view on Paris waking up!"

The famous vineyard where very expensive bottles of wine are produced, not so much for the content as much for the artists who paint the labels.

You can easily visit Montmartre via metro and the funicular, but don't try to walk all the way up unless you are in top cardiac condition. Walk around and inhale the artsy atmosphere, home to artists for over 125 years from when it was just a village on the outskirts of Paris. Now it is fully integrated into the city, but still seems many miles away in it's attitude. Watch the artists at work in Place Tertre, the main square. But for a good, reasonably priced meal wander away from Tertre. Don't miss the working vineyard on the backside of the hill and marvel that such valuable real estate, surrounded by yuppie-ish gentrafication is still used for this purpose many decades after all other agricultural uses have vanished from here. Do visit the Montmartre Museum, an interesting surprise. When you are through with your visit, walk down the Rue de Martyrs back into Paris proper--going down is easy."

People run Montmartre down saying it is \"tacky\" \"expensive\" etc. There is nothing tacky about it as far as I can see - it is a great experience and one that should not be missed when you visit Paris. Apart from the Sacr\u00e9 Coeur itself, which is beautiful, the view from around there is amazing, especially at night. You can see the Eiffel Tower from there, and watch the Tower's \"twinkles\" every hour after dark until it closes. Admittedly, it can be noisy around the steps of the Basilica at night, and there are always a lot of tourists about, some of them a bit rowdy, but it is still unmissable.The Place du Tetre is full of caf\u00e9s which may be a little more expensive, but I have never failed to get a good meal there. Beware of some of the street artists though - they can be pushy, and make sure that if you buy from one, it is from one who actually is situated in the Square itself and not just wandering around. Also, before you ask them to draw/paint you, watch them at work to see if you like their style. Don't rely on the examples of their work that they have around them - they have had hours to perfect those! There will only be a few minutes to draw you and you want it to be good. So make sure you are completely happy with them.When planning your visit to Montmartre, avoid weekends if you can, but if you must go then, go early in the day, or late at night when the crowds are less. Above all - enjoy it! Don't expect perfection, Nowhere is perfect but just soak up the atmosphere and remember it for ever! My husband and I adore it and always stay in a hotel nearby so that we can walk up there whenever we want. Bliss!"

But worst of all is the gangs of African immigrants pulling the \"friendship bracelet\" scam (you can read all about it online). They're almost impossible to avoid and extremely annoying. You can take the funicular to the top or climb stairs to reach the basilica, where you are greeted by - you guessed it - more annoying souvenir peddlers. You are granted admission for free but are asked to make a donation to a legitimate charity. The inside of the basilica is spectacular, but again, if you've been to Notre Dame or even St. Paul's in London, it's nothing special.

The place where the streets fold up in the movie Inception (2010) is right here in Montmartre!The place is just incredibly rustic, yet stunningly pretty. However do note that this is sited on a hilly area, and there and many steps around, which could prove inconvenient to the mobility impaired.THE ONE THING that tourists must take note of, is to avoid ALL fly-by-night businesses, or patronise them at their own risks - brick-and-mortar places are alright. I shall not not repeat in detail what criminals are capable of (accosting, harassing, fleecing, pickpocketing, snatching, selling fake goods etc), and thus I recommend visiting in the earlier hours of a day (leave before 2-3pm!), and a weekday rather than a weekend. Because these are the periods when the most tourists groups visit, and also when many of these shady \"businesses\" follow.There are many nice restaurants in the area, but those at the top of the hill near Sacre Coeur are quite expensive. Those nearer to the bottom of the hill would be more inexpensive."

Crowded (not the issue) but with thugs, thieves, and street racketeers EVERYWHERE. We immediately became protective of our items, and the entire neighborhood felt more like a Beirut bazaar than the Montmartre of old. We couldn't WAIT to get out of there...Very sad to see the demise of what was a great neighborhood in Paris for a long time. Unless I read a bunch of reviews saying they've cleaned up the neighborhood (of a LOT of sketchy people, and NOT french) I will not be coming close to Montmartre again. Maybe mid week when no one is out and you can enjoy a nice view from the Sacre Coeur."

You would do well to do some background research on the historical significance of the place before going, in order to get some understanding of what it was then and what is has become now.I appreciate Montmartre for the ground breaking artwork that propelled visual art into the Modern Art arena of the 21st century. It was - at one time - the cheapest run down area in Paris for the poor to live. Hence lots of \"starving artists\": Vincent Van Gogh (Dutch), Salivador Dali (Spanish), Pablo Picasso (Spanish), Modigliani (Italian), etc., had lodgings in this area and the alfresco cabaret (which was at the top of the hill) was a major magnet for the life style seen in the paintings of Renoir.So, to climb the hill and see artists sketching is not surprizing. They're just carrying on the artistic tradition though I doubt they live there since the rents seem extremely high now. Just don't ask any of these \"living\" artists about the dead artists who made this place GREAT!!!! They don't want to hear, especially considering that most of these artists weren't native to France.Personally a search for a good art historically based walking tour through Montmartre would be the icing on the cake topped by the marvelous view --- and the church, of course."

While it is no doubt a place where you want to be aware of your surroundings...like anyplace else..just be smart when traveling anywhere in Paris. I personally think that the peace and beautiful vista one has sitting on the steps leading up to Sacre Couer is, by far, one of the best experiences anyone can have in Paris. If it is a sunny day, then the sun feels amazing as you sit there and gaze down onto the rooftops of the city. If it is a cloudy day with strong cumulus clouds, then count your lucky stars. These clouds will make your pictures extra dramatic and just beautiful. I would recommend that you visit during the week to avoid some of the scammers that you'll see during some of the busier times on weekends.

While you continue to say no and attempt to walk around or through them they will move to surround you, they also grabbed our arms in attempt to stop us from walking by. The police showed up a couple times chasing these thugs out of the area, but it only lasted for a few minutes and then they all reappeared. I saw one young woman, alone, get surrounded and followed up the hill for 20 or 30 meters before they finally left her alone.It was beautiful, but it was also ugly.

I've visited this neighbourhood many times over the past years and I can't help but noticing the decline of this area! This place has turned into a giant tourist trap with people trying to sell you all kinds of worthless items and so-called artists constantly annoying you to draw a picture of you. We tried to escape the madness in a caf\u00e9 at Place du Tertre and paid \u20ac10 for a beer! What a scam! Place du Tertre itself is a nightmare with tourists trying to catch a glimpse of what used to be a nice and artistic little square! I really can't understand how people can enjoy this! This will definitely be my last visit. There are many, many nice places and neighbourhoods to visit in Paris, but Montmartre is no longer one of them!"

Its a beautiful place and the view was nearly as good as from top of the Eiffel tower, as the church is on top of the hill. Climbing the hill through the busy market streets was a fun and an exercise, whcih we thoroughly enjoyed. There are quite a lot of street shows, which we enjoyed as well. But, please be aware that there are set of crooks who try to make as much money as possible by selling some sort of colourful thread (claiming it to be holy!). **Stay away from them**"

Just be careful though because Pigalle at the base of Montmartre is extremely seedy and felt a bit daunting to me. Montmartre itself I didn't have a problem with. The square with the artists is lively and there are some who hassle you to draw your portrait but if you ignore them there are some excellent artists painting anything parisian. They are happy for you to watch them paint without plying for trade. I own two oil paintings bought there which are great and weren't overly expensive.Obviously a must when you are in this area is to visit the Sacre-Coeur. It is a long walk up the steps but must have the greatest view of the Parisian skyline. It is a magnificent Basilica but spoilt somewhat by gypsies trying to sell you their cheap and tacky wares. Nevertheless don't let them put you off visiting the Basilica itself."

For the one and only time, I felt unsafe in Paris. Not what I was expecting.Got away from this section of town fairly quickly and started walking towards Sacre Coeur. The landscape and atmosphere changed for the positive.Many different ways to approach the Basilica - taxi, funicular, bus, small tourist \"train\". I chose to walk. (Street signage not the best; make sure you have a map!) Took awhile winding through the streets and then the grounds itself, but it was lovely. Lots to see. Once at the Basilica, the view was breath taking. Lucky enough to attend a church service and to see the end of a wedding. The nuns singing was yet another bonus.Around the corner at the back of Sacre Coeur was the heart of Montmartre with it's restaurants, artists, galleries (look for Galerie d'art at 11 rue Poulbot) and another hidden gem - a Salvidor Dali Museum - Espace Dali.Rambling through the back streets, also came upon Musee de Montmartre at 12 rue Cortot. It is located in one of the oldest houses in Montmartre. Many artists (e.g. Renoir) have lived in the house. The gardens were beautiful.Definitiely well worth visiting this whole area of Paris.Take your time. Don't rush. Don't limit yourself to the 'known' tourist area/s. Explore. You will be delighted with what you find."

It is worth visiting Sacre Coeur and the artists' square and there are nice city views from the top of the hill. However, be very careful of con artists, especially near sacre couer. There are groups of people who pretend to have a disability and beg for money showing a donation card. Do not fall for this as it is totally fake. They will tell you that they can give you change and when you ask for change they just run off with your cash. It was a group of young girls who were involved."

Of course this is where you will find the Moulin Rouge, along with the accompanying peep shows, sex and DVD shops.

The square if filled with artists displaying their unique types of art. If you want an caricature drawn, it can be done in several mediums. The little shops along the way are small but offer up some unique dining options. It's narrow and winding but worth the time to enjoy. We went twice just to soak up the atmosphere and see the beautiful artwork being created before our eyes. The street preformers add lots of flavor as do the musical preformers. It's just a lovely stroll on the hill with a little culture around every corner."

You start the ascent by either taking the funiculaire or the 260+ steps up the Rue Foyatier, but the view of Paris from the top is definitely worth it. The Basilica of the Sacred Heart cuts an imposing white figure on top of the hill. A few steps from the church is the Place du Tertre and its cafes, street performers, and artists. There is also the Musee de Montmarte (where the painter Maurice Utrillo lived), the house where Toulouse-Lautrec used to live, the Cabaret du Lapine Agile (where Van Gogh, Matisse, Renoir, Degas, Picasso, Modigliani, and Toulouse-Lautrec used to hang out), the Place Dalida -- where you can rest your weary feet before continuing on to Moulin de la Galette, and then the Moulin Rouge at the Pigalle downhill. You can also check out Rue Lepic and its Les Deux Moulins caf\u00e9, made famous by Amelie, and Le Chat Noir.All in all, my Montmarte walk was very pleasant and charming, and not at all dangerous as I expected it to be given the reviews that I have read about the place. Maybe it depends on the time of day when you get to visit -- I was there from lunchtime and a few hours thereafter, well before the setting of the sun and the turning on of the lights in the red light district."

Beside the famous Sacre Coeur Basilica (the big white church) and lovely Moulin de La Galette, one of the last windmill in Montmartre. Take a stroll at the Place du Tertre, where the legends of 20th century artist used to roam. Now, the many painters or street artist are ready to sketch your beautiful face but bear in mind, it is expensive. The streets are also lined with caf\u00e9s, do spend some times relax and try the delicious steamed mussels in white wine and a glass of champagne and round up with a cup of latte and macaroon or crepe chocolate with banana in a charming ambience. The price is reasonable. Not forgotten, Montmartre is famous for its steps. The steps are classic with lined by pretty lampposts and deciduous trees. It is a good place to snap a few romantic photos. There are often street musician who perform at the bottom of the steps.One can walk your way up to the hill, if you are physical fit or you can choose to take a small white \u2018mini train\u2019 ride through the narrow alley and up to the hill. At the top, the view is the most spectacular in Paris. At night, the view is even more impressive. Tips :1. Take a metro and stop at Blanche Station, start your walk from here. 2. funicular service which you can ride to the top if you are the elder."

Our party consisted of grandma and our 4.5 year old son.We visited Valentines Day a Tuesday and took a Discover walk tour. Caught the METRO and got off at Blanche station to meet our guide Phillipe.The metro stop is right opposite MOULIN ROUGE. Our guide was fanastique and most knowledgable, his passion for this neighborhood was addictive and charming. To sum up Montmarte =souveniour shopping, sex district, (we avoided these parts as travelling with a child this is where our guide was very helpful!)and of course a look at local produce no supemarket in this area every thing is there and fresh fresh fresh! Bohemian feel with lots of vintage shops clothes homewares everything!It was a steep and winding walk upto Sacre Coeur but we didnt notice much as so much to see! Highly recommend going later in the day and watching the sunset at sacre cour church on the hill. You will even see the `Eiffel tower lightup every hour on the hour whilst buskers entertain you on a huge flight of stairs directly opposite the church. Wear your walking shoes and take plenty of cash ladies you could go crazy shopping here! Watch out for pickpokets too. Great district buzzing with a truly unique vive that is Paris! TIP: Take Discover walk these guys KNOW paris and will save you time and you get to see things you wont see on other tours. `Suggested fee for walking tour is 10 euros per person attending =cheap for what you recieve in return which is a real education!If you dont like walking and have a bad back dont go.Recommended.If going to sacre ceour be aware streets are NOT PRAM FRIENDLY due to condition and steep hills!Not busy as we travelled low season."

Symbol of a lavishing and colorful b\u00e9lle \u00e9poque, Montmartre( \"mountain of the martyr\",derived from the martyrdom of Saint Denis), this is a touristic must-see.As a designated historic area, little development is allowed in Montmartre so, thankfully, it has retained much of its character and village-like charm. Just walking around the district is a treat, but if you want to do some sightseeing or cultural visits, head to the Mus\u00e9e de Montmartre, where artist Maurice Utrillo once lived and painted, as well as the mansion behind it, which was once occupied by Renoir.A trip to the Montmartre Cemetery is also in order, and guests can view the graves of many great artists. Of course, you may also want to take in dinner and a show at Moulin Rouge or one of the many other nightclubs in the neighborhood. Oh, and don't forget to search for the little Mus\u00e9e Salvador Dali. If you appreciate the artist, you'll love it!"

At night the area looks alive with all the lights but beneath the surface there are shady people and everything is overpriced and low quality. Some small stuff I bought at souvenir shops here was falling apart when I got home. I went on a pub tour here and was told there are more scams in this area than most places in Paris. There are many glamourous looking sex shops which are nothing more than an adult DVD store in the US. I visited the erotic museum which was ok. This place is worth walking around in and there are major attractions in the area (as noted on previous posts) which overshadow the downside but considering this is in Paris, I could think of many other places I'd rather walk around in."

It was lovely to be amidst the history of Lautrec, Picasso, Van Gogh and Dali, the Moulin Rouge, and Sacre Coeur. And 'Amelie\" of course. The shops and cafes are very trendy. The cobblestone, windy, narrow streets are quaint. Convenient to central Paris via metro stops on two different lines, to the bus and train stations, make Montmarte a great base and visit wherever else you want to go. Beware of the portrait artists around the Sacre Coeur - they are harmless, but swarm (my teenage daughter didn't feel comfortable)."

The majority of items being made in China. Some of the goods are reasonable, some are tacky and cheap looking. The choice is of course the buyers. There are numerous roadside cafes where one can rest, eat and drink. The beauty of doing this of course is that you can watch the world and the many people go by. The village was also in the past the home to many famous artists such as Picasso.To day, in the village square, which is called Place du Tetre many artists ply their talents. Paintings and drawings that depict the Eiffel Tower, portraits,still life and many other subjects abound. The prices are varied like the quality of the work.It is an area that has atmosphere and is certainly worth spending time after visiting the Sacre Coeur"

From one corner to the next there are patissaries, boulangieries, poissonaries, cafes, bars, restaurants, groceries, wine shops and every type of store and boutique imaginable. This is the real Paris.The Blvd de Clichy which could be called it's \"Red Light District\" is a busy strip with all types of people; prostitues, pimps, families out for a walk after dinner, elderly couples walking to the grocery, college students and business men all mix and mingle going about their daily business with no class distinctions. The famous Moulin Rouge and metro are conveniently located on this street, as well as a metro on almost every other block for easy access.I was a single, female traveler, walking alone in all parts of this area and I felt safer than I have in my own city in the USA. All you have to do is follow common sense, blend in and use situational awareness, which everyone should do no matter where you are living.I love sitting in the front tables of the different bars and cafes late at night people watching while having a good beer, glass of wine and a French cigarette. Everyone was helpful and kind, just as long as you try to speak French in greeting. I will say that you do have to be a bit aggressive for certain situations,when standing in line for boarding trains, getting drinks at bars, etc; there is a different level of politeness then you find in Paris. It is sort of every man for himself. If you are too slow, someone will step in front of you without apologizing for it. Aggressive politeness? Something like that.Note: People in Paris allow their pets to relieve themselves on the sidewalk. Watch were you are walking because it is not mud you are stepping in.The Basilica Sacre Coeur was the first place I went upon arriving and I was brought to tears by the beauty of all of Paris, as far as the eye can see. I didn't feel the need to go up in the Eiffel Tower after seeing Paris from the Basilica.If I could live anywhere in Paris, it would be Montmartre. It is not the high-end, glamourous, overly polished Paris that the bourgeois like to shop around (Champs Elysee), but the real Paris that feels like coming home."

From Abbesses station walking uphill few minutes towards Rue Norvins, I found myself stepping on a classic town of boutique taverns and traditional bakeries. Ever since Rue Norvins has housed lines of pubs which must be favorite haunts of such artists as Van Gogh or Picasso who used to live around the area. Via olden Saint Pierre church, I was en route for the Basilica of the Sacred Heart sitting on the summit. From the highest point of the city, the hill afforded me a simply breathtaking landscape. Thereby the glimpse of Paris skyline was so flawless that even a sneak peek from the above of Eiffel Tower or Notre Dame tower could not compare with. What is more, Montmartre won my best favor for its unique surroundings. Passing Louis Michel Square in front of the Basilica, I met another vintage shopping street from which Moulin Rouge is in few minute walk afar and altogether promises the best nightlife for visitors of hoards."

A good vintage clothes shop with some good designer pieces. Just a shame that the two american women who were working in there showed such little interest in engaging with their customers, showing little passion about the clothing and no interest in being helpful. A little further we found a charming cafe on the corner and had a nice bowl of onion soup for lunch. The cafe was busy with a comfortable cozy atmosphere. After lunch we mounted the steps up towards the top of the hill and once there found ourselves in some very pretty cobbled streets approaching a beautiful piazza with lots of restaurants/cafe's around the edges and in the centre many artists with their easels and their work whichMostly consisted of portraits of people that they have attempted to draw. The ability of the work varied between competent and beginners. Some technically very good and many different styles. We had a wander around and one of the artists, An older man approached me to sit for him and have my portrait done. He said that he would do it in 10mins. I glanced at his easel to get an idea of the price and I am sure it said 10 euros. After seeing this I thought that it was not too expensive and that it would make a good memento of our trip. After some time of sitting for the portrait I was shown the drawing which I was not convinced had been successful in the artists attempt of capturing my likeness. He then produced a typed bit of paper that had 70 euros and 50 euros printed on it. He asked me to pay 50 euros discounted from 70 euros. I refused to pay the 50 euros and although I didn't think that the artist was hassling me too much i felt that I had been misled. I ended up negotiating a price of 35 euros which as an artist myself didn't mind paying as he obviously had some talent and was after all trying to make a living through his art but I think I paid too much in terms of the piece itself. We then wandered around for a bit but realised the shops in the immediate vicinity were very tourist driven so made our way up to Sacre Coeur. As we entered the Cathedral there was a service taking place. It was a magnificent place very warm beautiful music which made me think of Faure's Requiem and exquisitely crafted mosaics of gold leaf. There is also a strange mural of Jesus and the disciples on the ceiling that looked like something out of a comic book. There were loads of candles lit in the church 2 euros for a small nightlight and 10 euros for a big pint glass sized one. We walked in a big circle around the sides if the cathedral along with many other visitors and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. A good example of a functioning church and a tourist destination operating in a symbiotic way and well organised. It was very uplifting and an elevating experience and a great end to the afternoon. After leaving the cathedral we looked out on to a spectacular and impressive view over Paris and descended towards Pigalle."

So remember: this is a buyer's market. You don't need to insult and artist by offering a LOT less money for a personalized work, but definitely make at least one counter offer. We met a guy who wanted to sketch my daughter in the street. He started at 30 euro. As I politely said, \"No thanks\" and started walking away, the price went to 25. \"Maybe later\" and the price went to 20.\"OK. I'll come back in 20 minutes\" and the price dropped to 15 euro. Not all artists are as flexible, but like I said, it's a buyer's market. The work is all ... to some extent ... beautiful. But results DO vary, so remember:Your best bet is to say \"no\" to every personalized offer until you've looked around the square, because odds are very good that 10 steps away from your 20-euro sketcher is a 30-euro painter who has just finished a perfect painting of another family. You will find artists in this crowd who can do an exceptional job of capturing the look in your daughter's eye. There are others who just want to get the artwork done and get your money. Be very selective.This place is surrounded by restaurants and great food ... and heck, you'll need to use the facilities anyway. Remember, if you sit outside and face the square, you WILL be approached by artists who WILL start sketching you just because \"you're stunning.\" And then, they'll ask you for 30 euro and act insulted when you refuse. Again, if you really want the portrait, the artist needs to do it right. As far as accessibility ... you can reach it by subway and then take a lift up to the square. I have serious concerns about accessible restrooms ... as most joints in France seem to come standard with extremely steep staircases to a restroom below. It's a charming little spot to visit ... and the view of the city from St. Pierre is stunning. The artists are amazing. But be tough and don't pay for what you really don't want."

From there, it's a short walk to the funicular to get up to the top, near Sacre Coeur. The funicular is included in the Paris Transportation Pass. It was cramped and smelly, but better than all of the steps it would otherwise take to get to the top. Sacre Coeus is lovely, as is the whole neighborhood. We wandered down the hill towards the Moulin Rouge and saw lots of pretty buildings and alleys. There are plenty of shops and cafes on the hill, just know they're pretty expensive. The Moulin Rouge is very small from the outside. As a fan of the movie, I wanted a picture opportunity. I knew the elephant was gone, but I still expected more. Ah, well. The shows are very expensive, so we didn't go to see one. (yes, children over 6 are allowed)"

Then, I take the steps or funicular and once I've arrived up top, I stop for the best view of the city that seems to spreads out forever. There's time for a brief stop inside Sacre Coeur to contemplate life and give thanks. Then I follow the cobblestone streets and just wander. Stop in for a bite at le Moulin de la galette or for a fresh macaroon at the biscuiterie de Montmartre.

You will be greeted by a mass of people sat on the steps admiring the view of Paris. Shame you can not see the Eiffel tower (unless they cut a few big trees down). The Sacre-Coeur is serenely lit on the outside. Go inside and admire the beauty and the masses of candles. Back outside you'll be pestered by the tricket salesmen who do an interesting range of glow-in-the-dark toys that you throw in the air (and I assume loose) and well as flashing Eiffel towers.

My wife and I walked from our hotel in the 8th ARR two evenings in a row. It's abut a 4-5 mile round trip and a bit strenuous considering all of the steep streets and steps to get to the top, but once we arrived, it was all well worth it.Montmarte has the Sacre Coeur as its centerpiece, but our favorite spot was the square, lined with wonderful shops and restaurants -- and a real feeling of old Paris. In fact, it feels so perfect both me and my wife though it seemed more like something Disney would have created -- but it's the real deal.

It was one of the few areas in Paris that was open for business that afternoon, so we enjoyed a filling lunch at a neighborhood bistro and a pastry from a boulangerie. It was a great way to spend the afternoon, but it was incredibly crowded.One of us had been to Montmartre on previous visits to Paris, in the spring and the summer, and remarked that it was equally busy on those occasions. There must always be massive crowds around local icons like Caf\u00e9 des Deux Moulins (from Amelie) and the Sacr\u00e9 Couer. The area is packed with tacky tourist trap shops selling poor Toulouse-Lautrec and Degas reproductions and hastily made crepes, while modern day artists vie to paint portraits of passersby for cash. They probably make a good living selling to the tourists crowding the area's main streets.Don't let this intimidate you, Montmartre is worth visiting, especially if you explore the area behind Sacr\u00e9 Couer. The backstreets are full of attractive homes, including several by esteemed architects. That is also where you'll find the only operational vineyard in all of Paris. Just down from the vineyard is the famous Lapin Agile. We haven't been, but friends of ours enjoyed a really fun evening there. The view of Paris from the front of the Sacr\u00e9 Couer is devastatingly beautiful, and the view from the top is more so. It's worth dealing with the crowds for that world class view. And take a few minutes to explore the Montmartre Cemetery. We joined up with other cinephiles to pay our respects to Francois Truffaut, who is among the notable Parisians buried there."

            "review": "An out-of-the-way gem. Relative to other attractions in Paris, Montmarte is somewhat far removed, but it is easily reachable by Metro (Anvers stop) and definitely worth the trip. The white-domed Sacre-Coeur (visible in the distance from other landmarks like the Eiffel Tower and Arc de Triomphe) sits on the highest point in Paris, and the view from atop the many white steps is impressive. A short walk behind the church and around the corner leads to side streets filled with shops and cafes and then to Place du Tertre, a square filled with artists at work, with more shops and cafes around its perimeter. Although I agree that it is rather touristy, this area is steeped in culture (birthplace of the term \"bistro\" no less) and is overall rather charming and relaxing, so much so that we even returned later in our trip to take another look around.Practical info: Once you get off the Metro, it's all uphill. You walk a few blocks up a narrow street crowded with souvenir shops to the base of the hill where the steps up to the church begin. There is also a carousel here, not sure why. You can either climb the steps or take the Funiculaire railway/elevator to the (almost) top. We climbed and it was fine. The steps are wide, low-rise, and varied so you can easily go at your own pace, plus you can stop and sit on the steps or the expansive grass at any point to rest and enjoy the view. No photos permitted inside the church. On the way to Place du Tertre, artists might approach and ask if you would like them to sketch you or someone in your party, but they were not intrusive at all. We like to pick up some kind of artwork when we travel and this is a good place to do that. All artists were friendly and open to negotiations. One warning: if you buy a painting, make sure it's dry before you pay for it.And about those gypsies: You will likely run into a few (faux) deaf-mute girls with clipboards at nearly every tourist attraction you visit in Paris. These are gypsies looking for money (we were informed by a tour guide) and there did seem to be more of them at Sacre-Coeur. Simply shake your head or wave them away and they won't bother you. The guys with the string that other reviews have mentioned are the same. They might look more intimidating, but simply ignore, walk past, and you're fine. I noticed a couple of women get freaked out by them and run away, a spectacular overreaction. You are warned of pickpockets everywhere, but we did not have a problem. Anyway, these distractions are only around the lower level of the steps. Once you're past that, you won't run into them again. And nobody bothers you on the way down."

We did encounter the \"deaf\" girls shoving the petitions in our faces, but just walked right by. After all, they are supposed to be deaf and not able to speak, right? So, they can't even yell at you to stop. So non-threatening, it's almost funny. Once we passed them I turned around and they were chatting to one another as they waited for the next visitor to come up the steps from where they were standing. We also encountered the \"string scam\" and simply did not stop walking, speak to or look at the men. None of the cons physically tried to stop us or abuse us in any way. My main point is that visitors should not stay away from Montmartre due to frightening reviews they may have read on this site. I also want to say that I feel badly for people who have had wallets, purses, etc. stolen, but it is truly easy to avoid this kind of heartache. Keep larger sums of cash and credit cards in a wallet made to be worn inside of slacks. Keep passports stowed away safely in your hotel room. My husband carried a backpack and I had a smallish size handbag all the time. But the items we kept in these bags were of no great value, and if they had been taken from us, the joke would have been on the thief. Enjoy your time in Paris, and do not miss Montmartre."

Sacre Cour is a peacful church, a perfect place to take a breather to calm down. But the best reason for the visit to Monmartre is the panoramic view from the steps in front of the Sacre-Coeur.

We had broken away from the fixed itinerary of a package tour to really explore a quaint and interesting area of Paris, or so we thought. But after lunch at a bistro and appreciative stops to listen to street violinists and pick delightful souvenirs at the local shops, we reached the artists' square right before the church where WE HAD ALL OUR MONEY STOLEN. The technique was - a man engaged us in conversation while cutting out a paper silhouette of my daughter - something we had not asked him to do. another couple of men stood around us, also making inane conversation like asking what my son's tattoo signified. Then, the silhouette cutter asked for the sum of 20 euros. Aghast, but feeling obliged to pay, I reached for my purse, which was GONE on the 4th day of our 11 day trip. It was simply awful. I would advise travellers to be very careful of such conmen in this part of Paris. The worst thing was, after stealing our cash, he actually had the gall to blame it on 'little gypsy girls'.

As the high point of Paris at 130 metres or so, Montmartre has it attractions and interests by long association with struggling artists but it is also a bit of touristic cliche. The street artists today are not that gifted generally but it all adds to the colour and in a sense, continues the tradition. Apart from the narrow streets and lanes and houses where famous artists and others once lived, there is a vineyard which produces rather awful wine. The steps of Rue Foyatier and others are also very Montmartre, a fitness fanatic's dream, as well as being popular themes in the rather awful contemporary art produced there. Renoir and Degas are long gone and their talent has gone with them!The most interesting part is the cemetery where there are many now obscure people buried but others of great and lingering fame as well: Degas; Dumas; Nijinsky; Offenbach; Madame Recamier; Emile Zola and also the German writer, Heinrich Heine who is also honored by a statue.Sacre Coeur has a certain interest as well by virtue of its location and sheer dominance at the high point of Paris, but as a building, it is not one of the great edifices of Paris, looking like a giant and over-dressed wedding cake.Still, Montmartre will always be over-run with tourists. Many of the streets running back towards Rue des Abbesses and Rue Le Pic have some interesting shops and of course there is Boulevard de Clichy and Pigalle, which is an interesting shopping precinct, gradually moving upwards in the social scale. Much of the old seediness is going, being replaced gradually by a new chic look and shops to match.Go visit but do so, not expecting too much beyond the overtly touristic."

Montmartre divides opinion - some Trip Advisor reviews rave about it, others hate it.I guess it depends on expectations, and whether you venture away from the tourist traps of the Place du Tertre and the steps of Sacre Coeur.In Place du Tertre on a Saturday afternoon, portrait artists swarm like paparazzi, eager to capture your likeness in charcoal. We didn't find them too pushy - a simple 'non, merci' is enough. If you walk round the back of Sacre-Coeur, the crowds disappear, the nick-nack shops thin out, and you can enjoy the picturesque streets in peace. There is a tiny vineyard, some bijou appartments, elegant villas and the famous Lapin Agile cafe-bar, which features in so many Utrillo paintings. The Moulin de la Galette (as painted by Picasso, Renoir and Van Gogh) is on the top of the hill, to the west of Sacre Coeur.We stayed in rue Theloze, a small street off the rue Abbesses. This is a great area with lots of nice bars and restaurants, walking distance from Abbesses metro and Amelie's cafe des 2 Moulins on rue Lepic. There is a small cinema on rue Theloze, which shows films in their original language.If you are visiting Montmartre for the day, take the metro to Abbesses - it has one of the few remaining Guimard metro entrances and is opposite an interesting Art Nouveau church. All the sights are within walking distance from here (no need to take the tacky tourist train up to the top of the hill!)Further down the hill is the seedier side of Montmartre - sex shops line Boulevard de Clichy from Blanche metro station to Pigalle. My children wanted to see the Moulin Rouge, so we walked round the corner from rue Lepic and took some nice pictures of the windmill on a sunny morning.Around the rue des Trois Freres there are quirky shops and some reasonably priced restaurants. The creperie at number 15 rue des Trois Freres was particularly good. After dinner, walk up the hill to see the Sacre Coeur by night - it is beautifully illuminated and you get a great view of the Eiffel Tower from up there. Even the Place du Tertre seems less tacky after dark.Overall, we loved Montmartre - it was the best place I've ever stayed in eight visits to Paris.The seedy bits and the touristy parts are easily avoided, so don't be put off."

First of all its right in the heart of the tourist area , so be prepared for crowds , bus cafe's , restaurants ,and everything else the comes with 1000's of people in little narrow cobbled streets.It has retained much of its character over the years, thankfully, and is a great place to visit if in Paris.Place du Tertre,Sacre coeur, Moulin Rouge, Pigalle, its all here and within walking distance .The panoramis views from the steps in front of the Sacre-Coeur is the best place to view down into paris...... the only problem is that on a warm day there is hardly room to move as visitors sit and admire the view. Seek out small restaurants in the back streets awayfrom the crowds for some authentic food and ambience .Beware of pick pockets in the busy streets , (advice from others), not that i was unlucky that way ."

My only piece of advice seems in line with what another reviewer mentioned. BEWARE of the guys on the steps trying to sell you things. Especially the guys with the string trick... A friend of mine made the mistake of holding out her finger when one so charmingly approached her. A few other guys came around and appeared to be 'watching'... She ended up giving the guy a few coins from her pocket before realizing that her wallet was gone! Quelle Horreur!This is not really meant to scare anyone. These people will leave you well alone if you just give them a firm 'no thanks' or 'not interested.'"

My sole reason for taking the time to write this review is to warn unknowing travelers of deceptive sales practice by the street vendors at the very beginning of the attraction, as you enter towards the steps. There are dozens of guys there that practice sneaky/deceptive sales practice trying to sell you little colorful thread bracelets. They will aggressively approach you and simply ask you to hold your index finger out. Then they will loop a thread around your finger then proceed to create a bracelet. When you tell them you are not interested, they repeatedly tell you there is no cost, they will represent themselves as somehow associated with the church. Once they complete the bracelet, they will guilt you into paying for it, and will use the line that it is a donation for the church. It was easier for me to give them the few coins I had and continue on to see the attraction. I've travelled to many places with street vendors, Mexico, Jamaica, Caribbean, but this was one of the most deceitful sales I've ever witnessed. I'm shocked that the tourism authorities allow this at such a well known attraction. If I can save one reader from falling for the deceitful sales, then I've done my job. Just ignore and walk past these guys (unless you do want to buy one)."

It is full of outdoor cafes with live music. The shops are mainly selling tourist souvenirs, but you can also find some great art. We bought a few prints to take home with us. In the day, you can find great crepe windows and great espresso stops. There is also a lot of modern street art- some of it quite impressive. I really enjoyed the neighborhood- full of life and very vibrant. Also, the steps of Sacre Couer are a great place to drink some wine, experience a great view and really look out onto the city- a great place to meet a lot of other young travellers. Also- you don\u2019t need to take the tram to the top of the stairs. They might look terrible, but it never took us longer than ten minutes to climb.

Montmartre is a great neighbourhood in Paris to explore - its good just to wander round and take in the sights and atmosphere.We took the Metro to Abesses and walked to the base of the hill at Sacre Coeur. You can take the hill train or walk up - its not too bad if you're in decent health. Nice carousel for kids at the base of the hill. Lots of people around when we went which added to the atmosphere of the place. The main area round the Place de tetre has lots of restaurants and artists. We have eaten here before - not this time - and had a great meal we went off the main square and found it very reasonable and good quality. We have also had a picture done of our son, i would recommend you watch a few of them first so you know how good they are, we did and got an amazing picture, agree your price first too. Have also an original piece of artwork from here. It is a great place just to experience - can be a bit touristy - but worth the trip out. Few beggars round the hill train trying to attach bracelets - just say no firmly and walk off they don't tend to hassle you. We have also done the 'little train' which is good to give you an overview and some history about the place too. See that some people mention about only going in the day - we have been at night, not this time, and never had an issue. As long as you are careful and not wandering off the beaten track I'm sure you'll be okay. We've never had a problem."

The take-out is great. The markets are great. I am going back in March with my husband for 5 days. We've rented a one bedroom apartment, which is quite more reasonable than renting some postage size hotel room.

Spend the afternoon walking around Montmartre and you will see why Vincent van Gogh and his brother Theo, Auguste Renoir, Claude Monet, Amedeo Modigliani, Toulouse Lautrec, Fransesque Poulbot, Maurice Utrillo, Max Jacob, Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque and others chose to live there. There's a vineyard that dates back to Roman times, and it seems no matter what street you look down, there's something worth seeing.

While my husband and I were walking back up the steps to continue our journey, there was a group of teenage boys that started shouting at me the phrase, \"Knee-how?\", over and over again, which I think is (a) a Chinese phrase that translates to \"How are you?\" and (b) a reference to the fact that I am half-Chinese. Although I am a professor, I do not speak Chinese, so I said, \"Non!\" and shook my head no. The boys continued laughing and shouting the phrase at me, and I simply didn't understand what was so funny. I guess that is what people are referring to when they say to be careful in Montmartre."

I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect when staying in Montmartre: some reviews described it as seedy and exploitative of tourists, and not what it was.That\u2019s probably true, but it actually doesn\u2019t matter much. Yes, there are hawkers who try to rip you off, and there are the [--] shops on Blvd de Clichy, but there is so much more to Montmartre than this. It\u2019s charming, full of life and abounds in little bars, cafes and restaurants everywhere you look. It encapsulates what my romantic idea of Paris ought to be, so I found staying here to be a delight. Tellingly, there are many locals who both live here or are Parisians visiting.Being built on a hill, there are windy streets with rustic apartment buildings and crowded pavements where you can buy a beer or cafe and watch the world go by. The hilltop contains squares where artists still work and tourists gather. Beware the artist with a charcoal pencil and sketchbook loitering nearby: faster than you can say Toulouse Lautrec, he will have done your portrait and demanded an outrageous amount for payment. One guy caught me and wanted 80 euros, I had to laugh out loud. My husband eventually gave him 10 just to get rid of him. The restaurants are eclectic; you can get Vietnamese as well as local, and they vary in quality. If you want an authentic experience, avoid menus written in English. Locals do not patronise these, and they are more expensive.Highlights to visit: the cemetery at the bottom on Avenue Rachel, full of history and charm. The Sacre Coeur at the summit is extraordinarily beautiful, especially at sunset, and the views over Paris are gorgeous from there. You can walk down the famous Montmartre steps to the cafes below, where you will be besieged by hawkers trying to sell you rubbish souvenirs of the Eiffel Tower.I also found it quite safe and had no qualms about walking back alone at 10m. I wouldn\u2019t do it at 2am but then where would you do that anyway? There are enough people around at night to make it a safe area, just use the usual caution and avoid dark unpopulated spots.Bottom line: a real romantic Paris experience, even if it is more of a simulacra these days. Go for the charm and beauty, and turn a blind eye to the expense and cheap tourist shops."

It was not at all seedy or creepy during the day like some other reviews may say.However, going for a meal and some drinks in the evening was completely different. Being 3 young girls wearing high heels and jeans, with a mac, we stuck out like a sore thumb, men were leering at us and shouting across the street at us, this was pretty scary and intimidating. On one occassion, a man actually followed us down a side street to our hotel! I would like to point out that as budget travellers, we are not easily put off, or fussy about where we stay, but this was different. I would not recommend staying here if the party is all female and definetly not to get the subway around this area at night. We then got taxis for the rest of our stay immediately from the hotel and back to the grands boulevard and champs elyees (spelling not great)! These, we found, were the best places for night time for a few drinks and cocktails. I would absolutely recommend the Hard Rock Cafe, it was delicious! I would definetely return to paris as it was a beautiful and exciting city, I would stay in another location however."

We stayed in an apartment on place du terte and had a wonderful experience, the apartment was fantastic, the location was great, the people were lovely (ok one artist gave us hassle) the small winding streets were lovely and like nothing else in Paris. There is so much to discover here, we never had a problem or felt unsafe apart from dodging the lookie lookie men at the bottom of the Sacre Coeur, and having a little of the French language to tell them where to go helped I suppose but overall a fantastic experience."

            "review": "Montmartre with children. Go to Montmartre where the painters sit. Just for fun and show we used the funiculaire. Of course you will pass Sacre Coeur. My boy refused to enter another church after the Notre dame waiting experience. Apart from the Eiffel tower, the Seine cruise for french speaking children, the Montmartre experience was the third hightlight of my boy. I payed \u20ac 50 for a portrait which is not all that great, but he enjoyed the experience thouroghly. After that we had dinner on that pittoresque square where he even gladly ate escargots! Proudly he returned to our hotel with his portrait under his arm. All in all I can warmly recommend this experience."

            "review": "Old Hill art village. Montmarte is a nice place to visit when you are in Paris. Dont stay at Montmarte though. I found that the affordable hotels were old, small, and damp. Of course, I am sure the hotels may be originals! Montemarte use to be a place where artists gathered. Think moulin Rouge (which isnt really that far from montemarte) Many drug induced artists littered the streets of montemarte, but while i think absinthe, artists and tourists, montemarte is still a historical place to visit. Sacre couere sits right there next to it, but to me, wasnt the main attraction. On montemarte you get a decent view of the rest of the city. There is alos a carosal, and if you have seen the french flick, amelie, then you might recognize the steps going up to montemarte. visit montemarte in the daytime, or early evening before it gets too dark. Montemarte still reminds me of a bit of a rowdy scandalous place. There are little tiny caffees and a bunch of tourists shops. They are ok. I like the little cobbled streets, the view, and the artists (though i couldnt afford any of their paintings). If you really want to shop there is some decent prices souvenir like places at the bottom of montemarte."

            "review": "Beautiful Hilltop Village. Montmartre was the first place we visited during our stay in Paris this October for our honeymoon. We loved this beautiful hilltop village. The whole town still remains its color of 19 century's village. It feels like the Time Machine took you back 200 years. You almost can imagine vividly how the life was there. We discovered many lovely gardens, houses, cafes and magnificant views of Paris while we walking on the winding cobble stoned street. The afternoon we spent there was so nice and relaxing. We didn't stay in montmartre, so didn't notice any problems that the previous review mentioned. Montmartre is definetly site for walking tour if you visit Paris."

            "review": "Dog-poo slalem. My husband and I spent a week in Paris in July and had fabulous and not so fabulous experiences. My main advice is for people to not stay in the part of Monmartre that we did! We thought that being two streets back from the Sacre Cur would ensure us a great stay - wrong! Our nearest Metro stops were Anvers and Chateu Rouge (one of the few Metro stations that the Lonely Plant guide tells you to avoid at night - for good reason - it is scary!) and the short walk to each of them was quite horrible. We knew that Parisians weren't as environmentally friendly as what we were used to, but nowhere in Paris did we see so much filth - and so much dog poo - as we saw between our hotel and the local stations. We read an article in a tourist magazine about people roller-blading and walking down the foot paths doing the \"dog-poo slalem\" - we thought it an accurate description. As we left on our last morning to catch a train to the airport, we rolled our suitcases down the centre of the road to avoid messing up our wheels! While most or Paris - and most of Monmartre - was quite fabulous, that walk was enough to dampen a great day and make us feel yukky. We stayed at the Hotel New Monmartre, which our friends from London said was better than their rented flat, but which we found dirty, tiny and uncomfortable. The other side of the fabulous church on the hill was charming and lovely and we wished we had stayed there or in another region. Our trip highlight was a Mozart concert by a string ensemble at Saint Chappelle (right near Notre Dame) and a bus tour around the city, admiring the stunning architecture. We will have to return to Paris one day, just to stop the Monmarte experince from tainting our memory of such a beautiful city."
