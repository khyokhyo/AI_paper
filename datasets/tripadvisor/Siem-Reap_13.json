It's a reminder to us all that regardless of how formidable we may be today, in the end Mother Nature will reclaim what's rightfully hers. A brilliant decision on the part of \u00c9cole fran\u00e7aise d'Extr\u00eame-Orient to preserve, but not restore. If you have but a day to temple gaze this would be one of the two I would choose. The other of course, Angkor Wat."

Primarily worshipped for Lord Shiva, then when kingdom adopted Buddishm, idols of buddha can be seen.What to expect from this temple ?1. Huge Trees that are surreal, unlike anything you will ever see in your life. Specially the tree on the roof top of temple from East Gate takes your imagination to next level2. very good sculptures intact at some areas of temple, while most are broken & that eerie silence follows you always3. if you are in a group, you will probably not enjoy that feel other than people talking loud, photo moments etc, where you will not share that special bond place is trying to convey to you. Trust me, its not ruined monument you are paying a visit, these have withstood times more than we can ever live for & a testimony to dedication of these people to their god & their king, simply an excellance that has tested maths, science, astronomy etc., awe inspiring engineering feat ...4. exit by west gate, where your tuk tuk, taxi will await you,cheers"

You do not have to follow the crowd, the signs, or the norms. Find what you like, walk all the way around things, meet the monks and nuns, gather blessings, hug the trees, avoid the monkeys.It is all as beautiful as you want it to be. Do not let the selfie sticks and rudeness of others detract form your experience of this stunning location."

The temple is not as crowded as the other more popular sites and it seemed to be a younger crowd here. This is likely because the millennials all know that this is where Angelina Jolie's Laura Croft movie was filmed. There are many beautiful places where the grand old trees which have grown around and through the rock of the temple provide a striking reminder of the power and adaptability of nature. There are some steps which are uneven but not difficult to climb and of course, you need to have your temple pass stamped to enter. Although the day was a hot and humid scorcher, there are several areas of shade where you can sit and contemplate the beauty of the temple. It would be slippery and very hard to explore this site if it were raining."

Take a closer look and you'll see that trees play a greater role in the complex than in others. There are a few cases of some fantastically overgrown trees that have entirely enveloped the stone, eliciting images of some strange tentacle monster.As of Sept 2016, there is continuing work to put the broken pieces together, including, sadly, some tree removal activity. All this is being done to \"stabilize\" the structures, such that they're protected from further deterioration. Pay attention especially to the route here, as it is perhaps the easiest place in the Angkor complex to get lost (and miss out on some great sights).Most likely, you'll be visiting other places in the Angkor complex on the same day. I'd strongly advise visitors to bring at least one spare battery, as there will be almost nowhere you can charge your equipment."

We were part of a larger tour van group where they drop you and your English speaking guide at the front gate. that was where we went wrong, our guide spoke horrible English and we think he was a bit.... well.... shouldn't be driving a van full of tourists. Anyways, when you enter its human nature to follow the crowd especially with all the desctruction of the temple but the line was so long and it was so hot out. When I saw a nice Cambodian man waving for me and my friend to follow him to the left instead of the right, I hopped at the opportunity to have better photos without the thousands of Asian tourists with selfie sticks. He was engaging and his English wasn't perfect but much better than the guy we had already paid for so I stuck with him at all costs. a guy in our group refused to join after a moment saying \"he will demand money when this is over\" and my retort was \"good, he deserves it for his services\" and I was spot on right!! He lined up all the shots, took photos of me and my friends. he was very kind and trust worth for a stranger. I ended up getting hundreds of shots with no other people in them. We pooled all our spare cash while he wasn't looking and when he started a fake sob story about a sick mother in another country, we smiled and handed all the money without hesitating, he smiled and looked relieved that it wasn't going to be a fight. It ended up being about $10-12 I believe and he cried when he counted and hugged us all. He worked very hard and gave us a service, he earned that money. Anyways....We learned that although the trees had been growing for more than 300 years, most of the destruction was due to the bombs during the Vietnam war hitting areas near by. Very sad history but amazing visual to remind us what that history is.Most of the tours have this location towards the later of the day as Ankgor Wat is the sunrise party. Please note that its very very hot and very little shade, make sure you have water when you get there. there are a few tented shops at the end with coconuts and water but they are at the end. I went through both of my bottles of water before that point.Find the dinosaur... research the dinosaur before you get there. super cool and kinda spooky!"

I always try to avoid crowds, but they are hard to avoid in Ta Prohm, mainly thanks to the Tomb Raider 1 movie, which made it famous.I will not repeat what other fellow travelers already wrote, I will just say that this is one of the temples that need to be on your Angkor Wat short list. It has a very decent architecture and the overgrown trees make it truly unique.It is a pity that more and more of the temple is \"protected\" by poles and rope, this makes photography much more difficult (although there are many places for great unobstructed pictures still available... if you are lucky to find a moment with no or little people around). But this is a price of popularity I guess (and most of the temple is accessible anyway)."

There's also a spot where the Lara Croft movie were taken, but I'm not realised it until return from that place. So recognise it first if you want to pose yourself there."

Answered many questions from my husband and made sure he didn't rush us at any point. Many people did it alone so choice is yours. Cost through hotel was $60 U.S pp. Plus $20 U.S for one day pass pp. be aware it is VERY hot so bring a hat and sunscreen. Hotel driver provided cool wet towels and cold water through the day. We arranged to leave at 7am, to beat the worst of the heat, and had breakfast at hotel at 6am beforehand. The tour finished by 1pm so it is a long, hot and fairly strenuous day!

Lara Croft\u2019s Tomb Raiders gave it a more recent gloss. The (Indian) renovation team had a massive job to do to rebuild collapsed galleries and towers, They had the aesthetic sensibility to compromise historical accuracy to keep in place some of the more spectacular ficus trees which had insinuated themselves amid the stones. The result is an attractive maze of galleries, courtyards, face towers, enigmatic representation of a dino, all in the shade of the canopy provided by giant trees. Ta Prohm attracts the crowds \u2013 logical. We did two visits, the second one in the golden light of late afternoon. Magical, with alternatively a warm feeling of familiarity and the satisfaction to discover things we had missed the first time."

Ascertain which gate you entered through - you might end up exiting on the other side of the complex if you didnt pay enough attention (happened to me huhu)"

It is also called as Rajavihara, a royal monastery having many Buddhist deities. Consisting of Strangler figs and silk-cotton trees entwined among the ruins, the complex left in it's natural state though it involves lot of work to prevent further damage and continued efforts to clear the vegetation.The trees that have grown among the ruins provide unusual atmosphere as the unrestored state of Ta Prohm with it's size and complex architecture transport us to different world.I entered through eastern gopura and spent almost two hours lost in the majesty of glorious past. It's slippery at couple of places and must watch the steps not to fall.Collapsed buildings, enclosures, shrines, decorative carvings and over grown roots of trees and the double pillored galleried in partially unrestored state provide us the glimpse of how Angkor looked at the time of discovery in 19th century.Not to be missed."

The setting is beautiful, located in a forest, so there's also many (for me as a German) stunningly high trees with enormous trunks to see while you walk around plus there's more shade than you'll find at Angkor or Bayom. The way the trees grow 'into' the ruines and win their space back is fascinating. As we were there around 8-8.30 in the morning, there were only few people there, so the atmosphere was very quiet and peaceful and we had the chance to take many great photos without feeling rushed by somebody waiting behind.Of course, if you are more into spectacular views, either by climbing the temples or by the sight of an impressive temple itself, then Angkor or Bayom are the right places to go."

Atmospheric and creepy at the same time, pics with the tomb raider door are a must, but also look out for the dinosaur carving. Several different theories have been advanced to explain its presence. Some maintain it's a recently-carved hoax, while others say that the ancient Khmers could have unearthed a fossil and figured out what kind of creature it belonged to. One theory has it that the image actually shows a cow or rhino with a palm tree in the background - the palm's fronds being easily mistaken for the fin-like blades running down a stegasaurus' back.Or maybe the carving is evidence that dinosaurs really did live on until much later than previously thought. (Creationists would certainly like to believe so.) Perhaps here in the humid, ancient jungles of Southeast Asia, where the climate has remained largely unchanged since the dinosaurs' days, giant reptiles lived on well into the human era - long enough to persist in the Khmer folk-memory. If only these walls could talk, we might have a clue."

It was decided to keep the temple largely the way it was found i.e. merged with the jungle. That's what makes this temple unique and attracts crowd (plus of course the 2001 Angelina Jolie's Tomb Rider movie). We could see ancient trees soaring high out of ruins and their giant roots crawling over the ground and moss-covered structures. Kind of eerie. The boarded walkways allowed us to explore the complex. If you like Ta Phrom and want to see a much more rustic and less crowded one, go to Boeng Mealea (separate reviews). While in Siem Reap for 3 days, we did not join a tour or hire a guide, instead (as recommended by a TA fellow) used a friendly, knowledgeable young driver named Sochet Ny (+855 12 311 644, nysochectra@gmail.com or search his website driveangkor.com).

There's just something about the trees.These trees have been here for ages, creeping and growing up and over the ancient temples. It's an amazing looking area- giant trees looming over tall buildings, as if the jungle has crept in and is eating up the temple. We were told that many of the Angkor temples used to look basically like this, and that the trees and plants were cleared out and buildings restored over many decades. Ta Prohm is one of the few left of the major temple areas which still has many strangler figs and other invasive trees that prominently cover many areas of the temple, walls, buildings, gates, and stonework.At this point, taking them down would destabilize many of the buildings on which they grow, so the policy of the people who run the temples is to leave them for now- and in some cases even to prop them up. Then, once they do ultimately collapse, the dead tree will be taken away and the rocks will be restored in the area where the tree was. You can see this in one or two places around Ta Prohm, which my guide pointed out to us.The ancient carvings are interesting, too. They aren't as detailed and well-preserved as the ones at Banteay Srei, and they weren't as monumental in most cases as the heads at Bayan, but there were some beautiful ones here, too.Overall, it's a fantastic place to visit. We were advised to try to see it in the early morning, but the rain at about 7 am that day made our guide decide to reschedule it for mid-afternoon. By about 2 or 3 pm, the buses of tourists may have diminished a bit, and it won't be quite so crowded. Even so, it was definitely one of the busiest temples we saw. Easy to see why, though- the aching beauty and destructive power of the clinging trees is just so creepy and so otherworldly, and yet at the same time, lovely. It's a unique sight to see. I've never seen anything quite like it anywhere else in all the world.Do NOT MISS Ta Prohm if you are anywhere near the Angkor Wat area. Stop and see it even if you have to choose between this and the main Angkor Wat temple, which is huge and wonderful, too, but maybe not quite as unique."

This is the temple that is older than the Angkor Wat and one of the most visited attractions in the Angkor Archeological Park primarily famous for the reason that the movie Tomb Raider was shot there. But well worth a visit to see how the roots of the old tree have grown. Generally done as a tour of the trio that is Angkor Wat, Angkor Thom and Ta Prohm. VIsit this place in the morning when tour groups are at Angkor Wat. You can see this place in about 1 hour as as usual wear good footwear"

I've never seen such huge trees before, and when you think the tree ia just normal tree, no it isnt, the tree grew on top of the tomb!

This was the last temple I visited on my 1-day tour of Angkor. It. Was. GREAT! To see the trees growing through the stonework of the temple is really a visual treat. My tour guide and I arrived in the early afternoon (around 2 pm) and it had just started to rain. So we grabbed large umbrellas and trekked to the temple through the rain. Who wants to hang out in the car because of rain when there's an ancient temple RIGHT THERE?? Of course, because of its popularity, this particular temple was overrun with tourists but it wasn't as bad as it could have been, because of the rain. There has been a lot of conservation work done on the temple but a lot of it is in ruins and even those parts are beautiful to see. So go. Go. GO!"

You want to photograph the tree roots winding themselves around the man made structures and you would like to do that without simpering tourists insisting in standing to have their photos taken in front of the trees and walls. You may have to wait for 5 to 10 minutes before you can frame a human free view.And why do certain tourists always make a V For victory sign when they're having their photos taken?

Now one can see huge fig and silk cotton tree trunks and roots are embracing the temple like a gigantic snake. The Hollywood films Tomb Raider and Indiana Jones and Temple of Doom were shot here."

Exploring it meant climbing rocks and squeezing through small openings in the collapsed structure.I was disappointed to discover they had built wood sidewalks and stairways throughout 75% of the ruins--and 90% of the best areas. You want a photo? They've built a wooden deck for you in exactly the right spot. They're catering to the hoards of package tourists that don't want to get their shoes dirty. If you want to see what this temple looked like in the \"old days\" you'd better get here quick before they turn the other 25% into Disneyland. Don't get me wrong. Ta Phrom is still amazing.

Some people think you will be entering a tomb or a cave like structure. Instead its an open air structure of ruins. After seeing Angkor Wat this place will only add to your trip overhead in time and cost and will not give anything more than a structure that has an overgrown tree on it.

Originally known as Rajavihara (Monastery of the King), Ta Prohm was a Buddhist temple dedicated to the mother of King Jayavarman VII.A rare inscription at Ta Prohm provides statistics on the temple's workers. Allowing for some exaggeration to honor the king, the inscription's report of around 80,000 workers, including 2700 officials and 615 dancers, is still astounding.Sadly, Ta Prohm was looted quite heavily in recent years due to its relative isolation, and many of its ancient stone reliquaries have been lost."

Many of the corridors are impassible, thanks to the jumbled piles of carved stone blocks that clog their interiors.There are 39 towers at Ta Prohm, which are connected by numerous galleries. Visitors are no longer permitted to climb onto the crumbling galleries, due to the potential damage to both temple and visitor.

To avoid the droves of tourist, the worst being tour groups, go early in the morning, or save it for the lunch time. There is no way to enjoy this temple with the constant barrage of tourist inching closer behind you to keep moving to the next level.The appeal of Ta Prohm is the nature in which the forrest has reclaimed this temple. Most elements are still intact, and the intermingling of nature and the ancient building cannot be captured better than it is. The temple has not been completely restored, with areas of rockfall still blocking the passage to some areas. So you have to keep to the trail and follow the signage. Take a look at the map of the temple before venturing in as you are bound to get your orientation mangled up once you're inside.Another must visit in Siem Reap."

However it was absolutely crammed with tourists, many of them massive groups following a leader with a big flag. It was hard to enjoy the scenery at times with all of the noise and traffic. A lot of the place is carved out by little paths and these paths became super full. I heard a man in front of me say that it was like salmon trying to swim upstream. Even so, this is a spectacular area that 100% can not be missed. The mixture of man made and nature here is just incredible."

I've never seen Tomb Raider, so that reference didn't impress me, however, I was drawn to the imagery of the temple being swallowed by the jungle and imagined this is how the whole of Angkor would have been when the explorers first stumbled across it. I wasn't disappointed! Ta Prohm is impressive, to say the very least. It is so unique and very commanding. You can see and feel the power of the jungle that enveloped it. And yet, it has a overwhelming ethereal quality about it, graceful and beautiful. Yes, it is hot and yes, it is dusty and YES, it does get busy! However, it is worth it. I seesawed between wanting to run around and have adventures amid the closed courtyards, narrow corridors, tangled roots and the jumbled piles of carved stones to gently walking along and immersing myself in this spectacular history."

We entered through the West Gate -- that will take you inside the temple. If you wish to exit through the East Gate, you have to get out of the temple, and go around it, but still within the outer wall. Seems confusing, but there should be a sign there indicating that you can go around the temple, inside the wall bounds. You can buy cheap souvenirs right outside the gate. I made the mistake of buying small tokens in Angkor Wat, when it was way cheaper in Ta Prohm. They accept PHP, aside from USD."

After we had walked and seen the various interesting sections we then departed this Temple via another 'Gate' and proceeded out to the area where our Tuk-Tuk was awaiting us. Exiting here we cross the other section of the Moat and after a refreshment pit stop we proceeded to Ta Prohm which is some distance away.  There we stop at the entrance Gate and there is a l-o-n-g walk to the Temple. The 'path' is quite level and wide and is of compressed earth. At the end of the walk you arrive at Ta Prohm. What catches your eye immediately is the scene that has been depicted on countless of Post Cards, Photos, Paintings etc. i.e. the huge Tree that has grown over the ruins. This is nature claiming back . The tour of this Temple will show that there are a few more areas where Nature has claimed it's roots ... so to speak. Restoration work is slowly in progress as evident by cranes and blocked off areas. The section where there was a Chamber built for the King's Mother incorporating gems that supposedly caught the sunlight and illuminated the Chamber was fascinating but alas, all the Gems have been lost to robbers !!! and what is left behind are the holes where these Gems were once embedded in. A dream place for the avid photographer. Be patient for the crowds to clear so you can get the photo you want. Then, be prepared for that long walk back. However, do note that there are a few enterprising chaps who would offer a pillion ride on their scooters to the Gate for a small fee in US $ of course. Even the very young children selling souvenirs ... magnets , books etc. will trade in US dollars and mind you they will very cheekily ask for clean decent notes !!!! All in all, be prepared to walk and walk. Another item from our 'bucket list' that has been ticked off."

I think a lot of people will do this temple second or third in a day, so perhaps we had the advantage by heading straight here first thing. Ta Prohm has a certain tranquility that even some of the more unrestored temples didn't quite achieve. You can really imagine yourself as someone who simply stumbled upon this wondrous place whilst on a wee stroll in the jungle. Also - if you are in love with Ta Prohm, make sure you tack on Preah Khan and (if time allows) Boeng Mealea to your itinerary as they are also beautifully unrestored and have a similar feel."

Ta Prohm was probably the least known of the three, but we found it the most interesting. Of the three it was the most in disrepair and the least restored, but this significantly added to its charm. The jungle foliage had taken over much of the exterior which created some amazing views of trees, roots and vines growing what looked like straight from the rock to extend in every direction. It was also the least crowded of the 3 which was another bonus."

Sunset at Angkor Wat is definately something for the bucket list. It was very hot and tiring exploring the temples but such an amazing place in the world. The way the trees encapsulate this amazing temple is remarkable and beautiful. Pity about the huge numbers of Chinese tourists that embarked on the place with no respect of others.

This temple is different from most temples because the trees have taken over but this adds to the charm of the place. Unfortunately, some parts of the temple have fallen prey to the trees and have completely collapsed but sympathetic renovation work is ongoing to rebuild them but it will take years to do this.

The entire temple was emty and at first it seemed like I was the only human being inside the temple which made it even more exciting and almost a bit scary to explore it. Sudenly I heared voices and realized it was a two cleaners sweeping the floors of the temple. Phew so i wasn't completely alone. But I loved the emptiness at the time i visited so i could take pictures of spots without having any tourists photobombing my pictures. It was also a very peaceful walk which I quite enjoyed and found a lot of interesting spots inside the maze like Ta Prohm. Highly recommend this tourist attraction but come early so you can avoid the crowds"

A lot of this site has fallen down but I was happy to see they have a restoration project in progress. I think I love this site because it is so wild. Nature is doing her best to reclaim and the trees and root systems are amazing here. The temple is beautiful and I am pleased they are working to save it as it would be a huge shame to let it go. Well and truly worth a visit. I will always visit this particular temple each time I visit the area. I just love it. Don't forget,this was the temple that some of Tomb Raider was filmed in."

Yet so much of the structure is covered by intricate carvings.2/ Preah Khan - because I love the way nature and specifically the jungle over powers the temples. As Preah Khan is on the 'grand circuit' it isn't visited as much as the more busy temples on the 'small circuit'. And those fewer people add a richer feel to your experience. 3/ Ta Promhmis the best example of nature and temple fighting fluidly in stone. More beautiful than Preah Kahn, but way more crowded too"

What a difference lunch and an adjustment of perspective can make!After spending the morning at Angkor Wat then indulging in another delicious meal we were ready to take on Ta Prohm or as the tour guides seem to prefer the Lara Croft Temple.Our driver dropped us off at the East gate and told us to walk through the temple complex to the West gate and he would meet us there. Great we thought and set off down the wide dusty path towards the temples. We were surrounded by lush forest and could hear lots of birds along with music. We discovered about halfway to the Temple the music was from a group of land mine survivors playing a range of traditional Cambodian instruments. As we got closer to the temples we started to see piles of rubble and partially collapsed buildings, many with trees growing through them. We also reached the ticket inspectors at which point we discovered that one of our group had lost her ticket. Most likely it had fallen out of her pocket at Angkor Wat. We explained this to the ticket inspectors and showed them a photo of the ticket on her phone, yes she had taken a photo and luckily so we all thought but NO. No paper ticket equals no entry. No amount of discussion or request to be reasonable or compassionate would move the inspectors to allow her entry. So unfortunately she and her partner had to return to the East gate and get a tuk tuk around to the West gate whilst the rest of us continued on.It was absolutely amazing to see how the banyan trees had taken over whole sections of the temples. There are so many WOW, OMG, LOOK AT THAT moments it takes your breath away. There is just so much to look at and some many amazing photo opportunities to be had.Ta Prohm is a MUST SEE for anyone who visits Siem Reap. My meagre writing skills can not do justice to the spectacular, impressive, simply amazing sight of these massive trees growing out of the temples. For me the visit to Ta Prohm was the highlight of our trip! I would love to see it during a massive thunder storm. I feel that it would be a sensational experience!"

It set the bar for all the temples to come and it turned out to be my favorite.We visited it first thing in the morning (recommended) so it wasn't too busy yet. It was astonishing how the trees all grew around and through it. They really added to the spectacular nature of this temple. What amazed me about Ta Prohm (and all the temples at Siem Reap) was how accessible they are to visitors. There are no barriers around them (except where they might be working on some restorations). Visitors can walk through them, climb on them, touch them, trace the carvings. They are huge and jaw dropping. Each is different from the next. At Ta Prohm, I entered through a doorway and found a monk sitting quietly. I gave her $2 for a donation and she gave me a yarn bracelet along with a blessing for good health. I learned that I needed to keep the bracelet on for at least a week unless it fell off first. I ended up cutting it off after a week. I don't think it would ever have come off on its own - LOL! Anyway, I had a lovely moment with the woman and felt blessed my entire trip.Beware of all the vendors outside the temple. Unless you want to buy their merchandise, keep walking. Once you stop to see something (I did), they will all descend upon you. Especially if they see you take out your wallet. I did end up buying a beautiful cotton top. But had to fight my way back to the car afterwards. ;-)"

Hollywood asides it is without a doubt one of the more atmospheric temples in the Angkor complex, its surrounded by the jungle and has (of course) the trees growing around and within the temple itself; this is what makes Ta Phrom distinct in its own right. So before you rush to take the \"mandatory\" pictures of the tree roots made famous by Hollywood, take your time around Ta Prohm and its immediate surroundings and get a good feel of the temple. It's got its own unique ambiance which for me makes it stand out above most of the other temples around the Angkor complex."

It felt like the places he took us we were the only ones there!A definite must see and a highlight of my trip!"

You would get the effect of actually being in some kind of a movie here.. in general in all places in siem reap, I'd suggest carrying a guide book (lonely planet/whichever u prefer) to go about looking the places. I am not too sure if u would enjoy it the same way if u went with guides. I am not saying they r bad, but it's even more interesting to explore the places on ur own if u have the time n patience."

Its a beautiful site.Not much restoration has been done on this site, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. It's a shame that the new caretaker of the site opted to cut down some of the really old trees though. That was disappointing."

Here are some tips for all the temples if you are going to visit alot of them,prepare a day or two to visit them all and make sure to pack alot of water! 1.First what we did was buy ticket in a goverment controlled establishment (you a have a choice of a 1day 2day or 3day pass for all the temples included) we got the 1day pass for $20 and visited 6 temples.If you are not that into walking i would suggest to just visit bayon and angkor or just split the temples in different days for there will be alot of walking! 2.SLEEVLESS,SHORTS,SLIPPERS,SHADES AND SCARFS ARE NOT ALLOWED although sandals may be considered.but most importantly make sure to be comfortable to enjoy ur visit. 3.Just to be sure dont forget to check the weather,temples dont have roofs and there are only few convered area so if it is gonna rain i suggest you bring you rain coats or umbrella.Ps. Guides are available in temples if you are into history and culture i suggests you get one as of now they are not the rip off kind of guys that will try to fool you they are nice and knowledgable guys that can share real great stories as you stroll in the temples,and they also know secret sculptures and images that you might pass by."

The trees and ruins combine to create a memorable, extraordinary landscape that feels straight out of a movie set. The only weakness about Ta Prohm is that some of the corridors are tight, and when massive tour buses arrive, and hordes of tourists suddenly flood into one of these tight spaces, you can find yourself surrounded by scores of selfie-stick wielding adventurers. Some of the most special places in Ta Prohm are in somewhat confined quarters, and thus, they can get overrun by tourists at certain times of the day. Typically (though not always) tour groups start out from Siem Reap and work their way out from the city, stopping at Angkor Wat, Bayon, etc., before arriving at Ta Prohm. So, one solution to the overcrowding is to do the temples in the opposite order. Start at Ta Prohm and then work your way back toward Angkor Wat, back toward Siem Reap. In this way, you'll experience less crowds than if you follow the standard route.Even if you arrive at Ta Prohm at a busy time, there are wonderful parts of the complex that most groups don't see. So, ask your guide to take you to places where most tour groups don't go.It's an extraordinary temple. But it's even better if you can avoid the crowds. -- John Shors, bestselling author of Temple of a Thousand Faces: A Novel of Angkor Wat"

A Fascinating attraction which is unique from the others temple.The temple is almost swallowed by the forest and trees are growing on the temples.The huge roots of the trees grew over the walls around the temple and onto the temple structure, some have even went through the roof and invaded into the interior of the temples.Angkor Wat Temples pass is required to enter the temple.The 'Tomb Raider' Temple is in the deepest part of the temple compoundThe walkway is uneven and sandy, advised to wear sport shoes, for all the temple.Spent about an hour in Ta Prohm."

Ta Prohm is now forever inextricably linked with Lara Croft, but even for those of us who have never seen the movie, but have seen countless photos of trees sprouting out of temples, it is well worth a visit. I was another solo visitor who happened across an eager security guard who was happy to tag along, find photo opportunities, take photographs etc, and who I was happy to tip for his services. Cambodia is a country where the people are very poor, even in Govt jobs, so it is not uncommon for enterprising souls to try to find ways to supplement their income, no matter what we as visitors might think of the concept. It is a fact of life in Cambodia."

Unfortunately there are wooden walkways and platforms that have been built (within the last handful of years as far as I can tell) around the more popular areas of the temple so that takes away from the ruggedness a bit and makes it a bit more difficult to get some of the classic shots without obstructions. Still an amazing place to visit though."

Do the general route the other way around. We found out that this temple is almost empty late afternoon after 3pm.

The huge roots of the trees seem to be growing out of the structures themselves, making it difficult to see where nature starts and ends. It\u2019s amazing the buildings remain standing with these huge trees sprawling throughout them, even knowing the trunks are hollow, and in fact are now supporting these structures. Really an incredible sight to behold.We spent about 45 minutes here. It\u2019s quite a small site and although interesting we were here around midday and the heat was very intense. We had taken lots of water to drink but in May it was very hot and with the sun out not a lot of shade to take cover under.To visit any of the Angkor Wat temples you need to have an Angkor Pass, available in 1, 3 or 7 day passes. This gives you access to the temples for any of those number of days in a given week, or month if you have a 7 day pass, they don\u2019t have to be used on consecutive days. We went with a 3 day pass for $40. When you go to the main entrance to get your pass your photo is taken and printed on the pass, which you must present on each visit to a temple. We also visited Angkor Wat and Bayon Temple on the same day as they were included in our full day tour, however although it was beneficial going through these sites with the knowledge of a guide, due to the heat and the magnitude of what we were viewing if we could do it again we would leave these sites for a separate visit and take more time with each. We also found that this site didn\u2019t necessarily require a guide and could be self toured.We enjoyed travelling between the temples by tuk tuk, it was a unique way of travel for us and we also appreciated the cool breezes as we travelled."

Have one and a half hour exploring nearby village. The temple itself a bit different from my first visit on 2011. There is construction happening. It seems they remove some tree to preserve the temple construction. A bit disappointing but sure it needs to be done. So for the next few years, it would be different. And i prefer visit on rainy season (first visit) the weather much cooler and more greenery. At this time of year, temperature can rise up to 40 degree celsius. It's really hot."

The photographs of Ta Prohm cannot prepare you for your visit, everything is on a much grander scale that you could imagine. The temple was discovered having been overgrown by the jungle and many of the trees still remain, not least in part due to the fact that they are holding the building together. Ta Prohm was built in the 12/13th Centuries and is a utterly amazing feat of engineering. Beautifully carved and decorated this site is a must visit if in the Siem Reap area. There are many hidden gems such as faces peaking out between the tree roots, so if you have the money it is worth getting a tour guide as they know all the secrets. Either way Ta Prohm makes for a sensational visit, and allows for excellent photographic opportunities.Take lots of water and wipes, temperatures here get very high. This temple is famous from being in the Tomb Raider film."

Ta Prohm was our first temple visit in the Siem Riep area and what an introduction it was!It is a little trek from the entrance to get to the main portion of Ta Prohm which made what we saw all the more intriguing. When i saw the intertwining of tree and building for the first time i thought not only was it interesting but that this was the only one i would see so many photos were taken. Of course, unbeknownst to me there would be many more opportunities to appreciate the almost symbiotic relationship of plant and crafted stone. They say if the trees are removed much of the building would collapse and one can see how that could happen. Only later did we find out that there is a \"hidden buddha\", actually a tree that has grown in front of a buddha. We do not know where in Ta Prohm it is located. There are so many temples one can see in Siem Riep and people should definitely make an effort to include Ta Prohm. And what a cool souvenir your photo pass is as admission to the temples."

The temple does look like the scene we saw in movie..so real! The roots are \"eating\" into every structure they can grab..the veins so thick that it smashes thru stone walls. This is only temple in Angkor region that we witness many thick iron rods as structure reinforcement. Other temples mostly uses wooden planks. The local guide said, this temple used to be for little girls learning dance moves. Sounds Sanctuary. take note; there are 2 different entrance/exit (or tuk tuk drop-off points). So make sure you check the site very carefully..which is difficult cuz ruins look similar. If you end up wrong exit point, easily another 15mins to cut across the temple. This is a popular temple but smaller than Angkor Wat (main temple), so lesser drinks/snacks stall."

This temple was considerably more crowded than other areas, as it is arguably the most well known. Everyone there refers to it as the Tomb Raider temple. Despite the movie being over 15 years old, Angelina Jolie still has quite a following in Siem Reap. The ruins are simply amazing, and no pictures do it justice. It's quite amazing to be there, right in it, in an area where you've seen a million pictures from. It was definitely one of the highlights of our two week trips, and many friends are jealous of our photos. We spent about an hour there, and saw all that you possibly could.

The juxtaposition of the encroaching, overpowering trees against the seemingly immovable stone is quite stunning. Plan to spend a good amount of time here. There is a lot to see. I would recommend hiring a driver and going on your own. I don't do tours, as they kind of suck and you are always on a time schedule set by somebody else.

Also, the further into the site you get, the more spread out the crowd becomes. You can find stunning examples of trees & their roots without all the loud pushy tourists in your way.

At the entrance, there are very nice bathrooms, which are free if you show them your park ticket.There will be a couple of Buddhist Nuns in the interior of the Wat, who will bless you for $1USD and tie the red and yellow (long life and happiness) strings around your wrist."

Early Morning in one of the finest temples of Angkor - there are only a few left with roots and fig trees, some where broken allready after 600 years - but stil mystical.I remeber my first visit in 1992, a solider with a Kalashnikow guarded the entrance.He was to heads smaller than me, I asked myself, will he protect me if a Khmer Rouge is on the site? - that time Khmer Rouge were in the area! Jayavarman VII build the monastery in honour for his parents - good son! It's maybe 5km from Angkor Thom, and not so much crowded. March 2016, not the peak travel period. Maybe not all tour groups visit Ta Prom. It's my favourite from the big Three: Bayon, Angkor Wat and Ta Prom. Go very early it's open from sunrise . Now you are not allowed to climb to the galleries, 1992 my guide allowed me to step very carefully it was amazing and some of the best in my archelogical travel in my life. Don't do it today. The structures are so fragile due to broken roots and cut trees due to weather damages they had to cut some, but it's still the mystical ambiance, Henri Mouhot describes in his book Travel in Indochina (1867)"

I was looking forward to seeing this temple as it had been identified as the location of the Tomb Raider movie, and has been described in a number of guide books as being the temple that can give you the feeling that you have stumbled upon an undiscovered ancient tomb. However, I found that the complex has been sanitised with viewing platforms for photographs, with lines of people waiting their turn. It also appears that many of the trees have been cut back ( for preservation reasons). I still enjoyed the overall temple visit, and would highly recommend the full tour ( certainly one of the wonders of the world)."

The forest and temple coexist in a way that the border between the two is completely blurred - trees grow on top of and in the temple, eroding the walls of the once grand temple. There are arrows that generally guide you through the myriad of rooms but it's great fun to detour and explore a bit on your own. This temple is quite a bit different from the other temples in the broad Angkor Wat site and cannot be missed."

I had always wanted to go to Angkor wat and had not appreciated the number and variety of other temples. It is an amazing site and can only be fully appreciated in person. We had a private guide who we had through booking our holiday with TrailFinders, but there are plenty of official guides you could book with over there and it does add a lot to the tour, so is worth doing. We did all of the main sites in 1 day, but you could easily spread this across 2 or 3 days if you wanted to take it a bit slower and wander around some of the smaller sites. This is one day that will stay with me for a long time."

There are photographs to be had but great patience is needed to get any without a few tourists blocking out some of the scene you want. This is not a place for the less sure of foot; indeed most temples aren't. Wooden stairs up and down, uneven tunnel and paths and piles and piles of fallen blocks add hurdle after hurdle.I can see why it is rated highly as the tree roots are extraordinary, the few carved stones and arches that are left standing are in good condition, and despite everything there are some spots that one can find where the coach loads are not led.Tip: go at lunch when others are at the trough."

Be there at the gate by 7:20, so that when they open the gate at 7:30am, you're the first to get in and are AHEAD of any groups, and get to walk through this magical place, just hearing birds and crickets chirping, with morning sunlight filtering through the trees!I promise it will be a VERY different experience than going any other time of the day, slowly making your way through while sandwiched between Chinese tour groups."

The temple is especially tranquil in the morning, as crowds often flock to Angkor Wat and other more prominent temples as their first attraction of choice. When walking around Ta Prohm, be sure to follow the signs, or risk getting lost or missing out on places of interest within the monument. While some areas have been closed to the public, there are hindden scenery that can be found by going off the beaten track. Make your way through the narrow and dark passages, for some interesting finds.Ta Prohm is \u2018the\u2019 photographer\u2019s playground.

            "review": "Interesting for different reasons. This temple, as depicted in the many photos you come across, is in ruins. Nature and man have destroyed a lot of it, and this sets it apart from Angkor and Ta Prohm. This gives it a much different feel, more ancient and real almost. Very few remaining carvings unlike Bayon where the carvings are tremendous.It is also much smaller and set on one level, so very accessible. Great photo ops. On reflection If you have concerns about your capacity to visit all three in one day due to heat or fitness issues. I would do this temple first, Bayon second and use any remaining energy reserves for Angkor."

            "review": "My favorite of the temples of Siem Reap. its the \"Tomb Raider\" temple, but its amazing and a proper strategy helps see.. I am going to use the same review sturcture i used for angkor wat. There are a couple of things to understand about the temples in general in Siem Reap. If you want to read about Ta Prohm only then jump to #8This is one of those sites that delivers through all of the built up anticipation. Like many other wonders of the world, there are hundreds of sites, tours, guides, and ancillary services that are offered adjunct to exploring the ruins themselves. Understand that Angkor Wat is one ruin in a whole network of ruins over miles and miles of area. The most important part of a visit here is to simply educate yourself, get a good guide or driver and see the right things at the right time. First thing to consider is time of year. I went over the new years time and there are hundreds of thousands of people with the same idea. Its high season with a capital H, so if you are planning on taking photographs without people in them, either forget it, or you better be really good at photoshop. If you are coming specifically to photograph, i would recommend a time of year that is less popular. Then there is the next part...WHAT should i do? How do i start planning this? There are a million sites that all say they are the right way... 1. Start with your budget. Budget depending, chose your hotel.The choice of hotel might determine your options for guide services. For example if you stay at the Shinta Mani hotel..(even if you don't...you should visit since its the #1 hotel by TA. and its amazing) they will get your tour together for you. If you are on more of a budget, get your self your own guide / driver. The difference between a guide and a driver is that a guide can give you the history of each of the locations and a driver can only take you between the locations. Sometimes they can be both in one. I went with a tour guide / driver who was amazing and is on trip advisor. He name is Da Mao. He is one of the main tuk tuk drivers of the shinta mani hotelHe has a tuk tuk which is one of the best ways to get around. If you are sensitive to heat, you may want to opt for an air conditioned car. 2. Plan the temples and the time of day you want to hit them. Sunrise is a popular time because you can take spectacular photographs. Angkor wat is the most famous of all of the ruins and therefor one of the most popular at sunrise. I recommend getting up around 4:00 am and heading out around 4:30 - 5:00 am. (in december) 3. You will need to buy entrance tickets. They are around 20$ for one day and 40$ for 3 days. The lines are HUGE during christmas time. I opted for the 3 day even though i only planned one day simply because there was a shorter line. However you can put the 3 days to use if you buy the pass anyway. 4. When you get to angkor wat, i would recommend going directly inside the complex and to the small \"lake\" all of the photographers wait there to get the \"post card\" shot of Angkor Wat with the sun rising and reflecting in the \"lake\". I want to reiterate the lake on the inside (not the moat on the outside. It is best to go straight there are ALL pro photographers are trying to get to that same spot. So you will have to vie for position.5. Bring some food with you so you can eat a little something while inside. It is a HUGE temple and takes quite a while to see in its entirety. 6. Keep in mind that it is an ACTIVE functional temple so discrete clothing is REQUIRED and should be respected. This means that the ladies need to cover their shoulders and have skirts that go below the knee. You will some some tacky tourists in hotpants due to the heat, but it REALLY looks tacky and disrespectful and they may flat out refuse to let you in.7. Once you have seen enough of this temple and grounds its time to head off to the other temples like Ta Prohm (tomb raider temple) and Bayon (smiling face temple). Due to the timing of seeing the sun rise at angkor wat you will be hitting bayon closer to mid day. As a photographer all of the temples are less visually interesting in the high sun, but it is still great fun to explore. Bayon is really cool and kind of a labyrinth and requires much more vertical climbing up stairs compared to angkor wat. Enjoy it. 8. Ta Promh is the one i hit last in my tuk tuk trifecta. This was my favorite. This temple cant be explained with words. All i can say is go. It is COMPLETELY surreal. It is straight out of a dream or movie or some other incomprehensible scenario. It is the perfect example of a temple swallowed by the jungle almost perfectly. If you tried to make this on purpose i dont think it could have ever been possible to man make something to look like this. JUST GO....and if you have it in you take the \"long\" walk inside. There is a long and a short walk,...but why short change this experience.There are children selling ALL SORTS OF EVERYTHING...as cute as they may be...DONT buy maps or ANYTHING from them. You are actually keeping them out of school by perpetuating a living that avoids education by glamorized begging. there are plenty of non profits that you can donate to. I know its hard but its really important to help the local children become educated.I hope this was helpful and if you got a few things out of this....respect the clothing in the temples...dont buy from children and dont miss sunrise, and bring a wide angle and telephoto."

All of them, if standing alone, far away from the others, would be mind-boggling impressive and well worth visiting. However, since there are so many great structures on the property, it gets a bit overwhelming, and one tends to get \"templed out\"......if you have the get up and go to see them all, go for it....but if you only have a day or so, be SURE to visit Ta Prohm after visiting Angkor Wat.

Yes, this temple is also known as the Tomb Raider temple, made famous by the 2001 movie Lara Croft: Tomb Raider. But if your expecting to find an inner chamber with a four faced statue guarded by monkey gods and lion-dogs then you will be disappointed, because that was all done in a movie studio somewhere. As you can see from some of the photos I took, parts of the temple have tumbled to the ground and other parts are under renovation. The renovated parts are so well done it is almost imperceptible. There was a huge crane on site when we went but it did not detract at all from the overall beauty of this temple.

However, during my two visits over two days (in 44C heat!), I had the opportunity to meet, talk to and enjoy the music of the War and Land-Mine disabled musicians found near the East and West gates. If every tourist who raises a camera or iPad gave a few dollars to these guys, their lives and those of the 100 plus family members they support would be really improved. They are really doing something amazing, plus keeping the traditions of Kmer Mahori music alive in their villages. They also put aside a portion of donations to help other local war-disabled unable to earn even a meagre living - we owe it to them as they add to our pleasure of this magical place.The next time a young person at home uses the term 'Awesome', I'll tell them that awesome is a place like Ta Prohm and the people of the Angkor villages round about."

I will keep this review short and sweet for Ta Prohm is to be seen to be believed- there are no words to justify this ancient temple sufficiently which is a remarkable example of a fusion between man and nature to create what appears to all like a genuine Hollywood set ( Ta Prohm has famously been featured in Tomb raider). Over the last few hundred years since Ta Prohm was abandoned birds have been dropping seeds in the crevices and cracks of the rocks that make up this beautiful temple. The result is that trees have slowly grown and separated the rocks and in places appear to have fused and become part of the structure. Having visited a number of temples in Anghor this is probably our favourite due to this ( for fear of repeating myself) amazing relationship between man and nature. Definitely get a guide as they can show you the quickest and most rewarding route through the temple as the crowds of tourists could spoil your enjoyment of this wonder. I would like to put a special mention in for our guide who was with us for 4 days and guided us through a number of temples with not only professionalism and humour but a genuine love and respect for the architecture, skill and people that built these amazing structures. His name is:Mr Ngeth Samol and if anyone wants his e-mail address please contact me"

Our guide said that bird dropping with seeds are the cause for the vegetation and tree growth in and around the temples. Sounds feasible to me. There is also one very curious carving on the walls of Ta Prohm. It is a carving of what looks like a stegosaurus, a dinosaur that predates this temple by about 155 million years. An alternate story is that it is a mythological Hindu beast. I posted the pic, you decide! :)"

It was fun to see the parts that I've seen in films like Laura Croft Tomb raider. I recommend a private guide. It is really in expensive and they add so much more depth to the experience. If you don't have a guide try to eves drop or watch where they direct their group to stand or look."

Our driver dropped us at the East gate and told us he would be waiting at the West gate.The exterior was not much to look at. Crumbling walls and entry ways. We walked a few minutes and made it to the entry to the main temple. Along the walk, we had trees on either side proving some shade to protect us from the sun. There was also a band that played music. This group was raising money for landmine victims and some of the musicians appeared to be those same victims.The interior is the main temple which is still in various states of repair and decay. What makes this temple so special is the manner in which the trees have grown into the structure. While this growth gives the temple it's unique atmosphere, it is also slowly destroying this temple. The moat that used to surround it was dried up.The images inside are unforgettable. I have not seen anything like this in all my travels around the world. The temple was less crowded but you would still need to queue to get the good photos. Once of the most unique photo opportunities was of the Buddha face peeking out from between tree roots.This temple provides much more shade opportunities than the others. Again, dress smart. Wear comfortable shoes. Some parts of this temple are in a state of disrepair and wearing shoes like heels of any kind would be a really bad idea.Ta Prohm is definitely one of the \"must-see\" temples that provides a unique experience worth the time spent."

You enter at the West gate and eventually leave via the east gate. Ta Prohm really gives you an idea of how the temples must have been when they were discovered. The visit is unspoiled, i.e. no facilities, or guides/ signs on site, you have to arrange this before you arrive. I would recommend you use a guide so that you don't miss some of the special carvings, the site is huge and it would be easy to miss something, or even get lost!One point worth knowing is that you can buy the entrance tickets the night before and the site opens at 7.30. despite asking for an early visit we got there at 8.30 when the ticketing area was very busy. We took the whole morning on Angkor Thom and Bayon, you will need to get out of the heat by 12. We saw AW in the late afternoon, and our guide was right the light was just right for photos."

It's the most bizarre experience, which if not for the crowds, would be downright spooky.!! Massive, and I mean massive, tree roots, make for the classic Tomb Raider scenario photo, which unfortunately is probably why a good percentage of tourists head here...Thanks Hollywood.! But for me, it was just a sensational experience to see a rambling, part-collapsed, temple complex, in the middle of jungle that over time has been completely engulfed by nature. NOT the kind of place to be abandoned, alone, at night, with all the jungle noises...but then again,,!!!Sensible, comfortable footwear ESSENTIAL for this one.!Enjoy the absolute surrealism of the place, and all it's crumbling, disorganised beauty...and chaos.!!!"

Having a tour guide was very informative and entertaining as there were things we tried that we wouldn't have known about otherwise.

There are about 4 trees with sections of temple attached where you can see how it used to look and a few Sections where you can go inside.

I found such beauty in its delapidation, the piles of \"rubble\" among the structures that have withstood the ravages of time. I loved the wonky stone wall surrounding this ancient city, the bulk of which is till miraculously standing after centuries, and the encroachment - or rather co-existence- of nature among the ancient architecture.Having said all that, I am glad there are internationally-funded restoration works afoot.Tip: It is a one way circuit once you're in and the tour groups speaking myriad languages descend, and the guides get a bit shirty if you try to go against the tide, so take your time or perhaps at a later, quieter time...and take reliable mobile phones if you don't want to lose anyone if you become separated like we did. So glad we took spare phones and invested in local SIM cards!"

To the left are stones which are ordered and hopefully will be used to be put back. In front of the temple is a stone floor which would have been a dance floor and would have had a roof. The engraved imagery on the walls and carvings have interesting tales to tell. The trees that have sprouted out of the building and downward are of course fascinating.

The trees growing out of the ruins are perhaps the most distinctive feature of Ta Prohm. These start with just a seed dropped on the roof by say a bird for the tree to grow.UNESCO listed Ta Prohm on the World Heritage List in 1992.The temple of Ta Prohm was made famous and used as a location in the film Tomb Raider.One that must be included in your temple tours."

There are numerous places where amazingly determined trees have taken root in and around the ruins. Being one of the more famous temples it gets very crowded, so arrive early if possible. Firsthand tip: if you walk a bit north of the temple (there are trails) you can find an original gate with faces similar to Bayon temple; I've attached a photo. It's very cool and chances are you'll be the only one there!"

It certainly leaves a sense of awe and amazement of these huge trees and vines that have rooted itself onto the temple ruins. While there has been extensive restoration at this site, the jungle overgrowth have been tamed somewhat but the trees affixed to the ruins remained since this complex was rediscovered. The jungle overgrowth is a distinct feature of Ta Prom and adds an air of forbiddance as you wander through the complex. Many corridors have collapsed but it is still a beautiful temple to explore."

This is due mostly to the fact that the jungle has been allowed to flourish, in a controlled manner, in the temple complex. The results are such that the root systems of the mature strangler fig and the silk-cotton trees become parts of the stonework. Sometimes it's difficult to see if the roots are holding up the temples or the other way around! I was impressed in Ayutthaya, Thailand when I first saw the roots of a tree completely, over the centuries, engulfed the fallen head of a Buddha. That pales in comparison with what you'll see at Ta Phrom, both in scale and in complexity! For being featured in the Tomb Raiders, it's quite accessible and relatively free from crowds! I suppose that most tourists have only so much energy and the expend it at the \"major site\" of Angkor Wat so that by the time they get to Ta Phrom, they're exhausted and don't spend as much time exploring this beautiful place. However, to make sure you don't have to share the temple with too many people, you should come at opening hours or the hours before closing. Also, don't skip it just because it's raining - that's when the crowd is thinner and the photo ops are even better! Your multi-day ticket is good jere!"

But with so much of it in a collapsed state, it\u2019s hard to believe that this place had once been the filming location of a big hollywood movie.A whole tree growing on the roof, with roots cradling the temple before finally reaching the ground is indeed a sight to remember.How long would it last before the temple collapses under the weight of that massive tree? It serves as a grim reminder that we can only borrow from the earth for so long.

Take one look at Ta Prohm and the instant impression is of some place where time has stood still.The ruins are as they were when people walked away for the last time, but the giant trees and their roots snaking over everything provide a sort of \u201csleeping beauty\u201d atmosphere.It is as if the trees and the jungle are keeping the place safe which is far from the truth since their incursions have tumbled many a building and left restorers with a serious task.The site is most recently famous for being used as a location to shoot some scenes for the Tomb Raider film with Angelina Jolie.Entry as with all temple sites in this area is via a one day pass for $20 or a three-day pass for $40. The pass has an electronic photo of you which is taken at issue and it should be carried at all times as guards and officials regularly check visitors.When I toured the site my guide and I were there fairly early before the big tour groups start to arrive, so we often had sections of the site to ourselves or with only a few other people in sight, by far the best way to experience the ruins.I clambered about with my attention drawn to this giant stone face or that carving, my guide really earning his $35 a day fee by ensuring I saw things and places I would never have discovered on my own.Many sections of the ruins are too dangerous to go in to, fractured by tree roots or the passage of time to a point where they are unstable, but there are many other sections where you can wander freely in awe at what you see. Good trainers or boots are essential as terrain is rugged and very uneven as you\u2019d expect among ruins.There are wonderful carvings everywhere you go, hidden doorways leading to small rooms, ceilings created by stepped stones, the remains of statuary and some slightly grimmer sights of damaged stonework where the Khymer Rouge or others looted artefacts to sell.You need to keep your wits about you and have a good guide who knows the site because some points of interest are tiny and hidden away, notably a small stone face which peeps shyly through a gap between two large tree roots which have grown over its niche.Everywhere you go are fresh wonders, startling tree root formations or unusual carvings. One actually gives a hint as to how the temples were built, showing men at work on construction.You can spend hours just wandering around and the need for toilets and food may be an issue. Both are available close by and I enjoyed a traditional dish of Amok chicken served to me inside a coconut with a very welcome glass of iced tea in a small jungle restaurant.Don\u2019t miss a visit to this spectacular temple but get there early or late to avoid the crush."

Made famous by the Tomb Raider movie, this is the 12th century temple complex where the indigenous trees have been left to engulf and entwine the creation of man. The conservationist decided to leave a great deal of this complex au naturale, so expect to find many roped-off sections where the blocks have fallen and are sitting in piles. Nonetheless, this is an amazing site. Go in the early morning to avoid the streams of tourists that buzz through."

Who doesn't want to be able to say that they have been to the Tomb Raider Temple, truthfully though, this was our third temple of the day and I was done in probably 15mins. It was actually a good insight in to how the temples really have held up over the years, as this place has had very little reconstruction/conservation work done to it, unlike the other temples, it has instead been more preserved as it was when re-discovered. If you are visiting the other temples, then you'd have to come here for a look, but if you are considering only visiting one temple, I wouldn't make it this one."

The trees have rooted themselves around the building stones and it is a beautiful mingling of man and nature. It is a long walk in and out, be aware. The city walls are a kilometre a side and you walk into the temple in the centre. Definitely take the long walk around the temple, it is nicer than the shorter walk. One recommendation, most people will choose to go to Angkor Wat first, so this will probably be later in the day and there are vendors everywhere outside these temples, buy a cold coconut for a refreshing drink and enjoy it in your TukTuk on the way.

Although, navigating through the temple is difficult with the crowds this temple with the Fig trees joining with the rock that was laid over 1000 years ago, it is a sight to behold. I found it to be amazing to see and was thinking how advanced the Khmer people, must have been to build such structures. You will enjoy this and the other temples of Angkor Watt should you go. This was my second time to Cambodia and second time to Angkor Watt and this temple. I am still in awe of it all."

There are in excess of 1000 temples within the Angkor complex, with Ta Prohm being one of the \"Big 3\" that people visitThis temple is also known as the \"Tomb Raider Temple\" as it was here that a big chunk of the film was set. This temple has been reclaimed by the jungle where Strangler Figs and Kapok Trees have entwined themselves around the ruins. It is an incredibly atmospheric ruin made up of several towers, closed courtyards and narrow corridors to explore round the site. This temple is undergoing a lot of restoration funded by the Indian government at the time of writing, but still it is very much open and is one of the key places people visit. The huge trees that have taken over the site are the ones you usually see in pictures of the complex, with one particular large tree featuring as the Tree of Life\" in Tomb Raider. It is a must see if you visit the site, but it does get busy and the amount of tourists with selfie sticks really does start to grate..."

While Angkor Wat (one of the Wonders of the World) is the star attraction in Siem Reap, it is realistically just a bigger and better preserved site than some other temples.Wat Prom, however, only a short distance away,is totally unique and mind-blowing. We have never seen anything like it. This site (where the Angelina Jolie movie Lara Croft, Tomb Raider was partly filmed) has large trees growing on top of, out of, and around the ancient stone temple complex. It is incredible to see what mother nature has done here."

They have a lot of spectacular spots for the photography lovers.It was the site for the movie Tomb Raider. The place could do a bit better job of managing tourists to make sure they don't destroy this temple as it is basically free reign of the place. Angkor Wat is huge, Bayon has a different design with the faces, but the jungle and nature revolving around this temple makes it my personal favorite.

Perhaps they didn't die out 150 million years ago after all. Afterwards we drove around the small circuit. The many other temples along the way are overwhelming in their number, size, and reasonable state of repair. The crumbling castles that I grew up near in the UK are pitiful in comparison with these ancient structures for architecture, size, an ornate carvings. The ancient Khmer could teach us much about building with stone."

We visited Angkor Wat for sunrise, and while other people still busy exploring Angkor Wat after sunrise or still having breakfast in Angkor Wat, we headed up to Ta Prohm. Not like Angkor Wat, Ta Prohm have one way to get around and the track already been set up, you can't go back once you pass the big iconic tree on Tomb Rider movie, you have to keep on going and go around then get out from the right side of the entrance. So if you like taking picture without many people around, come early. We get there around 7.30 am after watching sunrise in Angkor Wat. No guide will tell you information, you will walk and just looking on the ruins. There's only one big information board right after the entrance. So, if you're interested in Ta Prohm history, google it before you visit it. On the entrance, you will be welcomed by kids selling souvenirs or coconut and they were pretty annoying forcing you to buy their stuff. Just keep on walking and say thanks, when you stop they will all come offer you stuff. All at once!When you're leaving, you will exit from the same gate, they will do the same thing too. Good luck"

Most tourists stick to the wooden path where the main sights also are, but it is very well worth leaving the track for short exploring in the other corridors. This is an easy way to find solitude even in the most hectic tourist hours and you\u2019ll find other strangler trees almost just as good as the ones tour groups are herded past. But don\u2019t forget to go the wooden path as well. The main sights ARE worth seeing! AS for alternatives to Ta Prohm \u2013 yes there are similar temples but still \u2013 there is a special feeling around Ta Prohm that shouldn\u2019t be skipped."

It is spectacular to see the way the trees grow on top of the structures. We were there in the dry season so most of the trees had lost their leaves and with it the 'jungle' feeling. It was still awesome. This temple has been badly damaged by nature and man in the past and parts are under restoration. We visited Ta Prohm as part of a Grasshopper cycles tour and our guide Som was so knowledgeable, it was quite a bonus to have him explaining things to us. "

The trees growing over the temples are 300-400 years old, and so huge, pictures do not do them justice.  The sun is really hot in this part of Asia, so be prepared, especially after 10 am. Toilet facilities are in-between the big temple complexes, so plan accordingly, and western styles are available. Foods and drinks can be had outside more temple areas, usually everything is one USD. I did not need to buy local money for 4 days here. Everyone wanted USD. Tickets for all the temples are bought just outside of Siem Reap on the main road to Angkor Wat. $20 for one day or $40 for three days. Children under I think 12 had a discount."

It's where nature has decided to take over the temple. It's just a special place to visit. You don't need to be religious to appreciate how special this place is. I recommend to just sit in the temple and take in everything in.Hot Tip: after seeing the sunrise at Angkor Wat drive straight here. (See Angkor Wat another day or in the afternoon) If you do you will have the place to yourself as the bus loads of tourists will arrive as you leave."

We'd never seen anything like it - tree roots growing on the temple everywhere. We were told that anything dead is removed, but active growth isn't cut. We suggest having an air-conditioned car and driver rather than a tuk tuk or bicycle to get there, unless you have lots of time and don't mind sweating in the heat all day long. We probably overpaid, we didn't bargain, but an air-conditioned Lexus with English speaking driver and professional guide, all to ourselves, was $80 plus entrance fees for the day with hotel pickup and drop-off and worth every penny. Everything in Siem Reap is paid for in dollars, so don't bother getting any Cambodian money. We used tuk tuks in town, $1-2 a trip. The temples are not to be missed, and the more time you have to explore with a guide the better."

            "review": "Easily the most crowded site at angkor. Of all the temples at the Angkor site, Ta prohm, or the \u2018tomb raider temple\u2019, is probably the site where the tourists are most densely packed. At almost all the temples you are free to just wander around whatever way you want, but at Ta prohm, even if you are not part of a tour group, there is a definite flow pattern to the tourists and deviating from it is not easy. Most visitors head to the right as they approach the main building (following the \u2018way of visit\u2019 signs) and then enter the main temple by deviating left again. After traversing the main building you then exit at the back. By turning right as you exit at the back, you can then walk around the side of the temple and this is where the famous \u2018Ta prohm tree\u2019 is located. Nowadays, there is a line of people waiting to be photographed in front of the tree. The line is on an elevated boardwalk, and when you finally get to the front of the line you cannot get right up to the tree itself. When we visited (mid afternoon) the line was about 40 people long. Note: if you don\u2019t want to wait: there is an equally impressive tree at Preah Kahn that you don\u2019t need to line up to be photographed with, and you can get right up to it. We went against this flow of traffic by not entering the main building at the front, and walking around to right, going immediately to \u2018the tree\u2019, and around to the back of the building intending to go into the back door. BUT this was a mistake because there was a guy at the back door stopping people entering the \u2018wrong way\u2019. Because most people go through the main building, or to the right side (as you approach it from the main entrance), the left side is relatively peaceful and much less crowded, and here you get a real feel for how nature has reclaimed the temple over the last 500 years. It is extremely atmospheric in places on this side, and I imagine if you get a time in the day when there are fewer visitors it would be the same all over. In some places the view was distinctly marred by the presence of an enormous yellow crane. For me it was the least enjoyable of the temples we went to."

So when you go to Ta Prohm in 2018, you will no longer see these Sprung trees growing out of the Ta Prohm Temples :-( I don't know whether this is good or bad...but the uniqueness of this place will be gone. I mean - most people remember Ta Prohm as the place where there are tall Sprung trees growing out of the temple ruins right? I was here from 8am to 9am. This temple ruins is not very large. And with a private guide and car, you can visit the important parts of the temples and skip the uninteresting parts.Important Reminder:Be prepared to walk and walk...and walk!

While thousands of tourists made a beeline for Angkor Wat before sunrise, I asked my tuk-tuk driver to drop me off at Ta Prom at 5:00 am.Mind you, I had arrived in Siem Reap the evening before and had no idea what lay ahead in the Angkor Archeological Park. I learned that morning at those early hours, it was pitch black and I had no flashlight on me. Luckily a few sunrise worshippers arrived at the same time so I followed their light to the front of Ta Prom. What a way to start my visit to Angkor.As the sky lightened, Ta Prohm slowly appeared like magic. The giant tree roots that grow over the temple added to the mysterious surrounding. As I walked deeper into the ruins, I was enchanted by the carvings and the structures. Before the visit, I had thought there was only one tree that grew over the ruins, but the number was endless.It was the best way to start my visit to Angkor. Tips: Try to get there before sunrise and explore the ruins before hords of tourists arrive."

It is larger, equally interesting and has the same cotton trees growing over segments as well. Fewer tourists over a larger site = better experience."

Well preserved and steeped in history with it's famous ancient fig trees which have integrated with the buildings structure from when the jungle retook the temple. To miss the crowds I would recommend visiting either in the early morning or late afternoon where you can explore the temple more freely, but I would also recommend a guide to supply further details about the history of this temple. I would recommend bringing a water, sun screen, a hat and a camera to capture some great pictures of this truly picturesque site. You can also enjoy traditional Cambodian music on the walk to the site which is nice."

Even on New Year's day, we got there around 6am, and other visitors began around the same time.If you are a keen photographer, and want to take photos of the entire strangler fig tree, then you will need something as wide as a 20mm lens (on full frame). 28mm just isn't wide enough.Another neat trick is to take pictures of these awesome trees and ruins using the panoramic shot within your phone.

Ta Prom is the temple you're looking for - the trees tangled in the walls and fallen blocks make for the mystical shots you've seen in any article on Cambodia. The downside is that the number of hawkers around the perimeter are in plague proportions. Another important tip is to be wary of (yes, got caught out!) Is the location of the gates. I intended to do a loop and exit through the East gate. Instead I performed a double loop half gainer and ended up out the West gate. This, apparently, was alarming for my family but routine for our tuktuk driver, so, we all survived. Shooting in the temple - I found the Nikon+ 14-24 & Fujifilm X30 worked out well. Tripods & monopods are frowned upon, which is a shame, but stopping down, shifting WB to shady and being flexible with EV gives excellent results."

One can't survive without the other now. Walking around you have the impression of being in a surreal place, with the strong light of the sun only filtering from the branches and the ruins covered in green musk. Don't miss it!!"

I enjoyed the peace and tranquility of the canopied tree lined walk to the temple, with the dappled sunlight and bird song, then the spectacular reveal of that magnificent tree twisting through the temple. It is a smaller complex so can be covered in an hour, but I could have easily sat and enjoyed the serenity in the gardens. I would recommend getting there between 7.30 and 8, both to beat the heat and the crowds."

Trees grow through, around and out of these imposing temples \u2013 and the ambience is awesome. Nature has taken over Man\u2019s efforts. The structures are large but the trees engulf them. Some bas reliefs do exist but they are not as stunning as at other temples.I had returned after nearly 20 years \u2013 and the provision of steps and gentle roped-off guide paths were welcome.

Many tourists were visiting at the same time and I found progress rather slow due to congestion. Watch your step as the paths and terraces are uneven. Spot the carved face surrounded by a strangler fig and the butt (or bum) tree as described by my jovial guide."

There were a few times when progress through the temples came to a standstill due to the crowds in confined, unrestored ruins, and dark corridors that need a careful path.Ta Prohm has a real \"Laura Croft\" feel about it due to the closeness of the jungle and the intentional policy of not cutting back the vigorious vegetation, and particularly, leaving invasive trees inside (often quite literally) the walls of the temple as well as inside. The power of nature, shown in the tree invading, and the moving centuries old walls of this unique site. This policy of non interferance sits heavily on Ta Prohm, giving it that almost mystical feel, and advance of the vegetation and numerous trees growing within the temple is both a cause for celebration (of Natures power), and future food for thought.Unmissable."

It is currently under reconstruction (December, 2015) so there's cranes and other maintenance equipment about, so I'm not sure how it will look when it's completed its overhaul. Hopefully not too dissimilar. I really like the crumbly aspect of Ta Prohm. I also noticed that there are now platforms and barricades preventing you from walking right up to the walls and trees. I'm guessing it's because of the influx of tourists (Cambodia estimates it will get an increase of 2 million tourists within the next couple of years, so I recommend going soon). It's a shame that hoards of people visit this temple for the sole reason of \"Tomb Raider was filmed here\" as it's a magnificent beauty in its own right and doesn't need a movie to advertise it. It also made it's harder to enjoy the natural, crumbling, mossy beauty of the place when you have tons of people clamouring to get a photo in front of the 'Tomb Raider tree's. Do not let that you stop you though because it's an exquisite site. I'm so happy I got to visit it.

Everyone links Ta Prohm to Tomb Raider and you would see why. Along with the fact that a scene was shot there, the place does feel mysterious. However, it can get very crowded which makes taking pictures rather difficult, but all the visitors were nice enough to line up and take pictures in turns. One of the trees now has a boardwalk built around it so you can no longer take the same picture as seen on postcards. I've been to Beng Mealea and I recommend going to both. They are very different but equally impressive. But if you only have so little time, pick Ta Prohm cos it's closer and more famous and a trip to Angkor Park isn't complete without a visit to Ta Prohm. "

We walked by all the crowded spots (the best photo spots) because we could barely get by the big tour groups and decided to come back to see what we had missed. We went from 7:00am-8:00am and I'd suggest going even earlier to have more quiet. There were still enough people that you might have to wait a few minutes to get the photo you want, but everyone was at least pretty respectful and quiet at that time of morning. It's also significantly cooler so more enjoyable. Go early to truly enjoy the beauty and wonder at Ta Prohm! Don't let the big crowds steal the experience of being in this awesome place."

You have to spend time to explore the inside of the temple as well as to stroll the outskirt of the temple where you can see many spectacular big trees. It is easily the best temple in the Angkor Wat area. I prefer the ruins to the restored temples which many often are not done well showing the modern touches. A must see temple when you are in Siem Reap."

When I came is year, it seemed that part of the magic that Ta Prohm had once held was gone. Due to erosion and a few architectural problems, tourists are now not permitted to venture wherever they wish and have to be cattle herded in one direction...and with the amount of tourists that still visit this site you really do feel claustrophobic in the sea of bodies. I wanted Ta Prohm to always be my special place of visitation but now it holds no meaning for me. Oh, I would still suggest you go, if nothing else to feel like Lara Croft, but the tourist trap that it has become does nothing for me. I hope people's experience can outweigh mine for the better."

It's hard to get lost here because there are people at every turn. And the authorities refused to restore it because the tourists like the \"lost city\" vibe too much.Admittedly, my bias comes from being an archaeologist in the region, but there are plenty better temples at Angkor to visit. If you want the same vibe, less tourists, and less clout, go to Preah Khan, Banteay Kdei, or Ta Som. All of them are Jayavarman VII-era temples outside the traditional \"small circuit\" of Angkorian tourism, but are most definitely worth the trek."

This is one of those things that needs to be seen with your own eyes. We did a Grasshopper pushbike tour and thoroughly enjoyed it as it covered a few different temples and riding the wall of one temple. If you get a good guide they'll explain the history of the temples which is amazing to hear - especially for an Aussie when we come from such a comparatively young country. We'd heard Angeline Jolie was back in Siem Reap visiting temples for an up and coming movie, so we were hoping to see her again but sadly we didn't.Of all the temples this one was in the worst state, so if you're considering a trip to see the temples best to go sooner rather than later. Eventually there will be so much movement among the trees and structures that I imagine it would become too dangerous to get close to, and that will be an incredible shame."

Would have missed a few of the best areas without his advice.The approach is in the shade due to the amount of trees in the area, so it felt a bit cooler here than Angkor Wat.The only thing needed to get the most out of a trip to Ta Prohm is a lot of patience.It is not overcrowded in general but the spots from which to take a good photograph were much sought after at the time of our visit. Plus quite a lot of other tourists take a mind boggling amount of \"selfies\", go figure.Some of the temple staff were helpful enough to take a few of our group pics and assist folk to take panorama shot, nice one.Your patience will be rewarded however and this temple should be very high on your list if time is short in Siem Reap.Take a look at our travel map, we joined TA late in life and only review the places we have been to since joining. You may wish to trust our judgement on this masterclass of old temple versus the jungle."

I've read about it, seen pictures, and on the big screen (It's in Tomb Raider). Literally every nook, cranny and corner you turn there is another epic picture! The grounds are being over taken by the jungle, giant banyans climbing their way super high in the sky, taking down the historic structures below it. There were restoration efforts being taken while we were there. A giant crane, bamboo scaffolding, and before/after posters of what it will all look like when complete. It's truly amazing to see what they are doing to bring back the original look and architecture of the place. What is not amazing is how when you're dropped off at the gates to walk into Ta Prohm, you are instantly bombarded by little kids trying to sell you on cheap magnets, figurines, tshirts, etc. Local people are calling you out from every angle for the first 50 steps into the gates. There are even huge signs/billboards directly in front of the entrance that tell you \"don't support locals begging for money\" and so on. So why don't they beef up security and kick these people out? I know they are trying to make a buck, but this is a national world heritage and historic place. Thousands of people don't travel thousands of miles to walk among the temples to be hounded by cheap tricks and scams. Take these stalls out and put them at the front of the park, so people can enjoy what they came to see. If you can keep a blind eye and deaf ear to all the sad craziness going on around you, and just enjoy the majestic wonder of it all, like we had to do, you'll be in good shape."

I have visited during the on-season and its is just frustrating. If you want to take photos don't bother going in the on-season instead brave the heat and travel in June July, you many get rain and hot days but at least there are hardly any people there. My daughter and I traveled in June July and found Angkor and Ta Prohm almost empty. If you want a go get a good tuktuk or car driver try Mr Pahna he is the best in the business. Phone him on +855 1286 45 81 or 855 975085708 e.mail and facebook panhachhouk@yahoo.com and arrange him to pick you up from the airport. If you do manage get him as your driver ask him to take you to the real local market for a tour, well worth a look . On your way into Cambodia you are unlikely to have your full quota of kgs of luggage. Most airlines offer 30kgs but most people take nearly empty suitcases into the country and fill them while they are there. Don\u2019t take a half empty suitcase into Cambodia, fill it up with children\u2019s books, educational toys (no battery operated toys), toothbrushes, soap, shoes, technology items and other useful things. The items don\u2019t need to be new, just in good working condition. Please don\u2019t take lollies or sugary stuff and don\u2019t offer religious items, Cambodians have a diversity of religions available to them, let them choose. You can ask your hotel to distribute the items or take them to the Children\u2019s Sanctuary"

If only able to visit for a day I suggest going to Angkor Wat and definitely trying to make it to Ta Prohm as its the temple used in the Tomb Raider movie with Angelina Jolie. The structure of the roots and vines from the trees into the temple walls and foundation is absolutely stunning. They are trying to restore the temple so you may come across construction sites. I would suggest going early in the morning rather than later especially if you're a photographer buff and prefer to have pictures without a lot of tourists them. If you have two to three days to visit the temples, I definitely suggest doing this temple in line with the circuit recommendations, see the attached picture map. Both Angkor Wat and Ta prom where my two favorites, and we actually spread them out over the course of two days so that we could enjoy both of them in all of they're glory instead of trying to cram it all into one day.Note1: Take a bike! They're $1usd and most come with locks, not that you really need them. Some routes/circuits are 10-12km, but you obviously don't have to follow the recommended three day tours. Biking allowed us to observe daily life in the rural areas outside the temples as well as Siem Reap as a whole.Note 2: do not go ticketless! They will fine you. Grab tickets en route to the temple roads, on your right approx. 3km before arriving at a fork in the road. Angkor is to the left of the fork. Note 3: Money is changed in USD, Cambodia uses the reil as change, like cents. Note4: snack stands and beverages available near Angkor Wat - restaurants too, and vendors line up near other temples. Prices slightly elevated but it's not ridiculous inflation."

Very different than the other temples as the trees have been allowed to grow through the temples here, which means you get a much more ruined temple in a jungle, with roots weaving through carved ancient walls and the sounds of parrots overhead. Butterflies lazily flit through the ruins. The shade of this temple is very welcome in the heat so a good option for the middle of the day.Only downside can be that since the temple is largely ruined there are limited routes to walk. When we were there there were large groups of Chinese tourists being quite loud,which lessened the experience somewhat."

Restoring this temple to it's original state would be a near impossible thing as the roots of the trees go very deep down and poses a hazard to the monument. Hence, restoring it partially to ease visitor access and make the temple stable has made the temple very unique. A visit to Siem Reap is incomplete without visiting Ta Prohm aka The Tomb Raider Temple. Highly recommended visit with a duration of 2-3 hours (or more for photo enthusiasts!!)"

I actually enjoyed the moss and the eerie feeling this temple had. The sheer natural beauty that exists here is so captivating and fun for shutterbugs. The downside for photo lovers is that there are often annoying signs or fencing that prevent you from taking a pure, natural picture (...well, those other tourists, don't help either)."

Unfortunately, it is the most crowded too. The temple was surrounded by jungle and after it was left abandoned for centuries, the nature took it over, growing out of the ruins. Most of the area inside the temple are off limit, so you cannot roam freely inside the temple, which is why it feels crowded at times.If you are coming from the east gate, just after the gate, you can choose to use the long way (right) or the short way (left). Always choose the short way because it is nearer to the entrance to the temple so you can beat the crowd and see the famous tree first. You can cover the long way area later.I love the fact that the govt decided to keep this temple as it is, with only minor restoration just to make sure the temple is in a stable condition and to ease visitors access. It would make the temple more \"original\" and stunningly unique."

It is easy to access and wander around for people with mobility issues. I had a crook knee but managed a good 2-3 hours of wandering around as there were few steps or gradients to wear it out.Seeing it in its current state of disrepair is surreal and I hope the efforts to restore it do not detract from the emotions this place evokes"

This place is quite famous because of Tomb raider, but I have read about it a long time ago, so it was an honour and a surreal experience to see it.The place is very touristy and attract large crowds, when I went there were some parts under restoration. I understand some people claim it is not that great because of tourism, that it is a shame the place has walkways, that it is not anymore as 10 yars ago....... Well yes certainy it's a shame the place has to cater for so many people (some tourists are indeed not very considered), and probably many years ago it was majestuous when it was off the beaten track, but things change and greater capital for maintenance and restoration is attracted for the whole archeological site, and it helps to keep the beauty of the place while bringing people. So I don't agree with the \"purists\" travellers that say that the beauty is gone"

I liked that they were not restored, unlike Angkor Wat and the temples in Angkor Thom which are mostly restored. Fortunately no crass signs and people politely waited to get photos in front of the famous tomb raider tree. There are several of these trees growing in the temple complex. It lies just outside Angkor Thom, but you need a Tuktuk to get there as this is still kilometres away from the main Angkor Thom temples."

If there is one piece of advice I can offer the lovely Cambodian people - claim back your temples. Have more tourist police enforce a no stupidity rule by having people talk quietly and respectfully. Ban the selfie stick. We visited in low season and out all the sacred sites we have visited (and there are quite a few) the ones in Siem Reap tested our patience the most."

Found this part of the Angkor Tom site had a lot of pesky beggars who bug you continuously whilst approaching and leaving this site - which is a shame but something you have to ignore or deal with in whatever you choose.Tomb Raider was filmed here you can understand why when you approach and enter this site. This temple has a very different feel to it than the others on the site. You really do feel like you're in the jungle, with all the massive Sprung trees everywhere reclaiming back their territory. It's truly a sight to see these huge roots wrapping themselves around the temple. It's a wonderful place to roam around. It's extremely hot in here as not my breeze, in fact none! So take plenty of water to drink. My hair was soaked by the time we left, very sticky and hot but worth it.Part of this site - when we entered was under reconstruction which was a shame as it did spoil the beauty and ambience of the site when you first enter but you soon move past this area and soon feel like you are back in time in the jungle glimpsing the past and imagining how majestic this place must of looked back in it's glory days. Fantastic photos to be taken in this site - and one very cheeky funny pic, see my pictures and I bet you smile. Do not miss the temple - it's a sight not to be missed."

That is because there are a lot of walls and corners so you can't see the entire grounds in any single view and all the tourist. Also, besides the Tomb Raider fame of the place, the temple looks old and ancient. It is not 100% perfect and that it what I expect when I see old temples. Definitely go to this temple."

Unlike other trees, the roots are the highlight than the tops and leaves. Wrapping themselves around and imprisoning the ancient stone blocks, these towering flora create an impression of nature reclaiming what is rightfully hers, displacing the no doubt immense effort taken by man to erect these tributes to their gods a millennia ago. Look out especially for a small stone face looking out from a crevice, almost entire enclosed by roots."

There is an overwhelming sense of overgrown jungleness as you see trees whose roots have knocked so much rock down that it needs metal shafts to support it. The big trees appeal to a macro guy like me, but if you like the intricacies of the carvings, there is also a huge amount for you to see. Not an overly lenthgy venue too, and with plenty of shade (trees, see I keep going on about them), you'll find this is one of the less burning experiences if you come in the summer times."

Travelling w 3 young kids aged 3,6&7, we knew we had no chance of visiting more than 3 and w had read that visiting the following 3 temples was a good alternative: Angkor Wat, Ta Promh and Angkor Thom. The tuk tuk leaves you some 10-15 minutes walk away from the temple itself (depending on how tired the little feet are) .... It's a dusty path and not easy to drag kids along but the first sight of the temple with this huge banian like tree growing almost on top of it and here and there tree roots wrapped around the temple took our breath away. We took some funky and funny shots w the kids monkeying around the temple and its roots!! Add on this the fact that Angelina Jolie's Lara Croft was filmed there and you got yourself a sure winner!!"

And in this temple you really get the feel of how vegetation and massive trees can live around our own constructions. The temple is beautiful in itself as well and the restoration work has been amazing. But those trees. Wow. Like every other major temple we visited, we were there by 6 am and had the complex almost to ourselves. My bet is, if you go 5 to seven days, check one big temple per early morning and leave the time from 9 am to 11 am to visit a few other small ones, than just relax at the hotel. This is what we did and it worked amazing."

When we went there was a lot less footfall than Angkor Wat and it gave us time to take in the place. Maybe this is why I enjoyed it more than Angkor Wat as we could spend some quality time browsing at our leisure.This is a must see attraction."

It is certainly a sight to behold, the unique ways the trees have grown everywhere is something I have not seen before, it is incredibly interesting. My best advice is to go early. While everyone is lining up to get into Angkor Wat in the early morning, we went the opposite way, going to Ta Prohm first, and Angkor Wat last. We got here at about 8AM and finished about 9AM, on advice of our tour guide provided by the Sofitel, and literally had the place all to ourselves. No crowds whatsoever, allowing us to get the best pictures and take our time looking at everything. So get there early for your best chances to have an ideal experience. Out of interest check out the \"dinosaur\" carving towards the back wall of the temple, something we found interesting and that not many others we spoke to had heard of."

Had been there after 2 days of temple touring and quite frankly, I wanted to give it a miss. How foolish it would have been of me! You would not want to miss it for the world. Realised how puny we are in front of the nature and was awestruck by the humongous trees (Spung, if i am not wrong). Seemed to me that an endless conflict between human enroachment and the nature's fight back for its territory has been going on for years. Instilled some hope back into me. Trees are here to stay! Pls dont miss it....The best temple in all of Siem reap in my view, where the deity is Mother Nature herself. Sad to know that people visit the place to see where the Lara croft movie starring angelina jolie was shot. Nature invictus!!!"

I wouldn't even consider spending less than two days on all the temples in the general area, and three days is actually more than a lot of people would need, although for others a week would be better. All of the temples have that lost-in-the-jungle feel to them but none in the same way this one does; the jungle really grew back around it, as is obvious in the pictures. Angkor Wat is huge, so it takes time just to walk around it, and Bayon is small, so it goes fast, with Ta Prohm in the middle."

You may have heard rumour that there is a carving of a dinosaur on the walls of this centuries old temple. It's true, it looks clearly like a stegosaurus, and yet the carving was done in a time where the dinosaurs were already extinct, but science had yet to discover dinosaur skeletons. How can it be?

The encroaching trees serve as a reminder of the condition of most of the temples.No, Lara Croft won't come swinging through the trees but the complex certainly gives you the feeling of being in the middle of an adventure. I have to confess that on one visit, while alone inside of one of the internal towers, I took out my phone and played the ringtone -- the theme from \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" and it felt good.Not to be missed."

Additionally, wooden walkways and platforms are now built throughout many areas that protect the fragile remains, but also add obstructions to negotiate while composing photos. But, the mix of ruins and nature, and the jungle canopy provide for stunning photo ops esp. after a rain.That being said, I went in the early morning to avoid the crowds, and I was not disappointed. This was one of my favorite temples in Siem Reap. It is not as large or ornate as other temples. But, I was completely fascinated by the way in which nature enveloped this man-made complex. The roots of trees from the encroaching jungle flow over and around the ruins as if to both support and preserve them. The moss and other plants growing on the tops and sides of structures add color and life to these long abandoned ruins. The intertwining of nature and man was awe inspiring and a definite must see even with the on-going restoration work."

I do not think they will ever remove those trees. But, it seems like the big roots can make the structure unstable in places and make it dangerous to be under.

Watch your step - there are many places where you are likely to trip and fall over. The thing is, you get so consumed in looking around and you may trip and fall.I was lucky to have a driver who doubled up as a guide, otherwise you may want to have some local guidance on going around.Ta Prohm is a square property with a build up wall on all four sides. It takes a good 2-3 hours if you wish to look into all the monuments and take good pictures. (You can also do it quickly in 15 mins if you are short of time, but I wouldn't recommend that).Typically one gets in from the West side and walk through the property and exits from the rear gate. Make sure you have co-ordinated with your driver / guide on where they will pick you up. Its a long long walk back if you need to go back all the way.Tips - keep water handy. there aren't many local stalls around."

I can sit here and just close my eyes and remember my visit here from beginning to end.From being in the crazy Siem Reap heat this is what we needed after visiting the other temples. I didn't expect this at all...but after we parked we just started walking down this path, a path filled with trees one each side, the trees alone brought shade and a beautiful breeze. That heat you were thinking about and dreading completely goes away. As we were walking we heard traditional khmer music in the far distance as weakest walking down the path we finally saw that there was a group of older people playing instruments who we later found out were farmers that had suffered from the khmer rouge reign. They were disabled but play as the tourists pass by and you can make a donation. Which I did, if you do get a guide when in Siem Reap you'll understand the khmer rouge did a lot of damage to the country. Aside from that sad part of history my point is the path leading to the temple, that walk with the music playing is just pure bliss, a sort of serenity. And what topped it all off was there were butterflies flying everywhere, every size, every color. Just so peaceful.As you approach the temple you are just amazed, walking through it amazed, from beginning to end, AMAZED. How did these overgrown trees grow the way they did, it's just crazy!The walk back to the car was just as i explained as the walk in.I just loved this place, also there was a local at the temple painting paintings he was selling. Such a talented young man, I bought one and have it framed in my home now. Support the local artists!"

This is a place not to be missed for the sheer fact that here grows some of the oldest trees in the world; well-rooted trees that have encroached the ancient walls and conquered them. Some of the roots look like giant serpents and it is really an engulfing experience. Built as a monastery and university in the late 12th and early 13th centuries, Ta Prohm has been left in pretty much the same condition in which it was found although there is currently a conservation and restoration project in place. It was inscribed in UNESCO's World Heritage List in 1992. Do visit Ta Prohm while it is still standing and witness first-hand a ruined past ruled by the tree kings."

Visit the temple with a guide; our Seven Candles guide knew exactly which courtyards and other areas were deserted.Bizarre, fantastical, atmospheric but - understandably - under renovation. An important choice must be made: preserve the temple and remove the trees and roots and with them the haunting atmosphere, or keep the trees and roots and let them consume and destroy the temple. Visit Ta Phrom now and catch a glimpse of its mysteries before the roots have been cleared..."

This temple is famous for it. There were beehives on some trees. Be careful on possibilities of falling debris when inside the temple. *read about the Philippines at joylenesdayout.blogspot.com"

Once swallowed by the jungle only the larger trees are now left in place. Ta Prohm is a temple of towers, closed courtyards and narrow corridors many of which are impassable, clogged with jumbled piles of carved stone blocks. A touch of Indiana Jones as you wander around and of course the iconic and most photographed spot where Lara Craft entered on her search as tomb raider. If you have the energy Ta Prohm is most impressive at dawn before the crowds arrive but like us late afternoon with afternoon shadows is just as good."

You get a real sense of how powerful nature is and it's easy to see how the jungle can soon overpower deserted buildings.You can make your own way there but it is worth hiring a tuk tuk driver (we did this through our hotel), for your time here as they can be really helpful in identifying the best bits to see. We would also advise reading up on the place before you go as this helps bring it to life. We went in May and it is very hot at this time of the year; you shouldn't let this put you off unless you have problems with heat.

These are the type of places that you see only in adventure movies and in fact Ta Prohm was the site of Angelina Jolie\u2019s Tomb Raider. Being here for myself was really interesting as it felt exactly how it would in the movies. Mystical, surreal, a hint of danger even. But today, Ta Prohm is a major attraction on the Angkorian archielogical site.The temple felt like its wrapped in time. In ruins, trees and jungle have grown around it and the temple has somewhat merged with the jungle. Some of these trees are hundreds of years old and its roots and trunks wrapped around the temple structures, destroying them in slow-motion in the process.Located east of Angkor Thom (and not within Angkor Thom itself), the temple is incredibly popular due to the attention it received from the movie. Therefore, its best to plan your trip there earlier during the day or much later when crowd thins. Whatever you choose, don\u2019t miss this temple. It\u2019s incredibly beautiful and offers plenty of amazing Instagram opportunities! I\u2019m glad I managed to see Ta Prohm in my time. There\u2019s a massive conservation effort happening now to protect and rebuild Ta Prohm since Angkor is now a UNESCO Heritage Site. However, that would mean that the trees that are now part and parcel of this ancient ruin will be removed in order to protect the temple. Ta Prohm of course would be restored to its former glory, but the allure of being an ancient lost city would also disappear.I don\u2019t know. To me, part of the allure of Ta Prohm are these trees. Giant roots holding giant statue heads was the quintessential imagery of Angkor. It\u2019s no longer there, and soon all the roots will be removed as well. That\u2019s why I think more than ever, you should go see Ta Prohm now."

Go really early because the crowds love this one!"

The old trees that were allowed to wind their trunks and roots around the temple buildings lend the whole place a romantic and 'hidden garden' aura.

There were only a few tourists back then, and the main gardian of the temple was an old man who swiped the floors and alleys of the place and was on the cover of Lonely Planet's Cambodia guidebook.10 years later, Ta Prohm has become one of the 3 major temples to visit in the area, and as such it is pack full of tourists, and conservation works are seen everywhere to keep it safe & keep it as much as it used to be. Needless to say it doesn't look quite as genuine and untouched as 10 years ago, and the tour felt less impressive. Go to Preah Khan if you want to see what Ta Prohm felt like when there weren't nearly as many tourists & conservation work (added wood beams, wood stairs, etc)."

The two most picturesque ones could be also admired in the film Tomb Raider with Angelina Jolie. However you must be very lucky to get a decent picture there because they are crowded with people taking selfles. Ta Prohm was originally a monastery and is surrounded by a square wall. It has two gates, a west and east gate. From the gates to the temple/monastery you still have a walk of roughly 300 meters through dense forest. Tip for photographers: Visit either very early in the morning or lat afternoon. With a bit of \"patience\" you can manage to take pictures without thousands of tourists in it."

The size of some of the trees growing through the ruins needs to be seen to be believed. Some of the roots are so huge they now require scaffolding.There are numerous piles of rubble and doorways leading here, there and everywhere. No health and safety! A wonderful and authentic experience without the hordes tourists at Angkor Wat (because we were there not long after dawn.)Not only is the temple the famous 'Tomb Raider' temple, where Angelina Jolie filmed for three months, this temple is also the site for the famous 'dinosaur' carving. It looks like a stegosaurus, but obviously at that time, no one would of known about dinosaurs, or what stegosaurus' particularly looked like. Enough to send chills when you see it! There are many theories that the animal is a hippo or a rhino and the plates behind are decoration, however you need to see it for yourself. There are websites that help you find its exact location, but luckily a local asked us if we needed help and we asked about it. He was happy to help and also pointed out a few other places of interest on the way, as it was only round the corner from where we were.

We managed to miss these tourists everywhere else but here unfortunately.Chinese tourists aside, ta prohm is very picturesque and would be awesome without the hordes.

I definitely think its good to do BUT: there are usually lots of tourists and (assuming you are with a guide) you will be running around in the sequence of visitors that fills the temple. This takes something out of the experience. Also be advised that during busy season, it can be VERY bad and try to find times to avoid crowds (ask your guide on advice). Siem Riep is getting very touristic and unless you visit when the weather is very hot, you need to be smart regarding your visits."

Go into the Echo Chamber, thump your chest, and listen for the echo! Erie, to say the least! Apparently the Echo Chamber was built to relieve stress!Our guide informed us the trees, most very tall, are 'Spung' trees, although we were also informed that the trees are strangler figs.

No wonder they have used this area for the Tomb Raider movie. While we were there, it started to rain and the weather gave the ruins an eerie atmosphere. That first glance of a giant tree root growing over the ruins, doors and buildings creates an incomprehensible sense of lost time world and the insignificance of us mortals. Absolutely surreal! Some ruins have been forced apart and are still in the process of getting dismantled. One can only imagine what it must have looked like when first rediscovered by outsiders. Mother nature emphasized here that time is a human concept. Ta Prohm was our favourite attraction and we were so fortunate to be part of \"The Lost City\"."

We saw countless incidents of them climbing over barriers and ignoring signs and the noise that accompanied them drowned out the jungle. I think the thing that annoyed me the most was the thousands of little sweet wrappers, again the majority from a certain country all over the floor and the little Cambodian children calling for you to give them sweets. Why on earth would you bring sweets to give to small children who have no access to dental care. Please just think a bit before doing this.

We went with a guide which I would recommend, as you get more information and stories than you might if you just \"read up\" on the area. It is incredible to me that these structures are still standing, completely exposed and with a healthy tourism business, when we cant get buildings that last 50 years these days."

A much beloved-and-visited temple by the tourists.It is left in a seemingly neglected, unrestored state, but believe me, behind this look is a lot of very carefully executed restoration of the Indians and Cambodians. I have to put down my hat before them, since you still have the feeling (minus crowd, wooden platforms and ropes), that you\u2019re an explorer, finding this unknown temple in the middle of the jungle.When I\u2019m thinking what can I advice you not to miss, I\u2019m quite puzzled.Every single stone, bas-reliefs and overgrown tree were dear to me.Maybe watch for the tympanum above the northeast entrance , where is an image of goddess Prajnaparamita modelled on the king's mother. Don\u2019t expect an image as good as the Buddha faces in Bayon and other temples.They mostly left the trees and their roots seemingly untouched, and the effect is striking. Good example is the strangulating root formation inside at the easternmost gopura (entrance pavilion)It is pointless to mention all of this symbiosis of vegetation and old temples, because you can find plenty of them, no one of them is more striking than the other one. We walked around the north satelite temple ,dedicated to Jayakirtideva, the elder brother of Jayavarman VII, who obviously was a good family man. It is a bit out of the main stream, but worth to see, since it is very charming.Unfortunately a lot of corridors are impassible because piled up carved stones are blocking your way. Still if you try to have a peek, you can find hidden or half hidden gems, just take your time.There are plenty of places, where you can\u2019t get close to your aim, so you have to adore them from a distance. They are surrounded by ropes, and you can see them from a wooden platform- as I mentioned it above- but it is very understandable, that they have to be protected from further damages due to the huge and not always well behaved tourist inflow.Only what I can say as a recommendation, that I plan to go back, and spend at least half a day in Ta Prohm."

There isn't really too much of interest to see on the Long Walk. Both take you by the areas where trees have taken over, but the Long Walk makes it longer than necessary. Note, site is not friendly to wheelchairs or strollers. Bring water, sunscreen, hat, etc.. Better to wear tennis shoes/hiking shoes instead of sandals as the direct/soil will turn your feet a different color. Once you're past the ticket checkers, there are no bathroom facilities or refreshments available until you exit the site. Bathroom facilities and refreshments are only available prior to the entrance/after exiting on either side of the site."

We arrived at Ta Prohm at sun rise and there was no one there. We took all the pictures of what we wanted with no one in our way. It was completely quiet except for the birds in the jungle singing to us. The shadows as the sun rose and the sounds of the jungle gave us a magic experience, and of all the temples we visited while in Siem Reap this was our favorite. Don't give a terrible review to a place because it was busy, instead go when it isn't and see places before or after the tour buses have gone."

Be aware of people, especially children, trying to sell you junk for ONE DOOLLAAARR and friendly strangers wanting to \"tell you the stories of the temple\" as they will (over)charge you. This country is nicknamed \"Scambodia\" for a reason, so be prepared. We told our driver to start with the temples furthers away, this one, and then work our way back towards Angkor Wat. This way you won't have to fight the crowds as much and you save the coolest thing for last!"

But after we had refused to buy the very expensive over priced lunch the whole thing went rapidly down hill.

The interesting part of this temple is that it is overgrown by very ancient trees. Thistemple can easily be combined in a one day trip with Angkor Wat, and Bayon (temple with the laughing faces)we collected our one day ticket for the temples the day before. When you do this after 5 PM then you have free entrance for the rest of that day plus the next day. At that moment there a no big queues at the ticket office. The late afternoon entry allows you to see the temples during sunset. Sun rises above the Angkor Wat temple walls at around 07:00 AM, but it is advised to arrive at around 05:45 AM so that you have a front row seat near the temple lake."

You have to enter from the west ant get out at the east gate.Be prepared to walk about 1 km while entering and again going out leaving apart the vast area of the temple complex ruins.When we went after visiting the main temple complex of Angkor Wat.,it was already well past noon and though it was February,Sun god was merciless and it was very tiresome to cover the long terrain.So,keep enough stock of water and of course a wide brimmed hat.Whn we went, it was teeming with tourists as it has become a very hot tourist attraction after ANGELINA jOLIE took shots here for her film so much so that the temple has now popularly called tomb raider temple after the name of the movie I would suggest you not to make the mistake of visiting this temple after Angkor Wat as much of the unspoilt beauty of this temple can be enjoyed and realized in the morning or in the afternnon. This temple built in 13th century has been intentionally left untouched by the archeologists so that one can cherish the actual condition in which it was discovered in18th century by French explores. However, some structural supports and strengthening are being done by the experts of Archeological Survey Of India to arrest further decay and collapse. the sight of the huge tree branches and roots of huge Banyan trees twining and entrapping the age old decayed structures give a haunted look especiall with the big dense jungles surrounding the area.The area has not been cleared of the jungles and only a narrow pathway has been cleared for the tourists.o, it is ver easy to get lost unless you are having a guide with you as it happened in my case and I had to ask other guides for the right path to go out . Actually, it is very confusing to move on your own taking photographs and suddenly finding you are lost!!.It is or rather was the largest temple complex with residences, univ ersitity, other buildings details of which are found in a stone inscription written in Sanskrit which gives facts and figures the splendor and vastness of this once prosperous city.Visiting this temple complex in dusk or dawn gives an eerie feeling as if you are in a lost world full of ruins and jungles By the tIme I was coming out, the Sun was setting and the feeling was really surrealistic!!"

We visited this ancient and famous temple on the same day that we visited Angkor Wat and The Bayon.It is an incredible place thanks to the amazing trees growing throughout the temple complex. Be warned that it is really overrun with tourists regardless of what time you go visit it. At one part of the site, we thought that we were going to be pushed aside by the crush of tourists flowing through.We went early afternoon after first visiting Angkor Wat, eating lunch and visiting the Bayon. We spent about an hour strolling through the ruins. I would love to give this place a 5, but there are simply too many people there to enjoy the true magnificence of this ancient temple complex. TIPS:Visit Ta Prohm as part of a visit to the overall Angkor complex.We went in the East entrance and out the West entrance (or was it the other way around?) but be prepared to get disorientated in the complex. We overheard multiple tourists trying to get their bearings. Car and driver for the day is around USD 30. It's useful hiring a car/driver as it gets very hot and the air-conditioned car is a welcome place to rest in between temple visits. One day entrance fees to the Angkor complex is USD 20 per person. Multi-day passes are also available. Don't clamber over the temple ruins - stay on the paths. This is a temple under restoration. No need to take shoes off at the temple.Take water - it gets really hot."

It is a must-see for visitors to the Angkor complex."

The temple looks like how your imagination would picture discovering a temple forgotten in the jungle for years (partly because this is the picture used by publicists for the purpose) so do take the time to see it for yourself. It is busy and the inevitable Angelina Jolie comments will happen but enjoy it. You will see how nature has combined trees and vines to grow through or around the temple and it is stunning. Reconstruction work is taking place and only time will show whether the archaeological theory eliminates the atmosphere, hopefully it will show sympathy to the traveller's impression by retaining some of the jungle's intrusion."

Letting such hordes of tourists in (and I won't mention the nationality, but I guess all Angkor visitors know what I mean) and letting them behave in such despicable manner is outrageous. This beautiful, mysterious temple has been transformed into some sort of movie set / ancient Disneyland: one path to follow, basically breathing on other tourists' neck, in a really substantial crowds, listening to guides and package tourists shouting... No mystery at all. No peace, no quiet. On top of it all, restoration is being done, and from what I saw, it's not good... I guess, it's not perfect now, but still - visit it before it turns to concrete. Because it will, soon.I know it's a bit hypocritical to complain about the crowds while being a part of one, but the whole point here is not that it's lots of people - it's how they behave. It's an absolute circus, and I am quite surprised to see the guards doing nothing about that. Funny enough, they found it necessary to approach and scold my boyfriend who was wearing a hat (solely as sun protection), but were ignoring the bus-loads of tourists who were shouting, throwing rubbish around, and generally disrespecting the place altogether.Such a shame, this place deserves better."

We been there with my friends last December only to be disappointed about their tourism. People are Crap! Some of them or most of them but there's a bit consideration with the other Cambodian people.when we are there. From the border they will take you ride a bus for free going to the next area which the taxi or service car will transfer to City of CAMBODIA to find hotel. Beware if the taxi stop over in the area which a lot of TUKTUK service. It's ok to ride TUKTUK going to the hotel you like. Or better told them from the beginning that you have already hotel to stay. Your friend is waiting for you there. So that they don't have any chance to chase you. Because Somebody will ask you if you have tour JUST SAY YES you already have. Don't entertain them they will follow you to the hotel. But ask them politely that you already have tour and say Thank You. Some people there are not contented with the TIP.. I wonder how's the difference between the same amount of RIEL = US$ They don't want their money. Advice: Better to have a package with your agency rather than getting package when you're there. It's worts! In consideration with Food it's great, the night market you can buy items with cheaper price. They have also their own version of Shabu shabu. It s yummy and affordable. I just hope Cambodian tourism could penalized those tour guide and agency who violate the rights of Tourist."

The bricks are crumbling, and corridors have collapsed, and the entire temple is in danger of one day falling to the ground.

The trees are very very old, the big roots of the banyan trees themselves look like trees. At some places, the roots have formed shapes like pyramid. People stand and pose infront of these tree like roots and click photographs.This is one of the most distinctive features of Ta Prohm, that the trees are growing out of ruins. Unesco has inscribed Ta Prohm on the World Heritage list. It is one of the temple complexes, visited by tourists from all over the world.

You will have to be patient enough to take good pictures as the crowd is overwhelming in this site. There will be locals trying to swarm you with all sorts of souvenirs from the main gate, so decline as polite as possible if you are not interested."

Read the history and you will be amazed by the artistic touches by the ancient Khmers. Ta Phrom and the entire ancient city of Angkor are the oriental version of infamous Maya sites of Central America. A must-visit if you're in Siem Reap for a couple of days. In dry season, the weather gets really hot from noon till sundown so bring plenty of water. Also, the entire Angkor complex can get very dusty due to the dry south-westerly wind so ensure to put on your anti-dust mask when you go out. Dusty air and hot climate during the period of dry season from November to April could cause one to end up with throat-related illnesses if you're too exposed to the elements. I prefer to visit Angkor at the beginning or the end of wet season as the air is always fresh and dust is pretty much washed down by the monsoon rain. It does not rain all day during wet season though. There's still some dry spell and one can be lucky to not encounter any rain for one or two days throughout the trip."

The fascinating highlights from Ta Prohm, are the huge trees that seem to have taken over the entire temple. Some trees have stretched out their roots to take over walls and it\u2019s something that you really have to see to believe. A lot of the structure is also in ruins and while we visited there was some restoration work going on. We were amazed at the age at which the temples stood. Ta Prohm was built as a Buddhist temple, dedicated to the mother of King Jayavarman VII in 1186. It was a temple that really caught my imagination and for me, it was the best temple of Angkor. What we adored about the temples was the rustic and atmospheric feel, the intricate details of the carvings and the rich history of the Angkorian temples. The stones are placed at such precision and complex interlocking shapes, that it is impossible to fit even a single piece of paper between them. Whether you have one week or one day in Siem Reap, I would definitely recommend coming to Angkor Wat and seeing the famous Angkorian temples. Unlike other modern temples in Thailand and other parts of Cambodia, these aged temples offer more dramatic and atmospheric views. Would definitely recommend going around midday when most people are having their lunch if you want a quieter experience - we did and was worth it. Many people told us we would need a minimum of three days for the temples which would cost $60 (per person) and around $60 (for a Tuk-Tuk driver for three days). We were able to see most of the large temples, stop off at the smaller ones and even had time for ice cream and lunch before the sun set over the temples in just one day. The day ticket is only $20 (per person) and if you arrive around 7:00am, you will have more than enough time to visit the temples including Angkor Wat. There are absolutely loads of temples though, so if these are your thing then a multi-pass deal might be for you.If arriving to Siem Reap by bus, avoid at all costs the locals who almost pounce on you at the bus station. Their prices are extortionate compared to the services your hotel will offer. One local tried selling to us, thinking I didn\u2019t understand the exchange rate. When calculating this in my head I told him no and he got very aggressive and shouted something in Khmer as we left the station. Their selling tactics are very hard sell \u2013 they don\u2019t give you time to think and before you know it you\u2019re reaching for your wallet. Speaking to many travellers on our journey we have heard many similar stories."

The huge restoration project of the temple was underway when we visited after the Angkor Wat and there were at least 20 people in the outdoor carving a stone, hammering a marble and doing sorts of delicate work very patiently. Ta Prohm has a character, It does not bore you, instead it enlightens you with the balance between the persistence of nature and human creativity. Trees are part of the temples, they themselves became a temple. Apparently the Indian government is sponsoring this ongoing project and perhaps by 2020 it will look very different from today. At the moment at least, this stone/ tree world heritage is unspoiled. TIP: At Angkow Wat you can purchase daily, 3 day or weekly tickets to visit all temples with one ticket."

I visited Ta Phrom with my sister in August 2014 as part of our bucket list trip to Siem Reap.This temple is obviously on everyone's list, given that it was made famous by the movie Tomb Raider, and is apparently the most visited temple besides Angkor Wat. Ta Phrom was built by the amazing Jayarvarman VII who dedicated it to his mother. Like the other Angkor temples, is very beautiful and dignified. The temple is crumbling and overgrown with incredible strangler fig trees but these only add to its beauty.There are some amazing carvings to be seen and if you look carefully you'll find the Buddha face that has a tree growing around it, which is just beautiful.Take your time to explore and be patient to get the perfect photo as others will be trying to catch the same shot - especially in front of the \"Tomb Raider tree\".Things to remember when visiting the temples:-* Be sure to book a private guide so you can move at your own pace. Make sure you get one that really knows their stuff as hearing the stories and legends around each temple was far more interesting than just hearing the facts. (If you need a guide then feel free to PM me - I'm more than happy to give you a recommendation!)* Wear sunblock and a hat. It is HOT.* Be sure to take the time to drink it all in. No matter how many other people are in the complex you'll be able to enjoy it all if you're patient and take your time.* Don't climb up on the temple walls, or let your children do it either. This is so disrespectful to both the temple and to the Cambodian people.* Please remember to dress respectfully. Yes, you're on holiday and yes, it's hot but this is a temple.Enjoy! :)"

This is where man and Nature meet, and the great trees that hold the temple structures in their grasp, literally, are as awe inspiring as what man has made.There is much restoration work here, and it is wonderous to see how from piles of stumbled stones the restorers are managing to rebuild the temple as it originally must have been. There is not much by way of carvings but it remains a must see.The musicians, land mine victims, who make sweet music en route you walk to and from the ruins are worth lauding.Can see too, why film makers found this a perfect location for their climax scenes! I wonder what brave person will dare spend a night alone here!"

Now it is the archetypal ruined temple where man and nature kind of co-exist. It truly is an incredible sight to behold.This was our number one temple to see in Siem Reap and it was truly amazing. All the others - Angkor Wat included - as spectacular as they are, did not amaze us quite as much as Ta Prohm.The site it large enough to explore over a couple of hours, though being in the jungle we found it easier than other temples where you were more in the sun. Regardless, make sure you have your water, sunscreen, hats, etc.So much has been said about Ta Prohm before, and it really does live up to expectations in our opinion. An unmissable part of any trip to Siem Reap. Top recommendation."

We were there around 4pm and it was so thick with Chinese tour groups that we finally gave up in some sites and just kept moving. Maybe the ticket agency will start to limit how many visitors can go a day because in such a cool site that is so compact (small walkways between doors, doorways, and falling rock/trees) it really does ruin it when you can't even get a look or a picture without someone's head in it."

We hired bicycles for our week's holiday and cycled to many temples at our own pace, which we recommend, especially as you will have lots of tuk tuk drivers haggling with you for a price to take you out to the temples. Cycling helps you to appreciate the scenery along the journey and is in fact not that far from Siem Reap town. Traffic is accommodating to cyclists and the roads are generally straight and in good condition.Ta Prohm is a beautiful temple which, as many reviewers have said, is gradually being reclaimed by nature. The trees growing through the stones make for amazing photo moments. We sensed a very calm vibe in this temple (compared to others which felt like mausoleums) and recommend that you visit early in the day to avoid the crowds.Tip: Wear long sleeves and knee length pants to protect from the intense sun and also in keeping with respect for the Khmer culture and people, especially if climbing up the steps."

This temple is quite unique with some amazing very old temples being swallowed up by some very old trees.There are some terrific photo opportunities but the whole of Angkor is so popular it can get very overcrowded throughout the day.Try & push out to the exterior walls of the complex away from the main thoroughfare as this is where the large groups of Chinese & Korean tourists are taken.I would suggest going as early as possible because as well as the large crowds it does get very hot as the day progresses.A full day trip organised by the hotel cost us $US15 which took you to the main sites stopping off for lunch was cost us US$20 in a nice restaurant.I would imagine you could get the transport costs down to about $US10 if you bargained hard away from the hotel.A definite visit but go early to avoid the crowds!"

The only thing done to this magnificent temple has been to build wooden stairs around the temple, as well as stairs climbing up to the top and down to the depths of this most sacred place.

I love those Spung Trees, which are both destoyers and preservers of the temple--their roots initially breaking apart the stone, but now that their roots are massive and encompass many structures, they are holding the temple stones together. Some people may not like temples with too many wooden platforms to guide the tourist's path. However, without the platforms and walkways, the millions of tourists climbing and walking over the temple stones would further erode and damage them. In my rankings, I do not factor in the tourist crowds. All the temples that are worthwhile and which do not have a high risk or land mines left over from all the wars, will have too many tourists. The number of tourists visiting is growing each year, so the sooner you visit, the better."

Restoration works are under way at the moment with parts of the grounds out of bounds to visitors. Nevertheless, walkways have been built around those parts and you can still get a good view of the structures. There are only 2 entrances - the east gate and the west gate. As the grounds are quite confusing, it's easy to get lost. Our guide was stopped at least 3 times by people who were lost. If you don't have a guide and only got a driver to drop you off, it's a good idea to ask your driver whether he's picking you up at the east or west gate, so that if you get lost, a guide on the grounds could point you in the right direction.As most of these temples are still used by the locals as places of worship, it would be respectful to dress appropriately. You may have seen pictures of people wearing shorts and tank tops while visiting the temples but do note that there is a dresscode. Knees and shoulders should be covered. Instead of wearing pants for example, I saw a few women wearing dresses and skirts. Ta Prohm doesn't have steep stairs to climb and so dresses and skirts that fall below the knee are alright. However, if you are also visiting other temples on the same day like Angkor Wat and Bayon, it's best to remember that some of the stairs there can be quite steep. Not only could dresses and skirts hinder your climbing, they could also leave little to the imagination for those climbing behind you."

Once we returned home from our trip, we re-watched the Tomb Raider movie. It wasn't all that great, but, we enjoyed the temple scenes and thought how amazing it must have been for the actors to visit the temple without the obscene mass of tourists.It didn't take us long to realize the appropriateness of the nickname, the \"Jungle Temple.\" Unlike many Angkorian Temples, the Ta Prohm Temple is unique because much of the jungle has not been cleared and it resembles how the temple would have appeared when the European explorers first stumbled across this treasure, which provides travelers with a unique flavor of how the temples appeared prior to the commencement of renovations. It was absolutely remarkable and mysterious, and, at brief moments, when we managed to block out the tourists, felt like we were living in a fairy tale.Roots were usurping the temple structure and tree branches were gripping all parts of the temple indiscriminately. Large stones that fell over long ago blocked pathways. The majority of the trees growing out and around the stones of the temple are Spung trees. The age of the spung trees ranged from 200 to 500 years old. The trees were massive and it was quite extraordinary the way the trees maneuvered between the stones. The jungle atmosphere was wild and highlighted the destructive power of mother nature."

It is well preserved in the state it was supposedly found, with strangler fig trees hugging the stones -- in order to give visitors a flavor of what the temples at Angkor were like before they were renovated. Ta Prohm, however, is very crowded. Korean and Chinese tour groups come by the buses, and they come all year long no matter what the season is. Russians too.You feel like you are in an Indiana Jones adventure, then the next group piles on in, and you feel like you're in a Tokyo subway."

Located approximately one kilometre east of Angkor Thom and on the southern edge of the East Baray, it was founded by the Khmer King Jayavarman VII as a Mahayana Buddhist monastery and university. Unlike most Angkorian temples, Ta Prohm has been left in much the same condition in which it was found: the photogenic and atmospheric combination of trees growing out of the ruins and the jungle surroundings have made it one of Angkor's most popular temples with visitors. UNESCO inscribed Ta Prohm on the World Heritage List in 1992. Today, it is one of the most visited complexes in Cambodia\u2019s Angkor region. The conservation and restoration of Ta Prohm is a partnership project of the Archaeological Survey of India and the APSARA (Authority for the Protection and Management of Angkor and the Region of Siem Reap)."

We found areas of total peace and tranquility from where we could contemplate the power and scale of nature and its ability to re-take what belonged to it in the first place as it consumed these amazing stone buildings, covered in bas-relief carvings and intricate decoration.In it\u2019s day the temple would have controlled over 3000 villages... unbelievable really.Definitely a must do! :-)"

A good walk to the temple itself - time to enjoy the peaceful trees and surroundings. It was good to see the artisans rebuilding this amazing 'building'!. I do not think it is a job they will finish very quickly! It is like putting a huge, and rather heavy, jigsaw together!

The first time, we visited it during afternoon around 3:30pm. It was PACKED with people. Big tour groups and long lines for pictures. We still enjoyed our visit, was it wasn't very magical. We went back on our last day, just after sunrise at Angkor Wat at around 7:30am. There were still some people, but no tour groups. We were able to take shots with no one in the background but our family. Took time to try taking photos from different angles and just strolling leisurely. By the time we leave close to 9am, many people are heading into the door. I would say if you want this to be magical, go early in the morning!"

The site, possibly because of its association with Tombraiders, attracts large crowds, but after you have been here, you realise that it is because of Ta Prohm that Tombraiders is a hit, not the other way around. The bell-ringing sound of cicada insects welcomes you and reminds you that it is a temple you are visiting. The giant Spung trees that grow out of, and surround sections of the temple make for a photogenic setting, with the Gopuras peeping out between trees at places. At sundown, these gopuras take on a golden hue that seems to completely transform the place. Apart from the tree roots and branches, the charm of the place is also due to some fine carvings all around. Some sections were closed when we visited because of the restoration efforts being on, but what we could see made the visit well worthwhile."

The roots of some are so huge they are having to be supported, some are supporting the ancient ruin, whilst others you can see are destroying it. However you can see work underway to preserve both trees & buildings.

Ta Prohm is part of the Angkor Wat compound, or as the locals call it the \"Tomb Raider Angelina Jollie temple\"... it is absolutely amazing and a difference to the other temples nature has taken matters into its own hands... the tree roots resembles hands invading and crushing walls and crawling through windows.. its very cool to watch...the whole thing is picture perfect... a Tuk tuk taxi can take you from your hotel wait for you and bring you back for only 10$, the entrance to the Angkor Wat park is 20$...To see the whole Angkor Wat temples....will take you about the 3 days, so choose the best to visit.. Ta Prohm being the best in my opinion for how cool it looks.....the tuk tuk will drop you off on one gate, and he will pick you up on the other side...we started from the east gate....coming out the West gate... on the west gate you have little souvenirs shops and refreshments As you are walking in you will see a group of musicians that are land mine victims all missing limps... they play the typical Kmer music, a CD for 10$ worth buying and its very emotionally moving. If you end up in Angkor Wat (the main temple) watch for one great coffee shop attached to an official gift shop, its Air-conditioned (It gets very hot) and the wash rooms are clean, and smell clean !!!!!! also food is pretty good."

But it upset me greatly that so many tourists seem to have no regard for what they were seeing, and having no regard for other people taking photos. And I saw a couple of tourists, just walking all over the place as if it was their own, and then being loud and displaying public displays of affection at this place. I felt like saying to that couple 'get a bloody room' and it's socially faux pas in Cambodia to display affection publicly, so it was even more embarassing that they were english speaking. Protip - don't lose your tour guide, because you'll learn stuff about this place, that you wouldn't know unless a cambodian tour guide is with you. There is a spirituality in this place, that can't be described. Take your time to walk around here, and in parts it's quite cool. Three things though 1 - make sure you go to the toilet across the street before you enter the site otherwise it's a long walk back to go 2 - take a hat to protect you from the piercing sun 3 - take fluids because the heat will get to you 4 - take respect for the history of this placeIt was amazing, but I just wish that UNESCO, the cambodian government, cambodian tourism would do more the protect the areas and the buildings, and had more areas cordoned off to tourists."

Wait a year or two for the reconstruction to get finished. If you can't wait, go as early in the morning as possible. The light is better for your photographs and your fellow guests just might be getting that second plate at the all you can eat breakfast buffet at their hotel.Also if you can't remember the name of this temple, just ask for the Tomb Raider temple. Everyone know which one you are talking about. If you want to round out your Tomb Raider movie tour, be sure to see the East Gate of Angkor Thom (not the one with the paved road - the one a bit further south). This is where Lara Croft pulled the temple down, though no temples were hury in the filming of the movie."

Restoration of this temple is perfect, just enough to make it reasonably safe (one hopes) but it still makes you feel like an explorer. We spent at least an hour here and I still have no idea of layout. Collapsed doorways means that there appears to be no symmetry, unlike other temples, and there are loads of dead-end courtyards. Throw in the trees growing over and through everything and your have one amazing experience. Possibly not my favourite (Bayon?) but definitely top three."

Sadly it was a bit of a let down.First of all, the number of visitors. I strongly recommend going either at 5pm or before 9am. Otherwise it is impossible to enjoy this fascinating temple ruin as there are just so few pathways open due to the renovation and repair works being carried out given the huge number of visitors.Secondly a lot of the trees that were growing on and around the temple have been cut down unfortunately, no doubt because they threatened to bring down much of the temple structure. Those that remain in most cases have barriers or fence around them so you can't get too closr., and it's not good for photography either.As a result it has lost much of the feeling of being lost in the jungle. There are two other temples you should visit nearby which also still have strangler fig trees growing on and around them though and which have far fewer visitors - Ta Som and Preah Khan.This temple is still well worth visiting - but be prepared for large crowds."

There is no need to mention the spectacular trees growing among the blocks. When I visited this place, I felt like I was in a maze, making this place even more interesting. Usually in other temples there are signs guiding you where you can go, but in this temple there is no sign and what comes up in front of you is quite random. I don't know how to describe it. Sorry! But it is definitely fun to visit and worthy to spare sometime to visit this place.

Also they have created roped, decked areas for the most famous 'Lara Croft' type vistas which felt very fake and in retrospect I was not happy with the pictures taken there. That said I do think it's a 'must see' and very scenic. Have a good camera so that you can edit out the man-made walkways and capture some of the wider angles of the real ruins."

You will be amazed and baffled how such gigantic roots of trees grew within this temple. Compare to other temples, it doesn't have that much buddhas in it but it's really the massive trees that makes this simple temple interesting. We went here as early as we can but time doesn't make any difference at all, people are always flowing in and out even if it is raining. When you visit Angkor, you have a lot of options to choose as a mode of transportation. First, there is Toktok (considered to be their cab/taxi) which is quite expensive for the whole day trip around the Angkor yet convenient, rent is per person which is US$15. Since we are just 2 when we visit Angkor and didn't much have time, we chose toktok to visit the place. Another advantage of hiring a toktok, is you can use it not just for visiting the Angkor but also moving around the city like looking for restaurant, bank etc. Second, if you knew how to bike, there are bicycles you can rent for a dollar with a map that will guide you in exploring the whole Angkor. However, the latter option is tiring and time consuming though I think it's fun. Last option you may have is renting a motorcycle if you know how to ride one, you just need to ask your hotel receptionist and they can refer you where to rent some motorbike. Not sure with the price but it goes around $3 to $5."

It then becomes very difficult to navigate and take reasonable photographs.The temple is also undergoing extensive conservation and reconstruction with scaffolding prominent over parts of the complex.

The roots growing everywhere - on, out of, over and around the walls make for a great sight. Now man is winning the struggle to reclaim the temple.As an Indian it made me proud that the Archaeological Survey of India was involved in reclaiming the structures and restoring them.

Personally this was enough for us as we certainly made the most of every day.Firstly, barter a price with a Tuk Tuk. Depending on how many temples/sites you wish to visit, they will offer you a price. Usually it can range between $5-$20USD. We did Ta Prohm & a couple 'less touristy' ones others for $15. Usually the hotel will help!!The Tuk Tuk will drive you there, wait, then drive onto the next one, wait, then drive you back. Personal chauffeur! Fancy! REMEMBER, you have to buy a 1 or 2/3 day pass to visit every temple. The ticket office is en route, be sure to remind your TukTuk. The 3 day pass is the same price as the 2 day. I think 40USD, little pricey for a traveller like myself, but worth every penny in Siem Reap. So... Ta Prohm! Personally this was my favourite of all the temples. Like any of the temples in SR, you'll be extremely lucky to visit at a time when it is dead. Early mornings or late afternoons are pretty much guaranteed to be quieter for ANY temple. If your unlucky then it will be packed full of Korean bus tours with people trying to take the 'perfect selfie' with a selfie stick or taking someone's eye out with their IPad and not even enjoying why they are there in the first place! So this is the iconic 'Tomb Raider' temple. You will need approx 2-3hrs here to really see it all and bask in the truly wonderful surroundings. If you want a speedy visit, you could cram it in 1hr. What I loved is that it is all completely unspoilt, yes they've carried out a couple restorations (minor) but the whole place is in ruins. A HUGE contrast to every other temple! It's what makes it so amazing! Trees are growing over Stone everywhere you look. Cheeky left and right turns will get you lost for ages until you randomly discover an ancient room with incredible Buddhist markings. To think this is a thousand years old makes you appreciate the capability of the human hands! Remember to take a camera (pretty obvious), you certainly aren't short of photo opp's. Some people may wish to get a tour guide, if you do ensure you grab a guy in a Beige/Brown shirt, they should have a name tag and an official badge on their shoulder. They'll be able to tell you more about the temple and it's history. However if like me and my girlfriend you wish to take your time and really make the most of it all, just wonder freely on your own.I hope you enjoy your trip here as much as I did. Read my other reviews for other temples. Thanks."

I understand that one of the Tomb Raider films was partially shot here, which might explain some of the odd poses we observed from one party of visitors.You need to get yourself a ticket for admission to the Angkor temple complex and there are various options available depending on how many days you are likely to be visiting.

This is one of the places I was looking forward to as this place has always been linked to Tomb Raider.When we got here, the huge trees were very much noticeable, rising very high and the big roots clinging to the ruins. It's very hard to take a very decent photo though as many people always pass by. It's better to go here early morning or aroung lunch time. Air is very humid as trees are blocking the air. Other than that, this place looks mysterious and very impressive and nothing that I have ever seen before."

Nevertheless, it is still a stunning temple, set inside the forest and it's most stunning feature is without a doubt the gigantic silk-cotton trees growing out of the ruins! A must see in Angkor!"

Of all the temples we visited (and that was a lot), this was in my top 3. Gorgeous tree roots trickle down the temple walls and engulf the well kept wonder. With well keeping however comes maintenance. While we were there we encountered some scaffolding holding certain walls and trees in place but this was done with such care I barely noticed the metal structures. I highly recommend you check out Ta Prohm in the morning to avoid the crowds. Majority of tours commence at Ankor Wat and do not reach Ta Prohm until late afternoon so by going here in the morning you will have the whole place to yourself. Another bonus of visiting in the morning is all the merchants are at Ankor Wat. Happy adventuring!"

Found that this temple resonated most in terms of connecting with the past.Explore the full ruin by entering the main gate and exiting through the back gate (have your driver meet you there) - listen to the trilling of the cicadas and the hoots of the myna birds. Since the structure is unrestored and offers random paths, the presence of other tourists is less apparent. Make this a mandatory stop."

Negotiate with a tuk tuk driver outside your hotel to be yours for the day. $20-25 is the norm, and buy him a couple of bottles of water during the day.

The roots of the trees are quite unbelievable here and add to the glamour of the temples. If anything the trees are the attraction here but the temple is also great to wander around. Amazing photos and memories from this place! Enjoy!"

You can almost imagine the apsara dancers twinkling through the corridors and the whole place has a calming feel to it with secret nooks and crannies.Our Tuk Tuk driver dropped us off at one side and we walked through the place from one side to the other where our driver was waiting for us again. That was a smart thing to do and saved the hassle of slugging back through the heat. On our trip with 3 girls (aged 9,8 and 7 yrs old) we visited Bayon, Ta Prohm and Angkor Wat. These were all different temples with their own style and gave us a good feel of the place. We also carted round the place on a Tuk Tuk but didn't get out everywhere. Just enough for us adults to satisfy our temple thirst and enough for the children to digest."

The trees sprouting through roofs are the most iconic sight but the sheer range of wildlife is something you don't often hear about - I found a massive millipede, spiders beyond counting and tiny frogs all lurking in the cracks & crevices. Sadly they have needed to fend off the more well known (Tomb Raider) parts otherwise I'm sure the trees would be a mangled mess of graffiti by now! You can still get decent photos though and the boarding actually helps guide you through the ruin.This is definitely one of the best temples still standing in the Angkor region & definitely recommended.

People also seem to make it a point to come here due to the movie fame, I guess, as the place was fairly packed, and also one good thing is you can exit from the back unlike at Preah Khan where you have to walk back the way you came in. I was greeted by tons of kids selling drinks back there who weren't that many at other temples.Ta Prohm was the fifth stop on my Angkor circuit tour starting at Angkor Wat, then Angkor Thom (Bayon & Baphuon), then Preah Khan, then Ta Keo, then Ta Prohm, then Banteay Kdei and Sras Srang reservoir, then Prasat Kravan, and finally Phnom Bakheng the temple on a mountain. If you're coming by minibus from Poipet and meet the tour operator named Vara when you get off in Siem Reap, I highly recommend his services - honest, timely pickups and no hidden charges except some small tip to the driver at day's end after the tour.Also, one important advice is to have your admission ticket you obtained at the main entrance (before Angkor Wat) with you at all times during the tour since they check for it at each subsequent stop (not just at Angkor Wat)."

Our family loved the way the jungle is claiming the temples for itself. There are many little areas to explore, and even though there were a number of people there (even now in low season), there were places we could find to ourselves. Near the entry, the trees growing through the walls are popular sites for photography, and are roped off, but further in there are possibilities to find other spots like this without the hordes. A really lovely atmosphere, full of character. We were there mid-afternoon on our first visit, and returned at 4.30 until 5.30 on the final day of our pass to experience it again with better light as the sun sank lower. There were less people there at that time of day and it was even more magical with the longer shadows and sun setting behind the trees and ruins."

I allowed myself be guided by one of the unofficial guides who really knew where to get good pictures off the beaten path. At first I ignored him, as one has to do, but he was tenacious and proved to have a good knowledge of where to get the best shots. While he clammed up in the presence of the real tan-shirt guides, the blue-shirt security did not stop him, so I concluded that he was sharing his fee with them and they were letting him go off the official path. I gave him $5, but like I said, I got the pictures that you missed.That said, the temple itself is a lovely crumbling mass of stone and trees. Yes, the trees are all over several walls, and you have to stand in line to get a picture of the iconic tree wrapped around the stone structure (from the movie), and it is roped off. Look close for a carved face watching from between tree roots, and look up for raft bee hives."

We visited the Bayon, Anghor Wat and Ta Phrom sites and our view was that the Ta Phrom site was by far the most atmospheric. This is probably due to the invasion of the complex by various 'jungle' growths such as trees and their roots, creepers etc. The other sites are larger and more spectacular but the serenity of the Ta Phrom site seems special.

Govt of India is helping partial restoration of this temple - but this temple will largely be kept unrestored intentionally - so as to give visitors a feel of Angkor temples as discovered by early European explorers.

Going around Ta Prohm is such a wonderful experience since it has wooden platforms to make it easier to roam around the temples.

Here not only the Cambodian history and lore come to play but also a very beautiful and unusual intertwining of the ancient temple and nature is on display. There are other places where a mighty forest grows through the ruins. But nowhere have I seen o much fantasy delivered by jungles. Sure there are a lot of tourists, sometimes place could be crowdie, you can see people preoccupied with picture taking. Hard not to follow. Hard not to have discoveries at every turn.Angkor Wat temples are very different - like islands of Hawaii - the same chain, but boy, how different they are!I would strongly recommend for the first time to come with a good local guide. Ask many questions - about the place, abut Hinduism, about Buddhism, about Cambodia, modern and ancient. And then you can keep coping on your own.Gennady"

When one sees the whole Ta Prohm, the restoration is not visible and the restored parts don't seem to stand out from the originals. Only some scaffoldings and planks of wood tell visitors restoration is still ongoing. Other than the main temple of the Angkor Wat, Ta Prohm is to me the temple that should not be missed. It is massive in space, and unique in design. Plus the added \"significance\" that Angelina Jolie was all over Ta Prohm in Tomb Raider.Angelina Jolie aside, I rate Tomb Raider a perfect spot for visitors and students of history. And photography enthusiasts like me."

I would strongly suggest going early in the morning as there are very few visitors here then. All the tuk-tuk drivers seem to follow set routes and therefore this would be around dinner time depending on how long it takes you to journey around Angkor Wat and Angkor Thom. As we had already been we didn't go around Angkor Thom again and went straight to Ta Prohm. There were about 12 other people there so there were plenty of areas when it was just us, something which would never happen at Angkor Wat. This isolation from other tourists certainly added to the magic that surrounds this place. A must visit for anyone!"

The locals refer to Ta Prohm as the tomb raider temple as this is where the movie with Angelina Jolie was filmed.The French explorers found this place in the 19th century and restoration works were carried out during the French colonial period. They intentionally left the trees in this manner to reflect what the explorers would have found. For me, I found it was a very beautiful example of how nature gradually took over a structure which humans abandoned, not ruining it but instead adding to its grandeur. The architecture of this temple is also rather different from Angkor Wat's, with more towers and large faces carved onto the towers - generally a very different aesthetic, built by a different king etc. Don't feel like Angkor Wat is the only temple you need to visit. This temple will give you a vastly different experience."

Its a very quiet and special place to be with the most interesting ruins and trees that have grown within the temple. And yes, it also has the famous door as filmed for 'Tomb Raider'.A good tip is to go after watching the sunrise at Angkor by Tuk Tuk. This way you miss the larger tours so you should only share your experience with a handful of other people and spend most of the time with it all to yourself. Another general tip for the temples, buy a book and read the history, take a standard cheap Tuk Tuk and don't bother with the guide. The guides are great but also feel like they need to tell you everything about the temples as you view them. The temples are all so special you just want to look and let you mind picture the past and wonder at their majesty and mystery. This is very hard to do when you are being spoken to all of the time. This is also the cheapest and most authentic way to visit."

Somehow, it didn't really prepare me for the feeling of standing in and amongst its structure. Erected in the late-12th century, largely forgotten to history and consumed by the surrounding jungle until its rediscovery, large parts of it are now badly ruined. But the combination of the ruins and the jungle make this one of the most unique temples in the world, and brings with it a feeling of having visited something truly special. In fact, its probably safe to say that the more the jungle appears to have grown through or around a wall or doorway, the more intriguing it looks. We were largely the only visitors at the time, and the sound of the trees and the breeze brought a sense of peace and tranquility.Arriving at the east gate of the outer wall, it's a trek of several hundred metres to the main compound. The trail is broad but can be a little flooded if its just rained, so be careful where you tread. We also encountered more young children just outside the main temple compound selling drinks and little trinkets than at any other major temple we visited."

Too see temples completely taken over and covered by tress will take you centuries back and will give you a sense of how all this must have seen to the first archaeologists on the scene.

Unlike most of the temples we had visited earlier, this temple was pretty much left as it was originally found, with only the addition of walkways and structural support.Upon arriving at it's gates, expect mini restaurants, sanitary facilities and lots and lots of aggressive, English speaking vendors/street urchins who can't see to take \"Ot teh!\" (No in Khmer) as an answer. As high as the other temples were, Ta Phrom is flat in comparison. The unique feature of the place however, are the spung trees that have sprouted in, around and ON the place.  As with nearly all the other temples bas reliefs and apsara (goddesses) carvings decorate the walls and columns of this temple. The place is a bit muddy in the inside, with most parts of the flooring, covered in wooden walkways. I must say, the huge roots of the strangler trees as well as the awesome spung tree, have given so much character to this place.After going around the inside of Ta Phrom, be prepared for another 5 minute power walk. I think it took me 10 minutes, as, once again, I was carrying our exhausted child, MAX. Poor Phil was still suffering from the stress of Baphuon, compounded by his recently fractured and dislocated arm. At the end of the pathway, we were once again reunited with our tuktuk.\""

Perhaps what made Cambodian temples famous all around the world \u2013 don\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t remember Angelina Jolie chased by stone demons were one of the best scenes you ever remember from your teenage days... \uf04aTemple wise, what makes Ta Prohm stands out will be the huge trees growing on the temple complex. The roots of the trees growing are so massive and deep rooted, it\u2019s a part of the temple structure now. The temple is undergoing restoration (joint India \u2013 Cambodian restoration project), so some parts of the temple were blocked out from public access. But you will still get to see a great part of the temple. Prepare to spend at least an hour in this temple and it\u2019s worth the time. PS: if you are travelling alone and want selfie \u2013 do yourself a favor and get a selfie stick! The best 5$ you ever spend for photography. Tip : Before you go and visit the temples, take a trip to Angkor National Museum and spend 2-3 hours there to explore and find out more about the temples and who build them and when. Museum entry is 15$ and don\u2019t forget to get the audio commentary in English, its worth the additional 3$ you spend. To enter inside the Angkor temple complex (which consist of the hundreds of big and small temples) you need to buy a pass. It\u2019s USD 20$ for 1 days and USD 40$ for 3 days. If you have time and keen on exploring the temples, I would recommend to take the 3 days pass and you could take your own time to see the place and explore it on your own terms. Climate wise, July to Nov is Cambodian rainy season \u2013 so its low season you get cheaper accommodation etc. Downside it rains some time the whole day. Dec to June is summer time and when sun is out, its scorching hot! April is the hottest time of the month."

The effect, then, was very stunning! It's as if time stood frozen inside its dark, musty halls. And those huge tree roots, eating up all the rubble, were very breathtaking! I would suggest to visit Ta Prohm at around late afternoon, just like we did, for that full magical effect!"

The usual hawkers await outside to greet you but no more persistent than elsewhere in the world.It is a much smaller one than the two previously mentioned so the crowds can be more noticeable even though I didn't really find that detracted noticeably from the overall experience, we just got tired of ruins and so changed our itinerary on the spot to see more interesting things. the guide was good and was a wealth of information so no reflection on him."

After the great temple of Angkor Wat and the Temple of the Face.i.e. Bayon Temple, the third temple in our travel itinerary is the Ta Prohm. Our guide who was trained as a tour guide pronounced it Tap Room so I was surprised with the spelling which is so local in origin..Ta Prohm. It was a very fascinating temple since one will marvel at the monstrous trees hugging whole walls of the ruins in many parts of the compound. Not just one but rather a good number of huge monstrous trees with roots encroaching in the walls of the ruins. Interestingly, we even found one giant tree precariously in a very dangerously stilted position requiring very tall steel bars to stop it from falling and with it toppling down an entire wall. Although smaller in scale and magnitude the Ta Prohm seems to be quite popular among the film goers. It is the scene for the film Lara Croft's Tomb Raider and you will be transported into the land beyond time, the unknown tribes of generations past and of the mysteries that cannot be unraveled. As one explores the various chambers, hallways and balustrades, Ta Prohm Temple will make you wonder how the monstrous trees have found a home in the ruins and have lasted through many centuries."

Best to have a tour guide who knows the inticacies of the passages and of course the history of the place. It's far enjoyable if someone leads the way with side tracks of history because you will have to appreciate the place more instead of memorizing the passages in the fear that you may get lost. And of course, tour guide will show you multitudes of beautiful spots to take pictures here.And yes, there is a lone carving that looks like a dinosuar, thanks to our tour guide we get to see it and take a picture of it. Ancient khmers might have seen one??? So they were able to mimic it by carving it in the temple's wall?? I don't know.

If they're good enough for UNESCO, they're good enough for me.Ta Prohm differs from other key monuments, in that restorers retained some vegetable matter. The ficus was the great, inexorable, mortal enemy of all Khmer monuments. All temple robbers combined-- from foreign looters to Andre Mal, only come in second. The fig roots got everywhere, and then grew to force apart stones and comvert architecture into ruins. Here, you get to see some of this in action. In addition to mature trees growing out of the temple, there are some interesting and insidious opportunistic roots running along the bases of the temple.

We were short on time and so hired a guide who was great in making sure we hit all the great spots for pictures.This temple is what many of the locals call the \"tomb raider\" or \"Angeline Jolie\" temple, since this is where part of Tombraider was filmed."

I wonder how the conservation is keeping the trees from causing further deteriorations. The beauty of this temple is the juxtaposition of man made vs the power of nature. There are still piles and piles of stones around given the preservation of this temple has been happening over 20 years. Wear ankle supported shoes. Go off the path a little ;-). Also, may sounds cruel, but I don't recommend buying any trinkets and books from the children at the entrance on 2 fronts: young children shouldn't be hawking and those books may be infringing on copyrights.

The trees growing out of the ruins are perhaps the most distinctive feature of Ta Prohm.....When in late nineteenth century temple was discovered by French, they decided not to conduct a full-scale restoration of the temple. The decision was made due to the fact that giant trees, such as ficus and silk tree, were so merged with ancient walls that eventually they became whole.

You see the photographs before you visit Angkor and everyone wants to visit the trees growing through the walls. At Ta Prohm you come face to face with the reality and I have to say the pictures do not do this justice. You have to see first hand the way these huge live trees have embraced the man made structures and just engulfed them in their root systems. The temple itself is pretty run down and one of the less spectacular temples but the trees make so much difference. Over centuries they have grown into huge living organisms and the way this has included the structures is just mind blowing. It truly is a wondrous sight and one that no one should miss. Spend some time just wandering around the outside walls too and you'll see more and more examples of how a root has just wrapped itself around a wall or through a doorway and pushed on into life. One of the most impressive mixes of man and nature I have seen. Great also to see the plans for restoration which will hopefully embrace the trees and bring this temple back to life, although life currently runs right through its heart."

You will need plenty of water. We hired a private driver and newer van (with great a/c) through our hotel, and the driver had cool scented wash cloths plus ice cold water waiting for us. It was well worth the $150.( this included our guide) US dollars for the day that we spent.

I disregard all the reviews complaining about too many people, and too many touts. If that's the basis for not enjoying the visit, then do not visit to begin with. I believe the significance of the place goes beyond its reconstruction and commercialization. That said, the crowd in this place is much better controlled than those at Angkor Wat and Phnom Backeng."

Nevertheless, it is cool to see... and I'm glad for the restoration so that those in the future can get a better idea of the original state.If you have a driver, the best is probably to ask to be dropped off at the E gopura and then picked up at the W gopura."

But most of us won't ever get ten days at Siem Reap so have to cherry pick. The main temple is a no-brainer but other highlights include Bayon Temple and this, Ta Prohm.The attraction here is of course the chance to see in real life the sorts of shots you've seen online and in books of the way nature has moved into the temples and the huge trees that have become entwined with the temple. My words will never be able to describe this as well as a brace of photos so do yourself a favour and check out some of the traveller shots here.You will want to put this entrancing temple complex on your must do list."

There were a few parts that were under construction though, which was shame.Since the area was surrounded by all the trees, it was always nice and shaded especially since it was 35 degrees when I visited! There may be several pushy vendors at the entrance of the temples who will try to sell you things. Just be ready to say no with a smile if needed, and you'll be fine.It's about a 10-minute tuktuk ride from Angkor Wat, and a 30-minute tuktuk ride from the city center."

Due to Khmer New Year on the 14-16th of April the roads around other Angkor Wat and Angkor Thom were extremely busy and it took us nearly an hour by Tuk-Tuk from Siem Reap. Outside the entrance I almost got annoyed by the sales people trying to sell me things and even though I did say no they tried to shove things in my face and block my way in. Finally inside there was not a problem as guards at the gate only let people with entrance passes in.The temple itself is amazing, a lot to walk around and look at and to explore. It is one of the jungle temples that has been restored fairly much and the work they have done is fantastic. The before and after pictures paints really shows how much work has gone into restoring this ancient monument. You feel really small, standing there looking at the giant trees growing out of the building. This is a real must see. Just remember that it is dry, hot and dusty. We opted for a 3 day pass and did 2 temples a day on two different days and stayed for about 2 hours at each temple. That way we didn't get what they called \"templed out\". We enjoyed the city, landscape, temples and culture and enjoyed it fully. Don't forget to bring plenty of water and protection against the sun."

Despite being in the same area as Angkor Wat and Bayon, Ta Prohm holds its own against its more famous cousins. It was built in 1186 and was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1992. Interestingly, the idea for the video game franchise Tomb Raider was taken from the images here of Ta Prohm.I wanted to arrive at Ta Prohm fairly early to avoid most of the crowds. By Tuktuk from downtown Siem Reap, it took about 15 minutes. When I arrived at Ta Prohm, sure enough the crowds were fairly manageable and I was able to get my Angkor Pass inspected and then able to head in to the temple. There is a long dirt road from the car park into the actual temple, and you can hear the aggressive screeching of the crickets and cicadas in the jungle either side of you, which all adds to the atmosphere of the place.Not long after you enter the temple proper, you can see the famous overgrown trees that have captured the temple ruins. For the tourists, this is a major photo opportunity. Crowds of tourists can always be seen posing in front of these overgrown tree roots, but I found it more interesting to look at the details on the ruins themselves. The closer you look, the more you will discover, especially if you have done a bit of research beforehand.Disturbingly, I did notice a few huge hornets nests high above Ta Prohm, especially in the inner courtyard areas. I did not see any hornets (only ants) but it was still a little disconcerting to see their nests above me as I was exploring. In Sri Lanka at Sigiriya, there are also hornets nests nearby and we were told to keep quiet to avoid provoking them. Here at Ta Prohm, no such warnings exist.Overgrown roots and hanging vines are what makes Ta Prohm so special, and so different from many of the other temples in the Angkor region. Of course, you have Beng Mealea and Preah Khan that are jungle ruins, but Ta Prohm is the best out of the three. It has been left in much the same condition as it was found, unlike most of the other temples here, which have had extensive restoration work. I did notice that some restoration at Ta Prohm was underway, as a joint effort between Cambodia and India."

A lot of the scenes were built on set in Hollywood. You can get to Ta Prohm from your hotel (usually all located on the hotel strip) via a tuk tuk. I stayed at Lotus Blanc. Not sure how much tuk tuk would have cost. My cousin and I hired a driver with an english tour guide via the hotel. We called around for private tour guides to compare prices and the hotel does offer competitive pricing so we just booked via the hotel. The price of an English translator was US$30 and the car rental US$35. This does not include the admission pass which is US$40 and tip for the driver and translator. Also you may want to make sure you have US$1 bills on you as there are a lot of kids wandering the streets trying to sell tourists post cards, bracelets, etc. They are really too cute to turn away. $1 can go along way for them."

Of course as it is said that dinosaurs were not known about until the 1800s, how did these people several hundreds of years ago know the Stegosaurus ever existed, unless they perhaps saw one? This is being debated amongst creationists and evolutionists, some who think the relief is just a hedgehog in front of a bush.

Instead we spent Day 1 touring some truly magnificent temple grounds in the Siem Reap area, thinking we were saving the best for last. With all the hype about Angelina Jolie filming Tomb Raider here, expectations were high. Then, after seeing Angkor Thom and Angkor Wat, this didn't compare.We were more blown away by the astonishing trees growing here, that have trunks twenty times the size of human girth and tower 100 feet into the air. Trees are so gargantuan that the expanding root systems dislodge a 20 ton section of wall like it's made of Legos.The temple itself is in varying states of crumbling and restoration. The restoration effort has included cutting away some of the towering flora that had swallowed the structure for hundreds of years. Piles of fallen stone blocks clutter the grounds everywhere, as do visible steel and wood support beams where renovation is going on. It's a mess, so tread very carefully.You can get a bit of an idea what the temple looked like in its glory, in a few small sections where a restoration team from India worked for three years. Otherwise it looks like a pile of rubble with trees growing through the walls.Ta Phrom is in use as a temple again and, in a few areas, headless Buddhas are posed for the faithful. Both men and women are expected to wear respectful clothing (no bare shoulders, midriff, cleavage, short shorts or dresses) but, unlike the other temples, I didn't see any enforcement here.Don't go between 11-3. Though the area is heavily shaded, the heat is incredibly intense, even in early April.You'll be absolutely barraged at the entrance with a throng of locals hawking scarves, T-shirts, postcards, cold drinks, etc. They don't accept no for an answer, so be prepared. I thought one woman was going to finally grab my husband's leg when our tuk tuk was pulling away. Admission is $20 per day to experience ALL temples in the area (or $40 for a 3-day pass.) You can't possibly see them all in a day, so get the multi-pass. You can't buy a partially used pass from another tourist because yours is personalized with a photo ID at purchase.I'd recommend seeing this temple first and building your experience from there."

We went early, arriving just after 6am, and this is definitely the best time to go, as there were only about 10 other people there. Having this temple mostly to yourself is just amazing. I was stunned by the beauty of the trees and their roots growing over stone fences and through buildings. I loved the fact that although some renovation of buildings is going on, most of the temple is being left as it was found. This adds so much atmosphere to it, and gives you an idea of what it would've been like when first discovered in this state. Came across a lovely Buddhist lady, who tied a red bracelet on me, and said a prayer for good luck while she was doing it - even though you give a small donation, I found the experience very uplifting. You can get your tuk-tuk driver to wait for you, but frankly, there are so many waiting when you come out that you won't have trouble getting one! Go as early as you can and beat the crowds, I think the essence of these places is to try and have them to yourself as much as possible, so you can experience the atmosphere and sacredness of them as much as you can."

This was probably my favourite temple because of the quintessential 'strangler figs all over the walls' photos together with a wonderful feel.We felt so lucky as we almost had the complex to ourselves, well not exactly, but no other people in our photos probably because we visited, by accident, at lunch time (12.30pm to 1pm) and I daresay the hoards of tourist bus tourists must have been stopped for lunch.At every turn there's an even better picture than the one before.Exquisite!!"

The temple may look small from the front but it goes one forever once you enter - it is kind of a maze so make sure you know which lot you are meeting your driver at because there are two entrances/exits and it is easy to get turned around once inside. This temple is truly unique compared to others in the area due to the impressive and beautiful melding of nature and man mad structure. Allow yourself time to wander and take pictures. The areas made famous by the Tomb Raider movie are beautiful for pictures but may have multiple people waiting to take pictures so be patient."

There was also restoration work going on when we visited.The saving grace of this temple, apart from its beautiful trees, some of which are, by the way, in danger of being cut, is how you can still sneak to the side where you can actually be alone and where you can sit on fallen blocks and gaze at the marvel that is nature reclaiming what was once hers.If you want to feel the odd beauty of ruins, I recommend Beng Mealea (significantly less toursity especially in the afternoon).

Ta Prohm was the temple that featured most heavily in the movie. Arguably the trees are the star of this temple, and a particular tree that's prominent in the film has become the main attraction. Admittedly I was there in February during a busy period, but it was stupidly busy. I'm not kidding, I actually queued in a 20 strong queue to have my photo taken with the tree which has a little rope across it. Also, unfortunately a lot of restoration work was happening, and there's nothing like diggers, scaffolding and 2000 people with bum-bags to shatter the fantasy that you're an lone intrepid adventurer on a quest to find hidden treasure. I'm afraid it really isn't that great. Nor is it the only place where trees have grown over the temples. I'd actually say somewhere like Preah Khan has a bigger and better tree that doesn't require fighting hoards of tourists to get a shot with it. This was the temple I was most excited about and the most disappointed by. There are smaller temples that you can visit early in the morning and have to yourself if you're looking for the explorer experience. If you're looking for a theme park experience, this is it. Whilst Tomb Raider helped the local economy, it has sadly helped trash this temple. But I shouldn't complain too much, I was one of the idiot tourists trashing it! You won't bear more than an hour here."

This is likely the most famous of Angkor's jungle temples -- seemingly in the python-like grip of strangler fig trees and site of the filming of Angelina Jolie's Tomb Raiders film. Our guide was Nu Tat. He speaks English very well, is well educated, and his commentaries are interesting and meaningful. Another of Tat's good qualities is that he doesn't follow the conventional itinerary so his clients tend to see the temples at less-visited times. Tat can be reached at nutarth@yahoo.com"

We went before lunch time and though we wanted to spend moments of silence, it was nearly impossible because of the flock of tourists in the area.

Trees were left in place rather than excavated from the site and it makes for a wondrous experience to see the roots growing through the stones. Some of the best pictures you will find will be in Ta Prohm!"

We went on a private tour (via Beyond Unique Tours: see my review of them), but you can easily visit this yourself by hiring a TukTuk driver from your hotel or in town. Went early and bought our tickets at 07.45am at the Official Ticket Office which was already busy! US$20 per person for a one-day, all-temple visit, or US$40 for a 3-day ticket. You have your photo taken for a personal ticket, so that you cannot re-sell it ... and each temple door-staff ask to see it. This was a great start to our day. You can buy water and fruit at the stalls OUTSIDE the temple walls. An 800-metre walk up a sandy path to arrive at a great temple... where the tree roots really do intertwine with the temple building. Very eery & quiet. And yes, you do see the infamous \"Tomb Raider' door, but it is roped off now, so you can only stand on a wooden platform in front of it. Well worth a visit and do go with a guide who can tell you the history ... particularly about the old 'Library' which is the first building on the right as you approach the temple. I had a foot-cast & walking stick, but still managed to get around. We all loved this!"

When you see the tree roots growing over the walls and inner structures of Ta Prohm, you can understand how these temples were lost to the jungle for centuries. Unfortunately these same trees are causing immense damage to the temple, which was very apparent after a 2 year break from visiting. They have started stabilising the temple for safety, and I'm guessing some of the trees will be removed. But I'm sure that the authorities realise that these trees are the big draw card here. It does get very busy, but have always found it easy enough to photograph without getting crowds in the shots. There are some huge tree roots on the boundary walls, which make a great background when taking portrait shots of people standing amongst the roots."

I am sure if any attempt is made to remove the roots the structure will collapse.It was amusing to see that the temple is hyped more with the tourist groups by their guides because of the Tomb Raider filming here on Angelina Jolie. The crowds were the thickest at the spot where she was supposed to have been filmed in action. In that packed area I could hear guides in at least three languages including Japanese explaining the site to the groups. I did not understand a word they said but I did hear Angelina Jolie mentioned at least four times with great emphasis. It almost sounded like that this ancient temple was dedicated to her than any of the gods the Khmer worshiped.There is a lot of restoration work going on at the site and care must be taken not to lose your footing and injure yourself inside the temple structure."

One Sunday I had an opportunity to visit this place in the afternoon. I would say that we must visit places considering varieties. We usually go to beaches, theatres and amusing parks and avoid going to historical places. I recommend going to places like this one."

You can easily imagine Indiana Jones running thru this temple chased by some crazed Indians with poisonous darts flying everywhere, ok great imagination but I Would so love for CGI. To be used to recreate these places as they once were in their full glory and colour, they must have been awesome to those approaching in a flat landscape and with so much colour and splendour, they were obviously amazing feats of craftsmanship, so many stone masons and supporting builders, no mechanical help, an army of people to feed the workers, amazing!!!!. I also love the countryside around these temples, Cambodia is a very lovely place. I would suggest that you buy your. 3 day pass the day before you plan to visit and avoid the 2 hrs or more lost at the ticket office, they are valid for 7 days and you can use them for any 3 days in that period. As with all the temples be careful, there is little evidence of repairs or restoration, there are steep steps and crumbling walls that at some time will fall, just be aware but for sure we'll worth the visit."

Still lucky to have seen some parts of Ta Prohm even if they were renovating in Oct. 2012. When I came back last June 2013, they closed most parts of Ta Prohm, there was nothing much to see. I'm pretty sure it will be great once the renovation is done. Just a bit worried since they cut sooo many trees :("

The archeologist have spent a lot of effort maintaining the buildings how it was rediscovered in 1800s. As far as I am concerned, that was the most brilliant idea ever. There are a ton of tourist there, so get there early. Plus it gets so hot during the day that its much nicer to relax at the pool in the afternoon. I recommend going around sunrise. Its really twisty in there, like a maze, with wonders at every turn. I recommend a guide to learn more about the history and what the different friezes mean. They are also doing a lot of work on the temple now, which is interesting also. The best temple in the entire park."

The trees will look fantastic with the soft light and you will be able to stroll around with very few people. It really adds to the atmosphere, even more than other Angkor temples. It's also good in the afternoon around 4:30.If you just leave the courtyards with the famous trees, you will see fewer people and you might enjoy some fine carvings above the doors. Be very careful if you feel like scrambling around masonry as it is loose and may fall."

In several places, there are trees growing on top/on the roof of the temple and it really gives you a sense of history and the cycle of life. Whatever humans build, nature can still find a way to overcome it. The fact that the temple is in the process of being reconstructed emphasizes how elaborate the stones are, and the significance of the Khmer Empire in creating structures like this in the 13th Century. The only drawback is that there are so many tourists, and many are loud and don't obey the rules about where they are allowed to go. It was annoying, disruptive, and disrespectful. Nevertheless, nature overcomes and this is still a beautiful site."

Out of all the temples we have visited on our trip to the Angkor Complex (each one having something special and wonderful to offer), this one has to be the most atmospheric. We took the route through the jungle to get there and spent a few hours exploring. With having so many trees growing through the building, it is in need of restoration; so it was pleasing to see that the works are underway. It did mean that we could not access all areas, but I would rather have that than have such a beautiful place be destroyed.It is a really popular place to visit, especially following the Tomb Raider film, but despite the crowds, the visit is totally worth it. It is a huge complex in which there are so many wonderful things to see, such as beautiful carvings which have survived the wilds of the jungle and wars, unbelievably huge roots growing in different areas of the temple."

This was temple number 6 for us and to be truthful altho I keep a journal and write up all informaioin some of them have gotten muddled up -however this one you cannot easily forget.the ruins are being held together by nature- yes this is the one that was featured in the film. This temple was built for the Mother of the king- most of them were built for a particular family member as that helped with attaining greater merit to becoming nearer enlightenment for Buddhist Kings at that time.Our guide told us that the walls would have originally held gemstones, gold plate,pearls and rubies etc- wow must have looked totally dazzling. The times of plundering and looting when the area became less used took away all that wealth. Again this temple housed people- at one point the monks and students maintained the building, they used to live there and clean the building.It was built in 1186 with the intention of it being a scholarly place- a school for the Royal Family aswell as for students- ie a sort of university.The dwelling places that were there originally have sadly all crumbled a long time ago.This temple was a big temple to be used by the people- unlike Angkot Wat which was only for the king and his retinue to use- for the god king ceremonies.After walking around you can leave and use the various stalls outside for some relief- fruit, delicious Cambodian coffee, snacks and meals- we had fish amok,aubergine curry and morning glory- exceptionally tasty- and no after effects! The stalls close at 5.30. You will also see lots of tiny children selling postcards, fridge magnets etc.they are so sweet and petite- they should be at school but often their fathers have no work and so the family cannot afford to send them to school so I did not feel bad giving them the odd dollar."

I wish I could have spent days there just to see the contrast of light and dark and the textures and colors of the ancient architecture and glory of the jungle becoming one. A wonderful experience, the only thing that would have made it better would have been less people. It is amazing how disrespectful some visitors were to the point that they would actually litter the area and disrespect the sacred aspects of such an ancient and venerable place."

I am so grateful that the archeologists decided to leave the jungle in place, because in this way one can see what man can make and what nature over time takes back from man when left in peace. Ta Prohm was constructed in the end of the 12th century and was a buddhist Monastery. Today much of the monastery is in ruins, but you can see how the huge Kapok trees have been growing, slowly taking back the nature. Some restaurations are being made, but in principle they are never going to fully restore the temple, maybe because a lot of visitors wants to see this place because of the filming of \"Tomb Raider\" in the ruins? I liked the place very much, and recommend a visit to all who are interested in history."

The temple no doubt like many other temples around is not without the jungle dominance and is beautiful and an absolute delight for camera. The tour guide we took was really enthusiastic and informative about the place and showed around the place very efficiently. The temple is actually haunting with the clinging roots and overgrowing jungle from each corner of the temple complex. Ta prohm has a very unique ambiance and without the hustle and bustle of the touring crowd the place can actually be a little eerie. Depending upon the climate, it is better to get proper precaution in clothing and having a comfortable shoe comes as a necessity around the place as there is a lot of walk and climb."

In contrast Ta Prohm retains its giant fig trees growing out , over and through the buildings along with stones and rubble.

There is even a crane erected to aid with restoration efforts. I do think it changes the feeling of Ta Prohm and to be honest I left a little disappointed. It was still amazing but perhaps prepare yourself that there will be restorations going on I'd say for a few months ahead. Plan your trip to avoid the busy periods if that is at all possible. A lot of tours seem to head anticlockwise around the small loop from Angkor Wat to Ta Prohm so perhaps you could head straight there in the morning.... What a fantastic place.

I used driver Sophean (+855 92 986 353) who spoke good English and told of tales and history of Cambodia. Entrace is included in the Angkor Heritage Pass - USD20 for one day and USD40 for up to 3days. I recommend the 3day pass as it is not possible to visit all in a single day. Hire a guide if you must for more elaborate understanding of the temples but I went temple hopping alone. Tour groups and large crowd in this temple makes it difficult to take nice photos - my driver recommended to visit this temple first before the rest for best pictures and less crowd. Normal itineraries usually include this as one of the midday or afternoon stopovers.Ta Prohm is mostly in ruins and trees overgrow the temple grounds but this adds an amazing feature to photos.

We only visited 3 temples on our trip to Siem Reap, of these, Ta Prohm's condition was the least appealing (the temple is undergoing restoration and hopefully will have more to offer once completed). The pathway to the temple reminded me of the walkway to Chateau Chenonceau in Loire Valley, but then everything else is centuries apart. The temple is more of an attraction for the trees and for the fact that the movie tomb raider was shot here. The trees are other worldly. The barks are huge, at least 5-6 feet in diameter, but our guide explained that they're hollow. There were many types of unique branches around the complex at which people stopped for a photo-op.The only interesting tower in the complex was the echo tower, where apparently the king beat his body (which then resonated in the tower) in an effort to cast away evil spirits before his prayers/meditation."

The jungle is close to other temple areas, but here you feel you are in the heart of the jungle. 2) So far there has been little restoration to this temple. In this more natural state you can sense its 800 years of history. In its dark corridors there is a strong feeling of mystery. (For this reason this temple became famous in 2000 when the movie, TOMB RAIDERS with Anjelina Jolie was filmed here.) (3) The overpowering sight of tree roots consuming the temple. The roots appear to crawl from room to room."

These trees are a type of fig, that grows to gargantuan size with roots that penetrate through crevasses, between rock blocks that was made by the temple architect, in search of water in this arid land.Now these roots of these trees are forming as a natures own sculpture, showing us the beauty of infinite power that is inherent in plants.

Work with a guide and go when there are the lowest number of tourists, as this can turn into a cacophany of tourism which can ruin the experience of this haunting temple.There are a large number of temples in the Angkor Wat, Angkor Thom, and outlying areas as well. Don't feel you have to see them all. Three full days of touring are important to do this world-class venue justice but these are the Don't Miss sites, in this order of priority: Angkor Wat, of course, the stellar, Number One site; Bayon; Terrace of the Elephants and Terrace of the Leper King; Ta Prohm; Bandrey Srei; Preah Kahn; Pre Rup; Neak Prean.Give yourself time to visit your three favorites a second time within your three day itinerary. Many are so overwhelming in their interest, architecture, and artistry that you must see them at least twice to begin to appreciate them. We had to see the Churning of the River of Milk at Angkor Wat three times, as it was so artistically stunning, and is comparable to the greatest carvings anywhere in the World."

Ta Prohm is where part of Indiana Jones was filmed.. but more importantly, lets people witness the dynamic interaction between man made art and nature... temple walls where ancient trees have grown and split massive stones. To actually stand beside trees that are hundreds of years old, and see where their strangulating roots have \"taken over\" the inside of the main entrance pavilion of the temple, is spectacular. I recommend that you take an English speaking guide with you to explain the history of various temples.. its very cheap, and is worth the few dollars it will cost."

Really interesting for its raw nature and also not as big as some of the other temples so you can see if before you start to tire of seeing yet another apsara! A warning though.

Is not the top temple but is on third position after Bayon and Angkor Wat"

They are the able-bodied, in shape and high spirited types of mortals. Well I guess possessing these attributes would be an advantage to any tourist who would explore the wondrous sights in Siem Reap.This is especially true when I and my sister went to the magical temple called Ta Prohm. After being dropped by our hired driver at the eastern gate who told us that he will be waiting at the western side of the complex, I knew that exploring The Jungle Temple would require a considerable amount of strength.Upon entering the gate and a 15-minute walk of a dirt road penetrating though the Cambodian jungle, we witnessed our first glimpse of a breathtaking out of this world sight. Just when we thought we\u2019d seen the best along came Ta Phrom and it blew us away!It seemed like the gigantic unrelenting jungle trees married themselves to the stone buildings by hugging and caressing them which results to bizarre breathtaking form.It gives you the feeling that after being left to nature for hundreds of years, the jungle decided to take over the temple and make its presence felt by outgrowing the numerous parts of the temple complex with very huge stems, branches and roots gripping and embracing the walls.Words definitely do not do justice for Ta Phrom."

It is a place well worth learning about and discovering ancient engineering ingenuity and artistic masterpieces."

Ta Prohm lived up to our every expectation in terms of scenery, etc. Unfortunately the place was not only being taken over by the gigantic trees but also hoards full of tourists- as shame really as this kind of took away some of its charm. We went there around 11am and the place was pretty busy. Try to avoid the other tourists if you can to fullly absorb this magical place."

            "review": "The Jungle Temple. Ta Prohm isstuff of which nightmares are made - all those overhanging trees provide a gloomy atmosphere for an active mind. When researching, I was surprised to find Ta Prohm is the modern name for this temple - it was originally called Rajavihara. This was its name in Khmer - \u179a\u17b6\u1787\u179c\u17b7\u17a0\u17b6\u179a. The temple is to the east of Angkor Thom and you enter from the west and leave from the east. Building on Ta Prohm began in 1186 AD. Originally known as Rajavihara (Monastery of the King), it was built by Jayavarman VII who dedicated it to his mother. Constructed originally as a Buddhist monastery, it was enormously wealthy in its time with control over 3000 villages, thousands of support staff and vast stores of jewels and gold. Unlike the other wats at Angkor, this one has been left the way was it was found - overgrown with trees, their roots taking hold and the temple reverting to nature - an overgrown jungle with hanging branches and leaves the master here. When my driver dropped me at Ta Prohm, I walked under a canopy of trees along the path and heard music. A group of disabled landmine musicians were seated on the ground playing instruments. These men are victims of the landmines that were laid by the Khmer Rouge. They do not play, they wait for money to be given, then they play. The best time to visit this temple is in the middle of the day as the leaves form a canopy shading you from the hot sun. There is a sense of timeless beauty surrounding this eerie place, no doubt due to the quiet and the fact that it is a ruin in the middle of a jungle. The only sound was the sound of the birds swooping around the trees. You need to watch were you're walking, there are so many massive stones, rocks and bits of building paraphernalia lying in assorted fashion as though they have been laid there artistically. Among the ruins I saw balustrades with carving at the top and bottom. There was a large Banyan tree in the foreground. To give you some idea of the place, you just need to look at all the foliage, now imagine it is an endless sea all around you - everywhere you turn and when you crane your neck up to look at the sky - all you see is miles and miles of tree and leaves. It is like being in another world seeing these giant trees taking over and growing out of the temple. Banyan, kapok and strangler figs spread and twist their roots over and under and around, their knobby roots looking like deformed snakes taking over everything it their wake."

They fell over numerous times but got straight back up again as it was so much fun. Having said that the adults loved it too!It can be a bit slippery so think of your shoe choice. Whilst the carving wasn't nearly as impressive as Angkor Wat for example we enjoyed it far more b/c of the atmosphere and shade the jungle provided.We went mid afternoon and there were other people but certainly not a lot. Plenty of opportunity to get away from others. Preah Khan was also great with even less people.Fee covered by Archaeological Park ticket."

Logically the explanation was that when Angkor was discovered, these parts of the city was at level ground with these large trees on them. Then only the temples was dug out, leaving the trees as it is. One of the best attraction at Angkor, certainly recommended this."

Mind-boggling if you ask me. How the heck did this happen? :) Its easier to go around Ta Prohm than Bayon and Angkor Wat...maybe because Im not really fond of stairs and climbing. TIP: Taking photos is difficult as there are many tourists lining up so what i did was find another spot (there are plenty of picturesque spots here dont worry) without that much people and take photos there. After that, I went back to the famous spot and taa-daa! people moved on to their next destination so its all mine. its just a matter of timing. Because most have tour guides that take them systematically around Ta Prohm, you just have to be ahead of their \"route\" :)"

The beauty of the trees growing over, around and through the temple walls was incredible! We also really enjoyed taking photos throughout this temple complex and because of the leaves providing shade, but still allowing some light in, the lighting was the best in this place! While I probably will never return to this spot, I will definitely recommend it to anyone planning to visit Cambodia."

Ta Prohm, located about one km east of Angkor Thom, it is one of the most visited temple in the Angkor Archaeological Park area and also one of the most photographed sites. So unique is this temple site that it was also used for shooting of the famous film \u201cTomb Raider\u201d. Ta Prohm was constructed during the late 12th and early 13th century by the Buddhist King Jayavarman VII not only as a temple but as a Buddhist monastery as well as a university in honour of his family. After the fall of the Khmer empire, this temple was forgotten and left in total neglect for centuries until it was rediscovered much later and subsequently made a Unesco Heritage Site in 1992.  It gives you the feeling that after being left to nature for hundreds of years, the jungle had decided to take over the temple and make its presence felt by outgrowing the numerous parts of the temple complex with very huge stems, branches and roots gripping and embracing the walls. Strangely the gigantic roots, instead of uprooting the buildings, have in fact grown in such a manner as though to lend support and stabilize further the building structure. Most of the gigantic roots have grown so big and flushed so well with the buildings that they become a surprisingly photogenic combination. There are so many locations around the temple complex where you can see these tree roots hugging and caressing the building structures and they are really amazing. In some areas and walkways, wooden platforms have been built for the safety of tourists and it can be observed that as far as possible where it does not pose any danger, the original state of the whole temple have been deliberately left unaltered and untouched by archaeologists and restoration teams and so as they say, in the ruins of Ta Prohm lies its magnificence.This unanimous decision to preserve the natural state of the temple as it was discovered is in recognition and appreciation of the natural wonder and beauty of the dense jungle, the uniqueness of Ta Prohm Temple and also the immense tourist potential. Today Ta Prohm is one of the most visited sites in the whole of Cambodia."

Our guide highlighted the fact that Ta Prom changes constantly because the jungle trees are unrelenting and powerful enough to destroy the heavy stone temple buildings. The managememt technique is to cut back leaning trees before they topple over and take out large sections of the temple. It is true that this can spoil some views but this Temple is very large with many, many, beautiful and spectacular photo opportunities. The bigger problem is the rapid growth in the number of tourists in the temple rich Siem Reap region. The Cambodian economy is benifiting from the boom, but it remains to be seen how well the authorities can manage these beautiful and unique sights - so go now. Important hint: do not rely on a guide book! An accredited local guide can really add to your appreciation of these unique sights. It is money well spent for multiple reasons."

The way the roots entangle themselves around the stone walls is amazing and gives a real impression of how this would have looked discovering it for the first time.Despite the huge crowds, we did manage to find a spot just as spectacular, which we had to ourselves. Just after the most famous Lara Croft spot, through the doorway towards the exit, turn sharply left and straight ahead there is a great spot where you can climb the fallen stones to get a good vantage point (see attached photograph)."

I feel like I could have spent all day at just this temple. Unfortunately we were there during the rainy season and we got rained out halfway through our tour! I would definitely recommend this temple. Beware of all the people selling goods outside the temple and children tugging on your arm begging for money. Once you're in the temple you won't have anybody bugging you."

Still, if you have patience it's not such a big deal. Come early, around 7.00am, to avoid the largest groups. Yes they have been doing restoration work which can be noisy and unsightly but it must be done. You will be surprised as how long it can take you to walk through Ta Prohm but take your time so you don't miss any of it, and make sure your camera is well charged!

We had our picture taken at the Angelina Jolie tree which was silly but almost seemed necessary! We visited in July and early in the morning. Crowds were not a problem at all."

My husband and I are travelling with our 19 month old daughter - our visit to Ta Prohm was a fantastic experience and we have some incredible photos from it. Just note that:- There is some restoration work in progress at the moment, and the scaffolding may be prominent in some of the 'iconic' photos. - Visitors can go almost anywhere, however there is a lot of 'uncleared stone' at this site in particular, some areas may be slippery in the wet season or unsafe - our toddler was able to roam comfortably in some grassy areas but she was carried in a backpack for most places (as you might expect). - There is limited information on site, and I do think that for the price ($60USD per person for a 7 day pass) that some information should be provided to 'unlock' the story behind this ancient place. We had a great reference book, and others have hired personal guides - either or both of these options are helpful to get value from the visit.- Tuk Tuk was the best transport for us - gave us flexibility to go anywhere and anytime. Most tuk tuks have a legal maximum of 3 passengers.- It's highly likely that you will be approached by children selling wares at each site. We were given advice to avoid purchasing from these children because it encourages their continued exploitation. It's hard to say no to these kids, so an alternative way to support them is to give a gift (e.g. a pencil, notepad, wrapped candy) rather than money. We got a 7 day pass, and spent early mornings (5am - 10am) and late afternoons (3pm - 6.30pm) at the temples. This site offers a lot of good shade and can be done at almost any time of the day for that reason."

We visited the site twice, first in the afternoon around 3.30 PM until 5.30 PM where the crowd has dispersed and you have the temple for your own. Of course, you have to hire your own transport (tuk-tuk) and not part of the group tour. The sinister fig tree root, devatas bas-relief and meditating chambers are some of the awesome subject. But with a lot of scaffolding and fence surrounding the temple to protects the ruin, taking clear shot is proven to be challenging, but rewarding. The next day we visited the temple again in the morning around 7.15 AM when only handful of people around. The natural light is not as we expected so we'd rather focus in the macro portraiture type. The crowd start pouring around 8.30 AM. So based on our personal experience, it's much better to take photos in the afternoon."

It was one of the reasons I wanted to see Cambodia - to see the jungle temple of Ta Prohm. Walking through the entrance gates of Ta Prohm, I couldnt help but notice the beautiful terra cotta colored earth. I was thinking how many generations of people have religiously walked that earth - Buddhists, Hindu, Khmer royalty, and spiritually evolved beings. Soon enough, I was awestruck by the ancient and giant forest of Spung Trees - most older than any human being alive, by many times over. These trees over bear witness to Khmer life and history. I am in the midst of an ancient civilization that has managed to keep its old world charm for a thousand years.Seeing the overgrown trees on temple rocks made me think - nature is powerful. We try so much to change the natural environment to suit us, but then in the end, our efforts remain only for as long as nature lets it. The beauty of Ta Prohm is that the trees have reclaimed the temple lands as it once was - their own. This is the power of nature. It is silent, patient, and seemingly passive. But it endures."

I was in Siem Reap for 2 days and went both days I liked it that much. I was lucky the second day as there weren't a lot of people so managed to get quite a few shots with no people in them. In some places I was the only person there for minutes at a time which by other peoples posts is quite rare. If you can handle the heat and humidity just get a tuk tuk for the day $15 USD. Take water but you can always buy out there which helps the locals out. A $1 tip goes a long way here so spread it round.This place is a must visit."

I had the feeling the temple is small, but it is much bigger then the first impression it creates. We spent there 2 hours without realizing it.The only thing I did not like were the large numbers of children selling things instead of attending school."

There are some big trees being cut too to preserve the temple. But you can still enjoy the beautiful temple, especially since the time Angkor was discovered again, Ta Prohm was made to be kept in the way it was found, this is why we can still see the big tress growing around even on top of the temple, sometimes it looks like some part of the temple are being entwined by trees like an octopus or snake, or even an elephant trunk. It's like the temple is supporting the trees, but the trees are supporting the temple as well. It's really is a different experience.Sadly we saw some people who don\u2019t respect the temples or understand things, they climb on top of some temples which has been restricted with rope and warnings for no climbing, not only they put them self in danger but they also show no respect.

The country is very special, mainly if you know a little of its glorious past history and also his infamous recent history. Of the many wonders we saw in our stay in the country, no doubt visit the temples of Angkor in Siem Reap, was the best of all things. We depart from the capital Phnom Pehn to the north and the 6 or 7 hours we stayed and the surreal road ( no more than 300 km) made us feel what was coming. Siem Reap is the nearest town to the Angkor complex with its numerous temples, and the starting point for every visitor in the region. This is where tourists staying and attending markets and restaurants. Among all the temples in Angkor, which dazzled us most, was Ta Prohm. It is simply spectacular. Built between the late twelfth and early thirteenth century by Jayavarman VII, one of major kings of ancient Khmer kingdom, whose capital was then the city of Angkor itself, is approximately 6 km far from the city center and can be reached by tuk-tuk or even bicycle. You must purchase a ticket which entitles nearly throughout the complex, at the park entrance, which is 3 km from Siem Reap. This amazing temple of Ta Prohm is unique, mainly because it has been kept pretty much the way it was found, many centuries after it was abandoned in the jungle, by the integration of nature with which was built by man.. The landscape reminds us of the cartoon, where plants and huge trees have life and seem to embrace the ancient stone buildings. Bas-reliefs depicting religious motifs, \"talking\" about the life of Buddha and showing various types of animals, are present everywhere. The mysterious air of the place, which was the scene of the first Laura Croft\u2019s movie, Tomb Raider, starring Angelina Jolie, is present even in the representation of an animal for millions of years fickle, the stegosaurus, which appears on some stone carvings . How it got there, no one knows, but scientists have proven that these figures were not placed there later. They are original. We stayed at the temple for a few hours, but the desire was never to leave."

It was hard to get a good shot as there always people in your frame! Another gripe is the persistent vendors selling trinkets and souvenir items the minute you walk towards the temple.

I went later in the afternoon and managed to avoid most of the crowds at Ta Phrom. It was great to be able to walk around so much of a site where in a lot of other countries you would only be able to view from afar, here you could walk through the temple and really get lost in the forest. By comparison Ta Phrom is in better condition and easier to get to than Beng Melea but if you have the time to make the trip (1.5 hours by car) it is also worth going to see. Even more over-grown and you literally climb over the tumbled down walls and through the ruins. In some areas it is hard to distinguish a path but you can feel like Indiana Jones or Lara Croft and explore almost every inch (at your own risk) and find your own way around. A boardwalk and some questionable stairs have been set up to assist you in your adventure and of course there is the obligatory guy selling souvenirs but all in all you feel very alone when browsing this site. Beng Melea is not part of the Angkor Park so it does cost an additional US$5. There are some great restaurants across from the entrance and water available to buy which is a must!"

The best time to visit Ta Phrom is between 6.30am-8.30am early in the morning with barely any crowd. We started out journey from the hotel at 6am and arrived at Ta Phrom at 6.30am. At that time there was only about 10 people around and we got to explore the temple in peace in the beautiful morning sun reflected in the gigantic trees. No queues whatsoever and we took the most beautiful pictures with the serene surroundings! Recommended to visit early in the morning to fully enjoy the splendors of the temple. The crowd starts coming in around 8am."

There is clearly a conflict between preservation and the drama of nature reclaiming its land. The current state of Ta Prohm gives an insight into the clearance and subsequent renovation that has been done in Angkor Wat and Angkor Thom, those sites have been restored and stabilised to a point where over the years to come we should see an improvement in their condition; at Ta Promh the small annual take over by the jungle is managed / reversed but the major strangulation by the trees and particularly their root systems is allowed to continue. There is no half measure in this situation, either remove the trees and try to restore the temple or allow the trees to, in the end, erase the temple. What is not clear today is what the authorities are trying to do, obviously they are using this as a tourist attraction to show the tree damage but at the same time there are small areas of the site that, judging by the quantity of scaffolding being deployed, are equally clearly having the structure fully restored. Contrary to some reports there was insufficient scaffolding around to limit photography (March 2013), there were also some places where it was evident that a bit of scaffolding might be a good thing in keeping structures intact!I am sure the Health & Safety police will be attacking this site in the near future - get there before they do and enjoy it as much as I did."

Like its neighbors in Angkor National Park, Bayon and Angkor Wat, the intricate carvings are strikingly well preserved given that these buildings languished in the heat for many decades. As a note, I visited with a private guide, which I would recommend if you want to learn about the temple's history as well the meaning of the carvings and statuary."

The old trees covering the huge stone bricks is simply amazing and always worth a picture!The problem at the moment is, that there are serious reparations going on.....of course they must be done and are important, but the workers take over almost the entire place and it disturbs the few a lot. As well they are very noisy.Let's hope that in a few month or years, when everything is repaired or reconstructed this place will get its silent hidden beauty back."

No doubt about it one of the wanders of the world. Its very intresting to note that Angkor wat itself is one of the biggest religious monuments in the world. There are many other amazing temples that you have to visit if your here, some are prymids very simuler to the prymids in south america. I was told by a very intresting Wize man that the pine cone towers represent the pineal gland ( crown chakra) and that the heads with four faces represent enlightened consciousness seeing into the spiritual dimensions. And these designs bring down divine energy into the meditation chambers directly beneath them. Even if you are not a believer still very intresting stuff. Its also intresting to note that most of these temples were Hindu, but have now been claimed as Buddhist temples. Would have been so amazing while they were in use, the architectures muat have been genius. Really amazing."

We were here around 9:30 and you can follow the people in a steady pace, not much space inside to just stand around. When we were done a bus with Chinese arrived. Overall I would rate Preah Khan higher and it's a similar wide set up, with a long hall way to walk through. It's nicer to see from the outside anyway as there are some cool trees overgrowing, however the tree in the middle at the end of the inside of the court gets so much attention that it's impossible to take photos without anybody else in it. I imagine it might be nicer first thing at 6 am or something. We didn't take a guide as our guide book explained the different stages of building these temples, the why and the what and the different stories that are depicted in the different temples, so that was enough for us. I could see those poor chinese standing in the heat of 35 C degrees in long trousers, shoes with socks listening to their animated tour guide... "

I did it early in the morning, right after the sunrise at Angkor Wat, and there was almost no tourist around. This was just perfect to just take the best pictures I wanted. What makes Ta Prohm so successful is definitely to see these big jungle trees taking over the stone and literally growing on top of the temple's walls. Some trees and roots are impressively huge. Some sections of the temple have mostly collapsed, the reason being, the Buddhist temples were built with weaker foundations than the Hindu ones. They also had less materials available, most of the stones around were already used for the Angkor Wat temple. Some of these sections are being refurbished, but it won't take anything from the whole experience. No wonder a few scenes from the 2001 movie Tomb Raider with Angelina Jolie was recorded in this very temple. It offers a truly unique atmosphere, and some pictures will definitely make you look like an adventurous movie hero!"

Its really something...but again, there are stories to tell in all these ruins...so read before u visit the place so u can appreciate it better. But im telling you now, its never a waste of your time and effort...With all these temple visits, we connect; not just to nature but to people, we talk to them. Also to the local children. We even brought food for the children. We have anticipated this. We read about children asking for 'tips' in USD for simply following tourists. So,we thought of giving them something else as a gift...My colleague was doing an ART installation during this trip so at times we meet curious children...we spend time teaching them some paper art works...simple ones just to 'quench their thirst'. We were actually very happy to see them grasping ideas very fast...As teachers, we were touched and hope they get good education they deserve. We feel that doing these is better than giving them money. Just in case, u feel like doing the same thing, be ready with ur materials for art work. Believe me it feels REALLY good..."

Its a stunning place with massive fig and silk cotton trees growing from the towers and corridors and spreading their gigantic roots over, under and in between the stone pillars of the complex. This temple was one of King Jayavarmans first major temple projects and was dedicated to his mother. Ta Phrom was originally a Buddhist monastery and there was a sandscript inscription on stone (this is now in the Conservation d' Angkor). This stone tells about the size and function of Ta Prohm. Ta Prohm was very wealthy in its time having control of over 3140 villages, 79,365 staff to maintain the complex, including 18 High Priests, 2,740 officials, 2,202 assistants and 615 dancers.Property that belonged to the temple was a set of golden dishes weighing over 500 kilograms, 35 diamonds, 40,620 pearls, 4,540 precious stones, 512 silk beds and huge stores of jewels and gold.\u00a0 Some of the temple is impassable and some areas are accessible only by small narrow passageways. There are many lovely spots to just sit outside and just wonder at this amazing place. An absolute must to visit Ta Prohm and explore for a couple of hours.I could go on and on about our 8 hours of touring around a few of the main temples, multiply everything I have said by 100. It was a brilliant, amazing, fascinating day. I don't think I could pick a favorite place, they were all so different. I'm just so glad I have been there to see all of this, as surely one day only certain areas will be open to the public to protect this wonderful place."

It was built in the Bayon style in the late 12th and early 13th centuries by the Khmer King Jayavarman VII as a Buddhist monastery and university. It has been left in much the same way in which it was found and some parts are very collapsed.

When I see it up close and personal -- it is so much more amazing than that. We arrived early in the morning - around 7am - so the sunlight was just starting to come through the fig tree branches. The carvings, the ruins, the towers, makes you realize how truly beautiful this temple must have been when first built. Now, with the fig tree roots curling around doorways and pushing huge stone slabs out of the walls, it's a testiment to mother nature's enduring tenacity to reclaim her territory. It was beautiful, somewhat eerie and so peaceful. With the grays and beige stones - the only color that splashed across the scene was when a monk, with his dark skin and orange robes would walk through a door way, as they did hundreds of years earlier. I loved this area and hope many others come to enjoy it as well."

Smack in the middle of the complex is modern civilization's intrusive attempt to restore Ta Prohm.As with all the past few reviews, a few tips--1) Club this with a trip to Banteay Kdei next door. Have your Angkor pass available for inspection.2) The ruins are smaller and... Ruined. Do talk to your hotel staff and find out the best time to go.3) If going at a later part of the day do have a torch in hand, there are some dark passageways. For someone as uncoordinated as I am, the torch helped... and since we did a good job with tip number 2 (above) there were several instances when we didn't have a crowd to follow.Parents traveling with thrill-seeking tots will love this place.

I thought Angkor Wat was overrun with tourists until I visited Ta Prohm, which on a busy Saturday was bursting at the seams with tourist groups. If there is a good thing about tourist groups it's that they move through quickly, but you're in real trouble if you end up at any of the Lara Croft/Tomb Raider tree sites when a group rolls up and starts an endless parade of photos. My suggestion is to let them move through and then hope you have a quiet 5 minutes before the next one comes in. And, in some areas of the site you won't see any tourist groups at all, and those moments can be truly magical. For photographers I would also recommend visiting Ta Prohm immediately after sunrise, when you might have the chance to get some eerie shots with the light streaming in at an angle and with a slight mist in the air."

Stopped off at TA Prohm this afternoon after seeing many other temples and this one stands out purely because of the many banyan trees draped over the temple ruins. It's very Tomb Raider and this draws the hordes of Chinese / Korean tourists. It can get a bit busy in the main areas as everyone wants to take that magical picture. Try and get there early if you can to enjoy it without the thousands of other tourists."

Our tuk tuk driver picked us up at 5.15am and drove us out to the temple.We got there while it was still dark and walking through the jungle towards Ta Prohm was one of the most incredible experiences of our two months in SE Asia. When we arrived at the temple it was just starting to lighten up and it was the most incredible experience to be there without another soul in sight - although we did get a bit of a fright when a load of bats came flying out of one of the doorways straight at us!We spent at least 40 minutes wandering around before we saw another group of people arrive, and by then we'd explored most of the temple.If you get chance, I would highly recommend heading to Ta Prohm at dawn - we did Angkor Wat at sunrise as well but it didn't compare for us."

The two downsides to this temple was the crowds were immense and very inconsiderate. I had so many photos ruined by people not paying attention. The second is the ferocity of the begging of the local children. I had one girl attempt to tie a bracelet onto my wrist after I had declined buying it and then began yelling at me because I didn't want it. She was about 8 years old. If you can let that roll off your back it is definitely a place that needs to be visited!"

We walked the whole left hand side not seeing another person which made the whole experience that much more incredible. So in order to do that I would recommend go early.

As you walk up the path to Ta Prohm from the main entrance you will hear beautiful traditional Khmer music, the music is played by landmine victims who play music and sell their CDs in order to support their families (feel free to give some dollars/riels as it is very much appreciated) and adds beautifully to the atmosphere of this temple. Take some time to enjoy the atmosphere. Also take a look at the work of one of the artists at Ta Prohm although his artwork looks similar to the ones at the markets, you can watch him paint at the site and he is very friendly and explains a bit about his work to you.Ta Prohm is more than just the 'Tomb Raider' temple, it is well worth several hours of your time exploring the nooks and crannies of this beautiful temple"

You don't see the sky too often in this part of the world, but this morning it was there. With a blue sky and this scenery, a poor photo was impossible. Angkor park is a world class destination - and of the half dozen sites we visited, Ta Prohm truly is the best imo. The power of nature exposes how a city can be lost in a jungle over time. Photo Hint; The only way to get a picture of a doorway without somebody posing in it is by standing in queue with the posers - and then disallowing any posing until you get your shots, then allow the next in line - it works. Its a short little hike to the site and hard to say how long to plan for - I could have spent a couple hours but in reality the site is very small. Tomb raider and all that - this place is a winner."

When we arrived was a bit dark and there were just about three people entering the temple. We could enjoy a quiet morning, listening to birds and seeing the first sun shades. Curently the temple is going through some restaurations but this was not an impediment to enjoy the visit.Ta Prohm is different than the others in Angkor Thom as nature tried to regain the land and you can see from quite a lot of trees growing through the ruins of the temple. It is quite spectacular the view. One of my favourites for sure and a must see among the temples in Siem Reap.If you like this you could as well go to Beng Mealea."

It was previously one of the most mysterious and magnificient (really magnificient) places I have been to despite being in ruins back then.The Ta Prohm now has been partly rebuilt- and it is great that there is a certain structure to the place and it is safer to visit the place now. It is also obvious that quite a bit of effort have been put in place to save as many of the trees that make the place special. At the same time however, the atmosphere of the place has been \"altered\" and the temple now feels very comparatively more commercial."

Mind you there are lots of tourists so chose your visiting time well.It is a very unusual scene and one which you have to see with your own eyes to really take in."

I am really shocked that the authorities are allowing visitors to trample all over this treasure making the restoration so much more difficult. Like most major archeological sites around the world that are closed completely for restoration (the Acropolis, some of the Egyptian Sphinx, some of the Italian museums), this Temple needs to be shut down for a few years. In the meanwhile, all thos busloads of irresponsible tourists need to be banned from visiting here."

Angkor Wat, Angkor Thom are must dos. If you have to pick one more dont miss Ta Prhom. What i liked about the temple is the trees that are intervowen into the temple. There is a lot of restoration work going on so that can be dissapointing. However i was told that once this is cleaned up most of the old trees may be removed to make the temple structure stronger.

I've seen it in movies and read enough reviews to make me feel pretty comfortable with what I was about to encounter. I was still surprised at how large it is and how beautiful and peaceful the environment is, even though there were others milling around the temple at the same time that I was. The stegosaurus was easy to find (although, seeing it live, I don't think it was really meant to be a stegosaurus). More interesting, to me, was the way some temple walls were designed (with xmas tree-like cutouts) to ensure structural integrity and all of the holes present that I was told once contained jewels. Perhaps I either misunderstood or just fell for it, but was told that Ta Phrom was considered among the elite of temples of the time and was adorned with jewelry that has since been removed. I haven't tried to verify if this is true, but it sounded good at the time. I had previously seen videos on how people put holes in stone blocks to move them into place, but this temple has many more holes than other, similar temples so the explanation I heard at the temple sounded plausible."

It is not fully cleared and fully restored as with other Angkor temples. Ta Prohm maintains its romantic, ruined atmosphere amidst the tall trees which intertwine with the temple's structure. However, there are some restorations on-going to prevent an absolute decline of temple. A main restoration project is being done at the Hall of Dancers east of the temple --- just a fair warning so you wouldn't be surprised with the presence of cranes, heavy machinery, and frames at the eastern part of Ta Prohm. The traditional tour route of the temple is by going from west to east of the temple. That's great if you want to start with Ta Prohm early in the day and then go around the Big Circuit counterclockwise for the rest of the day and then stopping by Phnom Bakheng for the sunset --- a day's tour idea for you there. (Note: If you plan on doing this, have your driver leave you at the west side of Ta Prohm and make your driver wait for you at the east side of Ta Prohm.)Another route goes from east to west of the temple. Since the temple is oriented east, it's like entering through the real entryway of Ta Prohm. If you don't have much time to visit (less than 1 hour), follow the tour route as laid out. If you have about 1-2 hours or more for your visit, explore the temple where only a handful of tourist goes, i.e. stray away from the tour route. It's really a great experience as you see a more quiet and more abandoned part of the temple.In Ta Prohm, do not miss taking great pictures of scenery protected from the sun by a canopy of tall trees. Sometimes, rays of sunlight would escape from this canopy and put a tower or part of a temple under a spotlight. Also, make your imagination run wild when trying to view the roots which tangle up with the structures. They sometimes make funny human anatomies. Have fun with them!Ta Prohm is definitely not to be missed because of its unique feature of apparent neglect. It's one of the top Angkor Archaeological Park sites you must visit other than Angkor Wat, Bayon, and Banteay Srei."

The difference being, for once, the grand old lady wins. And, for once, we are glad modern humans didn't remove the trees to \"restore\" the temple. That would have removed the escence, the beauty, of Ta Prohm as it is now. Not that it is physically possible, anyway. If they try to remove all the roots, the temple would probably disintegrate and fall down flat. Advice to visitors: wear good walking shoes. Need to have good stamina. It will be hot and humid, so wear light clothing and bring a lot water to drink Maybe no need for a hat, since the canopy of the rainforest mostly shields out the sun. Be careful if bringing children. Most of all, ensure bring along a good camera. The pics are worth keeping a lifetime."

Ta Prohm is among the largest of the monuments in the Angkor complex, the in scrimption gives an idea of the size of the temple. The complex included 260 statues of gods, 39 towers with pinnacles and 566 groups of residences. Ta Prohm comprises a series of long low buildings standing on one level, which are enclosed by rectangular laterite wall. The center of the monument is reached by a series of towers connected with passages.Some areas of the temple are impassable and others are accessible only by narrow dark passages. It is recommended to follow the plan with a route and landmarks indicted or to stay with a guide to avoid getting lost."

There was even a small dinosaur engraved on a sandstone wall near the back exit of Ta Prohm! It made one wonders the era when this temple was constructed.

As an extra bonus as we started the tour, the dawn chorus started which was something else to listen to.

One feature that captures everybody's imagination are the amazing sets of massive tree roots that have engulfed much of the structures. These are truly amazing. The jungle is taking over. Wear good walking shoes, take a bottle of water (it can be very hot) and maybe take a light rain jacket too (it can rain too). The limited reconstruction is described on some information boards. They have a long way to go and maybe it is just fine as it is. A visit to the Angkor National Museum in Siem Reap will prepare you for your visits to the temples."

It is a must see but the only consideration to keep in mind is that it can get crowded because everyone tends to follow the same path to view the temple and tours get in the way. Based on that it is ideal to see it very early in the morning which has the added advantage of the light; or even at noon (is surrounded by the jungle so the sun is manageable). Endless opportunities to get great pictures of the trees and since it is rather small, if it is not too crowded you can explore it in depth."

Giant trees grow on top of it and though it. Their thick tentacles crushing the walls. I felt that if time could be speeded up you would actually see the roots move. It gets quite crowded and thus hot and stuffy so go early."

If you are photo lovers, then, this is a must visit place. The location is exotic and has got various points where you can get beautiful angles. As a solo traveler, I was deeply touched thinking about the structures in it's erstwhile glory and imagining how such temples must have been built.

The access to the place is easy although if it rains be prepared to walk through a quagmire. You enter one way and exit another straight into the hands of the hawkers. The buildings are built to the same design as all the others in Angkor Wat. There are hundreds of these places in Siem Reap so you are spoilt for choice. You could spend a few weeks looking at them. Having said all that, it is a worthwhile see."

The fact that it has been left somewhat overgrown with enormous root-trees is what adds to the mystical charm of the place. Photographers could spend all day here, as there are so many potential subjects. This is a good place to take a guide, as Ta Prohm is labyrinthine in nature and there are so many places that could be missed without a guide - such as the echo room and also the \"peeking\" girl.Biggest drawback to Ta Prohm is its popularity. At times, there are swarms of people crowding into the same places. Photography can be frustrating as many people are waiting to get the same shot. One suggestion is to enter on the \"back\" side of the temple and go through in reverse. This seemed to make the visit a bit better when we went."

We decided instead to head to Ta Prohm around 6:15am. Best decision we could have made. For the first three-quarters of an hour we only saw four other tourists and essentially had the place to ourselves. The atmosphere was palpable, with an eerie silence amongst the ruins mixing with an orchestra of sounds from the encroaching jungle. Visually it was even more impressive with vast silver roots entangling themselves around ornately engraved stonework. As you explore the labyrinth of doorways and courtyards you can lose yourself in the experience and, for a moment, it feels as if you have discovered these ancient ruins. Arrive after 7:30am though and it will feel more like a theme park."

However, after spending around an hour there it really started to get crowded and I was glad I went early. It was interesting to see how the strangler figs and kapok trees have entwined themselves around the ruins, bursting through walls yet protecting them at the same time. The temple is undergoing some repair work and reconstruction but there is still so much to explore. It truly is a 'lost temple.'"

My daughter saw boats outside the gates to Ta Prohm and we decided to take a short cruise spur of the moment. 2 hours later we had seen 3 additional temple ruins including a corner fortification temple most tourists never see, learned about the defenses of the ancient city, enjoyed a relaxing boat ride, and had a great time. Thank you Dara (of the 7 Candles Guesthouse and the Ponheary Ly Foundation) for a wonderful tour!"

Massive tree roots on massive walls. You can walk everywere you want. Do it on your own and not with a guide for more fun. For children this must be a heaven to explore."

Go early in the morning to avoid the congestion and the midday sun. It gets very hot walking around the complex. This was our favourite temple. A little out the way from Angkor Wat and the Bayon and am absolute must see. Tomb Raider (rider to the cambodians) was filmed here. The way the trees intertwine with the building is beautiful, although it has ultimately destroyed the original temple. It's different to the other temples as there is a jungle feel."

Helpful tips: 1) Slather on mosquito repellent before you visit this site. I noticed there were more mosquitoes here, compared to the other temples I visited. Best to be safe than sorry. (2) From Ta Prohm, head out to the other remote temples like Banteay Srei (a half hour away by tuktuk) and Pre-rup. I was able to visit all 3 sites in a little over 4 hours, and grab a late lunch back in Siem Reap city proper. 3) Get there by 7:30am to get ahead of the bus tours.

Ta Prohm really lived up to our expectations. It is and was as we had imagined from the various books and magazines we had seen. Seeing it for real was simply unbelievable. The hard thing for the future will be how to preserve it in it's current state - yes, we want to see the trees and roots protruding from the walls and roof, but how do you stop the further deteriation of the structures? Something surely for the Indian Archaeology team to consider as they set about their proposed restoration project. Perhaps it is a case of go see it now before it current status is lost or remodelled too much by the hand of man."

Funny thing is, they've even built a platform in front of the tree so that you can stand there and have your picture taken with it. Tourists here are very courteous and each would wait their turn in front of the tree. There's no line but people just have the decency to wait till the first one is finished before they step unto the platform.

We almost didn't feel the heat because of the trees that surround the area. Near the entrance, you will be greeted by music played by the war victims. Giving a small donation to the group is optional but giving a little amount will be of great help to them. Our tour guide told us of the different magnificent trees that make up Ta Prohm. Of course, when we saw the famous 'Tomb Raider' tree, we just have to take a picture with it. There are other interesting information about the temple in Ta Prohm. Having a guide to tell and show you about these things is very helpful."

Neither the largest nor possessed of the highest towers, Ta Phrom's endearing memory will be of the huge tree roots hugging and slowly crushing the temple ruins in a super slow motion dance of death. The sights are a reminder that in the end, nature will be all that remains. There are quite a few popular locations where tourists will line up to take pictures of the roots, but don't miss out taking pictures of yourself in the trunk of a huge tree and another through a \u201cdragon's eye\u201d tree root. Get your guide to explain the parasitic fig trees eating away at some huge trees and visit the Third Enclosure Gallery, which has an amazing before and after picture of the restoration. Restoration works are still in progress and it was bewildering to see the sheer numbers of stone blocks to sieve through. Many stone reliefs are in good condition and are beautiful. There is also an unusual relief of what appears to be a prehistoric creature that you shouldn't miss. All this makes Ta Phrom a must see site in Angkor. Spend about 2-3 hours there."

Due to the number of blocked passageways, this site can sometimes feel like a maze. It's probably best to enter with a guide the first time you visit so you are sure to see everything. I have been here several times and I still get turned around once I'm inside. Restoration efforts are underway, but hopefully the giant tree roots will remain."

After two full days of temple-visiting, we were all templed out, but a friend strongly recommended we see Banteay Srei for the beautiful carvings. However, on the way to Banteay Srei, our tuktuk driver recommended we go see Ta Prohm as well. We initially wanted to give it a pass, but he said we really should see it. We gave in to him (mostly because after tuktuk-ing us around for 2 solid days, we had grown very fond of him) ... and boy, were we glad we listened to him!Ta Prohm really is quite beautiful, with huge silk-cotton trees hugging the stones and standing in silent sentience over the ruins. Really, really breath-taking. Many people will have guides with them, but there are also tourist guards within the inner portions of the temple who will happily tell you stories of the temple or offer to show you around. I'm sure this impromptu \"guide service\" might come as a bit of a pressure to those of you who might not want to be harassed in such a manner, but I really didn't mind. Our \"guide\" showed us the more popular sights (all this fascination about Angelina Jolie and a specific tree), the best angles to take pictures from, and even pointed out to us the relief of a stegosaurus-like animal which I had made it my personal mission to find on this trip! All in all, for a 1-hour tour, we tipped him USD5, which he seemed more than happy with. Do give Ta Phrom a visit. It really is beautiful, even against the beauty of the other temples (temple-fatigue can set in, I know) and unlike the other temples of Angkor Wat and Angkor Thom, this one is mostly in the shade as it is surrounded by huuuuuuuuuge silk-cotton and strangler fig trees. Oh, and souvenirs are always being pushed in your face at all the temples in Siem Reap, but in the inner courtyard of Ta Prohm are some youths who sell original brush paintings. Very, very beautiful, and I had intended to get a few pieces on my way out of the temple, only I forgot. It's something I still regret!"

It is one of the most popular of the temples and thus tends to be (read: is) overrun by loud and noisy tour groups. We went twice: the first time when it wasn't too crowded, and the second time, when it was very crowded. If you are free-lancing, go early in the morning or late in the afternoon to avoid the crowds... otherwise, it can be an unpleasant experience trying to make your way through the crowds."

Ta Prohm was built in 1186, it was built to house the divine queen mother. The outer enclosure are still obscure by foliage but reach well beyond the temples heart. Ta Prohm literally translates to the Royal Monastery and that is what it functioned as, home to 18 Abbots and 2740 monks.

Tip: If u're doing solo traveling, do catch one of the official tour guides and ask them to take your photos. They will be in uniform so its easy to identify them. They would know which are the best angles to choose and will direct u where to stand to get the best shots. TIP them for their kindness, even if u didn't use them as a guide.

This January we were there over the Chinese New Year and the crowds were the worst that we had ever seen. I would love to see Cambodia stop the use of big buses and large tour group. The buses are too big for the roads and some of the magic is lost when they barrel past you. Large tours who travel in large groups of 30 people + make it very hard to see and appreciate the temples. Splitting the tour group up into smaller groups to see the temples would make it more enjoyable for every-one, even the tour groups. Ta Prohm has always been one of my favorites. You can still see traces of the Jungle swallowing up the temples with the twisted fig trees growing right inside and up the temple walls. There is a secret to seeing Ta Prohm the way that it can truly be appreciated though and I almost hate to tell you how. While the mass of tourist are scrambling to Angkor Wat to see the sunrise - do the same but go to Ta Prohm instead. You will arrive in the dark so don't forget to take your flashlight . Once inside the temple just sit there is silence and watch and listen to the jungle wake up. It is amazing. When there is enough light go and explore. This January when we were in Ta Prohm we passed only one other couple and that was after an hour of having the temple all to ourselves. It was magical!"

This is clearly not everyone's idea of what they think they want to do on their vacation, but for those who want to experience the serenity and beauty of Ta Prohm and other ruins like Bayon and Preah Khan) this is the only way to go. Not only do you have a much better chance of taking great photos without the stress of inconsiderate tourists, you actually get to imagine yourself as the explorer who discovers the ruins for the first time. It's priceless."

            "review": "A real maze - try to beat the crowds to make the most of it. Ta Prohm is magnificent but because the central site of the temple - the bit people actually come to explore - is relatively small, and the volume of people attempting to cram into it is very great - above all because of the famous unrestored state of the temple where trees and rock co-exist - the effect is not for the claustrophobic. Make no mistake, it is still WELL worth a visit; the temple is undeniably beautiful and has a labyrinthine quality that adds to the sense of adventure. But at peak times it also adds to the sense that you and many other busloads of tourists are all doing your Christmas shopping in Oxford Street at the same time. It is, perhaps, just a bit too much and the closure of the centre of the site, whilst adding to its maze-like quality, also serves to increase the crush. We didn't feel the same at any other Angkor temple.2 tips to avoid this:- Try to got to Ta Prohm early in the morning. We didn't, but next time this will be a top priority. Having the temple more or less to yourself would be an astonishing experience.- Explore all of the nooks and crannies. If you have the 'Ancient Angkor' book follow the author's tip of doubling back on yourself in the site to Ta Prohm's less explored Southern Tower and Library where you just might get a bit if space to contemplate the temple without getting in the way of someone's shot."

This temple is part of the Angkor Wat complex, a short distance by tuk tuk from the main Angkor Wat, Bayon & other temples. We went in the late afternoon(around 3 PM) & it was fairly empty. Words cannot really describe how beautiful the whole complex is--huge trees interwined within the temples, lots & lots of moss covered temples & bricks that have fallen from the temples scattered everywhere. Since it was quiet, largely devoid of tourists at that time, we took our own time just wandering around & taking pictures. Here are a few tips;1. Try to go in the early morning or late afternoon when the tourists are at Angkor2. Carry hats & water- there really are no restaurants nearby, no place to buy water.3. Be wearing a sturdy pair of shoes- while most of the temples are fairly easy to climb through, rocks are piled in places & could be difficult to climb in sandals & open shoes.4. Be sure to see the famous \"Lara Croft\" tree first- that is the most popular photo opp & a large group could mean a long time waiting!"

It's amazing how nature has taken over the temple with giant tree roots/trunks that 'drape' over the walls. Looks like an invasion by giant octopuses in some sci-fi movie. I found it rather eerie and fascinating at the same time. Not my favourite temple but still a must see.There are 2 famous tour routes: red and white. The white route can be done in a day and includes 3 temples: Angkor Wat, Angkor Thom (with huge Buddha faces) and Ta Prohm (Tomb Raider temple). The red route requires 2 days and covers more temples. After a day and a bit, we were all templed out especially after visiting Angkor Wat for its sunrise and sunset. If you are short of time, just do the white route. Even though we bought a 3 day pass, we decided to spend the third day in Siem Reap town instead. Note that despite the red and white routes being clearly marked on the hotel map, we found it very confusing when we were at the temple sites as the so-called red or white routes are not clearly marked. So glad we hired a guide - Mr. Poy Pines (he can be contacted directly: duokbuffoon@yahoo.com) to show us around. He was excellent - patient with my boys, humourous and knowledgeable.Temple passes: 1 day pass costs US$20, 3 days pass costs US$40 valid for any 3 days in a week. An unflattering photo of you is taken when you pay up and the picture will appear on your ticket which you have to carry with you througout the 3 days and there are checkpoints at each temple. Children under 12 go free but you need to bring their passports as proof of age which is a pain. I prefer to leave them at the hotel safe but any saving is a saving especially if you visit the whole area more than once. If you purchase tickets after 4:45 p.m., it is dated the following day but you still get to visit the temples for free for the rest of current day (temple shuts at about 6 p.m.)."

It was nice, we have to walk through the jungle until we reach this famous temple.One of my favorite place..."

Explored every possible room/corner that I could get to and it's indeed really impressive. One can't imagine how maginificent it would have been if the nature did not stake a claim on it. If you are going without a tour guide, try to 'hitchhike' on the big tour's guide as he could lead you to the only apsara face that wasn't 'covered' up by tree root in one of the room. Nothing magnificent but just something worth seeing."

Still, It is probably the second most popular destination after Angkor Wat within the park when I was here in November of 2011. I think it might have to do with the trees growing over the temple more than the Tomb Raider movie. Atleast I hope so. The place can get crowded. If you have time, you can wait it out because bus tours go in and out. They don't stay there long. There is plenty to see. If you want it all to yourself, go early in the morning as the big tours go to Angkor Wat first or during lunch time. Walking the perimeter of the temple is another good idea as it is less traveled and you will see trees over the temple. From the previous review, there aren't stairs going up to any temple like Angkor Wat or Baphuon. They have added wooden paths mainly for you safety. People have been getting hurt walking over the large stones. There are some stairs but nothing that will make you think twice about coming back. Ta Prohm is in the jungle with standing water. Mosquito repellant would help alot. My guide told me that they are starting to cut some of the trees that are ruining the temples. That's part of the attraction but they are more concerned about the temples and I have to agree. Eventually trees die not only from man but nature as well. There are carpenter ants that chew through the wood. Also during flood season, some trees usually go down. Temperature went up to 100 degrees in November with crazy humidity. This place has plenty of shade.  You will also hear a loud pitch noise at the temple. It's Cicadas. It can get pretty loud. They are really hard to see ( see pic of the tree bark)I didn't post the most popular photos as there are plenty here. These are to show what it looks like with the restoration going on. It's not as bad as it looks since the place is pretty big. So go enjoy yourself as I did. If you like Ta Prohm, I highly recommend Beng Melea which is out of the way but worth the 1 hour and 20 minute tuk tuk ride. I also recommend. Ta Som and Bantey Kdei as they are not as large or popular but still within the park. And it's right next to Ta Prohm"

Conservation work was definitely needed, but the wooden walkways that now line the complex are a little clinical, compared to the clambering needed a few years ago. The new roped fence around the Temple of Doom doorway doesn't exactly help photographers either... Having said that, the conservation work is a must, the tree formations are still stunning, and you must visit Ta Prohm while you are there!"

I wrote about it in my blog... http://blakesworld211.blogspot.com/ if anyone wants to see some pictures or read about. It's a little bit further than the other sites, but its worth it...

The encroachment of the trees has really made it quite a magical place and photo opportunities abound. the one downside is the huge crane and mass of green netting that surrounds the construction work going on at the site. Interestingly it was about the only temple in Cambodia where I actually saw some monks, there having been a solitary one at Angkor Wat!. Well worth a couple of hours of anyones time just to wander through and take things at your own pace."

The overgrown strangler figs and piles of stones definitely provide a sense of 'tumbledown charm' but it is the sound of the cicadas that also heightens the atmosphere of the place. We thoroughly enjoyed it - the number of couples taking silly 'lara croft-esque' pictures next to the waterfall strangler fig was a bit cheezy but everyone was very good natured and seemed to be totally enjoying the temple. It always amazes me the number of people who walk on areas that are clearly off limits with no thought to the damage they may cause to this historic site - or the fact that they may slip and damage themselves!

The intertwine tree roots which has become very much the identity of Ta Prohm provided the uniqueness to this ancient ruins. Known also as the Tomb Raider temple (thanks to the portrayal of this temple the the Lara Croft - The Tomb Raider movie), Ta Prohm is one of the most popular attraction here other than the Angkor Wat.For those who had watched the movie, a visit to this site will certainly be more rewarding as there are more than what was portrayed in the movie. Although certain segment of the temple is closed to visitors due to its unstable condition, there are still many areas to be explored. The intertwine tree roots are clear examples of how old this temple is, and how the temple is being reclaimed by the jungle after years of neglect. The strength of these roots are visible as huge stone blocks at various portions of the temple have been literary lifted out of position by these roots. While the tree roots are giving the temple its unique features, these roots are also said to be the main problem which contribute to the condition of the temple. However, preservation works at various sites of the temple have been carried out to save the temple from collapsing. Despite this, the intertwine tree roots were very much untouched and continue to show the uniqueness of this place.To those intending to visit, do ensure that you come lightly dressed, with comfortable shoes as there will be a lot of walking and climbing. Also ensure you have ample drinking water.Other than that, there is nothing much to prepare for except perhaps to prepare yourself to be blown away by the sheer magnitude of this structure."

Like Angkor Thom, with the decline of the Khmer civilization it was abandoned and eventually overgrown by jungle. Unlike Angkor Thom though, there has been very minimal clearing of the jungle here for tourists, making it a unique experience.Everyone's seen the pictures of massive trees growing over walls and doorways. In reality the temple is much larger than the pictures suggest; but still fairly small. There is some restoration work going on, but it's minimal. There are jumbled mounds of moss covered building blocks everywhere you look, making it difficult to picture just what this place looked like when it was in its prime. But boy do they give it atmosphere!Wooden walkways are a recent addition, making it easier to traverse the ruins, and several areas have been roped off and viewing platforms erected. While this helps preserve the temple, several prime photography spots are now off limits. Someone else mentioned the queue for the tree covered entrance photo: well we had a giggle and joined it anyway.A great little temple. Crowds weren't too bad when we were there. If you're not templed out after Angkor Wat & Angkor Thom this is a must do."

Not too sure about this as I didn't watch the movie, but that's what i overheard from a tour guide, who was truly very proud of this =)There are many great photo ops here, with many ingrown big trees, which are left in their natural state. And the temple is very much in ruined state, but with lots of ongoing heavy restoration work. It does feel like in the middle of the jungle, which makes this one of the very few special ones here in Siem Reap. Somehow it also feels like you are walking in a maze, every turn you can see an amazing ingrown tree on the ruins. Definitely worth a visit, even if you're pressed for time, after Angkor Wat and Bayon."

Unlike the Angkor Wat, this one can be viewed at any time of the day. The temples are made of stones which are really cooling so inside you'll be chilled although it's probably 80 degrees outside. Make sure you buy a crate of mineral water (costs only about 50cents at the markets) and take it with you. Just leave them in the tuk tuk while you go inside the temples. There is a lot of construction going on at the point of visit so watch your step and head. Most of the roots are overgrowing on the temples and it looks somewhat being crushed. This' apparently is also where the famous Tomb Raider scene was shot. There are 2 time options to enter Angkor Wat to view it at its best: AM or PM. Shortly before sunrise or shortly before sunset. We chose the former option. The sun which slowly rises over the temple domes is definitely a sight worth seeing. There is a moot or a lake in front of the Angkor which reflects the temple beautifully at any angle and this is where visitors usually flock to enjoy the picturesque view. Some others would prefer to have climbed to the top of the main temple to view. It really depends on your preference really. Note that there are 12 temples in this area. They're not all near to each other. From Angkor Wat, you'll need to get on your tuk tuk and ride on to another area where the famous Faces temple \"Angkor Thom\" and Tomb-raider temple \"Ta Phrom\". The others you may find interesting to go to are: BANTEAY SREY (citadel of women), Grand Circuit Temples: Preah Khan (End of 12 century), Neak Pean and Ta Som."

Without putting yourself in the middle of the ancient temple, you will never know the \"feeling\" of the ancient \"tree on bricks\". The temple has a large coverage of 1000 x 600 m, built 36 years after the great Angkor Wat, by King Jayavarman VII for his mother. History claimed that there were more than 12,000 people reside within the outermost enclosure. We can reach the temple by heading east from Angkor Thom towards Sras Srang. The temple is around 2 km away from the gate of Angkor Thom. By car, around 10 minutes away from Bayon.As the temple was abandoned for hundreds of years, forest had once reclaimed the area until, well, all of us come and make it a world heritage site :-p There are several trees overgrown the temple's structure. The root of the trees somehow found their way through the bricks and reached the ground. The temple was badly damaged, with only a few routes open for visitors. The temple was under heavy restoration work as well.My advice, you can enter the temple through east gate (or gopura) as the route is less crowded. There are several \"outstanding\" sites for photo taking, each with special platform built for the purpose. Keep in mind that there is a massive crowd in the temple. We have to queue in many places in order to take a nice picture with the \"tree on the temple\".

I lived in Siem Reap for a year and a half and I guarantee that most of the people are warm and helpful, but if you're concerned about the few who will take advantage of you, the best defense is to be prepared. It's worth the little bit of time and money it costs to book a reputable tour guide in advance in order to ensure that your vacation goes smoothly. When friends or family would visit, I always suggested they reserve a spot with someone like Kol Chhen (www.cambodianangkortour.com--he's knowledgeable, reliable, and possibly the friendliest person in all of Cambodia), rather than relying on the shady alternatives that skulk around local guesthouses. A good tour guide like Chhen will make sure that your trip to Siem Reap and the nearby temples is really worth it."

Straight out of an adventure film, I half expected a massive boulder to come rumbling down after us!Trees just growing seemingly out of the ruins. Mental but amazing.If the hordes try to sell you a guide book don't use the 'i've already got one' excuse, because they seem to think you could do with ten. If you need one it's only going to cost you a dollar though."

The presence of tourist controllers is more prevalent here than any other temple, perhaps because of its semi-cleared state. The vegetation encroaching the complex is preserved to represent the state when the complex was found and the trees protect some of the structures."

            "review": "Good picture opportunities, Can be crowded. Visited Ta Prohm (or the Tomb Raider temple as many refer to it as) again in August this year. The previous time was March 2007 and it was so packed with people that one hardly had enough time to snap a photo without having someone walk past. Compared to March, August has relatively fewer tourists. However, as we were told by our guide, this being one of the must see temples, it can still be crowded.We were supposed to arrive at the temple before 9 am but because of a very long breakfast and because we went to another nearby temple first, it was already 10am. We were told that bus loads of tourists, especially tours from the East would converge at this temple at around 10am. Apparently, our guide more or less knew the tour itinery. We passed by the entrance and true enough, the entire road leading to the entrance was jam packed with tour buses and all. So, we left and came back in the evening, which was a good idea as it was relatively empty.Compared to last year, there are one or two places cordoned off (which makes it difficult, photography wise) but you still get a good feel of the place. There are platforms erected here and there to make walking easier but at the same time, this also makes it less authentic. This is where Preah Khan, another temple with overgrown trees and less visited, has a plus point.Nevertheless, it is still a must see."

I had fully experienced the power of nature at Ta Prohm, seeing all these gigantic trees engulfing the buildings. There were a lot of narrow corridors; so be careful and watch your head when you are walking around, I could get up close with the apsaras on the walls as most of them were behind piles ofrocks. I just needed to climb over the piles and took some amazing closeups. This is a must-see spot for tourists; which means come early to avoid the tourist groups."
