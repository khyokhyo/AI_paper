On the way to the place he gave us a good insight of what we are seeing, the history of the Mayan wonder and things to do/dont's at the cenote. Also part of the tour we visited the house/museum which was filled with beautiful artifacts of Mexico. We learned a lot about the Mayan ruins from Victor, and we were able to take great pictures as we went there early in the morning. He suggested places where we could shop there and it was a trip worth taking-- highly recommend"

Victor came on time early at 6 am (excellent idea) and took us to Chichen Itza (One of the wonders of the world) at 8 am - great story teller - knows MAYAN history and culture thoroughly - and shares enthusiastically - great photo ops before the crowd - wish I had my history teacher make this topic as interesting as him :) - good stop at the exotic senote' and a lovely tour of Mayan and colorful artefacts and an opportunity to meet a great philanthropist who owned the home turned museum in Valladolid - bottom line very professional, courteous, humorous guide with good connections at the tourist destinations and safe driver - was worth the experience - highly recommended"

Our day was planned out for us but the beauty in having a private guide means that if anything caught victors eye, as it did with us, he would stop and inform us what was happening. We seen a school that were celebrating the Mexican revolution. We met a local Mayan family and victor had a real connection with the family that didn't make you feel you were being intrusive. He even donated gifts to them. The sian Ka'an was fantastic. A natural lazy river taking you round the reserve which was beautiful. Tulum was great and very informative. There was a lot we wouldn't have known without a guide with us. All in all a fantastic day with a fantastic tour guide. Thank you Victor :)"

            "review": "Best of the Best!. I felt it absolutely necessary to leave as much positive feedback as possible. Other family members have also hit the high notes - but I would like to echo their remarks. Our family toured Coba (rent a bike), Mayan village (lucky to try FRESH tortillas), as well as the Cenote swim (great way to start the day -with animal preserve added), and we were very well taken care of by Victor from Univers Maya. The knowledge and passion expressed by him was unequalled! The best part was the personal service received that cannot be duplicated by other company/outfitter especially the larger group guilds. He would also move as fast/slow as we wanted. Univers really works on tailoring the trips to your wants/needs. They also have a different approach/timing to the tours, so we were usually there when little (or no) other tours where at the stops. His personal knowledge and relationships with all of the local people along the way also made you feel very comfortable. Victor\u2019s information, stories, and answers made you feel as though he was a family member driving you around as opposed to a tour guild making the rounds. Highly recommended! Thanks again!"

Our guide Victor was insightful from the moment they picked us up, letting us get to know the Mayan people, their region and beliefs. We started out at the refreshing and pristine Cenote, then walked the ecotour to warm up. Next we traveled comfortably on to Coba (tortilla bakery, tour of the village and a little local lunch) and the Ruins, which were fascinating and a tad exhilarating (biking and climbing, although bike taxi's are available if you aren't in the mood for a work out!) All the while Victor illuminated and took great care of us. I even noticed groups of people who were touring on their own taking advantage of Victor's immense knowledge as he guided us. 6 collective thumbs up from our family...Great tour!"

            "review": "In a word... Brilliant!. My family and I an absolutely fantastic time with Victor from Univers Maya who took us on a day trip to Chichen Itza and Valladolid as part of my Mum's 50th birthday celebrations.Victor had a wealth of informative information and was clearly passionate about the Mayan's (both ancient and modern), his country and his line of work. We never got bored throughout the day and enjoyed a comfortable ride that was so much quicker than by coach. Victor's transport was a Honda Pilot SUV with A/C, cool box (complete with Cerveza and other drinks) and DVD player. Victor made good use of this by screening an Ancient Mayan DVD and a movie for the journey home. Chichen Itza itself was well worth the visit. As seen as Victor is a fully qualified tour guide he was able to show us round in our small group which made it much more personable and special. The visit was very relaxed as we had got there before the coaches had arrived in their droves. Victor also ensured that we got round in good time - without rushing us. We had plenty of time to soak up the sights, clap in front of El Castillo and have group photos taken by Victor himself.After Chichen Itza we headed for Valladolid and took a pit stop at a local Cenote for a freshen up and some lunch. I cannot remember the name of the Cenote but we all enjoyed ourselves and the buffet lunch that was provided.We arrived in Valladolid in the early afternoon and visited the home of an American couple who had turned their renovated home into a private Mayan art gallery. The collection consisted of paintings, ironwork, furniture and even sculptures which had been created by a blind man. It is all for a good cause too - the donations that visitors make go to a charity which provides glasses and other vital essentials for local Mayan children.Once we had finished at the Art gallery Victor took us shopping in some typical Mayan shops. We enjoyed coffees, beers and ice cream and bought some souvenirs to take back home. Victor was really really helpful as he helped to translate menus and conversations between shop assistants - my Spanish is not that good but I certainly picked up some bits from Victor!After a few more photos and with all of us exhausted it was time to head back home, enjoying our personal screening of the comedy, My Life In Ruins, on the back seat of the SUV. About half way back to Playa del Carmen, Victor pulled over to the side of the road and jumped out of the car to buy a Coconut for my sister (who had said several hours earlier that she really wanted a fresh coconut). We had all forgotten about it but Victor hadn't - how thoughtful! During our journey we also asked Victor for advice about the best places for food, hammocks, cigars and tequilla in Playa del Carmen. We got some really good advice and subsequently made some good purchases and sampled tasty traditional Mexican food.When my family and I travelled to Mexico we wanted a holiday of a lifetime to celebrate a special occasion. We certainly had the holiday of a lifetime we had wished for and this tour with Victor and Univers Maya was definitely one of the highlights!Thank you Victor for making this happen!In summary I highly recommend Univers Maya to anyone visiting Riviera Maya who wants a sightseeing trip of a lifetime. They provide a friendly, informative, professional and personable service that is tailored to your needs and excellent value for money."

Lucky for us, we had the lovely Helene as our tour guide; she talked about Mayan history and culture with an obvious passion for the Yucatan and its people. My teenagers loved her, too, and when we got back to the hotel wanted to study more about the Mayans -- the best sign of what a great time they had!Next time we go back to Mexico I will be contacting Univers Maya directly as they add so much to a holiday.(As you will guess, Helene had to speak English to our group, which was not a problem at all!)"

We were taken to an office/meeting area in Playa Del Carmen where we meet up with others from different resorts. Here we met our tour guide Mary. We then loaded up for the drive to Tulum. We enjoyed seeing the ruins and the wonderful ocean. Mary was a very informative guide and did a wonderful job. Her knowledge of the Mayan culture was amazing and she shared as much as she could in her short time with us. She was perhaps the best guide we have ever had. The shopping in the market was nice and we enjoyed it. We were then loaded up and taken back to our resort. It was around 1245 when we got back. This is a perfect half day tour for people who don't want a long day. Would recommend to anyone! THANKS MARY!"

            "review": "Mystic River and Paradise Lagoon. Tour dates November 3rd, 2016.Weather: Partially sunny mainly cloudy. 81\u00b0 warm but not unbearably and humid.What to wear: swim suit on before hand and extra cloths for after. Water shoes are great so you dont step on rocks diring the cave part but not necessary. Bring a towel. No sun screen allowed (environmental reasons) only very little biodegradable sunscreen on. Your face and shoulders.What to bring: a water proof camera!Mystic River: you tour a cave and you are swimming in like the depth of a pool between 3ft to 6+ft at all times. The water feels fresh at first but you get used to it within seconds. If you have been to the beach in southern California in the middle summer, then this water will seem warm to you. Very beautiful and breath taking inside. You see bats in the cave, and you have little fishes swimming around you. You will be provided with a life jacket first to your size and a helmet/head lamp (don't dip the helmet in the water, lamp is not water proof.) Snack aka breakfast:This is after the first activity. It consists of water, a banana, and cookies. It's a small snack to tie you over until lunch and not likely to be thrown up due to swimming.Paradise Lagoon:After a 30 min car ride yoi arrive to the Lagoon. You are provided with snorkeling gear (mask and flippers) and a self inflatable (if you choose to inflate it but mandatory to wear regardless) life vest. You are toured around in a Lagoon ( sudden changes to warm and cooler water due to connecting to the ocean.) The Lagoon has beautiful tropical fish, with the possibilities of seeing stingrays and sea turtles. We didn't see the stingrays nor sea turtles probably because they stay away when there are so many humans (other tours) in the water. Regardless the tropical fishes were a amazing to see; on kissed my boyfriend Gopro. The environment is breathtaking.Lunch:After you are driven to a restaurant near 5th Ave shopping district where you are treated to a Mexican buffet buffet includes: taquitos de papa, beef tacos, quesadillas, ceviche, beans, tacos fixings such as Pico de gallos lettuce guacamole sour cream Salas and chips, slow cooked pork in Spanish sauce with corn tortillas. You are provided with a soft drink as well. You get one hour for lunch, so if you finish quickly you can get like 20 or so minutes to souvenir shop (you'll see where.)Need to Knows:You need to know how to basically swim. You will be constantly swimming in the water which can get you a little winded after some time. You do not need to be an expert swimmer or swim fast. Knowing the basics: going forward, and staying afloat without assistance is necessary. If you fall behind your tour guide will always wait for you. There are bats, an insect that looks like a huge spider buy isnt, and large fish around you so if you scare super easy don't scream. These animals are more scared of you and the bats aren't flying around you just above your head and same with the non spider thing. Only the fishes are near you. ***Book this excursion through your cruise line or you will miss the boat!Pro: Everything! The entire experience was amazing. Our tour guide Alan was wonderful (along with his assistants); very helpful and informative, offered us water and made sure we were comfortable the entire time. We learned about the culture and history in the area. Alan made us feel at home. Con: This has nothing to do with Cancun Adventures but the only con to the day. Since this was booked while on a cruise, we ported in Cozumel (an island) and had to do a 40 min ferry ride to Playa del Carmen before our 45 min drive. Now the ferry ride was horrible. Worst one one I've been on. Very rough the entire time. I was sick to my stomach and at least 5 ppl threw up making the rest of us feel even more nauseated. And this ferry ride was unavoidable for anyone on my cruise that was doing an excursion in the main land."

            "review": "Worth it. We booked this excursion through our cruise line, Carnival, under the name Mystic River and Lagoon Adventure. Let me start of by saying our tour guide, Alan, was phenomenal. He was very upbeat and informative. He even made a point to learn and use everyone's names, which impressed me because it takes ne weeks to learn new coworkers names. Alan had mentioned he'd never been to America to us, which really surprised me as his English was very clear. I understood everything he said. I felt bad at first because after our 45 minute awful and rough ferry ride to the mainland from Cozumel (which was of no fault of Cancun Adventures, as the ferry was a third party company), we felt nauseated and didn't feel much like talking at first. Alan and the staff with him were helpful by offering us plenty of water and giving us interesting facts about the locations we were in and what we were to expect during the excursion. The river was very cool, it was definitely a once in a lifetime experience. We were given life jackets and helmets with lights and then we were on our way. The caves were breathtaking and we even saw some bats. There are fish in the beginning that will clean the dead skin off your feet so stick your feet in before going in and get a bonus foot treatment that would cost a fortune in a spa. After getting through the cave, we were given bananas, some cookies and more bottles of water. We were then taken to the lagoon and given goggles, snorkel gear and swimming flippers. Alan lead us around the lagoon and gave us tips on where the best places to see fish were. There were a ton of fish and a good variety. It's probably the most fish I've ever seen snorkeling. After we were done at the lagoon, we were taken to a restaurant for a Mexican buffet lunch where there was an abundance of food included and it opened up to a beautiful beach. You could also walk to 5th Avenue if you wanted to do some souvenir shopping. All in all, I would definitely recommend this excursion and I would excitedly use this company again if in the area."

We were the last stop for his pick up so it was a little bit later than the scheduled time. Abi was courteous and was an amazing driver. We stopped by their office to pick up the tour guide Ada. We were greeted by her with a warm smile and they had some coffee and juice set up for the passengers at their office. We then set off for the approximate 45 minute drive to Tulum.Once we got there Ada ran through the basic time frame of our stay at Tulum. Made sure we knew where the meeting place was and went over detailed instructions on how to get back. We started the walk into Tulum and stopped a few times so Ada can explain some of the plants and trees and how the Mayans used them. Once when we got into the site you could tell Ada was VERY passionate about the history of the Mayans. Her expressions and enthusiasm exploded from her when she talked about the different ruins and the life of the Mayans in Tulum.After we were done in Tulum, Abi the driver had ice cold water, snacks, and a refreshing wet wash cloth ready for all us. We then set off for the Cenote. After a quick drive to the cenote, we were handed a mask, snorkel and a flotation belt/life vest. Ada then explained how the Mayans used the cenote for their source of water and explained how the stalagmites and stalactites are formed. We got to snorkel through the cenote and see little guppies swimming all around us. We had one person that never snorkeled before, and wasn't a very strong swimmer. Both Ada and Abi made sure he felt comfortable while swimming and had a secondary flotation device that he can hold on to.After snorkeling in the cenote, we headed to the estuary where they handed out flippers to use along with the previous gear we had during the cenote. There we snorkeled along the rocks and saw a lot of beautiful fish. Ada lead the way and made sure to point out anything of interest, while Abi followed behind us to make sure everyone stayed together and no one needed help.The trip concluded with a late lunch at a beach side restaurant. It had a pretty simple buffet, but the food was amazing! We also got 2 drink vouchers that we could use for soda, tea, or beer. Over all the trip took approximately 7-8 hours, which includes the driving time from the Hotel Zone in Cancun. Both Ada and Abi were amazing. Be sure to bring a change of clothes so you can eat in comfort after all the adventures. If you have a GoPro or a waterproof camera, be sure to bring that. There are some amazing sites to see under the water. Also, biodegradable sunscreen is a good thing to have while swimming in the estuary."

You can try your luck on a paddle board or just swim and relax. Our tour guide Miguel was excellent and Gabby was our photographer - buying the pictures for $40 was WELL worth it.

Our excursion was the Tulum + Yal-Ku Plus with guide Omar and driver Dennis. The bus was a little small and we could have used more room, but it got us hither and hon.\u2022 Our first stop was the Mayan Ruins of Tulum, and we spent about 2 hours there. I would have enjoyed it more if we had a chronological history explanation, like starting from the very beginning and so on. It was very beautiful there, including the beach area! Make sure you get a snack here, because you'll be doing a lot more throughout the day before your included lunch meal! We ate at Subway and had a shot of 1921's cream tequila (YUM) to hold us over.\u2022 Second stop was the Dos Ojos cenote swim. This was the highlight of my day! Absolutely incredible, unlike anything I've ever seen before! Even though I was kind of disappointed that we couldn't bring any belongings since we started at one end, and ended at another. So be prepared to bring your water camera and not your actual one. Also, wear water shoes or sandals since you will be walking back to the bus--save your socks! When we snorkeled, we made a semi-circle for about 45 minutes, and then had about 15 minutes of free-time. I would have loved more though. The water was so clear, it was surreal! (Ice cold too, but you get used to it!)\u2022 Third stop was the Yal-Ku lagoon where we did more snorkeling. (Once again, be prepared to leave your belongings on the bus...Didn't have time to take pictures with my actual camera. :( ) The insanely cool part about this was: you got to snorkel where the fresh, cold cenote water meets the salty, warm ocean water. It's a pretty lagoon, but sometimes the mix of the two waters made it hard to see underwater. It was almost like your goggles were fogged up or you were looking at a greasy/oily water. It was still a fun time though--the rainbow fish were beautiful!\u2022 Last stop was lunch at a restaurant situated on the beach. I forgot the name of the restaurant but it was a buffet meal. It included soft tacos, chips, spaghetti, black beans, and rice. Plus two drink tickets per person that will only get you beer or soda. (Would have liked more options there, honestly.) The beach was beautiful though.Overall, amazing time! Just a few little things I would have changed, personally. But I would definitely recommend it for a half-day excursion. Loved it and ready for another excursion with Cancun Adventures!!"

They were organized, friendly, attentive, and informative. This was a small tour group as well so we didn't feel crowded. The equipment was in good shape.The van was clean and comfortable with a friendly and safe driver. Snorkeling in the cenotes was amazing! The beach at Akumal was so beautiful and seeing sea turtles so closely was fabulous. Don't worry if you are not an experienced snorkeler, the guides will help you and are very patient. The beach bar where we had lunch after the activities was inviting with great food, delicious mojitos and a lovely beach. This was such a great tour and wonderful experience!!!"

I was a little bit apprehensive due to my last experience snorkeling in Mexico was not a good one. (different touring company) As I soon discovered my fears were completely unfounded. Oscar was our tour guide and Miguel and Darwin made the four-hour excursion amazing. The day could not have been a better day. It was perfect for laying on the catamarans nets and relaxing in the sun, as you sped through the water. Once we got to the reefs Oscar guided us out into the water with our snorkeling gear. I was shocked by all the sea life I saw, sting rays, giant sea turtles, and so much more. I appreciated the entire crew\u2019s passion for the conservation of the reef. More than once it was repeated how delicate the ecosystem was that we were viewing. Once we were done with snorkeling we boarded the catamaran. They served a lunch while we headed to a sand bar for paddle boarding and \u201cMexican\u201d volleyball. I didn\u2019t participate but those who did looked like they were having a blast\u2026 much tequila consumed! All in all I could not begin to recommend this tour enough, and ask for Oscar, Miguel, and Darwin!"

Once we were picked up at our hotel, Cancun Adventures took us to their offices so we could change vans, pick up our tour guide and drink some orange juice and water and use the restroom.From their we headed to Tulum with our driver and our great tour guide Daniel. Daniel told us some great stories about the local area, things that we wouldn't normally read about. When we arrived at the ruins, we grabbed water out of their cooler, and began our tour. We were given the option of using one of their umbrellas to keep out the sun. Make sure you take one because the sun is pretty brutal there. We stopped a few times on the way to the actual ruins for Daniel to tell us more about them. Luckily we stopped in the shade thanks to Daniel thinking ahead. During one stop we encountered a Coatis animal. They are part raccoon and have an ant eater look about them. They look cute but don't let their looks fool you. My mother-in-law sat her water down on a table next to one of the benches in the shade. The coatis jumped up on the table and tried to grab her water. When she tried to take the water back, the animal bit her in the arm causing her to bleed. I let Daniel know and he rinsed the bite out with water and someone else had hand sanitizer. (Note: Once she got back to the US, she went ahead and got her rabies shots just to be safe.) So everyone please stay away from the Coatis!We went on to the ruins. It was quite amazing that they are in such good shape. The grounds around them are beautiful with iguanas and trees blooming with colorful flowers. All of the ruins overlooks the ocean which is a fairly easy couple flights of large wooden steps. The sand at the beach is smooth and rock free and feels great on the feet. You can"

We were picked up at our resort (iberostar Paraiso Lindo) at 7:05am then driven to the office where we unloaded and checked in with our tour guide, they offered coffee, orange juice and bottled water. After maybe 15 mins we were called to the van we were taking to tulum, our driver was Antonio/Carlos and our guide was Alex. Once on the van Alex had us all introduce ourselves and our reason for visit which added to camaraderie. The drive to tulum took about 45 mins, once we arrived we were given bottled water and snacks and we met in a gift shop where another van of people joined our group and we were all given stickers to identify what group we were with, Alex called this \"Mexican GPS\" haha! We then took a 10 minute walk to the ruins, be warned do not wear flip flops! Wear running shoes!! Once at the ruins we spent about an hour on a guided tour which was very entertaining as Alex is hilarious and Manages to make everything a fun story to listen to! Keep in mind this is a lot of walking and very hot! Bring a hat! I wish I had! Once the tour ended we walked to the exit with some other tour members, another 20 or so mins then caught a shuttle back the shop area for 20 pesos per person, very worth it after 2 hours of walking! Overall I highly recommend this tour! And Alex/Antonio/Carlos are fab!!"

The food was very tasty and the presentation was even better. We had intended to take a ferry out to Isla Mujeres, and this provided us that opportunity along with some other fun activities. We enjoyed the island, as well, and rented a golf cart to get around and see more. The shopping was an experience. The vendors are pushy, but never rude.

We were given a welcome drink just after we boarded which was delicious and strong! ;) The bar remained opened throughout the sail with whatever you wanted available. About 20 minutes into the sail we went to the back of the boat. It was PERFECT for the BEST pictures! No people in the way and a clear view of the sunset. An hour into the sail, the sun was mostly gone and we were served a yummy tray of treats. Some tortilla chips, guacamole, salsa, vegetables and dip. As we were eating, the workers said they had a \"surprise\" for my partner. After we were done they brought out a sombrero and tequila shots and sang Happy Birthday. It was a very very kind gesture that we are thankful for. The boat then cruised around for another 45 minutes and anchored for about 15 minutes before heading back to the dock.

The crew was great, the food and drinks were awesome and the snorkeling was amazing!! Our crew, Captain Jorge, Oscar, Aline, Sobet and photographer Gaby were so friendly and fun. I loved the snorkeling floating belt they had us wear as opposed to a lifejacket that goes over your head. I felt less constricted but still safe. I was able to maneuver in the water much better. I fully recommend this company."

            "review": "Beautiful City by the Sea. We did the 1/2 day trip to Tulum that our resort booked for us. Cancun Adventures was the company that picked us up at 6:40 AM. They were right on time. We booked when we got to Mexico because we weren't sure what day we wanted to goto Tulum.I couldn't understand why we had to get going so early but by the time we actually entered the city of Tulum (about 9:20 AM) it was super hot, I can't imaging trying to tour in the afternoon with what I chose to wear (capris and a light t-shrit). We spent almost two hours getting to Tulum, which was only 40 minutes away from our resort but we had to pick up other resort goers along the way and stop at the Cancun Adventures office to transfer buses. We spent an hour and a half getting back. The guided tour itself was less than an hour, after that we had about 1.5 hours free time at Tulum to walk around or swim. Cost was about $70 each USD. I didn't bring my swimsuit but wished I did. The water was really really pretty and it was so hot out, jumping in and cooling off was a great idea. We did walk down to the beach area and get our feet wet and take some pictures. The stairs are steep so if you have hip or knee problems I would not recommend it for safety sake. After that we walked back to the little tourist spot where we were supposed to meet for the ride back. We glanced at some shops but mainly ducked into Starbucks where we could enjoy the A/C and get a Starbucks Mexico mug for my mug collection. We took a few pictures and looked in a couple of shops, chatted with other people on the tour. Our tour guide, Marj from Holland, was great. She has lived in Mexico for quite sometime. She bought some cocoa beans at the store and shared it with us as she told us about all of the hot chocolate the king drank every day. She knew what time and where to get us into the shade at Tulum so we would be more comfortable when she talked. She gave us great tips on other things like how to shop in Playa Del Carmen as we chatted on the ride back to the resort. They provided ice cold wash clothes sprayed with a delightful lemon scent after the tour which I placed on my face and announced that I loved going to the Mexican Spa. I'm not kidding, a really cold scented wash rag after the tour was the bomb. The hubby and I bought $1.50 bottled beer at one of the shops and drank them on the way back in the van. We were the only ones drinking but when one is from Wisconsin, one takes Wisconsin with them wherever they go. Marj said you could drink in the van in Mexico, you just shouldn't be driving. The ride back was delightful and peppered with more interesting facts about Mexico from Marj. One thing I would like to mention - if this is your first time in Mexico, are new to the area, or don't plan on doing any other excursions, you might want to consider an excursion that would allow you some more time. There is no way you would have time to do a little swimming, a little shopping, and have a little snack on this quick little trip that will cost you upwards of $70 each. For being gone from our resort for almost 6 hours, only about 2.5 were spent on the excursion itself. It's pretty much get in and see Tulum and then get back out. If you have never experienced haggling in Mexico (you have to check out all or most of the shops before deciding on a price to pay), you may not have time to really enjoy both Tulum and the little Mexican Markets or the show they put on in center square with just this 1/2 day excursion. You may have to pick one or the other in order to get back in time. On the other hand, if all you care to see is the guided portion of Tulum, you are free to leave and walk the 10-15 minutes back to the center square and try to squeeze some shopping or sit down to eat or drink before it's time to leave. Since this wasn't my first time in Mexico, this 1/2 day trip was fine for me. Unfortunately, the majority of the time spent was getting there and back - much like those grade school field trips - time is spent on travel, hearding the masses, and taking head counts. You just can't get around it when you are taking a guided tour and don't know the area. Plus, our resort was the furthest away so I'm sure that made a difference (we were at Breathless) We have traveled enough that we know how to use the travel time as part of the excursion, hence the beer on the way back :) Would I use this company again? Absolutely. They provided us with what we needed, some light snacks (water, bananas and cookies), some cold towels, safety, interesting facts about the area, very friendly. Water and coffee were available prior to the tour as we were waiting to get on the second set of vans to get to Tulum. The guides are knowledgable and very nice."

He said it was a new one, but the best one for the kinds of things we wanted to do. Being \"new\" made me nervous, but we went for it and it was undoubtedly the best excursion I have been on. Our day looked like this: ride Polaris ATVs through various dirt roads and mud holes, rappelled down into a cenote, climbed a rope ladder out of said cenote, repeat a few times, cross a wire \"tightrope\" across an open cenote, zipline into the cenote, repeat a few times, snorkel through multiple cenotes, ride Polaris around again, and jump off cliffs into a deep, open cenote. This was all done in about 4 hours and while being photographed by a professional photographer. At the end, we got to see all of the pictures, and they were certainly professional! Throughout the jam-packed day, we learned about the jungle and cenotes from various guides and we felt very safe throughout the adventures. Overall a 10/10 and we would certainly recommend for anyone with a sense of adventure."

We booked through Royal Caribbean and got off the boat at 7, we were put on a 30 minute ferry (motion generative people be aware but there are nurses on board who can help) to Costa del playa where we were met by Omar who is hands down the friendliest and most informative guide we have ever had. We were told on the ferry to buy water as there was no water ashore ... lol our guides had a cooler with water for us in our van, free. The van was nice and only about 8 of us in the group. We drove 45 minutes to the senote but Omar told us about the history of the place and the Mayan culture as well as other interesting info, so the drive was very quick and pleasant. We arrived and had an opportunity to use the restroom, then went to the underwater part, AMAZING, please bring an underwater camera as you will be stunned. Omar is very informative throughout the tour and keeps everyone together despite age and mobility differences in our group. Then we free swam in another senote, and took the shuttle back to the beach for the turtle swim. Snacks were provided free! We saw many turtles and a stingrays. Lunch was in town at a nice private restaurant on the beach with about an hour after for shopping. Lunch is fantastic, so much good food. The shopping is decent in that area, and then omar took us to the ferry and saw us off. A very hardworking and pleasant gentleman, I would request him if you can. The company impressed impressed me with their service and a shout out to our driver I believe Martin, also very friendly and watched our stuff."

This is not what happens with Omar. He stayed with our small group the whole time. We didn't even have to ride a boat. We entered the water from wood steps.Omar was great about providing instructions and making sure we were resting periodically. Omar is a very strong swimmer and pulled a float behind himself that up to three people could hold onto and he would pull them along. I didn't need him to pull me, but I kept a hand on the float to feel confident that I wouldn't wander away.It was a fun experience and an hour and a half was the perfect amount of time for me."

Once in the water Jorge led the group from the front and Paco, who we picked up at the office along with our life jackets, followed in the rear assisting with spotting marine life and also assisting swimmers as needed with an additional floatation device. We saw hundreds of beautiful fish darting all around as they moved around us and the coral, we saw multiple stingrays, and at least 20 sea turtles!After the the sea turtles it was off to the cenotes. Jorge walked us down a long winding path pointing out all sorts of interesting things. I don't think any of us, other than Jorge, had ever seen water so clear. It was absolutely beautiful!The excursion was concluded with drinks and a buffet on the beach! Everyone in the group had an awesome time!

We were unable to do the snorkelling due to murky water :( ( which sucked) but, had a great time paddle boarding, swimming, playing Mexican volleyball & enjoying the ride. The drinks were flowing, the music was bumping and even though I got sea sick, the staff nurtured me back to health with lots of time to enjoy the adventure. Thank you for the fun day!!!"

We started the morning by heading out to snorkel at the second largest reef in the world (Mesoamerican Barrier Reef)! It was a beautiful ride out on the catamaran and the weather was perfect for us! Once there we snorkeled for about 45 minutes and it was BEAUTIFUL! We saw rays, turtles, plenty of fish and beautiful coral. After snorkeling we got back on the boat and rode out to a gorgeous bay area with sand bars and open water. We had free time to swim, paddle board, play volleyball, jump off the boat and much more! We also had open bar the whole time which was awesome! SO. MUCH. TEQUILA. :-) The staff was really interactive and engaged everyone on the boat in games and fun! On the way back we all just relaxed and had a fresh lunch of fish, chips, guacamole and some other tasty snacks. It really was an awesome time! Miguel, Aline, Wicho and Deyvi were THE BEST!!! Thank y'all for making it such a memorable trip. **** Also the pictures that they take while on the excursion (above AND underwater) are AMAZING!!!!!!!!!

Spending time on Isla Mujeres was an added bonus and the restaurant was excellent. We also managed to save 15% by booking online rather than through our resort which made the trip an excellent value. Our guide Michelle was the best!! We'll be sure to book additional excursions with CA on our next trip."

Probably 30 or more of them all feeding in the area, and even though there are many boats at the same spot, it doesn't feel crowded and we all had a great time. If you are here during the season (May-Sep), this is a must-do. The second excursion was to Tulum in the morning, and then a Cenote snorkel and another lagoon snorkel. Tulum was really interesting to see and is in a beautiful setting, and the lagoon snorkel was great with a lot of fish. The real highlight of the day was the cenote snorkel at Dos Ojos, which was really remarkable. My guides (Michelle and Hilda) were fantastic and really did a great job informing us and making sure we had a great trip. The drivers (Eduardo and Andres) were also super, making for an all-around great time on both days."

From there, we hopped on Polaris ATVs and zoomed through the jungle, ramping hills and splashing through mud while following our guide Hugo. Then we arrived at the cenotes (caves), where we repelled, ziplined, tightroped, snorkeled, and climbed out of the caves, all whole being led by our amazing and funny guides Ruso, Erika, Marcos, Erik, and Hugo. Then we hopped back on the ATVs and drove to an open cenote where we got to cliff jump. At the end of the trip, we were able to view and purchase our amazing pictures taken by Ivan, who did an amazing job capturing the whole adventure from start to finish. The pictures were well worth the $40, so make sure to bring cash with you. 10/10 excursion. We highly recommend this!"

Victor provided us with umbrellas so that we had shade, and was so patient with my two kids, even when they lost a brolly. We also spent time on the beautiful beach at Tulum, before heading off to Akumal to swim with turtles. Victor was brilliant, especially with my daughter (the 10 year old), as she was absolutely terrified before getting in. He looked after them both so well, and was very encouraging. We saw 4 turtles and the kids had a fantastic time. We then went on to lunch at Xpu-Ha, which was a tiny village on the most beautiful beach. The tour was a lot longer than I expected, especially as we were never rushed to leave anywhere! Victor was very patient and encouraged us to take as long as we wanted.Cancun Adventures- Victor is a real credit to your company!"

On a seven-day cruise, we docked in Cozumel for a single day and opted for the seven-hour excursion to Mystic River and Paradise Lagoon. Our guide, Paco, was excellent! We first boarded a boat at 8:30 AM for a half-hour ride from Cozumel to Playa del Carmen. From there, we had a pleasant van ride into a Mayan jungle. We were issued life preservers and helmets with lights. A short walk from the van took us to a large cave opening where a set of wooden steps allowed us to step down into Mystic River. For at least an hour, we followed Paco through the cave in water that was chest-deep and deeper. (Often, we followed a rope just below the water's surface, but there were times that we did a bit of swimming or paddling through the water, but this wasn't taxing.) At times, everyone turned their lights off to enjoy the complete darkness of the cave. The cave formations were interesting as were the few insects that we saw; and, on the cave's ceiling, we saw dozens if not hundreds of bats as we left the cave. A very interesting morning in Mystic River with Paco! We turned in our helmets and life preservers and boarded the van for the ride to Paradise Lagoon. During the ride, Paco distributed bananas and Mexican cookies. At the lagoon, we were issued fins and snorkel gear and took a short walk through a lovely sculpture garden down to the lagoon. For well over an hour, we snorkeled, enjoying many exotic fish. After returning our snorkel equipment, we boarded the van for a short ride to a Mexican buffet at a restaurant on the beach in Playa del Carmen. (By now, it was 3 PM.) The food wasn't the best Mexican food we have eaten, but it was plentiful; and the dining experience was itself fun. (There was a vegetarian option or two.) After 45 minutes, we boarded the van for a very short ride to the boat for the return trip to Cozumel, arriving near our cruise ship at 5 PM. My wife is in her late 50s; I am in my mid-60s. We thoroughly enjoyed the day, have no regrets that we took the excursion, and highly recommend it to others. For what this excursion included, it was a great value. And Paco made the entire day a lot of fun. Recommendation: wear swimsuits for the entire day, and bring a pair of water shoes."

Tulum was beautiful, and the snorkeling was a blast. My boyfriend was very nervous about the snorkeling as he doesn't consider himself a proficient swimmer. Let the record show that as long as you have a life vest, there is nothing at all to worry about, and he took to it like a fish. We were also nervous going into it where we would actually be snorkeling, and turned out it was a very calm inlet with no current or waves, clear water and plenty of fish!

On the way back, I was getting too much sun so I went down and sat by the galley in the shade. It was very pleasant. The staff goes out of their way to take care of everyone! Pato was our leader and she is darling. She asked our names before we got on the boat and she remember everyone's name the first time. She was awesome and never slowed down. She went out of her way to make sure everyone was okay. Next time we will do a sunset cruise because the catamaran ride was our favorite part."

They use another company excaret experiencias. They picked us up right on time in a huge bus with a/c. The tour guides we had were Adrian and Raul and they were amazing. We did the chichen itza Classic and tulum ruins. The chichen itza was really long. From the time we were picked up to the time they dropped us off was about a 13 hour day. It was cool to see 1 of the 7 wonders of the world and the cenotes were amazing but the tulum ruins are a must. It is simply more beautiful as it is nestled on one of the most beautiful beaches I have ever been to and I have visited most of the Caribbean and I live in Florida. I wish we had more time there. After the tulum ruins we went to xel ha, which was almost amazing.Xel ha is an aquatic park and I had no idea how much they had to offer. They have zipling, swimming in caves, grottos, cenotes, swimming with dolphins, beautiful snorkeling, scuba diving and much more. They also have unlimited food at about 4 restaurants and unlimited drinks including cocktails which were amazing. We spent about 2 hours at the tulum ruins and 5 at xel ha. My only cons were that when you get to the ruins the tour guides spend an hour informing you which I don't mind learning about where we are but then it only leaves you with an hour to explore the ruins itself. At tulum it's almost impossible to enjoy the beach, the ruins and take pictures. It is also the best deal when booking the package. Anytime I emailed them someone immediately got back to me."

The crew on the boat were so fun and we had a great time. Alex our guide was fun and entertaining. They also provide a photographer to capture snorkeling pictures and family and couple pictures on the boat. The island itself is beautiful, great market shopping to find unique gifts for cheap and you can bargain! You then have free time of the coast of a beautiful beach with free swim time. Alex even serves you drinks in the water as you relax! Could not have chosen better day."

We were told it was only 30 minutes to the boat when it took 2 hours from pick up at our hotel to actually everyone getting on the boat. Part of the problem was it took 1hour 15 min from our hotel to get to the marina the other 45 minutes was waiting to be taken to the boat. We immediately liked the experience when the crew actually put up the sails and we were sailing to our snorkel destination. (Some companies do not actually sail they just motor the catamaran). The crew was extremely friendly and made sure everyone had drinks however it started raining after our snorkel so the only lunch we had was tortilla chips. The music was good and the rain created a more dramatic experience in a good way. My suggestion if you choose this company is to make sure you bring your own towel as you cannot use the bathroom if you are wet. I would also eat before so you are not hungry and can stay in the water at both the snorkel stop and the 2nd stop on the way back to the marina."

Wanted to do a full day tour to chichen itza but we were going home the next morning & we wanted to enjoy our resort on our last night in Cancun. They picked us up at our hotel right on time. They offered us beverages and a light snack which was fine. Just make sure you have breakfast before going, although there are restaurants on site (but you might not have enough time to sit & eat), because there a significant amount of walking. They also offer umbrellas for shade which was nice. Rodrigo (Diego) our tour guide was very knowledgeable about the site and gave us tips about the local vendors & gift shops onsite so we would not get scammed. He explained everything clearly and always answered any of our questions. Tulum is absolutely breathtaking! The beach is gorgeous although we did not go in it, no bathrooms close enough to change into our swimsuits, go with yours on if you want to get in. At the end of the tour they allow you some time to either explore the ruins on your own, take pics, enjoy the beach or gift shop. Definitely would do another tour with this company next time we're in Cancun! Gracias!"

            "review": "Highly Recommend This Trip!. My fianc\u00e9 and I wanted to do an excursion when we were down in the Riviera Maya last month, and after talking to our Amstar reps at our resort, decided to hop aboard a catamaran on Cancun Adventure\u2019s \u201cIsla Mujeres Luxury Sailing\u201d trip. We wanted some excitement, but not anything too intense or time consuming as we would feel a bit guilty for being away from the resort all day. This was the perfect option! The price also included tax and docking fees. There are some smaller excursion companies that may advertise a better price, but after the docking fees & other fees, are actually more expensive that Cancun Adventures. The day started early, about 7am, with being picked up at our resort by a friendly gentleman. He drove us and some other folks up through Cancun and eventually arrived at the marina where all of the company\u2019s catamarans are docked. We all checked in and then climbed aboard the boat. On our way out, there was a massive yacht docked in the marina called the Galactica Star (google it \u2013 so cool). After we got out of the marina, Alejandro (Alex), described what would be in store for the day \u2013 Sailing, snorkeling, drinking & eating, paddle boarding, and also exploring the island of Isla Mujeres. Alex had a great personality and made sure that we were all having a great time. There were probably about 25 people on our boat, which was great because we weren\u2019t too cramped. The majority of the others all traveled down for a wedding, so they were all looking to have some fun before the big day. Once we got out to the reef, we all geared up and jumped in the water. There were many fish to look at swimming below us. The depth was probably only 20 feet, so you didn\u2019t feel like you were out in the middle of the deep ocean. Alex then brought us over to an area where there were some underwater statues. It was pretty cool to see that underwater art. After snorkeling, we all got our \u201cboxed lunch\u201d which had a sandwich, ceviche, chips, guacamole, and a brownie. It was the perfect lunch to tide us over until we got back to land. Also, Alex and the crew did a great job making drinks and bringing them to everyone on the boat. We then got to the most turquoise water off the coast of Isla Mujeres. We were able to paddle board here, but I stayed on board as I was still quenching my thirst. After the paddle boarding, we docked at the marina on Isla Mujeres and were given a few hours to walk around at our leisure. You can rent a golf cart on the island, but I think that all of the fun stuff to see is within walking distance of the marina. That tip will save you about $4o. We walked around to many shops and restaurants while there. The beaches and water were also very beautiful \u2013 it was truly paradise. Once we all met back at the marina, we set sail back to Cancun. Overall, I would highly recommend this trip to anyone looking to do something a bit different that the highly publicized Xcaret, Xel-Ha, Xplor, etc\u2026 The thing that made this trip so great was Alex and the rest of his crew. You could definitely tell that he loves what he does and he wants you to love it just as much. 5 stars!"

We were fortunate that no one else was in our group. So it was just us and the guide and her trainee. Ada, our guide, is a native and was Mayan. So she was able to personalize the trip and give a great perspective on the Mayan people and Tulum. After her educational talk we had time to explore the ruins or go down to the small, but beautiful beach, just below the ruins. Because we went early the ruins were not crowded at all. When we left about 11am, the line to get into the ruins was extremely long and large groups of people were still coming to get in line. Definitely go early to beat the crowds and the heat. After leaving Tulum we headed to Akumal Bay to snorkel with the turtles. Ada guided us to several turtles and a few sting rays. The Bay is very nice and a must do while in Playa. I would definitely recommend booking with this vendor. If the other employees are like Ada you will be guaranteed a great time on your excursion. "

Oddly we were the only ones who booked this trip on this day, so we got a private tour from our guide Julian and excellent service from our driver Jesus. Julian was funny and insightful during our tour of Tulum and both were flexible and thoughtful during our trip. Both my husband and I were beginning snorkelers and this excursion was perfect for learning. The snorkeling is in a protected lagoon and it was not difficult to get the hang of. No sea turtles today, but many tropical fish. We enjoyed this trip so much that we booked another the following day!Day 2 - Luxury Catamaran and Snorkeling. This trip was just as fun, though more crowded as we were now with a group of 30+. The snorkeling was AMAZING. We saw several sea turtles and rays and it was great to see a life reef up close. Our guide Oscar was funny and easygoing and the rest of our crew was fantastic too. This trip had a photographer and I DO wish we would have known photo prices before going. We took only cash to tip our crew, but had I known the photo prices were so reasonable, we probably would have brought a credit card too. I believe they were $20 per person (so my husband and I would have had to pay $40 to receive a flashdrive of all pictures). I'm sure our photographer Jun got some GREAT underwater shots while snorkeling. During both excursions I felt completely confident in our guide's abilities and knowledge. We were completely safe and had an incredible time. I honestly could not speak more highly of Cancun Adventures."

It was very relaxed and mellow in terms of how they rant the tour. Also the lunch in Tulum was absolutely beautiful. I would highly recommend this trip to anyone not wanting to spend a full day out, but still experience the area's culture and sites."

The tour at the Tulum ruins was not too long for their attention span. The cave was great although the water was very cold at first. The best part was our tour guide who went by Captain Snake. He spoke excellent English, was extremely knowledgeable and did awesome with the kids, especially my 10 year old daughter who was apprehensive about getting in the water at the cave. I would recommend this tour with this guide for anyone. Our driver was also very good."

I originally thought I wanted to go to chichen itza, but in July when there had not been any rain for 2 weeks and a 3 hr drive it just wod have been unbearable. We love animals and swimming so it was a great option for us to see Tulum ruins, which was only half an hour away and it has a beach so you can cool down in the sea if you wish. Then head off to a lovely beach where we snorkeled up and swam in the sea and luckily saw several turtles, stingray and the beautiful fish on the reef were amazing. Such a tranquil feeling to swim amongst beautiful creatures. We haven't done much snorkeling before but this really helped, it's my new favourite thing now! We did this a couple of days before swimming with Whale Sharks and it definitely helped us get used to snorkeling. Our guide Alex was really friendly and our driver Lalo was great too. Would definitely recommend to anyone who want to see a bit of culture/history but have a relaxing experience too. Fantastic! X"

You have to know that this adventure requires a long boat ride,and if you have the slightest motion issues, make sure you take a dramamine."

We took our resort's advice and booked this excursion (which was cheaper) and can't say enough great things about the trip and the crew. Our guide (can't remember his name, had longish hair), Jun (our photographer), captain David, and the rest of the crew were fantastic - helpful, entertaining, and all around professional. The trip began with a quick intro, then about a 40 minute ride to the reef to snorkel with underwater pictures (saw plenty of fish, turtles, and rays). After that was a trip back down the coast with lunch and complimentary adult beverages :), then about another 45 minutes in a secluded cove to swim, hang out, and stand-up paddle boarding if so inclined. All the equipment and vessel were in excellent, clean shape. Would highly recommend this excursion for anyone in the Riveria Maya area."

We were assigned to Uri and our driver was Carlos Traejo. To give a bit of context all of us are from Trinidad but live in various places around the world, Montreal, London and Newark and we are all professionals etc. meaning we weren't the everyday tourist that are just happy to be in the sun and by a beach.This was one of the best tours ever!! Uri was excellent! The tour was informative but he gave us enough time to be on our own. He advised everyone about staying in the shade and staying hydrated etc. Gave us cool towels! Ensured safety. When we arrived at the Cenote three of us could not swim and he made sure we were safe and did things in a controlled fashion.I do not like tours usually but this one was awesome it lasted approximately 5 hrs and after we were taken to a beach to have a local lunch which was simple but tasty!!In short I recommend this combo to be your tour guides whatever excursions you decide on. Good job Uri and Carlos!! Thanks for eveyrthing"

You enter a crowded beach and are required to wear life vests the entirety of the time you are in the water. As experienced snorkelers we were a bit disappointed. However, Captain Snake easily made up for the let down with his wealth of knowledge and friendly service!!

The overall cost/value was fine, but the quality of the guide was average, and you felt like you were being herded around and through the archeological site. There was too much downtime between pick up at our hotel and a stop at their office to corral and break into different tour groups. We felt safe, and it was a good value. And, we were reasonably well attended to, but we had a far better experience with another tour provider on a separate excursion during our same vacation. Cancun Adventure's biggest selling point may the the very expansive variety of tours and experiences they offer. But, we were more inclined to go with quality of experience over sheer quantity."

We all got right in and saw lots of beautiful fish, a couple squid and the icing on the cake was a big sea turtle! It swam so close and seemed very curious. Once we were done we got back on the boat and was served a lunch to share and the bar was opened with a great selection of cocktails and cervezas that are included in the excursion price. They took us to a beautiful lagoon to swim and paddle board. Everyone was jumping off the boat and having a great time. On board with us was a photographer, Gabby, she took photos of all the activities everyone did. She got some great shots of the underwater snorkeling as well. The photos were for sale on a jump drive at the end of the excursion. Depending on the number in your group was how much the jump drive cost. For the two of us we paid $40 for over 400 photos. It was a great souvier to bring back and show our family. My husband and I were so glad we did this. It was a great value for the money The crew of Catamaran #7 made it even that much better!"

We did the Tulum + Underground Cave swim, and it was a very good deal. It was a small, personalized tour of 7 people.They want you to call at least 48 hours ahead to confirm you are still going, which we did through our hotel concierge. The driver, I think Manuel, was fantastic. We were first on the pick up list. There were 2 other couples and 1 other woman. Van was air conditioned and comfortable. It is a bit of a ride, with one stop at a little convenience store where we used the bathrooms and picked up our tour guide, Jeronimo.Jeronimo was wonderful. He was very lax, personable, informative. On the ride there, he showed us a large map of Mexico to explain where we going and a little about the Mayan expansion and demise. When we arrived, we were told to use sunscreen, sunglasses, and umbrellas, They also handed out water and large umbrellas. Once we got through the entrance and very commercialized marketplace, we realized it was very crowded. We had stickers to indicate our group. We stopped periodically where Jeronimo told us about different aspects of the area, the Mayas, the flora and fauna, etc. His guided tour took about an hour, including time to take pics. He would even take them for your. There were iguanas everywhere too! After his part of the tour, we had about another hour to wander around. None of our group opted to go the actual beach. But it was very beautiful to look at. Hard to get pics of things, as people were everywhere doing the same thing.As we exited the area, there was a vendor with water and popsicles for sale at the bottom of the stairs. You could either walk or ride the tram back to the entrance We walked. Bathrooms were in the gift shop. The gift shop was overpriced so we went to the other market vendors. You get a better deal if you pay in pesos and speak a little Spanish. If you use a credit card, you will get a better exchange rate, but they will charge you 10% more at the shop. We shopped a little and watched the end of the Voladores show. There was a Mayan dance ceremony happening when we arrived but we only saw the end. They would take pics with you for a charge, but we didn't do that. When we returned to the van, they had snacks and more water for us. Then we rode about another 1/2 hour to the cave containing the cenote \"Dos Ojos.\" This was a very bumpy ride but worth it. We stopped first for bathrooms and to given life vests and lighted helmets. We then drove through the Mayan area where there was a little school you could see. When we got there, we got down to our swimsuits and got in the water. There was a rope to guide you into it,and if you can't handle not feeling the ground beneath your feet, you might have an issue with this tour. You can easily float, which I did a lot. Once inside the cave, there were many parts where you could easily stand but you have to be careful of what you will step on. You could easily trip, bruise yourself, cut your feet, scrape your knees, etc. if not careful.It's dark but everyone has headlamps and Jeronimo had a flashlight. He was very informative about the cave structures, cenotes, and the Mayan underworld. You can take pics and video if you have a water proof camera. I bought a protective case that I word around my neck and it worked great. It is dark though and sometimes my flash just wouldn't work. Not a lot of my pics or videos were good. I think the Mayan gods forbade photos. The water was very cold, but after Tulum and the hell-fire sun, it was welcomed. Even with the little fish. I never saw snakes or spiders, but there were BATS. And when I say there were bats, I mean like Bruce-Wayne-falling-in-with-bats-as-a-kid BATS. We didn't know this upon booking or from reading reviews, but my husband and I are considered weird as hell and love creepy weird stuff, so it made the experience even better. When you illuminated the ceiling at the end, it was covered. My only fear was that they would poop on me, but that never happened. At the end of the swim, you dressed and they gathered your equipment. We walked back to the van. The only part of the trip I hated, was using the outhouse after. I just couldn't wait till we got back to the entrance. Not even gonna go into that...just DON'T use them, You will regret it...I promise. We then drove another 20 mins to a place for lunch. No idea what it was called, but again you had to turn off the main road and drive the Mayan area. Best part of that was the signs hanging to respect the howler monkeys and jaguars that lived there. Seriously. I really wanted to stop for a jaguar in the road, but apparently the Mayan gods did not allow it that day..probably bc they were still upset that I took pics in the cenote. Once we arrived, it was the nicest little resort area. It was small, but there was an ATV tour, as well as a jet ski rental area, and a beach area with chairs and umbrellas. They had changing areas and decent bathrooms, outdoor showers and a little kids pool. The food was a buffet, but I was disappointed that it wasn't traditional Mayan foods as stated in the description. Whatever. We didn't care. We were hungry. There wasn't much for me, as I'm a vegetarian, but I was fine. Chips and guacamole, potatoes, rice and 2 drinks, and I was good to go.The ride back was very long, and we dropped Jeronimo off at the place we picked him up. We made sure to tip him well and filled the coment card he gave us. We were in very heavy traffic so the trip took even longer, but it was air conditioned and I slept. We were the last dropped off, as our hotel was the farthest down the strip. We made sure to tip Manuel b/c he really was wonderful. Overall, this was by far my favorite part of this vacation. It was well worth the long drives and blazing-demon heat. Jeronimo and Manuel were wonderful and deserved a great tip and review."

After having several Amstar/Iberostar employees recommend we take advantage of the whale shark season we decided to go out and do just that. Cancun Adventures was a recommended vendor by Amstar and the price was competitive so we decided to go with them. The overall experience was amazing, swimming with whale sharks really is a great time.The only negative I can really say is that the masks/snorkels they provided are terrible for the type of activity. They provide a very basic (cheap) snorkel/mask that is not really adequate for jumping off the side of a boat with, multiple people on our trip ended up swallowing sea water due to the snorkels and vomiting. If I were to ever do this again I'd ask to bring my own mask/snorkel."

They stopped at a fun snorkeling place in between (where there was statues below the water), then they stopped just outside North beach and we paddle boarded int he most amazing clear turquoise water I have ever seen. It was crazy beautiful you just had to get in. We spent about 2 1/2 hours on the island, then they put up the sail (instead of using the engine) and we sailed back. Picture this- turquoise water, sailing, eating chips and guacamole, listening to Bob Marley = HEAVEN! Great service, would recommend 100%"

They did everything they could to keep us happy and entertained, took pictures for us, kept our drink cups full, joked around, and was just in general there to please. I suggest doing this as adults since it does have a lot of alcohol on board. I went with my family and it was fun so it isn't just geared towards couples, but again no children young enough that they can't drink. Overall, it was perfect. Beautiful views and a short ride there and back so it didn't take all day. If you are staying at Hard Rock Riviera Maya it is about a 5 min ride from the resort."

            "review": "Fantastic tour of Tulum and Mystic River caverns with NO extraneous shopping stops.. We really lucked out with this tour. We have been on several other tours already during our stay and one REALLY made us angry (Cancun Passion tours of Chichen Itza are terrible, stay away from them). On this tour of Tulum and Mystic River Cavern our guide's name was Captain Snake (well, not really, but that was his tour guide name). He started off by baptizing all of us on the tour van as \"baby snakes\" so we became one family. He then talked about the natural history of the area, and how important that was to the Maya. Then he gave us a quick Maya history lesson and even taught us some Mayan words. His passion for the subject and reminders to keep the area and the cenote clean were infectious and just what was needed. Captain Snake gave his baby snakes a great tour of Tulum and then let us wander for an hour on our own. There was time to buy souvenirs, but no heavy sales pitch, and we didn't loose time on the tour because of it. It was an incredibly hot day and when we got back to the van Charlie the driver had cold drinks, and amazingly, cold wet towels to put on our necks to cool us off. It was wonderful. When we got to Mystic River Caverns, Captain Snake gave us all pointers on what we should and shouldn't do and was VERY KNOWLEDGABLE about the cave system and what formed it (I am a science teacher and he did a FANTASTIC job of teaching us about the geology of the area). At one point, deep in the cave, we hit a slippery spot, and one of us said, \"here I'll help you all up\", and Captain Snake said, \"Yes, that's what I like to see, my baby snakes helping each other, we are truly one family...\". I also need to mention that Charlie the driver was a trooper. He is a wonderful man who's English is only passable, but I would trust my life to him. He helped at all stops, and even came with us into the cave, swimming along behind with an extra flashlight and life preserver. After the cavern tour Captain Snake took us to his favorite place for our lunch, and all of us on the trip swapped email addresses and said our good byes. This was a great tour, with fantastic information, and a brilliant young tour guide. I would DEFINITELY use these guys (Cancun Adventures) and Captain Snake/Charlie again, and again, and again."

We then went to swim with sea turtles, I wasn't sure what to expect, but we LOVED it. Pato and Rene took care of the group and made sure we all stayed together. We saw over 10 sea turtles. Amazing experience! Again, there was no time to shop, would have liked at least 30 minutes, felt a tad rushed. We then went to have lunch on a beach and that was a great time to relax and talk about our day as a group. Great ending to a nearly perfect experience. Thanks Pato and Rene!"

The weather was perfect, couldn't have asked for a more beautiful sunset. The crew Davey, Roberto, Weecho and Jerry went above and beyond to insure everyone had an enjoyable evening. I sat shot gun next to Roberto as he steered the boat and he happily talked casually with me and answered all of my questions regarding the boat as well as the surrounding area. The trip was about 3 hours or so from the time we left our hotel until we returned. Make sure to bring your camera/phone but hold on tight to it as the winds are strong from the time you leave the marina until you arrive at the cove where you actually see the sunset and are able to get some great pictures. You are required to remove your shoes - which is no big deal, we had a backpack to put them in otherwise you are able to put them into a bin to be stored until arrival back at the marina. They provide light snacks like nuts, chips, guac and salsa as well as drinks both alcoholic and not. All in all, it was a great experience with fantastic crew members! I would highly recommend!"

We first took a ferry to Playa Del Carman and then a air conditioned bus to the beach. We put on life jackets, snorkels and fins and swam in the ocean. We saw green sea turtles, fish, stingray and a coral reef. It was amazing! My kids are 11 and 15 and had no trouble keeping up. Then we got back in the van and drove to two cenotes (which are underground rivers in caves) and swam. It is fresh water so it was very refreshing. We saw lots of stalagmites and stalactites there. Our tour guide was Sophie and our driver was Pedro and they were awesome! Ask for them when you go! The food we were fed at Wah Wahs was amazing too and we had an hour to play on the beach or shop before heading back."

My girlfriend and I thought we'd get a jump on the day by scheduling a 8am catamaran tour (which included a catamaran sail to Isle Mujers, snorkling, paddleboarding, drinks, etc) which meant we must be in our hotel lobby by 7:15am for the ride from Ocean Coral & Turquesa (excellent hotel) to the marina in Cancun. They drove us all the way to the marina before telling us that it was too windy for our trip as planned and that all they could provide was a motorised (no sails) catamaran ride to the Isle Mujeres and back; the rest of the trip would not happen.We were not pleased because we felt they should've read the weather report earlier and let us know before we departed our hotel. They said the harbormaster provides his first advice to mariners at 8am and they couldn't get the weather information any earlier. They offered to reschedule us later that week, but we already had other things booked. They said they would drive us back to our hotel and we could talk with the Amstar rep at our hotel about a refund, which we received.I gave them two stars because it seemed like it would have been a professionally done and interesting trip otherwise."

A bit crowded but it is the only public beach. Once we got our small group out into the surf, all was well. Lots of sea turtles doing their thing... The reef was awesome. Tanya helped us with pictures, and pointed out lots of sea life.Then private beach for lunch... Margaritas, fresh fish, guacamole, fresh pico and more... What is not to like. Ismael was the best driver ever! Our group was small (10), all from same resort. Made for a very pleasant day!"

Tulum without all the background history would a been a very different experience. And swimming in an underground cave, let's just say rocked! Literally. Stalactites abound. Two thumbs up. Thanks Sebastian and all the crew. You made a great memory for us."

Our guides who I could not give enough credit to for making the tour so enjoyable, were Pato and Fabian. We were pick up at our hotel and taken to the ruins, which were amazing. Pato conducted the tour in a way that kept the group engaged and involved, providing us with so much information about the Mayan culture and daily life. When the tour was complete we had an hour to explore the grounds on our own and/or enjoy the beach and ocean at the base of the cliff where some of the lager ruins sat. From the ruins we proceeded to one of the underground rivers of Tulum. This was a walking/wading/swimming tour through a cavernous underground river. We were provided life jackets (mandatory) and hard hats with lights. There is no electricity in the cave as you wade through the river. The river did not have a noticeable current and it was not difficult to traverse. It was beautiful and reminded me of the 1980\u2019s family film \u201cThe Goonies\u201d. After the river tour we went to a small beach restaurant that is popular with the locals on weekends. We were there on a Tuesday afternoon and it was not crowded. Included in the tour was the buffet of fresh chicken fajitas, fish tacos, salads & sides, as well as two (2) drinks per-person (including Beer and Spirits). Again at this location we had about a half an hour to enjoy the beach/ocean. When our time concluded here we were taken back to our hotel. Fabian was a great driver and unlike in other countries I\u2019ve toured there was not one moment that I worried for my families safety. From pick up to drop off the tour took about seven (7) hours and it was awesome!"

She was extremely informative. She made sure we knew about the local areas and all the rules we needed to follow. She went above the call when she got a video of the turtles for us. I can't speak highly enough of her. I can't imagine a better tour guide. Pedro was great as well. He made sure we traveled safely and he did all the heavy lifting. Both places were beautiful. The cenotes were another world. Thousands of years of formations. Swimming with the turtles was as amazing as you can imagine. The swimming was not difficult. If you had any issues at all, Crystal and her team were right there to assist you. I would recommend this tour to all ages."

I can honestly say it was the highlight of our trip! We have never done anything like this before! Our guide David was great - super fun and informative! He and our driver Andres made sure we were well taken care of and having fun! Small group of only 6 people made for a very personal experience. The lagoon was pretty but the cave was definitely our favorite part. The Mexican lunch was delicious and restaurant was right on the beach with a live band that made for a fun atmosphere. There was a lot of traveling to get from Cozumel to the cave, but it was worth it."

What intrigued us about the tour was that it had all 3 tours we were looking for: visiting Tulum, snorkeling in Dos Ojos (a cenote for an extra $10 charge), and swimming/snorkeling with the sea turtles in Akumal Bay. Cancun Adventures had all 3 of these. We loved the whole day! Pepe, our tour guide, and Saul, our driver were outstanding!! Pepe was very knowledgable about Tulum (gave us a big history lesson on the Mayan culture). They both made sure we were very safe and always stayed with the group! They provided a snack after the tour. It was so hot. Dos Ojos was so beautiful. Worth the extra $. Akumal Bay was crowded, lots of tours, and individuals snorkeling, but Pepe and Saul went with us, ensuring our safety. We even snorkeled around a little reef and saw some beautiful fish. My only complaint is that I would have loved to have stayed longer and seen more turtles, but we did have a long day and needed to eat. At the end of the tour, they took us to a beach club and had a really good all you can eat buffet. We left at 8:00am and returned by 4pm. Such an awesome experience. Would definitely recommend! We love Pepe and Saul!"

After picking up everybody (12 people in a small bus) we headed to the main office in Playa del Carmen for a quick pit stop (coffee and fruits were served, bathrooms were very clean). We then headed to Tulum where we were handed off to our tour guide. It ended up pouring rain, however the trip was awesome and we learned a lot. We then headed to the middle of the jungle where they served us lunch (chicken, rice, beans and salad). The location is remote and mosquito-friendly so make sure to apply deet-free repellent. First we did the zip-line, well worth it. Sabino was very knowledgeable and walked us through each safety-step. The rest of the staff ensured our safety as well. The rappelling activity was also awesome, everything is double-checked and fool-proofed to ensure your safety (I am a chicken and I even had fun on these activities and felt safe at all times). We then descended to the cenote. This was by far the best. They offer you new snorkels too. The water was cool but refreshing after a hot and humid day. Do not use sun-protection as these damage the Eco-system in the cenote.These guys are utmost professionals. Will definitely use this company again for our next trip to Cancun."

We took the Mexico Waterjets ferry for about a 30 minute trip from the pier in Cozumel to Playa deal Carmen and were greeted by our tour guide, Carlos. After making sure everyone made it from the ferry to him, he escorted us on a short walk to the van we'd be traveling in, provided us with some cold bottled water, and intruced us to our driver, Roberto. Along the drive to Turtle Cove, Carlos talked to us about some of the history of the area. When we arrived, we were provided with life jackets, fins, masks, and snorkels. We made our way to the beach, and began snorkeling with Carlos leading us around. We saw several turtles, a few sting rays, some coral, and a lots of fish including a couple of invasive lion fish. During our time in the water, Carlos did a good job of scouting out where the turtles were, and made sure no one got left behind. He also made sure we kept a safe distance from the lion fish since they're poisonous.After Turtle Cove, we kept our snorkeling equipment and Roberto drove us all to the Dos Ojos cenotes in Tulum. The water in these caverns is absolutely the clearest water we've ever seen. If there had been enough light, I'm sure we could have seen clear through to the bottom. The rock formations in the cenotes were incredible. The water was a bit cold at first, but we got used to it after a few minutes. There are small fish in the water, but the rock formations are what you're really there to see and they do not disappoint.After Dos Ojos, we got back in the van and were driven the Wah Wah Beach Bar back in Playa del Carmen for a buffet style Mexican lunch and some drinks. Two drinks were included in the tour. There was a wide variety of food to choose from, and all of it was fantastic. Following lunch, Carlos escorted all of us back to the ferry for our return trip to the pier in Cozumel.One thing to note for anyone considering this tour. Make sure you apply your sunscreen and bug spray before you get on the ferry. Turtle Cove and Dos Ojos are both protected areas, so were told not to apply anything to our skin prior to getting into the water. They want to make sure the chemicals don't harm the animals, or degrade the quality/clarity of the water. If you apply your sunscreen and bug spray before the excursion, it has time to soak into your skin and won't pollute the water. We didn't know about the rules ahead of time, so we both ended up with several mosquito bites while were walking around Dos Ojos before getting into the water. Overall, I think this was the best excursion of our cruise. It was an all day trip, and we enjoyed every bit of it."

They go out of their way to make sure you have fun. They are personable and very outgoing. Jose led the snorkeling adventure and he will make sure you get up close and personal with the stingrays. Alina was there to make sure she caught every photo of your experience. The turtle?? Well, he was a friendly guy all on his own and liked to swim under you. It was amazing! But, as with life, you get out what you put in. If you are at all nervous about the creatures, hang to the back of the crowd, where you can observe without getting too close. It can be a rough ride out to the reef, as you head into the waves. If you are prone to seasickness, consider this and stay at the front of the boat. The ride back is smooth. Or it could have been the Carlos Special that evened me out a bit. (ask for that. Tell them you saw it on TripAdvisor. :) )After we snorkeled, they anchored the boat, where it became a party boat. We jumped off the boat to swim in the lagoon, paddle-boarded, or just stayed on board to drink the Mexican Water. Or in my case, that Carlos Special.I highly recommend this tour company and will definitely look forward to our next adventure with them."

Took us to meet our small group led by an amazing guide (Pato) and driven safely around (Carlos T.). We immediately headed to the Mayan ruins, Pato explained everything is great detail leading up to the tour and then through the tour of the ruins. After this hot short excursion, we were taken to the underground rivers (Cenote), where we all cooled down in the underground rivers which was soooo refreshing. We all had life jackets and helmets with lights to see this completely enclosed underground system. Pato guided us through this area while Carlos T safely guarded everything behind. We then headed out to the beach for a great little buffet lunch. We had plenty of time to navigate all of the shops in Tulum prior to leaving for the Cenote and conversations was lively and interesting. A great getaway and well worth the price we paid at the resort. We left at 0745 and arrived home around 3p. Recommended to those not interested in being exposed to the sun all day."

Our tour guide, Ivan, was a friendly and helpful guide. Our tour ended around 4.30pm which allowed us to enjoy the sea in the evening. Our guide Ivan provided us bottles of water, face towels, snacks, etc... so I felt like I was in a 5 star hotel. Overall, great tour with a great tour guide, Ivan.

She was truly the most patient, fun, informative and attentive guide I have ever had. My kids were fearing the snorkelling because we have never done it. She made them feel so comfortable in the water and never left their side. This made the experience that much better. The tour itself was breath taking. The most peaceful, beautiful views in crystal clear, clean water. The Tulums was just as great of an experience and the views were just breathtaking. Truly recommended to all ages and an experience we will never forget."

We then moved to a \"cove\" where we jumped into the water from the boat, paddle boarded, and swam. Lunch and drinks (alcoholic and non) were supplied after the snorkeling. A photographer on board documented the experience in and out of the water. Digital pictures could be purchased on a thumb drive as you got off the boat.

Was totally worth every penny, as long as you have good weather and are able to go out (they mentioned a few times that other days people weren't able to go out and snorkel because it was too wavy or stormy). We started on the catamaran which was huge, they blasted great music for everyone and took pics, everyone was talking and laying out. We got to the reef and they got us all set up nice and quick and were in the water in no time. They were super chill, found amazing things to spot out and pick up to show everyone. They time flew by. After that we got on the boat and the open bar started and they made the best margaritas I've ever had. Lunch was delicious as well! We had guac and chips, and sandwich, ceviche and potato salad. Then we headed to an area to paddle board and swim around. Everyone started taking tequila shots and doing flips off the boat! IT WAS AWESOMEside note:-its about a half a day long-perfect for spring breakers or families with older kids or a bunch of friends/couples-don't worry about getting sea sick the boat moves pretty slow"

This is my first review of any sort but, I felt it was warranted for the incredible service we received from a cancun adventures host/guide named Pepe! Pepe was very energetic, knowledgable, passionate and best of all fun / experience minded during the duration of our 7 hours with him. We started the day at 09:00 for a few hours of snorkeling with indigent turtles of Tulum Playa Del Carmen and it was incredible. Pepe was extremely safety oriented in helping those that had not had the pleasure of snorkeling in the Caribbean before and made everyone very comfortable in finding their rhythm from breathing to swimming. We were able to see 7 sea turtles and at one point 4 in one area together. There was a grey stingray and even a 4-5ft barracuda that the entire group was able to enjoy seeing from a distance of course lol The next part of the day was my favorite just for the historical value and Pepe's overwhelming knowledge and passion. The Mayan ruins of Tulum From the 20 minute ride from snorkeling to Tulum, Pepe talked to us (group of 11) of how almost everything we were taught in grade school was incorrect about the rise and fall of the Mayan civilization. He was quick to point out this was not an empire but just a culture dating back many thousands of years. They have not disappeared but simply disbanded due to poor economic and habitual decisions for food water etc The ruins are a must do down here and I hope everyone that goes gets to enjoy them as I did and has Pepe as a guide for their journey ! If I'm ever down here again I will be sure to book with Cancun Adventures and specifically ask for Pepe!!"

After joining Mary, our guide, and the rest of our group we headed to Tulum. Just a heads up, Tulum is an hour or so drive from Cancun/ Playa del Carmen, so be ready to spend some time in the van. Thankfully all the vehicles are air-conditioned. Cancun Adventures also provides cold water and snacks for the tour. Take advantage of the bottled water, it can be very hot and humid in the ruins. Mary was fantastic as a guide. It's obvious this is more than just a job to her. The Mayans and these ruins are important to her personally. After the guided tour, we were given some time to explore on our own, before heading back to our resort. Don't let the early pickup time deter you from this tour. We were leaving the site right as huge tour buses loaded with cruise ship tourists were arriving. It's always nice to beat the rush.Mary and Heriberto, thank you for a fun and educational morning."

My husband always said he would never leave the country for vacation, so to get him to Mexico was a feat in its own, but we went with the intentions of seeing Tulum. The day started with us being greeted by our friendly tour guide Crystal, and our Driver Denis. Crystal was the best thing to ever happen to us. First Denis greeted us all with a water. Once everyone was in the van Crystal explained the Itinerary for our day. At one point in our journey to Tulum she must have heard us voice confusion about Mexico so she took time to explain everything to us. We went to Tulum first. She was so informative, telling us all about the ruins and what the different things ment. She took so much time to make sure we understood the reasons the Mayans did things the way they did, and why they believed what they believed, after touring Tulum we were able to spend some time shopping she made recommendations for things for us to try and do. We then set off for Akumal to snorkel with the sea turtles. This was such an amazing experience. We saw many turtles, stingrays, barracuda, ans and several different fish, her knowledge base was phenomenal. The ocean was pretty rough this day so we weren't even sure we'd get to snorkel, but not only did we get to we got to go to the reef and snorkel. Truly a highlight of our tril. She couldn't have been better for our lunch she stood at the end of the line in the buffet style lunch and explained what everything was, and how it was traditionally eaten. She helped us put the traditional sauces on our civiche, and told us how the locals made their food. My husband and I went with a friend as well and her underwater camera died before Akumal. So we decided to do the tour over again to get the pictures we wanted. This time we went through a different company, ecotours, and we did the cenotes and Akumal. Our Akumal tour was nothing compared to our tour with Crystal. Our second tour we saw 3 turtles and that was it. We didn't get to go the the reef and our tour guide wasn't nearly as helpful. It was nothing compared to our first tour with cancun adventures, Thanks to Crystal, we held our tour guide to too high of standards."

Crystal went above and beyond to help capture photos and video of the sealife.Our last stop was at La Playa Xpuha for an excellent buffet lunch. I was extremely impressed with the way Crystal went through each dish, how it's traditionally eaten, and what it was paired with. On previous excursions, they gave us the free for all.

Amazing crew- really took into consideration everyones skill level.One thing the reps (from the hotel) should you when booking is there is an option for wetsuits (15USD PP) as you aren't guaranteed blue (clearer, warmer) waters or green (colder, murkier) water.We also got to see sea turtles (from the boat into the water, mantis and 3 dolphins!)Remember to bring \"biodegradable\" sunscreen!!"

Our tour guide Israel was great as well as our driver Danny. We managed to see about six sea turtles as well as a few rays and plenty of colorful fish on the turtle cove portion. The Dos Ojos Cenote was amazing and really made our trip. Seeing the divers in the large underwater cave was surreal. We finished the day up at a Mexican buffet on the beach at \"Wah Wah's\" and it was very good. I think I saw the most guacamole and ceviche I've ever seen in my life at one place. Transportation was great and the tour was timed very well to get us back on our ship without too little or too much time. Israel and Danny did a fantastic job."

Our our trip to Hard Rock Riviera Maya, we had some resort credits we were able to use on tours. One of the first ones was the mystical underground river with the cenotes and dos ojos. This tour was absolutely amazing. We had a group of 8 of us all couples. The drive was a little bit from the resort but it was worth it. Our tour guide Crystal was absolutely amazing. Very knowledgeable on all the history of the cenotes and how it all became of it. She also kept the group engaged. The water is the most relaxing crystalline water i have ever been in. It just felt so refreshing. She also knew our group liked to learn of things from different culture. After our tour was done we were able to get a taste of culture and have some fresh coconut with lime, salt and chili powder. So good. Crystal was very good we wish we would have had her for the rest of our tours. Alexis was the driver and he played really good music. We also did the speedboat and snorkeling. We were able to swim with sea turtles and stingrays and explore the coral reef, which was also absolutely amazing. I highly recommend that tour as well. Than to finish our vacation we did the sunset sailing. Which was just absolutely amazing. You will get a little wet on this tour so dont over dress and you also take your shoes off before you get on the boat. Flip flops would be a good choice of footwear. They serve you snacks and its open bar. You sail for a while and than they park so everyone can mingle around the boat. I recommend all of these tours as all the guides we had were all amazing."

Our guide Pepe was very informative and enthusiastic he gave us a lot of information about the history of the area and the mayans. When we arrived at tulum we were provided with bottles of water and umbrellas to protect us from the sun. Tulum was a fantastic sight and is highly recommended, its very different to chichen itza. There are great views of the sea and a walk through a small wooded area before you get there. The sight itself is walled in and free of street sellers so this is a huge improvement over chichen itza.After we left tulum we had a short bus ride to akumal where we were shown how to snorkle by Pepe he was a great instructor and made the group feel at ease before going in the sea. We were in the sea for around an hour and a half and saw several sea turtles, a stingray and lots of other fish. The water is crystal clear and we got to swim over the coral as well. After the snorkling we went for a buffet lunch with some drinks before being dropped right back at our resorts. Overall the experience was fantastic and the highlight of our trip to mexico thank you Pepe for an amazing day :)"

The only downside are that there are a lot of bats, so if you are afraid (like I was) be aware. They won't harm you or fly into you, but they are there. The place is beautiful and shadowed, so there is no need for sunscreen, which you cannot wear anyway since the Mayan people still use the water for various purposes. Definitely bring a camera!

Not to mention an open bar and very friendly staff.

            "review": "Otherworldly sights and sounds. This excursion was a second choice for us, as our original excursion was cancelled and no longer offered through Carnival cruise lines. As it turns out, this excursion gave us more information about the history and culture of the Mayan people than we would have received if we just went to an eco-park as originally planned. We met our tour coordinator at the end of the pier in Cozumel who provided us with wristbands for the excursion and tickets for the ferry to the mainland. The ferry filled fairly quickly. Within an hour of getting off the Carnival ship we had arrived at the mainland in Riviera Maya where we were met by our guide for the day, David. We were a small group of 8. We loaded up in a comfortable van driven by Walberto and began the one hour drive to the Yal-Ku Lagoon. Along the way, David explained our itinerary for the day, went over safety procedures and taught us a little about his country. We were worried about the weather since it was raining sideways when we arrived. By the time we reached the lagoon the rain had passed. We were outfitted with our life jackets, snorkel gear and flippers. The lagoon was not crowded. Maybe two other small groups of 8 at most. You stroll through a beautiful sculpture garden on the way to the water's edge. We stayed together as a group and explored the lagoon for one hour. Imagine swimming in a beautiful aquarium with exotic, tropical fish! The water was brackish (salt/fresh water mixed) but we had great visibility considering we were there between bands of two tropical depressions and it had just rained an hour within our arrival. When we returned to the van, Walberto had bottled water, bananas and cookies waiting for us. Remember to bring along your towel, as they are not provided on this excursion. We got back in the van for a short drive to the private Mayan Land and the home of the Mystic River. We were outfitted with our helmets and life jackets then driven into the jungle to the entrance of the cenote. Water shoes are helpful for this portion of the excursion. The water is quite cool when you first get in, but you get used to it very quickly! You tread water into the cave and get to view bat families hanging from the top. You get to see some amazing, almost otherworldly, stalactites and stalagmites. You explore the cenote for an hour. Then it's another hour drive back to Riviera Maya, but it goes by quickly. David shared stories of his adventures and taught us more about the culture. We were treated to a buffet lunch at a beachfront restaurant. Beverages were included and David even called ahead so our drinks were handed to us as we walked in the door. We had one hour to enjoy the delicious authentic Mexican meal and reminisce about the day. Then it was time to say goodbye and return to the ferry. David escorted us every step of the way and made sure we received our return ferry tickets. After a bumpy, rainy, ferry ride we returned to port. All call on the ship was 9:30 and we were on the gangway by 9:28. A full day from start to finish! No time for shopping, but adventure was our priority so we were not disappointed. This tour was worth every penny and more. The guides were informative, courteous and helpful. They truly have your comfort and safety in mind throughout the day. We cannot wait to return and explore Mexico with David again! I will add photos as soon as possible!"

That would have been a nice addition to our excursion. Pepe gave a very \"modern\" and thorough explanation of the site, Mayan history & tradition, and other related background info. He was very passionate & excited by the subject! Definitely learned a lot.Akumel snorkeling was a true highlight of our entire vacation. The sea turtles were amazing to watch and would come so close to us while popping up for air! The coral reef offered incredible views complete w. a multitude of colorful fishies. I'm excited to get our underwater disposable pics developed (TIP: bring one of these w you!!)Lastly we had a very relaxing & enjoyable buffet lunch & (2 free!) drinks at a casual beach bar to top off the day.

They are very well organized and go out of there way to accommodate all. I am going to name names, but there is a chance I could miss someone and probably will. If you are one I do not mention I am truly sorry, but all were instrumental in making a great excursion. First you have Jose a great leader with a jubilant attitude, the the boat captain was Davalicious, the photographer and helper was Gabby, then there was another helper Merlon who got renamed Manly by my wife and her new friend Lisa after a few tequila filled drinks and Cerveza , no one knows how they got Manly out of Merlon but they did and Merlon was okay with it. There was another couple of guys who were quiet but also helping so I don't know their names and for that I am sorry. The pick-up at our resort was on-time and when we got to the port where the boat was kept Jose took over and after some brief rules about the boat we were off to the reef and the ride was very pleasant, I only saw 1 person feeling nauseated. When we got to the reef Jose gave an efficient snorkeling class to those who have never snorkeled. Once all rules of the reef were disclosed we were in the water with a guided tour to where you will see the best fish, turtles and stingrays. I have been snorkeling a lot, and following Jose brought us to many, many colorful fish that seemed to want you to touch them, they came so close and were plentiful, I myself had a great time in the water and saw more colorful fish and wildlife than I had in the previous 4 snorkeling trips I had been on together. We had ample time in the water and was not rushed! Once done at the reef all of us were back on the catamaran for some good food and drink. The food was plentiful and came in a box conveniently packed with a tasty turkey and cheese or ham and cheese sandwich on roll, potato salad, guacamole, salad, dressing, brownie, napkin, knife, fork and spoon. the liquor was top shelf and the tequila was very good. When we left the reef they then take you to a beautiful calm and colorful lagoon to do some paddle boarding and diving off the boat. Anyone who attempted paddle boarding did quite well and had tons of fun! From there we were on our way back to port, and the trip back to our resort was a pleasure. We had a great time, very enjoyable and money well spent! Cost was $109 per person..."

The main reason i choose this trip was because i had never gone snorkeling in my life I didn't expect to see much but thanks to our tour guide we didn't only get to see turtles or the cenotes we got to have a blast this was probably the best adventure i had during the carnival cruise our guide treated us respectfully and made sure we all felt comfortable and had us laughing most of the time she made my expectations look weak compared to how it turned out to be. I would definitely go again. Our Guide was (Alina) best, funniest guide ever."

They picked us up in Playa Del Carmen ferry because we were staying in Cozumel. They were timely, knowledgeable and fun! As we swim in the noticing the formations we were seeing the flashlight in the dark waters, we could see the scuba divers coming from the other connecting cenote ( dos ojos ) and it was really cool. One of the guys in the cenote handed me a small piece of fruit to hold underwater and the fish fed from my hands- super cool. Afterwords they took us to Akumal to swim and snorkel with the turtles around a dozen Including a sting ray. Awesome afternoon. They were friendly and clearly enjoyed their jobs!"

Everything was exceptional. The meeting point to were we stayed was a minute walk, they were extremely punctual and helpful with everything. Two people stood out, one day we had a guy named Ivan walk us through Chichen Itza and he was one of the friendliest tour guides we've ever had. He was truly knowledgeable about the Mayan culture and it showed when it was time for him to explain us everything. Another people we were very delighted with was Yeudiel (I don't know if that's how it's spelled, but he went by Silver) which was our tour guide at Xoximilco. He was very outgoing and made sure all of the group felt welcomed even though not everyone spoke the same language. Also, the prices you find at Cancun adventure can't be better, I looked at other websites and this was definitely the best website for the purchase. Everything was beyond our expectations and ultimately the service is what made the trip so great. I would very much recommend it and would definitely work with Cancun adventure if I ever come back to Playa. Simply exceptional!"

From there you jump from the boat - relax, eat, drink & paddle board if you so desire. We are a young couple enjoying everything about Mexico...

I would like to first point out that these two provided the most attention to details on any tours that we have been on. The Tulum part of the tour was interesting and Michelle made sure it wasn't boring. We were provided with umbrellas as it was a sunny day. This was a very nice touch as we got some nasty sunburns and should like to avoid further injuring it. After the guided tour, we were giving some free time to ourselves at Tulum to take pictures and walk around. It was too windy that day and the beach was not opened for swimming. After the tour, we were giving snacks and moved to Akumal. We geared up and snorkelled for an hour and saw lots of sea turtles, reef fishes and a stingray. Michelle made sure everyone is around and that no one has fallen behind while we snorkelled. My wife was a weak swimmer and somehow managed to lose one of her fins. Michelle helped her put the fin back on. After the snorkelling we got back on the van and drove to a sea side restaurant for lunch. The meal was decent and was buffet style and we each got two drinks. After the meal, we got dropped off at the hotel. I should mention that prior to the meal, the van got a bit messy from the sand and water on our feet when we got on from snorkelling. Antonio cleaned everything while we had lunch so when we got back on, the van was very clean again. I should also mention that everyone received complementary cold bottled water through out the trip and Michelle carried a bunch in her backpack during the Tulum part so people can have water if they finished theres while walking around Tulum. All in all we had a great time and would highly recommend this tour."

I am a big Horror movie fan and in the description it says the movie \"The Cave\" was filmed at this location. HUGE plus for me. Well, we finally booked this excursion and I could not wait to experience it.We started out on a 30 minute ferry ride over to Playa del Carmen. Not a bad ride. When we arrived we were greeted by Alina. She was very friendly and prompted us to wait for the rest of the group that would be joining us. There was about 10 people in our group (Excellent! I hate big groups on these types of activities) before we started our short walk through the shops to the van. In the 5 minutes we walked I felt like I already knew so much about the island thanks to Alina. When we got situated in the van Alina started out by telling us about herself and what we would be doing that day. Along with getting everyone's names and a little information about each of us. The ride to the beach was maybe 20-25 minutes, but it felt like nothing because Alina was telling us so much about the history of the beaches and Mayan civilization. Once we got to the beach she gave us information about what we would be doing along with some do's and don'ts while in the water. All the snorkel gear is provided and explained how to use the equipment (you can bring your own gear if you like, we are divers so we brought our own). At the beach she informed everyone to put on their gear and start entering the water. She was not the typical \"lets stay in one line to get to our destination' type guide. She was very laid back and conscious about where everyone was in the group. She informed us each time she saw a turtle or sting ray and told us to come over for pictures and to observe. The water was a bit rough so being a good swimmer is recommended. We saw probably 5-6 different turtles, stingrays, coral, and lots of colorful fish. We were in the water roughly an hour before we departed back to the van for water and snacks (all provided). Once back in the van Alina informed us that it was a short ride over to the Cenotes. On our way over she gave great details about the history of the Cenotes and the Mayan families that still live there today. Once we got to the Cenotes, OH MY GOD! it was AMAZING! The water is a bit cold (around 70 degrees) so if you have something warm to swim in it would be good but you'll get used to it. The cave systems they have are amazing and the water is crystal clear. If you are a diver they have set lines that you can dive through the tunnels (guide required, of course). Alina gave us time to explore the cave and have a leisurely swim. After, we went to ANOTHER Cenote where it was just as cool. Again, Alina was awesome about telling us about the caves and gave us time to explore alone or with your partner. After the AMAZING Cenote trip we got back to the van and took about a 30 minute ride to the BEACH! There we took a short walk to Wah Wah's restaurant. There we were greeted with an awesome buffet with authentic Mexican dishes that were absolutely delicious. Two drinks are included with the buffet (alcoholic or non-alcoholic). After eating Alina let us spend some time on the beach or exploring the markets before meeting back to get on the ferry back to the ship :( The ferry ride was another 30 minute ride but after a full day of fun you wont notice because you will pass out.If you are looking to book a great excursion with lots of fun and history involved I strongly encourage this one. Don't forget to get Alina as your tour guide!!"

Our tour guide Alex and our driver Jesus were amazing. They made the tour fun and gave us tons of information. Alex let the group know what the schedule was throughout the day so we knew what was expected and answered any of our questions. The tour went flawlessly. Tulum was beautiful and loved the history about it. It was very busy the day we went. After we left tulum. We did a short drive to Akumal where we swam with sea turtles, squids and sting rays. AMAZING! After we swam with the turtles we did another super short drive to have lunch. The food was amazing, right on the beach with beautiful sand, a swing bar and a couple shops. After we ate we had time to shop around and hang out before returning to our resorts. Alex and Jesus were great people to have as our tour guides."

They really should have cancelled. Half of the people on the boat were throwing up and we could not even snorkel because there was no visibility. Make sure you don't come hungry. The trip began at 12:30 but they didn't offer lunch until 4, which was a box of food you had to share between two people. Even though I wasn't one of the people sick, it was a really disappointing trip as I paid for snorkelling and did not even get to go. One positive is that the crew was awesome and were really attentive to the people that were sick. I think Cancun Adventures just needs to be aware of the forecast and give people who have pre booked the opportunity to cancel by warning them they may get sick and will not be able to snorkel."

When we arrived in Playa del Carmen we were met by Fernando who took us to an awaiting van. The van was not very big but there were only 10 in our group so by the time the day was over we had new friends. We travelled to Akumal to swim with the turtles. The weather was very windy so the snorkeling was not great but the turtle experience was awesome. After the turtles, we rode to Dos Ojos Cenotes. We went in at two entry points (one guided and one independent). Then, we finished off the great day with a buffet lunch in town (food was better than expected). Fernando & Elias were great guides. They were knowledgeable and personable."

Due to high winds and rough waters that day, our original plans to go speedboating and snorkeling was cancelled and this was offered instead. I was a bit hesitant about it, swimming is a cave didn't sound too fun. Boy, was I wrong. First credit goes to our tour guide, Roberto and our bus driver, whose name I can't recall. They were fabulous. Roberto could sense mine and my 9 year old's discomfort once in the water, immediately he asked if we would like to hold on to the lifesaver. Then when my husband was struggling a bit, he told him to wait for us by the stairs. This experience was awesome in and out of the water. The water was super nice, a bit cold at first, but once in, it was great. Thanks Roberto and friends, we loved the experience."

We had a small group of 6 and the other group present had ~5 people, including kids. Our driver was Cesar and tour guide was Michelle. Cesar was a friendly and safe driver and Michelle was energetic, full of information, and engaging. After being picked up from the resort, we went straight to Tulum a short distance away. Michelle led us on a tour of the ruins, giving us a lot of interesting information about the area and the Mayans. Since the other family had kids, she made sure to make the tour engaging for both adults and kids. She was very personable and easy to talk to! After the tour, we had time to browse the ruins and local shops on our own. We then headed to Akumal for snorkeling. Michelle led us on a snorkeling tour and made everyone feel comfortable in the water! She gave us information about the conservation station at the reef, as well as information about the different species of sea turtles and stingrays we saw. After snorkeling, Cesar drove us a short distance away to a local restaurant/bar where we had lunch right on the beach. The food was DELICIOUS, the beach was more beautiful than our resorts, and the people there were friendly. Many thanks to Cesar and Michelle for making the day so pleasant and fun!!! Our family highly recommends this excursion, as well as Cesar and Michelle as the tour guides for the day.Also, Michelle, if you are reading this, the name of the documentary where the teenage girl sails around the world by herself is called \"Maidentrip\". You would love it!"

There were so many options in Cozumel, but we had heard that the Cenotes were amazing based on watching the movie \"The Cave\" so we booked this excursion. After we took the ferry to Playa deal Carmen from Cozumel we met with our tour guide Alina. From the very beginning she was a wealth of information and provided excellent customer service. She took us to our transport where we met our driver and had cold bottled water waiting for us. (It was a very hot day!)Alina then began teaching us about the history of Mexico and about the beach at Akubal. She was very knowledgable about really took the time to explain everything we would be doing, discussed being environmentally responsible, while having a good time. Please note that is you take this excursion you should put on all sunscreen before departing your vessel as putting on sunscreen at Akubal is discouraged because the chemicals can stay in the water and harm the wildlife. We were able to snorkel in Akubal, saw numerous turtles, stingrays, multiple fish, and the coral reef. The surf was a bit rough and required some significant swimming that day so make sure you are decent swimmer. Life jackets were required but keeping up with the group proved difficult at times for some. We took our own equipment and we didn't have any problems. After we left Akubal, we then took a short ride to the Dos Ojos cenotes. This place was absolutely amazing! The water was crystal clear and quite cool (water temp in the 70s) so be prepared. We were able to swim and use our snorkel gear in 3 different locations! An absolutely amazing experience. There are so many caves and passages to see under water. We also were able to swim in a location inhabited by numerous bats! Since we are Scuba Divers we are definitely coming back to dive here. After leaving Dos Ojos we went back to the port and had a delicious Mexican buffet that included two beverages (alcoholic if you want) at the Wah Wah beach club. The food was fantastic! Overall this had to be the best excursion we have ever been on and Alina (our guide) and Roberto (our driver) made this experience for us. Alina was an amazing guide with knowledge of every location, she made sure we all were able to experience as much as we wanted, and she gave us free time to explore without having to stay in lines like some other tours. Roberto was amazing and he held on to our gear(hats, sunglasses, shoes, etc) throughout the whole tour and was willing to help us with anything we needed. I highly recommend Alina and Roberto from Cancun Adventures!!!!Thanks for a once in a lifetime experience. Shawn & Josh"

The bus arrived to pick us up promptly, and even though we dropped the ball and didn't print out our email confirmation voucher, the guide took care of everything and we continued on without a problem. The bus was comfortable and well air conditioned, with space above the seats for personal belongings. They served a little breakfast on board, consisting of a sandwich, cornbread and orange juice. This tour also provided cold water and soda. Our first stop was Coba. (All entrance fees were paid with the price of the tour) We all were given the choice of riding a bicycle of our choosing, or a tricycle pedaled by a park employee. We were taken through the site and our guide, Mario \"Gato\", was very informative throughout the tour, (even during the bus rides.) He even paid attention to each person, looking at our pupils to make sure we were all tolerating the heat okay. We climbed the pyramid and saw other ruins along the way. Then it was back on the bus, with a cool wet towel, to continue on to Xel-Ha. We had about 4 hours at the eco park, to explore as we wished. Food and drinks were all inclusive and we had a very nice lunch at the buffet restaurant. The selection was awesome! The park was beautiful with lots to do. We swam the river and snorkeled for most of the time, and just walked through for the rest. Plan to use their reef safe sunscreen as many sold online do not meet their standards. It was a very well run tour and the guides are very knowledgeable and helpful. Its a great way to pack a lot into one day without having to figure it out on your own!"

He took us to the Cenote Azul nice and early before most of the other tours, so it was lovely and quiet. After about an hour and a half we jumped back in and went to snorkel with turtles in the coral reef. He passed us on to another guide who took us round. It was absolutely amazing and we couldn't recommend it any more, He was waiting for us after we finished the snorkeling and took us to the local restaurant near the beach for lunch. The food was lovely and the staff were polite and loved to have a bit of a chat. On the way back to the hotel Javier spoke with us about the history of Cancun and other snippets of facts about Mexico in general.We had a great time and the tour guide was brilliant!!"

We then took speedboat for approx 20 min out to the snorkel site. Spent approx 45 min to an hour snorkeling. We saw stingrays, turtles and fish. Good snorkeling. Guide made the entire group stay together the entire time so that was difficult as I kept getting kicked by others. Wish they told us to stay near and not venture off, but not with the guide the entire time. A small boat of snorkelers arrived about 10 min before we were leaving and they were feeding the fish and turtles which definitely attracted more sea life into the area. Overall friendly staff but wish we had a bit more freedom and time. Bringing some bait also would have helped."

It was pretty windy out and when we first arrived to the area before we went onto the boat the staff told us that the ride may be bumpier and rougher than usual and also that we may not be able to snorkel depending on the water conditions so we should think about if we still wanted to go or to reschedule. I went with my boyfriend and we are leaving Friday morning so we decided to go through with it. The ride there wasn't too bad, definitely put on a lot of sunscreen because you will burn like I did! The crew members on the ship were Jose, June, Fernando, and Merlin. I forgot the captains name but he was also on board the ship (thankfully!). Once arriving to the place to snorkel we were thankfully able to go. The water was a little cloudy/murky due to all of the sand being moved around with the winds and waves. Even though it wasn't perfect conditions I still saw stingrays, fish, and even a sea turtle! After snorkeling we went to a cove to paddle board and jump off the boat doing flips or whatever you want. It was a very nice experience and well worth the money!

The turtles were so cute and I finally got to see a stingray!!Although Mexico's water has to be the worst water conditions, it's really not that clear to see under the water Compared to most snorkeling excursions I've done before. But Julian really helped everyone find the sealife under the water and would guide everyone in the way of where to look. This was my 2nd time visiting the ruins and it will be my last. It's brutally hot and once you have seen them once you really don't need to torture yourself and go back LOL. But I was being a team player since my GF's had never been. Tip: bring an umbrella you will need it! My FAV part of this excursion was the Akiin beach hotel where we had lunch, it was the most peaceful beautiful scenery ever. The food was delicious!! The water was crystal blue and so refreshing we swam and relaxed on the beach. This location would be great for a smaller wedding reception for all you women looking for a beautiful beach wedding.

We did this tour during our cruise and the whole experience was excellent. Our tour started from Cozumel, we took 30 min ferry ride to Playa Del Carmen. Our tour guide Crystal from Cancun Adventures met our group at the Pier. She took our group to the shuttle to meet the Driver Sergio where we took another 45 min to do our Snorkeling in Dos Ojos Cenotes. Crystal was very good tour guide and very knowledgeable. During our Snorkeling at Cenotes, my wife was scared to snorkel in a cave so she told her to stay with her the whole time in the floating ring and was pulling her. She worked so hard pulling my wife as she doesn't know how to swim. She did the same thing on our Snorkeling with the turtles not to mention that I got lost while Snorkeling and got separated from our group. It took 15 min to find each other but she was not planning to leave me there. During our snorkel, our Driver Sergio was watching our things which was good even if he didn't know much of English. After our snorkel, Crystal took us for Mexican food which was really good then gave us time to do a bit of shopping. We were very happy for this whole experience and we could recommend this tour company to everyone and we hope your tour guide will be Crystal and Driver Sergio."

We took the half day tour to Tulum; the staff from Cancun Adventures (Crystal and Mateo) were very professional and anticipated any needs, such as an umbrella and cold water. Crystal was very informed and made sure that we were in a shady area as much as possible while explaining the site, which is primitive and has little shade. After visiting the ruins, there was time to shop or swim. Finally, at the end of the tour, we were greeted with cold water and snacks. Cancun Adventures does a great job and I highly recommend them."

I am sorry I did not write a review of it at the time, but here you go. Our tour guide was super knowledgeable, the turtles were amazing, and it was a great day.This time around we went on the sunset luxury sailing cruise. The catamaran was great and we saw swarms (and I mean swarms) of flying fish. Only 4/5 stars because some people on the trip were clearly out for a romantic evening while others were out to party and drink a lot of tequila. The sunset was so beautiful though!Word of warning: the boat ride is a little rough, so take dramamine or wear one of those wrist bands that help with seasickness. You don't want to end up sick while everyone else is watching the magical sunset!"

It was very hot and there was a lot of walking involved to get to the attraction (Tulum). The guide (Ada) spoke very good English and was very knowledgable. She had a bit of a biased opinion of the area, which was ok but a little bit of a downer as she described locals trying to sell merchandise and services. Once we arrived in Tulum we had to sneak away to get to the beach because it was too hot to stand around and listen to guided history. The beach was a little fishy smelling and not very big, not too many places to get comfortable, but the water was amazing and blue. Would have liked to have more time at this location to just do free time exploring."

My boyfriend and I cruised with Royal Caribbean and once of the stops was Cozumel; offering an excursion with Cancun Adventures. Excursion was all day, taking place in Playa del Carmen, with 2 stops: 1 - Cenotes, Dos Ojos, 2 - Akumal, Sea Turtle and Barrier Reef Snorkel. We snorkeled through the entire Cenote which was breathtakingly gorgeous and in the ocean among sea turtles, sting rays and various reef life. Sergio took excellent care of all our belongings which we were out in the waters, helped with all safety gear (life vests, fins, masks etc.) and made sure we were all comfortable while we were traveling. My boyfriend injured his thumb prior to our vacation and Sergio kept checking in with him the whole day to make sure he was okay and didn't need anything. Crystal, our adventure guide, was fantastic. She was so knowledgeable throughout the entire excursion, providing history about the Cenotes and Mayan culture. She also kept the whole group together, making sure no one felt left out and made those who were tired or uncomfortable comfortable and safe the entire time. I especially appreciated her attention to time in keeping us all on track so that we were able to get the most out of the experience. I also loved her personal touches to the tour such as allotting time to get fresh coconuts along with trying local adaptations of the coconut and other fruits also she allotted extra time to traverse 5th avenue for a little before making it back to the ferry. She also made sure that throughout the entire excursion everyone was drinking water and had a snack in between because lunch was planned for later on in the day, Anything and everything we wanted to do, she made possible. I have already recommended this particular excursion along with Cancun Adventures to friend who will be vacationing to Mexico within the upcoming months."

Our guide Jorge R was so awesome, he knew everything about the ruins and the caverns. He even said he goes on these tours on his own free time which shows that he really enjoys doing what he does. He was such a joy to be around and he was so flexible with the group. He gave us an hour of free time to take pictures, swim or shop after the ruins. He stopped when he saw my girlfriend and I shopping and asked if we needed help with anything and talked for a few minutes. Jorge made sure everybody had water, snacks and also if they had to go to the restroom, he stopped and showed the group where to go. He never rushed us and the beach club we stopped at for lunch was awesome! The tour of the cavern was amazing and Jorge was again so knowledgable and helpful. He always kept the group in the loop on what was going on and if we were passing anything important, took photos of the couples as well. The Driver Andres was very nice as well, he helped get all the snacks and waters prepped for the group for when we returned from the tour and also helped carry belongings for the group if we needed help. I would absolutely recommend this tour to anybody traveling to the area! It was so great I wish I could get this tour guide for every tour I go on! Such a great experience!!"

I had a moment when no one was near by that one swam up to the surface and hung out with me for a few minutes. made my trip:) thank you Pepe and your group for a truly memorable experience :)"

My family, a friend and I signed up for the snorkel adventure with Cancun Adventures- snorkeling was the only thing we wanted to do (other than enjoy the resort) when we were in Mexico. It was pretty windy on the day of but we assumed the members of Cancun Adventures would cancel the trip if we couldn't experience what we paid for. We learned after our excursion that they had cancelled another boat tour that same day. It started out with a 2-hour ride to the reef. Because the water was so rough, myself, and many others, felt sick right away. The most 'comfortable' spot was on the front mesh of the catamaran because of the breeze and a good view of the horizon, which I focused on the whole time (I couldn't look at the sea turtles or flying fish along the way. I literally did not take my eyes off the horizon). When we arrived at the reef, the conditions were not ideal for snorkeling (HUGE disappointment!) and because of that, we got an extra long boat ride (yay). We headed out to this 'Lagoon' (Plan B), which was actually a man-made harbor/canal type area making it very busy with boats. On the plus side, the boat was much less rocky in this space and we were somewhat able to feel normal again, though eating and drinking was not on the table for us. I paddle-boarded because I wanted to make the most of the experience, and it was fun, though it didn't make up for the rest. After hanging around in this culvert for 45 minutes, we took a 5 minute ride back to where we started and it was over- much to our relief.I understand they need to make their money, but they should have cancelled. They knew that too because, as mentioned before, they had cancelled another tour that same day.On a side note, the staff were very friendly and personable, so in better conditions you would have a blast with them. My advice is to ensure, for any excursion and with any company, that there is a cancellation policy in place in case the weather doesn't cooperate."

When the group I was with were in the bay, on the boat, the crew members said that the water may be too rough for snorkelling, but that we would drive out and see (the waves were huge, and seemed unsafe). Once out there, they deemed it unsafe to snorkel, and took us to a small bay to \"play water games and have a party on a boat\". They also said we could use the snorkel equipment, but that there was limited life in the bay. At this point, they told us to sign a waiver stating we were fine with not snorkelling- many people on the boat asked to go back to shore and for a refund of our money. The crew made us feel stupid, as if we were just trying to ruin the fun and stated we wouldn't get our money back because we wasted gas money driving to the snorkelling spot. After 30 minutes, they got permission from their boss' to drop those who wanted to leave at shore and take the remaining for a cruise in the water. My bf and I left the boat and went to our travel agency to request a refund. Cancun Adventures told our agent when he called that they had taken us snorkelling and a refund would not be granted. After 3 hours our agent negotiated a refund, but I was less than pleased that they lied to the agent and tried to deny a refund for not providing us the service we paid for. Combined with that and the crew's lack of communication with us and trying to make us feel silly, I will never do another tour with this company."

So we looked and found this tour group, Cancun Adventures. They picked us up at the hotel promptly on time at 9am. Alex (guide) and Jesus (driver) were polite, friendly and easy to understand (si, habla English)...When we arrived at Tulum, Alex guided us to the ruins and then launched into one of the best historical descriptions of the Mayan culture, as well as the city itself, that I've experienced. His knowledge was great, he brought along a book of detailed pictures, as well as props, to help enrich the tour. He definitely brought the city \"to life\" for us. The tour was just enough time, but bring comfortable shoes and dress lightly...it requires walking several miles.After the tour of Tulum, we were taken to a beach area, where Alex guided us through a snorkel adventure with giant tortoise...it was amazing. We not only saw numerous tortoise, but also stingray, squid, as well as umpteen tropical fish near the reaf. If you like snorkeling, this was a great time. Be warned, everyone is required to wear life jackets, even experrienced swimmers.Finally, the tour ended a wonder beach-side restaurant for fajitas and beer. Then, unfortunately, back to the hotel by 3:30.This tour was one of the highlights of our time in Riviera Maya...a must see ;-)"

Our tour guide, Hector, was top notch at all aspects of this tour. Very knowledgeable about the Tulum site and able to shift attention to any part of the site, depending on how crowded individual areas were. He managed the schedule really well so we could have both the guided piece of the tour and time to wander by ourselves.The snorkeling at Anukal was great. It was my first time snorkeling and he was very good at helping me figure out basic things, like getting the mask on the right way :) we saw several turtles, a sting ray and then he took us out deeper to the reef. The water was beautiful and he to made sure to keep our relatively small group (4 couples) together. One guy had issues with his mask and Hector switched masks with him then dove to retrieve a small piece that had come loose, so the guy could keep snorkeling.We finished the day having drinks and lunch at the Beach Club. The food was really good and we were given some free time again to hit the beach and either swim or enjoy a drink or two. The beach was gorgeous and the beach club had facilities to shower and change as well.On the way back to our hotel, Hector was great about answering all of my questions about the denotes that we didn't get a chance to visit. We will definitely come back and would recommend Cancun Adventures tours to anyone."

It was a picture perfect day and the snorkeling was amazing. We saw rays, turtles and countless varieties of fish and coral. Roberto was our tour guide and he was awesome. He was engaged with the group and a great lead through the water as we snorkeled. The crew was hard working and ready to answer any questions. Eder was great and our captain David was perfect at the helm of the catamaran. I would definitely recommend this tour to anyone interested in great snorkeling and beautiful scenery.

Our guide was Alina and our driver was Abi (not sure of his full name), We toured the Tulum ruins and went snorkeling off a beach to see some coral reef and see the sea turtles and ended the day with a later lunch. For the ruins tour, there were so many great photo opportunities and Ali was so knowledgeable. Thankfully, we were provided with umbrellas by Abi and Ali for extra shade. After she guided us around the ruins, we had free time to walk around ourselves, go back to the shopping area near the entrance, or to even swim at the cove below the ruins. We then arrived back to our bus, where Abi was waiting with cold towels, water and snacks and then drove us to the beach where we snorkeled and swam with the turtles and then had lunch. We saw at least 6-8 turtles below us, baby squid, many different fish along the reef. The beach itself that we swam off of was just beautiful. For the included lunch, we had a buffet lunch with salad, ceviche, chips/salsas, fajitas and more. You will need walking shoes, a hat, a bathing suit, high SPF sunscreen, some souvenir money and definitely your camera! There are many little shops right near the meeting point so there is plenty of souvenir shopping opportunity. I would not recommend the trip for little children. We were gone from 715 in the morning and did not arrive back to the hotel until about 515. The sun was very strong and there is not a lot of shade as you are traveling between the buildings at the ruins site. I would definitely recommend this tour trip!"

            "review": "Tulum Akumal Tour. Myself and two others booked a half day tour to Tulum and Akumal. It was 2 excursions in one, first to snorkel with sea turtles and then to visit the mayan ruins. A shuttle picked us up at our hotel lobby and URI was our tour guide. There was about 10-11 people total in the group. Our first stop was to akumal beach to snorkel. We left all of our stuff in the shuttle (the driver stayed with our belongings the entire time- I believe his name was Alex) and geared up as a group. Uri was amazing- made sure we all stuck together and made everyone feel comfortable. He guided us around the water and we were able to catch 3 sea turtles during the 45 minute snorkel. I was expecting to see a little more but I guess it depends on what time of the day you go. After the snorkel they provided us with snacks (bananas, cookies, water) and then we got back in the shuttle to head to the next stop. When we got to the tulum ruins, it was beyond hot. Uri provided everyone with umbrellas and water to keep us as cool as possible. On the ride there, he provided us with a lot of background about the mayan culture and the ruins. He knew his stuff. Extremely knowledgeable. One thing to know about this tour is there is a LOT of walking to the ruins. I would not suggest this to someone who has issues with walking especially in this type of heat. Uri guided us to the ruins and gave us a tour with information for about 35-40 minutes. He then let us walk around and explore for ourselves for about 45 minutes and set up a meeting point which was just enough time to take some pictures and do a little bit of shopping. I only lasted another 10 minutes at the ruins site because of the heat and we had already began heading back to the meeting spot. Once we all got together and got back in the van, they provided us with more water and ice cold towels to cool down. We then took a short drive to place called Akiin Beach in Tulum where they brought us to an outdoor restaurant right on the water and served us the best buffet. After we ate, we were able to sit by the beach for about 20-30 minutes which was absolutely beautiful and very private. That was the end of the excursion and then we all got dropped back off at our resorts. I would HIGHLY recommend this tour to anyone. Uri was amazing but I am sure that all the staff that work for this company are just as great. I felt it was worth every penny. They say its about 5.5 hours but they picked us up around 8am and dropped us back off around 2pm. I enjoyed every second of it! Make sure you pick a nice day since its all outdoors and the rain could kill the stunning views at the ruins."

We were convinced by our Apple representative that Monday would be a fine day to go snorkeling on the catamaran despite our own sound showing storms. We went on the catamaran adventure and were highly disappointed by not only the staff who showed lack of direction in snorkel usage but also paddleboard usage to the point that I do have paddleboard before was caught in the current and one of the staff needed to swim after me. This could've been prevented if one of the staff did not tell me the wrong way to hold the paddle. I will stop here with the negatives of the review because Fernando as the title said is an excellent manager who took care of the situation and provided us with compensation of a speed boat adventure snorkeling in which we saw sea turtles tons of fish and had the quality time snorkeling that we deeply desired. This is a company that takes any problem that is presented seriously and wants to in every and any possible way that they can correct it. I would trust taking this tour and would recommend requesting Jose as your director and guide he is very patient and helpful as well as has a great personality. At the moment the driver of the speedboats name escapes my mind but he did an excellent job as well and I'm sure that if you called and asked for who Jose was working with on April 20 they would be able to tell you. Anyone that is needing more information please feel free to send me questions and I will provide you fair and honest answers. In the meantime if you have any Apple representative at wherever you're staying that doesn't seem to be providing you with the details that you need to take a brochure that is in the blobby that for Cancun adventures call the number and asked to speak to Fernando. He is amazing at what he does and I hope that his boss recognizes his hard work which extended to him coming out to our resort to talk to us because he was concerned about our problems that we had experienced. I felt he took everything extremely seriously and had an amazing personality as a manager and businessman. Fernando I wish you well in your business and thank you so much for caring about our experience"

You sail for about 1 hour to snorkel, AMAZING! WE snorkeled at the reef and saw fish and a large sting ray. The guides swim with you so there is no way to get lost. They have refreshments (alcohol too!) and snacks, music, it's a party! Then you sail for a little bit more and do the standup paddleboarding. One thing I must talk about is about how sick I got on this excursion. I NATURALLY get very motion sick and despite taking one pill I still got VERY SICK. The waters were a little rough that day. Pato and Gerry took very good care of me. They helped me get over the sickness and checked on me every few minutes. My husband was so impressed over how doting Pato was. She is such a sweet girl. Even though I got very motion sick, IT WAS TOTALLY WORTH IT!"

I was pregnant, I was lagging behind because I was out of breath from the sun. He did nothing to accommodate me. Once I tried going snorkelling he told me I almost stepped on a turtle and that I was destroying the coral reef. How was a 5 foot pregnant woman almost step on a turtle in 10 ft water. Overall he was one of the worst tour guides I have ever had. Slept the whole way on the tour in the van and the whole way back. What kind of your guide is that? The whole excursion to the ruins was rushy. The lunch was horrible. For the price I paid I did not enjoy the tour guides terrible attitude. If you are going with IVAN from cancun adventures beware. They clean the van floor with armeral to make the floors shiny I could of got seriously hurt and worse off hurt my baby and all he could say was I signed the waiver.

Fernando and Jerri were very informative about our trip and gave us many good hints about what to expect. We saw two sting rays, which were almost in our face and very friendly, almost like pet dogs. My sister saw a turtle go scooting by. After being in the water for about 30 minutes we scrambled back on board where we refreshed ourselves with drinks. Margaritas, Rum and cokes, water, etc. We travelled back to a quiet lagoon where we dropped the hook and went for a swim. Those wanting to paddle board were able to take advantage of the boards on the boat. Finally, we were offered a light lunch before heading into the dock. Gabriella was the resident photographer and we bought a USB of all the photos she had taken during our adventure. Five stars!"

There were lots of tiny little fish swimming around and the water was so clear. Once we were done at the cenotes, we had a nice little snack of bananas and cookies, they also had a cooler full of water for us to have throughout the day. Then it was off to turtle cove in Akumal! We saw probably 10 big sea turtles along with a variety of fish and coral! The turtles were so amazing to watch and I definitely plan on returning. Once we were done snorkeling it was back to Playa del Carmen for lunch... yummy!! We had a buffet of various tacos, flautas, quesadillas and more. After lunch we had a little time to go to the beach or hit a few shops before heading back to the ferry dock for the return to Cozumel where the Carnival Valor was waiting :-) It was a full day excursion and definitely and awesome day!"

We wanted their trip to be memorable that was filled with culture and not just beach activity. I took the boys snorkeling while my brother went off on a separate boat/dive. I was a bit nervous but the crew made it a fantastic and easy experience. Jose, Pablo, Marlin, Victor, and Gabby all made the trip memorable. To add, my brother's phone took a swim the day before and we lost a great deal of photos. I highly recommend purchasing the photos that the crew takes (bring cash ... you walk away with a filled jump drive) ... they were able to capture so many moments and it made up for the lost photos!!"

This was probably the highlight for me because I love turtles and couldn't believe how close we got to them. From there, we headed off to snorkel through a cenote. This was a really cool experience too and it was neat to see all of the fish and stalactites. They next brought us to this really cool beach club for lunch which had delicious food, a stunning beach, and oddly enough, the most beautiful restrooms! After lunch we headed over to Tulum. Patricia was very knowledgeable as she showed us around, and then gave us some free time to explore. On the drive back to the resort, we started talking about music, and Patricia overheard us talking about the song \"Steal my Sunshine\" by Len. She threw it on to her iPod and we had an awesome sing-a-long! It was the perfect ending to our day.Thanks for the amazing time and all of the great memories!!"

It included a speedboat ride and snorkeling.Of course, we saw a lot of tropical fishes (that\u2019s the point of this tour\u2026). We also saw a huge Manta Ray that swan right beneath us many times (so close that I could have touched it if I wanted too). The only thing we did not see is a turtle. The guide told us there is another tour where you can see a lot of them.The only disappointing thing was the time we actually spent snorkeling. At the hotel, it was advertised as a 2.5 hours tour but we only got about 1.5 hours including the boat ride. So, that\u2019s not a lot of time in the water.If you want more time with the fishes, and if you want to do snorkeling at your own pace, you should probably go to Xelha instead (we did not go to Xelha, but that\u2019s what we were told at the hotel afterward. Next time, that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do). Don\u2019t take me wrong, we still enjoyed the tour, but we wished it wasn\u2019t so brief, especially for the price. "

We (4 in party, plus 3 other couples) were rushed through Tulum; indeed, we had expected ~1.5 hrs at this historic site based upon the reviews and materials provided by the company. We had a guided tour for about 15 minutes and then were given only another 15 minutes to make it back on time to the van. Thirty total minutes does not even yield a flavor of what this site has to offer. Fortunately (note sarcasm), we had ample time (90 minutes) to travel and enjoy (again, sarcasm) a sub-par lunch (limited selections, mediocre taste). It isn't clear why they do not just drop the unnecessary lunch and give more time for snorkeling and/or Tulum. Very disappointed. We have contacted the company and have not heard back from them (perhaps not surprisingly). We suggest exploring other options."

We spent all day Thursday with Vincent (tour guide) and Antonio (driver) and 5 other strangers who quickly became friends! This was our 2nd tour with Vincent- we loved him so much when he took us to snorkle with the sea turtles a year and a half ago that we requested him when we booked our excursion this time around. We were so thankful to get to spend another day having fun and learning from him!The van picked us up on time at our hotel and stopped quickly to pick up the others nearby, and then we were off to the caves. The first cave was a dry one, and Vincent explained to us how the stalagmites and stalactites were formed. Fascinating, even to our teenage boys (ages 13 and 15). They hung onto every word Vincent said!Then we entered the flooded caves, and got to swim through the most beautiful and scenic caves. There were 4 of them. In some spots, you were literally swimming... then you'd get to spots were you walked and the water was only inches deep. We wore life jackets and helmets with lamps on them and felt very safe the entire time. Next, Antonio drove us to a cenote (an open cave with water at the bottom) and we saw that people were jumping from the cliff into the water that was crystal clear and about 10 feet deep. Our boys loved this and did it 3 or 4 times each!After the cenote, we went to the Tulum ruins, and learned a tremendous amount about the Mayan lifestyle and culture from Vincent as he walked us around. As a sidenote- it was VERY hot outside, but Vincent kept us cool by giving us all umbrellas to shield us from the sun, and bottles of ice cold water to carry with us. When we returned to the van, he and Antonio gave us all ice cold washcloths to wipe down our faces and cool off with. It was such a pleasant and delightful surprise!Finally, we ended up at a Mexican beach-side restaurant in Tulum. It was just okay- not as great as La Buena Vida where we got to go the last time. I'm hoping that Cancun Adventures changes their itinerary to go back to La Buena Vida-- we loved that place!This is our second time being extremely impressed with Vincent and Cancun Adventures. The van is comfortable, and the tour is extremely professional. Even our kids were impressed with how organized it was, compared with other tours we have taken at other vacation destinations. I loved how Vincent and Antonio were always at the side of the van to help us in and out, every single time we entered or exited. Very courteous and kind. We can't say enough great things about Vincent, Antonio, and Cancun Adventures. We made memories on this trip that will for sure last a lifetime!! Thank you, thank you, thank you!"

What fun! We then had a great lunch at a beach club, good food. Through out the entire adventure, our guide stayed with us and we felt we got to know her very well. Only issue was that part of the group had never been swimming before. Pato handled the situation very well but for those who do not know how to swim, this isn't for you. Just do Tulum and leave the snorkling to those who can swim. Note: it is hot at Tulum, go early. Thank you, Pato, for a great day."

We booked an exucrsion out of our hotel to visit Tulum, Cenotes, Akumal and have a beach lunch. We were a group of 9- 7 adults and 2 kids aged 12 & 10. We were picked up at 8:30, right on time and were greeted by our guide Fernando and driver Joaquin. These two men were the epiotme of professionalism! As we drove to Tulum, Fernando gave us a explaination of how the day was planned, what to expect and then history of the Mayans and the region.We arrived in Tulum and it was hot! Joaquin handed each person a bottle of cold water and Fernando offered umbrellas for anyone who wanted shade. We felt very comfortable leaving our belongings on the van with Jaoquin. We were guided through Tulum for about 30 minutes with Fernando answering our questions and giving us a ton of information along the way. We were then given another 30-40 minutes to wander ourselves. Once we met back at the van, Joaquin offered us commercially packaged cookies, bananas and cold, damp hand towels. What a nice unexpected perk! We drove the the Cenotes, natural sinkholes/caves for snorkelling. We were given life vests, snorkel equipment, well delivered instructions and Fernando was our guide in the water. Our 12 year old son is not comfortable in the water so I assumed that I would be swimming with him. Fernando took him with a float and was incredibly patient and calming to our nervous kid. It was over and above 'service', Fernando truly cared about our son having a good experience. The Cenotes were incredible! The water was cold, but the stagmalites and stalactites were breathtaking! This part of the tour was about 45 minutes.We then drove to Akumal for a different snorkelling experience. Akumal's famous for sea turtles and sting rays. Again, Fernando gave us equipment (and flippers this time), we had a local guide in the water making sure we were respectful to the sea turtle's habitat. Fernando took our son again and built his confidence up so much that he was able to swim on his own! We saw many turtles, fish and rays in clear warm water. Again this was about 45 minutes. Our last stop was at Cancun Adventures' beach for an authentic Mexican lunch on the beach. The food and service were wonderful! Joaquin and Fernando drove us back to our resort by about 3:30pm. It was a full day of life changing experiences! We ranged in ages from early 50s down to 10 and everyone had an amazing day. Our daughter is a strong swimmer and loved every second of the day, she was able to do a little exploring and we were never concerned about her safety. We all would highly recommend Cancun Adventures and if possible to request Fernando and Joaquin. There are a few things to note that weren't in the brochure- wear comfortable shoes for Tulum and bring sandals/flip flops for the snorkelling. We only had shoes and it would have been easier with sandals, but not crucial. Photographs can't be taken at the Cenotes and Akumal unless you have an underwater camera or Go Pro. At Akumal you can not use regular sunscreen, the chemicals effect the health of the sea turtles, you need to wear biodegradable sunscreen or swim shirts. Other than that- it was an incredible day!Thank you for an excursion that we all will never forget."

Our tour guide said we would do Akumal first. We had two young girls with us and the tour guide was very helpful with them. He gave them a buoy and stayed by their side while they attempted to snorkel.Next we went to the ruins at Tulum. Our tour guide only pointed out and spoke about three different structures while there. That part probably took less than 30 minutes. He then proceeded to tell us that we had 20 minutes on our own and to meet back at our meeting spot (one of the gift shops). Since it took about 10-15 minutes to walk from the ruins to the gift shop, in actuality we only had 10 minutes of our own time to explore the rest of the ruins. Seeing the ruins and getting a guided tour of them was the main reason we booked this tour. We hardly had any time to see the ruins and read about them.After the ruins, we had lunch at the private beach club. What a waste of time. We spent an hour plus traveling to the private beach club, eating the buffet (the food at our hotel was much better) and 15 minutes on the beach. We spent more time for that lunch than at the ruins.In retrospect, we should not have booked this tour and just gone to the ruins on our own. At least, we would have been able to spend more time at the ruins, have time to read the signage and learn just as much about the ruins."

When we arrived in Tulum, we parked and were met by our tour guide Ada. She was probably one of the top two or three tour guides I have had around the world. The tour provided large umbrellas for shade and admission tickets. You bypass the line that stretched for over 100 feet to purchase tickets and enter the site. Our guide was very knowledgeable of Mayan culture and answered a lot of questions. The guided tour lasts around 1 hour and then you have 1 hour to roam the site and take pictures. We did not swim while we were there but the beach looked amazing!!! We walked back to our rally point; you can also take a shuttle that cost $2 USD. The meet up point is in a little village that has local handmade items, stores and a Subway if you really need that to eat. We were there the third week of March and it is hot, once in the site there is little shade offered. Bring a bag with drinks.I would like to return to Tulum our next visit when the children are older. They enjoyed it, but the heat started to get to them.Great tour operator, driver and guide Ada.

The driver picked us up the hotel on time and took us to the speedboat where we met Davy, Victor and Roberto. Roberto was our guide and his English was perfect. He explained about the area very concisely and with a love of the area that was infectious. He loves what he does and it shows. We went to the reef where he explained exactly what we would be doing and made us feel safe. The day was beautiful and there was lots to see. We had a ray swim with us for almost the whole time which was really cool. There was lots of fish swimming with us and lots to see. The one or two times he thought we might need help he was right there, although we are all strong swimmers and were fine. It's a quick excursion. We left the hotel at 730 and were back shortly after 11. I would recommend this excursion to anyone. Just make sure you can swim as it gets a little tiring even for strong swimmers."

This was a morning adventure that took us by speedboat to a quaint reef along side a white sandy beach. We were so lucky as we were the only 2 that were on the boat! Our snorkelling guide Patricia took my boyfriend & I all around the reef pointing out unbelievable colorful fish, a sea turtle and a stingray! Patricia is at peace with the marine life and they loved her! She took incredible pictures with her underwater camera. An experience I would do again for sure! Thank you!"

The staff was very friendly and interactive with the group (our group had Vincent, who was an excellent tour guide who made sure the group was having a great time). The visit to the Tulum is beautiful and a must see. At Playa de Carmen, swimming with sea turtles was an amazing experience - they were so close and the coral reefs were beautiful! To wrap up the afternoon, you go to another beach close by for lunch. The food is alright, but the beach is absolutely beautiful with blue water and swings/beach chairs. Canc\u00fan Adventures gave our family an amazing time and was our favorite part of our vacation!"

Jorge was very patient, professional, concerned about everyone's well being and, at the same time, providing us with a unique snorkelling experience in a cenote and also in the beautiful Yal Ku lagoon. The tour lasted 31/2 hours. We were taken in two vans to the cenote site and given very clear instructions on how to use the snorkel masks. The provided equipment was in excellent shape. I recommend bringing water shoes. I brought my camera and the van driver, Rene, used it to take lots of photos of us, which I would have not been able to do. I would certainly go on another excursion with this company, not to be confused with Cancun Adventure."

He was very attentive, had a great personality and makes sure everyone is comfortable and having a great experience. The agent we booked our trip through failed to mention we would need to bring towels from our resort to use after snorkeling. Thankfully a nice family from PA had an extra towel and let us use it.

Our guide, Jorge, was an excellent, knowledgeable guide who made our fun his priority. He was concerned with our safely when swimming and waited patiently for those of us with children. My advice for those with children would have been to take the tram/bus at the Tulum Ruins \u2013 after a day of turtles and cenotes, the long, hot walk to the ruins wore us out before we even began the tour of the ruins. At only 20 pesos per person it would have been worth it.I took my 6 year old son on this tour and in hindsite it was a bit much for him (even tho he's a strong swimmer) it was totally fine for my 10 year old daughter. I would recommend it for 10 years and up.I wish the tour company at a the hotel would have recognized this tour as being a bit difficult for younger kids."

One reef snorkeling trip had to be cancelled because of high winds, but our guide Jose and driver Carlos took the two of us on a substitute snorkeling trip to the Dos Ojos Cenote. Their personal care and attention made for an exceptional half-day. A couple of days later, we went on the Tulum Akumal tour with guide Crystal and driver Roberto. The day included a tour of the Mayan ruins, Dos Ojos Cenotes again, and then snorkeling over the turtle breeding grounds and out to the nearby reef before a lovely lunch at a nearby secluded resort beach. This tour was the highlight of our trip with Crystal providing knowledgeable information plus expert water skills to show us the cenote features and wonderful fish. The staff were also great on the catamaran sailing earlier in the week. Our experience with Cancun Adventures was excellent - personable, professional guides and staff, interesting venues, and good food. We would highly recommend them. Carolyn E."

We were picked up at our hotel and taken to the dock at Puerto Aventuras. I was worried that I would get sea sick. The staff (Sergio, Pedro, etc.) was very attentive and gave me great tips to avoid sea sickness. They even let me sit with the captain. Once we got to the reef, we were given snorkel gear and jumped in. Several crew members go into the water with you. They work hard to make sure you see a lot. Not only did we see amazing tropical fish, but we saw an eel, crab, and sea turtle! On the trip home we were given a lunch and unlimited beverages. They also provide a photographer who takes LOTS of pictures. You have the option of purchasing the pictures on a jump drive for $40 USD."

To our surprise transportation arrived on time \u2013 with our driver Alex and tour guide Sebastian. During the ride to pick up other guests and to the first stop \u2013 the Cenote \u2013 Sebastian was a world of information. He was very knowledgeable about the area history and answered all of our questions with confidence. The Cenote entrance was intimidating, but his calm composure kept a few of us reassured we were safe. The swim in the cave was amazing to see the formations caused by water drops over the years. Bats were in the cave, but thankfully did not interact with us at all. This is a must do if you have the opportunity. Next stop was the Tulum Ruins. It was bit of a walk \u2013 we recommend travel light, with lots of water and enjoy the setting. Sebastian was very knowledgeable on the history of the Ruins, including the Mayan culture and the surrounding areas. There was an opportunity to explore the ruins on our own before meeting up with the group. The local shops had plenty to offer. The day of our tour was very hot, Alex \u2013 our driver \u2013 had the van with the air conditioner running and welcomed us back with a ice cold cloth to help cool us down \u2013 what an unexpected, but much appreciated surprise. The last place of our tour was a lunch in a beach side restaurant. A cold beverage and hot buffer was offered \u2013 a nice way to end the excursion. During the trip back to our hotels, Sebastian and Alex continued to converse with all of us, ensuring we were entertained to the end. We highly recommend this tour, and hopefully you are lucky to spend the day with Sebastian and Alex \u2013 they made the day very enjoyable. Thank you guys!"

Alex, the Captain, and staff did everything they could to make this a good experience. Secondly, snorkeling was cancelled due to weather. Not under their control.I know what amazing service on a catamaran at this price feels like and this definitely wasn't it. The drinks were alright. Not bad. The food was terrible. And I'm a easy going person, I can eat anything. This was terrible. I mean, the pasta was VERY dry, several people ate the sandwich (mostly bread, nothing in it almost) and were asking \"what is this?\" (I still don't know....) and well... let's just say my wife and I took a couple bites. Thats it. They also serve you at like 3pm when you've been out since 11am. But yeah, oh, and they give you 1 tray of food for 2 people. Its not much food to begin with. But we wouldn't have eaten more anyway.Isla Mujeres was extremely boring. Glad we had money to spend or it would've been a complete bust. One person on this tour told us as we waited for the boat to come back, the tour guide said, \"did you have a good time?\" She said sarcastically, \"yes... [then whispered to us] on this island with nothing to do.\" Pretty much a shared view. Isla mujeres is another tourist trap with little to do and very pushy sellers.So the food can improve. The tour destination is horrible. Can't comment on snorkeling since it got cancelled AFTER we arrived with no refund available and unable to reschedule for another date (due to trip length). I'm mixed on this review. They were nice people. But the thing your paying for, the tour, was far below expectations and I'd never recommend this tour based on our experience.I wanted to give a good review before taking this trip. I still want to give some credit. But there was hardly anything good to comment on except the staff were 'nice'. And they truly were, and they wanted to show us a good time. Just, even the boat tour to the island was unentertaining. We've previously had guides talk to us about the area or turn music on and get excited and take our pictures on the boat. The truth is: we generally have a very good time on these types of trips. It wasn't just the snorkeling; this was a complete waste of a day. And I regret spending it on this tour. The catamaran is pretty small as well but I don't know if you'll find a better one (maybe Catamaya? That looked like a nice tour.)"

Esteban, our driver and Crystal our guide, promptly picked us up at our hotel and professionally drove us to Akumal, with only one other stop to pick up additional passengers. Clear snorkeling instructions were given on the way for the novice snorkelers.The snorkeling was incredible. We saw at least 10 turtles, one stingray, hundreds of a wide variety of fish and a beautiful coral reef. Crystal and her assistant Sarah (she was added when we arrived) were very patient and accommodating during the unhurried event, even loaning their own special mask to one person who was having problems. It was a lifetime experience! Snacks and water were provided after snorkeling. The changing rooms at Akumal were backed up and we did not bring towels and none were provided so we had a wet somewhat uncomfortable 30 minute ride down to Tulum. Clearer instructions could have been provided at time of booking to avoid not having towels.Arriving in Tulum we were given a few minutes to change and put ourselves together before making the short walk to the ruins entrance. The gift shop there also offered snacks and beverages for sale. Umbrellas were offered for relief from the sun during the tour. Crystal again was very knowledgeable and we were very satisfied with the tour of the ruins, being allowed some 20 minutes of free time to explore on our own and take in breathtaking ocean views.Cold face towels were offered by Esteban to cheers from everyone after the sun drenched ruins tour.Lunch was offered at a beach restaurant after a longish ride into Tulum. The beach buffet was adequate but not outstanding and consisted of Mexican style, rice beans, fish chicken, tortillas guacamole, salad, etc. The buffet looked picked over by the time we arrived and not freshly stocked. A small (8 ounces) single beer was included and the price for extras were too high. The beach that we had a few extra minutes to visit was amazing.Overall this tour was a great experience for our family of 5. Though not cheap, it was worth every penny and our driver Esteban and guide Crystal, were excellent and extremely professional. The lunch was a bit of a let down but it wasn't the selling point of taking the trip."

Sergio locked all of our valuables and watched over all of our belongings while we were busy. We valued this security very much as other tourists reported their things being stolen.

We were not able to snorkel at turtle bay due to high winds and rough waters on the day, however, Alina took us to a beautiful water inlet to snorkel and view colorful fishes, which made up for it. Alina was so knowledgeable about each site. She took the time to explain the history and culture of the site and and answered any questions we had! The swimming was easy as we had life jackets and only swam for about one hour at a time. Alina also included an extra visit to beautiful open cenote filled with growing lily pads since we had a few extra hours before our cruise ship departed. That was probably the highlight of my day! Our driver Diego was really helpful-- he helped watch my camera while we snorkeled. I would highly recommend both Alina and Diego! Can't wait to be back for another trip!"

We headed for Tulum in a very nice, air conditioned van that was very comfortable. We were taken to a meeting point and met with our tour guide, Alina. We were given time for refreshments before heading to Tulum. When we arrived at Tulum Ruins, Alina was very informatiive and extremely knowledgeable in explaining the site. It was also very impressive that she was able to speak several different languages so that everyone on the tour was able to participate. I would highly recommend that anyone interested in visiting the ruins should book their trip with Cancun Adventures and hope that you have the opportunity to have Alina as your guide. THANK YOU ALINA."

We were given the opportunity to book on another day or we could continue with the catamaran ride sans snorkeling. The crew (Pablo, the Mexican Wolverine, Gabriella, Sergio, Carlos) made the trip awesome. The seas were pretty high and a bit rough but they kept us laughing and having a good time.

We started our day by visiting the Mayan ruins of Tulum, after this one was recommended by a local who had visited all of them. He told us to go to this one because of its large size and amount to see, as well as its being genuine (albeit touched up). Next we went to Turtle Bay were we were able to snorkel with the sea turtles for 50 minutes (which felt like 15!) We finished with a mid-afternoon meal at a local wedding venue, which was excellent.Michelle was very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about Tulum, and did very well keeping our group together with the sea turtles. My only complaint is that after asking for our contact information in case we lost anything, a member of our group forgot a shirt she bought her son in the van and it got thrown out. Our own fault though!Overall would recommend these excursions and hope to be able to visit the rest of the Mayan sites sometime in the future."

I shouldn't be saying this but the trip was probably worth twice as much. The price included transportation from the hotel to the dock in Cancun where we were by Ever, our host for the trip on the catamaran to Isla Mujeris. Along the way we stopped to snorkel. I have snorkeled many times before but this time the ocean seemed to be rougher that I could handle at the time and Ever had to come to my rescue. Having said that no one else had any trouble. After snorkeling we traveled on to the island. We had about three hours of spare time, so we rented one of the golf carts that you see all over the island. There are many rental places available so you can shop around. We travelled up to the lighthouse for a spectacular view. We had plenty of time to go completely around the island and felt very comfortable and safe. When we got back to the catamaran for the return trip, we went a short distance for a swim in shallow water not far from the public beach. We were served a light lunch on board. If you have a big appetite, I would recommend a lunch on the island because the lunch was indeed light. Drinks were included coming and going and there was no limit and I don't know of anyone who ordered something that they didn't have or could not prepare. On the way back, the captain, Pedro, took lots of time with a couple of us to tell of his training in San Francisco, then hauled up the sails and gave us a tutorial on sailing. Also on the crew (not sure of names) were: Jorge, Abram and Jared. EVERYONE on the crew was pleasant and made sure our experience was enjoyable. I cannot recommend Cancun Adventures too highly. This was a very, very worthwhile side trip."

Our tour guide Michelle and driver Roberto went above and beyond to make the whole trip enjoyable for everyone. The Adventures group of companies is for sure one of the best tour companies in Mexico.

During my recent trip to the Mayan Riviera, I booked a day trip with Cancun Adventures to visit the ruins at Tulum followed by a trip to Akumel to snorkel with sea turtles. Our friendly and professional driver Roberto arrived to pick me up right on time, and got us to our destinations safely. Our guide, Michelle, was energetic, engaging, and best of all, very informative. She provided us with very interesting facts and stories about some of the local flora and fauna and once inside the ruins at Tulum, painted a vivid picture of what life was like for the ancient Mayans who lived there. I enjoyed having the significance of all the different structures and areas explained quite thoroughly, yet always with an engaging sense of humour. Once we were done there, we were then taken a short distance to the beach at Akumel, where we were outfitted with quality snorkeling equipment and led out to the reef, where, as promised, we were able to see up close many sea turtles, as well as rays and innumerable other types of fish, plants and coral. Having finished our swim, we were then taken to a nearby seaside cantina for a nice meal and a few drinks and then delivered back to our hotels safe, sound and satisfied. This was a great trip for anybody with a family that wants to see some of the Riviera's ancient ruins and vibrant sea life, no matter your snorkeling ability. Our guide and driver were wonderful, and the experience was everything it was promised to be. Easily some of the highlights of my trip."

We left our hotel at 7:40 am for a quick 15 min. shuttle to the dock in Puerto Adventura. Here we met up with the other 30 people that would join our excursion. We had such a great time sailing on the catamaran and riding the waves and enjoying the open bar that is included. We went for a 45 minute ride until we reached Inah reef. This was a great spot to dropped anchor, take a quick snorkeling lesson and then get outfitted with snorkeling gear. This was our first time snorkeling and the crew helped us each step of the way. What a beautiful place to snorkel. We were in about 6-8 feet of water and saw sting rays, sea turtles and hundreds of colorful, tropical fish. The reef itself was beautiful and full of life. I need to mention that our crew was incredible. They kept us safe, but they were really loose and made the experience enjoyable. Thanks to our crew - Gerry, Vincent, Davey, Richard and June as our photographer. A special shout out to Vincent for his snorkeling assist to my wife. After an hour of snorkeling, we headed back on the water for a 40 minute sail while were served a nice boxed lunch. Then we anchored again, this time in a sheltered bay for some paddle boarding, swimming and jumping from the boat. What a fun spot to play and enjoy the water.

The first adventure was visiting the Mayan Ruins of Tulum that then followed up with snorkeling, zip lining, and propelling with a very knowledgeable and patient tour guide, Riaz Escobedo. Secord adventure was with Pato, Peyui, Richard, Gerry, and Aline on a catamaran, paddleboarding, snorkeling, and lunch. The crewmembers were all so helpful and extremely friendly. Would highly this group."

Cancun Adventures was very accommodating on switching the day of our excursion, and picked us up at the Excellence Riviera Resort. Due to the weather reports, only about a half of the people who signed up, showed up, so it was like a personal cruise, with a huge catamaran and only 11 people. The entire crew was fantastic. Made it lots of fun. The highlight was the photos taken both on the boat and in the water. They were available on a usb as we debarked. Also, kudos to their customer service. I lost my usb, and they were very helpful in getting me a link to retrieve the photos. A great time."

Cancun that is located in M\u00e9xico, is my favorite place to go on vacation because of the weather that is so warm and can find anything you're looking for,If you want, Cancun could be a tranquil place because you could stay all the day at the Beach and admire the beautiful sand or If you want you could visit some relaxing places like \"Xcaret\" or \"Xel-ha\" for me the best way to relax is doing what makes you happy, so in here you could find anything to relax like fishing in \"Aqua Wordl\", acuatic sports like wakeboard or jetpack, swimming with dolphins in \"Delphinus Dreams\" some of these activities are quite expensive.Algo If you are some one who likes hanging out with friends and meet people, this place has one of the best baches in M\u00e9xico to hang out.The best sea son is on hola week because of the Spring Break."

Could not have possibly been any happier with the crew of Alex, George, Merlin and Darwin. The crew was fun, they got us excited for the trip and were extremely accommodating through out the entire trip. At first my girlfriend was a little apprehensive about snorkeling as she has never showed an interest in it (I am SCUBA certified and dragged her on the trip!) but Alex, the lead guide, was so passionate and knowledgable about the ocean that after a few stories and a few lessons from him she could not wait to get in the water and now after this trip has enrolled in SCUBA classes for the spring. The crew that we had this day were all absolutely terrific, they were having so much run that it clearly rubbed off on the passengers and within minutes we all were having a blast. We enjoyed this trip so much that we actually considered booking it for a second day! Overall, its a must do."

Loved the small group, I really hope it stays that way, really felt like you had your own tour guide. The second thing I loved was you got variety- I didn't have to pick either the beach or cenotes while in port, I got both. Really made me feel like I got to do a lot. The bay of Akumal was gorgeous. The cenotes were neat, my favorite part was watching the divers go by and light up the entire cave. Went back to Playa Del Carmen for a beach buffet which was actually really good, impressed with the lunch. You also got 2 drinks alcoholic or soda/punch. Great day! Would recommend for a port day. Our whole group loved it! Best excursion of the trip. Fernando was our guide and Raul was our driver, they were both fantastic."

Captain Sergio, Ever, and the rest of the crew were great!Very attentive; Delicious lunch; Good selection of music; Great sailing by the captain in rough waters. Both fun and relaxing. Beautiful experience, we felt like we were the only boat in the ocean.I hope the company recognizes these wonderful employees!"

            "review": "Great Experience!. We did the Tulum Half-Day trip of the Mayan Ruins, it was well worth it the time. The ruins themselves were amazing as you stand where the Mayans worshipped, worked, lived, and conducted business so many centuries ago. The view of the accessible beach below the ruins is beautiful and beach itself is small, but nice. Also watch for the true inhabitants of Tulum basking in the shade or hanging out of windows--the iguanas, they are all over the grounds!Although the buildings themselves are too fragile for foot traffic, you can get close enough to admire the art and architecture unless of course you pull a \"Bieber!\" You can walk the grounds on your own as there are informational signs scattered throughout, but we strongly encourage you do the tour guide package. Our tour guide was Mary (originally from Holland) who did a wonderful job both on the drive to Tulum and on the grounds. She was so informative giving great insight and history, the trip definitely would not have been the same without her. Also our driver Abi was a great host taking great care of us. The visit to Tulum in itself would get a 4 star ranking, but Mary/Abi made it a 5 star adventure.A couple of tips: dress lightly as it is very hot/humid on the grounds, have plenty of water to drink, wear good shoes and a hat. Our tour package included unlimited water and snacks plus umbrellas for shade, but if you are on your own be prepared.History buff or not, this trip is worth the adventure plus the Tulum market place is a nice spot for some good shopping."

We had a great time on our tour that we had set up through our Carnival cruise a couple of weeks ago, and thanks to what we heard about other attractions in the area from our guide, Pepe, we are already planning a trip back to Riviera Maya to take part in Cancun Adventures' whale shark snorkel! Can't wait to come back!!We had an excellent time on the Turtle Cove and Cavern Snorkel Adventure, thanks in big part to our awesome guide Pepe and driver/guide Canelo!! It was an overcast/rainy/windy day so we were worried our tour might be affected, but it turned out to be an amazing experience every step of the way. First we got in the van and headed to the cenotes, which were stunning. There were only 6 people on the tour, so we got great personalized attention and Pepe was so very knowledgeable about everything relating to the tour. When we arrived to the cenotes, we got geared up and headed down to the first one. As we were about to go in the water, my husband realized he\u2019d left the camera in the van. He was about to head back for it when Canelo showed up, camera in hand! He had seen it left in the van and figured we might want it \uf04a We couldn\u2019t have asked for better guides. Being able to snorkel around in the cenotes was amazing, and Pepe was giving us great information the whole time. After that, we headed to Akumal Bay. Even with it being a bit windy and rainy, the snorkeling experience was great. We even had a first-time snorkeler and he was able to really enjoy the experience with Pepe and Canelo looking out for him. We saw so many turtles; it was amazing to be able to be so close to them and watch them in their natural environment. We even saw a stingray! We finished the trip with an amazing lunch of wonderful authentic food at Wah-Wah\u2019s on the beach, then headed back. This was a fantastic experience from start to finish, and Pepe and Canelo made the day even better than we could have imagined it would turn out to be!"

Our guide Sophie was the first ingredient to our amazing day of cenotes, rappelling and snorkeling with a huge amount of amazing history from the region.Traveling to the cenote is a bit of a drive but it is filled with information and views of the country you would not normally get to see which made the drive well worth it.Each attraction out did the last, the cenote and rappelling into the water is highly recommended, followed by snorkeling in a cenote and watching divers entering underground rivers and caves! WOW we then snorkeled in a lagoon near Akumal, a really great day!"

We were picked up promptly at our hotel at 7:00 am and met our tour guide Edith. She was so knowledgeable, kind, and funny. She definitely enhanced our trip and made me want to write this review. We saw a lot of sea turtles and learned a lot about the Mayan culture. We saw the ruins and discovered how to use Mayan math. Honestly, she was the highlight of the tour. I would highly recommend booking with this company and recommending her.

We were picked up at our resort in a newer van and we proceeded to Tulum, stopping at 2 other resorts along the way to fill the seats. Our guide was Uri, and he was very personable and knowledgeable about the history and culture of the Mayan people. He was also fluent in Spanish, English, French and Russian. We had French speaking tourists in our group and he was able to make their tour all the better by conversing in their native language. We spent about 1.5 hours in Tulum and had plenty of time to view the ruins and a bit of time to wander the small market there. We next visited some cenotes for snorkelling. It was very enjoyable, although you are required to wear a life jacket regardless of your swimming ability. Again, Uri was an excellent guide, being very careful about everyone's safety. The cenotes were beautiful and it was a great experience to swim them.We then boarded the van and travelled to Akumal to snorkel and view the sea turtles. This was also a great experience, with many turtles seen, a few stingrays and many fish. We were required to wear our life jackets again, and after such a long swim I did end up with some abrasions where the jacket rubbed, but I do understand why they are necessary on such a tour. One beef I did have was that there were no showers available upon exiting the ocean to rinse off the salt water. Most of us had worn our swimsuits and sitting wet in them wasn't comfortable.We then went for a late lunch to a small beach club at a beach I'm not sure the name of. It was a fairly rustic club but the food provided was nice authentic Mexican fare, and we were given tickets for 2 drinks each. Not sure, but if you hadn't had Dukoral before you came to Mexico, you may want skip the provided buffet as this was definitely not resort food. I ate it without any after-effects though, and I enjoyed the rustic atmosphere of the place.All-in-all we all had a great time and the other couples we met in our group were great fun."

Even when making confirmations/changes 24 hours before, the customer service team was excellent and prompt at providing updates and notifications. Pick up was bright and early but very prompt - the minivan was clean and snacks were provided after the swim (banana, cookies, water).Since we got to the Dos Ojos cenote really early, we had both caves to ourselves for 30 minutes before other tourists started coming around. Thanks to the driver for getting us there early and ensuring this to happen. Could have spent more time at each cenote, particularly the Dos Ojos cenote which was beautiful!"

The mayan ruins tour was very enjoyable and Yolo was very informative....she gave you the highlights and didn't bore you. We were given a little time to browse the shop. After that we went snorkeling with sea turtles off the beach. We saw plenty of very large sea turtles, a sting ray, and a few fish. One reason I gave 4/5 rating is because there was a coral reef about 10 feet from where we were snorkeling and she didn't take us over there. My husband had followed the sting ray over and came upon the reef and said it was amazing. Not sure if it's company policy to stick to the turtles or not. Lunch afterward at the Blue Venado was not very good and the road there was extremely bumpy (they called it a mayan massage haha), but the setting was stunning. Wooden swings at the bar, beautiful beach. It's something I would definitely do if you're in the area."

We docked in Cozumel and ferried over to the mainland where we were greeted by the guides waiting for us on the dock. We were randomly assigned Michelle...lucky us. The groups are kept small, there were only 9 in our group. We boarded a CLEAN van and set off for our adventure. After introductions Michelle gave us an overview of what we would see and do and also gave us the option of shopping or visiting an additional cenote...we unanimously chose the cenote. First stop was Turtle Bay Resort...apparently the turtles like to swim and frolic early in the day. We weren't disappointed. We now have video of us swimming/snorkeling with the turtles. Other tours have promised turtles but we've never seen them until this tour. From Turtle Bay it was a short drive to the first of three cenotes we would swim and snorkel at. Throughout the tour Michelle enthusiastically shared the local history and educated us about the cenotes, their importance and what is being done to preserve them. She also shared stories about the Mayan culture and history. The turtle experience itself would have been great and wonderful by itself but the cenotes are unbelievably beautiful. The water is clean and clear and the stalagmites and stalagtites are amazing. After swimming the cenotes we headed back to town where we were treated to a Mexican lunch buffet and margarita's at a local restaurant. After lunch we were driven back to the dock to catch the ferry back to Cozumel...tired but full of tacos and memories of an experience not to be missed. Remember that part about the van being clean? We trashed it...sorry. We've been on many a shore excursion and toured cenotes before but this was by far the best! Thanks Michelle!!!!!"

Jorge gave us the hand signals to use \"in case\" we saw a turtle or a ray. In case? We saw probably 10-15 turtles and about 5 rays - all within about an hour. We carried onto lunch (and saw a crocodile from the safety of the bus), and had an awesome meal. We returned to our resort with our bellies full and great memories of an incredible day.

Abi was a good driver and kept the van very clean. Tulum was very cool. Gus gave us a good history lesson of the Mayans and then let us explore the ruins ourselves. Then onto to the sea turtles snorkeling adventure. This was the highlight of our excursion. You go to a protected national park. There are tons of sea turtles to. Gus also took us out to the reef to see the colorful fish and corals. We then went for lunch at a nice little beach restaurant in the heart of the mayan. The chicken tacos were amazing! !Overall this was a great experience they provide water and snacks through out the day so you're never hungry or thirsty. Bring your own towel, change into your bathing suit ahead of time as the change rooms at Akumal aren't the greatest. One thing that I would change is an earlier departure time and therefore an earlier return time. "

Alex was so patient and helpful, reminded us we needed towels on this excursion! We started out touring the Cavern, we swam through the caves...wet suit and life vest recommended!! Alex explains the history and science behind the formation of the beautiful stalactites and stalagmites! He also had a go pro and took pictures of all the couples and promised to email them to us.Then Nestor drove us to the Tulum ruins, where Alex once again reviewed the Mayan history! We ended the day at a local beach front property and had authentic mexican food for a late lunch.A fun day, not too long! Alex was an excellent tour guide!!"

We did a 4 hour trip which included snorkelling and paddle boarding as well as a lovely lunch and great drinks and music on the boat. The staff on the boat were what made it really special though. Gabi, Sergio and Alex were fantastic. They made us feel so welcome on the trip and made sure everyone was enjoying themselves all of the time. We have never been on a better or more fun trip. I would recommend this excursion to anyone. We snorkelled with the sea turtles and they were gorgeous. Sergio, Gabi and Alex made sure that everyone got to see them and Gabi took some amazing underwater pictures which we would not have been able to take ourselves.We have such great memories of this trip and also some great photos as a keepsake. I would recommend anyone who goes on this excursion does get the photos as Gabi is brilliant and she takes some excellent shots. From the minute we stepped on to the boat to the minute we got off we had the best time."

Our Tour Guide was Edith and her assistant was Charly. Charly was available to transport us safely to our destinations, assist us in preparing for the adventures, and providing us with snacks and water; he always demonstrated great respect and courtesy to the participants. Because of Edith's passion for the Mayan history and culture, our tour of Tulum was exceptional. She was able to provide us with so much insight and information regarding the Mayan Culture and Architecture that it made the tour so much more interesting. In addition, our snorkeling adventure with the turtles exceeded all expectations. Edith assured that all participants were safe at all times and was continuously asking whether everyone in our group was fine and were we enjoying ourselves. Even though we have limited swimming abilities, Edith assured that we were able to fully participate in the adventure. Thanks to Edith, we had a great and memorable time. It is people, like Edith that assure that companies like Cancun Adventures continue to provide top quality services. We greatly appreciate all the time and effort Edith and Charly gave us while on this adventure. I hope that somehow, someone can convey our gratitude to Edith. Thank You.Jose and AmeliaColorado "

She was very attentive to not only us as customers but assured that we all were mindful of the regulations while in the water with the turtles and other sea life. She is a perfect example of professionalism within that field and is most certainly a role model for us guides. We had an awesome time and would definitely do it again!"

At Tulum, Alex took us to interesting locations and gave what I thought to be interesting and helpful insights into what the city would have been like. Alex has a lot of passion for his country and the different cultures and was passionate to share with us. Tulum was packed with visitors, but he led us through to quiet places to make the most of the visit. Lunch was great and all the logistics were easy. Great playlists for the ride!

After a few more hotel pickups we drove to Tulum. On the way we picked up our guide (Hector) who was excellent. Hector was very knowledgable giving us a great tour of Tulum and some free time. After that we were driven to the underground swim spot. As it turned out, my friend and I were the only ones opting for this part of the tour so it ended up being a very VIP experience. Adrian and Hector went with us into the caves which were amazing and the highlight of our Mexico trip. As we were only a few, we could go places in the caves that larger groups couldn't. After that was lunch which was delicious and included two beers. Highly recommend this tour. We wish we booked our other Mexican day trips through them. Mucho Gracias Hector and Adrian!

The water was murky and cold. They wouldn't cancel or reschedule.When you pay $500 for your family to ride a catamaran and snorkel, you expect to get to enjoy at least some part of it. But when 15 of the 20 people on the boat are vomiting over the side of the boat because the water is so rough, you wonder why they took you at all. For those that weren't sick, they attempted to snorkel but the waves and wind made the water murky and you couldn't see six inches below you. You couldn't use the SUP except to hold on to for dear life at the reef for a much needed escape from the boat.I'm sure this is a lovely excursion on a clear day, but after this experience I can clearly see its all about the money. The trip should have been canceled. No one had a good experience. No one will ever use them again. It was a complete waste of $500 and 6 hours of my life. I'll never use this company again and I'd recommend you not either. I'm ok with snorkeling in the rain. Riding a boat in the rain. But don't tell us when you pick us up, that if its still raining when we get to Puerta Adventuras that you will bring us back. But then refuse. Don't put us on a boat and tell us its going to be choppy and we're probably going to get sea sick. Then tell us where to go when we need to vomit.Bad. Bad. Bad."

We chose to try the underwater cave exploration and snorkeling adventure. Our group consisted of family members from ages 12-67. The underwater cave was a one of a kind experience. The water was very cold, and there was some swimming involved. We were given life vests, and took things slow. Our guide, Yolo, was informative, but seemed to be in a hurry. Our ship was late to the dock, and there were many tours before and after us--this may be why the rush. I chose to take it easy, and forced her--and the rest of our group--to wait. I didn't want to be rushed through such an amazing experience. The snorkeling was in the river, and a bit rough for non-swimmers, and folks with limited swimming experience. My husband and mom, ages 42 and 67 respectively, stayed on land. We were given life vests and snorkel equipment, including flippers. These were ALL necessary. First, we swam up river--a tough swim around rocks. We were able to see where the fresh water and saltwater met. I was really only the only one impressed with this phenomenon. We were then able to drift downstream and relax a bit on the way back to the platform. The fish were mostly river fish and not as extraordinary as some in the reefs, but beautiful none the less. The coolest part was seeing the waters mix. ( I could have skipped this part, but we had someone with us who was new to travel, and wanted to try everything!)Back in Playa Del Carmen, we were served lunch. The food was all right, but the drinks were not made to my standard. Weak and cheap liquor. The sodas were cold and refreshing, though.Yolo, our guide, and Juan, our driver were amazing. Yolo was very informative and funny. Positives: Beautiful cave system, and explanation of how the cave was formed.Bottled water providedInteresting phenomenon to see the fresh and sea water mix.Yolo was a great guide--informative and keeping us on trackWell thought out itinerary to get the \"most bang for your buck\"Negatives: We felt rushedLong drive to the cave, but totally worth it!No changing facilities at the restaurantI would definitely use this company again, but would personalize the itinerary. We booked through the cruise line and didn't have many options, but I'll bet they have lots to choose from."

At Tulum, our guide was a fount of knowledge, I got antsy because our time there was going to be short and for me it was the views and pictures. My husband on the other hand, could have glanced around and then listened to the history all day. We needed another 15 minutes there for me to have been 100% satisfied, but my husband was very pleased. Pack extra water!! They give you some, but it was warm and we drank 4 bottles in the 1.5hrs we were there. I will say this, we were one of the smallest tour groups there, and I am SO glad. We didn't have to crowd in to hear our guide and we became a \"little family\" while there, that was an experience I didn't expect, but was s grateful to have. Our ride back included some more history with maps and pictures and a books to look at, it was apparent this is something our guide loves to do.Xplor! WOW, very cool place. We booked with Cancun Adventure, but got picked up by a large bus and taken to a bus station where we got on the bus that would take us to our destination (follow the \"color\" line). Not very crowded the day we went. Our longest waits (maybe 5 minutes) were for the zip lines (but once you get going, no more lines!) and the \"amphibious\" vehicles. Food was great. They have \"guard cats\" to keep the iguanas away from the buffet area LOL. You definitely need the whole day for this park, we only did the amphibious vehicles twice and we always took the long routes everywhere else. When you get there, the park offers a picture package. it's $90 and worth it. You may get some random people in your picture package when you download, but there is no other way to get some of the best and most memorable photos of your adventures, and the souvenir shop is ridiculously expensive. I shopped around for both of these places, and when you get to Cancun, EVERYONE and their mother tries to sell you these excursions, at high prices. Oh the looks on their faces when I told them I paid 3/4 or half the price that they were charging. We will book with Cancun Adventure when we come back. They are reliable, and it was a great experience"

He gave us a lot of background on the cultural significance of the Cenotes to the Mayans on the drive there, and also during the tour. It felt very special because of this. There was one traveller who had difficulty mobility wise, and the guide helped him through the water. If you are afraid of bats, you don't want to go on this tour. We loved experiencing the bats sleeping in the cavern and had the chance to watch some of them fly around. The guide was very knowledgable about the stalactites and stalagmites. He showed us many formations and named them, explaining how they were formed by nature. He also gave background about how scientists use these formations to learn about the area's history. As one of the most important geological features of the area, we felt it was very important to experience these caverns. We were provided headlamps and helmets which made it feel very official. Learning about the Mayans' vision quests made it all seem very spiritual as well.The trip to Tulum was also very good. Our guide took us on a quick tour of all of the structures, explaining the cultural significance of each special place. This was nice, because we then had an hour to continue reading and exploring Tulum, or walk around outside where there were other attractions, bars and shops. Tulum is VERY busy, so it was good to go on a tour because you don't have to wait in the long line up. I would say it took us 5 mins to get in, and those waiting for individual admittance were waiting for upwards of 30 mins. It is very hot there, even with the breeze coming from the water. We were offered water and umbrellas before leaving the van. It would be good to visit Tulum early in the morning, but we would not have traded our solitary experience at the cavern for that.This was all followed by an ocean front buffet lunch and one free drink at a restaurant in Tulum, a very busy area that took a while to get to. The lunch was good. By this time, everyone was quite tired and ready to go back to their resorts. It was out of the way and we would have preferred somewhere on the way back. The driver who picked us up and drove us for the day was amazing. We appreciated the prompt and courteous service."

First, let me say that Michelle, our tour guide, and Tony, our driver were extraordinary! Michelle made us feel like family as soon as she greeted us from the dock. We immediately fell in love with her. She has a great energy and we'd come back just to do another tour with her! She had lots of great information to offer us from telling us about the sea animals during the beach snorkel to the history of the cenotes. She even stood in line with us as we waited to get on our boat back to Cozumel and hugged us goodbye. Michelle and Tony took great care of us! Now for the tour... We started with a great snorkel trip from the beach where Michelle pointed out a lot of turtles and stingray. You're able to get really close to them and we saw so many! We were unable to go out to the reef that day but it was still unforgettable! The hour flew by but we saw so much! It was great for our experienced snorkelers as well as our first-timer. Then we drove to the cenotes. While we were in the water, Tony bough us snacks for the road! :) We took a quick dip in the first one. We couldn't believe how crystal clear the water was. It was stunningly beautiful! ...And so \"refreshing!\" ;) Then she took us on a swim through the underground river. Again, BEAUTIFUL! Something everyone should see! She taught us so much about what we were seeing and the history of the area or the formations. Very informative, she knows her stuff! I think that was about an hour also. After that we went for a buffet lunch, which was delicious. It was such a beautiful beach restaurant too. I couldn't ask for a more amazing tour for our first time to Mexico or more perfect hosts. This was unforgettable. Thank you Michelle and Tony! <3"

            "review": "Isla Mujeres Catamaran was great. Had a great time with the crew on the Cancun Adventures #3 catamaran to Isla Mujeres. We booked this through Apple Vacations at our resort on Christmas Eve with my wife on our honeymoon.The wind/weather was too intense for us to stop and paddleboard/snorkel and they gave us the option to reschedule once we arrived but we chose to stay and had a great time. They picked us up in a van at our hotel and took about a 30-45 minute drive (including another passenger pickup) before letting off at the pier where the boat was located. We loaded up and took a nice 30-45 minute ride across to the island. FYI: bring an extra shirt or plan to buy one on the island because you WILL get wet on the ride over. Once we let off we had our guide give us a quick 15 minute tour of the island before letting us run free for about 2.5 hours. We stopped and had a few beers, did some shopping, and walked down the beach and really enjoyed the cool little island. We then loaded back up on the boat and they moved a few hundred yards over to the north beach of the island and dropped anchor. There, they served us a little plated lunch of ceviche, a sandwich, guac and pasta which was great. Afterwards we hopped in the water and floated around for a little bit before loading back up for the trek back.All in all it was a great little excursion and we definitely felt like we got our money's worth. Our staff of Roberto, Charlie, Alejandro and Pedro were friendly and eager to talk to us and keep our drinks full. We would definitely recommend (and did recommend to a few couples at the resort) this excursion to others and would consider more through Cancun Adventures on our next trip."

            "review": "Snorkel Xtreme with Alex M. (ask for him - he's fantastic). I rarely write reviews, but our tour guide asked for a review and he did such a great job that for him I am writing this review. Alex M. (Martinez I believe) speaks several different language including excellent English. He has so much energy, is very knowledgeable if you have questions (my friend and I were pretty curious), makes a lot of jokes, and sets such a positive energy. He made the experience so much better. It would have been great, but he truly loves what he does (and say so too) and it only enhanced the experience.The activities itself for Snorkel Xtreme were overall fun. I am an adrenaline junkie, so for me they were not too \"extreme\" but some people in our tour group chose to not partake in all activities - which is completely fine. First, we snorkeled with these large beautiful endangered turtles. Then, we ziplined (average to me, but heights do not faze me), rappeled down a man-made building (something I have never done before so it was nice to experience), ate really delicious food at a buffet, and then finished the trip with my favorite experience - snorkeling in a cenote. The water is so pure and it's hard to describe the experience of a cenote, but if nothing else Google it. I recommend it at some point in your life. Bottom line, ask for Alex M. Regardless of him, overall for $135 for all of these activities and a filling lunch, I highly recommend this. They pick you up from your resort and drop you off as well too. I personally thought the rappeling and ziplining were okay (again to my non-average standard), but for the two snorkeling experiences were worth the $135. Look around at other sites. You are not going to find a package like this for this price.Hopefully this provides insight to someone. Happy vacationing :)"

We spend an hour snorkeling in the Dos Ojos Cenotes, led by Cindy from Cancun Adventures. Great instructions, information all during our snorkeling, and overall knowledge of the area. When a second part of the tour fell through due to a political event, they regrouped and took us to the Mystic River. They supplied hard hats with lights, and again Cindy's narration and instructions were fantastic. What a great tour this was. Lunch was later at the beach and she stayed with us until we boarded the ferry back to Cozumel. What an excellent tour guide and excellent tour. Can't say enough good about this company."

We did a full day excursion with Gabo where we first visited Tulum, then explored an underground cavern and ended the day on a beautiful beach where we enjoyed the most delicious local cuisine. We cannot say enough about our guide! He was very knowledgeable, answered all of our questions and kept the whole day fun. This excursion was our favorite day of the week that we spent in the Riviera Maya. It was interesting to learn about Tulum and truly amazing to swim in the cavern. When we got home, Gabo emailed us videos he took on his go-pro from the cavern tour. He went above and beyond! The cenotes/caverns are something to see if you don't mind the cold river. Thank you!!"

We wanted to go on an excursion where we could still be in the beautiful sunny weather. We met with our Cheap Caribbean Rep and he highly recommended the Cancun Adventures Luxury Sailing & Snorkeling trip. This trip is the perfect length. We were picked up in our hotel lobby at about 7AM and we were sailing on the boat by 8AM. The trip came with all you can drink & with a lunch. For about the first hour of the trip you sail out into the ocean and just take in the beauty of the ocean along with great music playing on the boat. The crew was awesome during the sailing portion, they always made sure you had a fresh drink in your hand and that you were enjoying themselves, you could tell they really loved their jobs.Sergio, the main guide of the trip, was great. He was very knowledgeable about the boat, ocean, fish and anything else relateable. He seemed to have grew up always being on a boat because he was as ease on the boat. He really made the trip fun because he was always interacting with everyone on board and making sure they were having a good time. The rest of the crew was great too, Gaby was there to take pictures & videos so we could look back on trip. Pablo & Marlin were also great, very attentive service & a great captain of the boat making sure we safely reached our destination.After snorkeling, we sailed to a little bay where we got lunch and then were able to paddle board and hang out on a sand bar. Overall, a great trip and I would highly recommend this trip for anyone who loves boats, water, drinking & having a great time in paradise. My wife and I were both very happy with our trip and would do it again in a heart beat."

Coffee and restrooms were available. Wait time was approx. 30 minutes. We then boarded another van and were on our way to Tulum. During the ride our tour guide Mari gave a brief history of the region and the Mayan people. She is from Holland originally, fluent in English. Upon arrival she offered some do's and don't of the shopping center. A snack (cookies & banana), bottled water and umbrella (optional) were provided. We enjoyed the tour of Tulum and free time after.

Chose a day with a little overcast - I know everyone thinks they want a bright sunny day - but the overcast makes the day better. EVEN IF YOU CANNOT SWIM PLEASE TRY SNORKELING-WITH THE LIFE VEST YOU ARE SAFE - EXPERIENCE THE ADVENTURE. The current takes you from point A to Point B - you do nothing except float along while snorkeling and their is a front guide and back guide - you are well protected. I do not remember the captain's name, I think Pedro - he was excellent along with the rest of the boat staff. They do not overcrowd the catamaran which leaves you with plenty of room to move about the vessel. The one thing I recommend is for you to eat on the Island - the boxed lunch is less than desirable-but there is not much more they can do to make it better. If you are a drinker you will be quite happy - plenty of liquor/beer, etc. I would definitely recommend Cancun Adventures and would do this again. Warning when you land on Isla Mujeres - if you rent a golf cart to view the island - BE SPECIFIC about how long you are renting for - we told them 2 hrs and they charged $40 but when we returned they wanted another $40 for the second hour. We refused to pay - maybe it was miscommunication upfront-but it almost got ugly."

This was our first trip to Mexico and we Flew with Transat.We booked our excursion with Cancun Adventures through our Transat representative. We did a full day tour from 8-5pm as we wanted to bang out as many activates as we could in one day. We chose to swim with sea turtles, snorkel in a cenote and see the Tulum ruins. The price was very good compared to other excursion and for all your travel, activates and lunch included we thought that $130.00 American was a very reasonable price.Our tour guide for the day was Michelle from South Africa who was very knowledgably and delightful. She broke the ice between travelers and make our tour a fun learning experience. The amount of tree facts I know now to tell my friends and family about is extensive lolWe started our morning off with the turtle swim. I have to say I was a little worried this was going to be ok hop in this pool where we've abducted turtles from their natural home for your viewing pleasure. I was delighted when we arrive on a stunning beach to snorkel as a lose group to find sea turtles doing their natural thing. I was even happier that this is a protected area for the turtles and they took persuasions to not bother them. For example we were instructed to not kick our flippers deep so to not hit any wildlife or stir up the sand as well as only staying with one turtle for no more then 2 minutes so they weren't stressed. We also saw a sting ray and swam over a coral reef to take in all the different kinds of fish.On to the cenote! onlt about 15-20 minutes down the road we drove to a property with a few cenotes on it we visited one and Michelle guided us through the cave on a snorkeling tour learning about the Mayan culture, stalagmites and stalactites, minerals and even the fish in the cenote that nibble harmlessly at the dead skin on your feet.The cave has fresh water that's aqua in colour. And the most amazing part is the size of the cave from above the water it looks narrow and not very spacious but from under water you see the caverns go forever and the depth is amazing there were many scuba divers down there during out tour.NEXT was lunch we went to a local spot on the beach in Tulum and OMG was it every amazing. I wish I could recall the name of it. The food was to die for but the location and view...speechless! I wish we had more time here to hang out on the white sand beach and crystal clean water.And last but not least we went to see the Tulum ruins which are smaller but the only ruins on the coast line. Cancun Adventures took measures to keep us cool such as giving us water bottles and umbrellas for the tour as this was the hottest part of the day and its more or less a field of scorch out there. Michelle was knowledgeable and tried to make the tour fun by asking question and telling fun facts but to be honest it was WAY to hot! no one was listening and just dying for it to be over. after the tour we were allowed 45 minutes to wonder on our own and take pictures no one did so we all voted to go back to the bus as we were drenched in sweat and sunburnt. Once we got back we had time to drink cold beer and cool off in the air conditioning of the shop and the tour company gave up cool towels to well done to them for taking precautions to prevent heat stroke and fainting. BUT PLEASE CANUN ADVENTURES the ONLY down fall to this day was doing this part last during the hottest time of the day. it would be far better to do it in the morning get hot and sweaty, eat some lunch and then get to spend the rest of the afternoon cooling down in the cenote or ocean with the turtles.thank you for making your excursion wonderful and educational! we loved it"

            "review": "Fun! Too Many People. My boyfriend and I scheduled this as a fun activity for the two of us thinking maybe there would be a total of 15-20 people with us. He's an experienced sailor on 30-40ft boots and was already hesitant to go sailing with other people crewing the boat. Much to his dissatisfaction, we piled on to the 46ft catamaran along with 24 other people. The maximum booking capacity is 40, so if you go during a busy tourist season expect that many people. For $110 a person I would have liked the capacity to be 15-20. The website says you cant drink alcohol until after the snorkeling, INCORRECT thank goodness feel free to start the drinking the second you get on the boat. They did allow smoking which i was not so fond of. The crew were all very nice, however the captain left his post for 20 minutes or longer periods during the trip (autopilot was on, but its still unsafe). I dont know if it was the cervezas or the lovely photographer but I was suckered in to buying the pictures, unless you know there are a lot of photos of you and your group on the flash drive its not worth the money (680 pesos for 2 people). The reef was gorgeous, but you have to stay as a group so if you are an experienced swimmer you will be doing a lot of waiting around for the rest of the group. It would have been nice if they let us swim around the reef at our own pace. Over all it was a beautiful day to sail and we made the most out of it."

We were picked up from our resort right on time and brought to the boat. My husband is a boat lover and we were impressed with the high quality of the catamaran that was taking us out for the day. The crew was entertaining and accommodating and really made us feel at home. We enjoyed the complimentary cocktails and the delicious lunch they served us as well.The area that we went snorkeling in was absolutely perfect. The water was clear blue and calm and we saw a variety of aquatic life including fish, stingrays, sea turtles and sea urchins. After we finished our snorkeling we were given the opportunity to use paddle boards and everyone loved it. During the entire trip, everything was being photographed (including in the water) and we were given the opportunity to buy a flash drive with the photos - totally worth it!A big thank you to Gabby, Sergio, Pablo, Mauro and Ricardo for what truly felt like the best vacation day ever!"

The combined excursion ran from about 9 to 3:30 and was worth every minute of our time away from the pool. It was a once in a lifetime experience. Our tour guide Gabo was the absolute best. He was knowledgeable, kind, patient (our group ranged in age from 9 to 80 and he pulled my 9 year old daughter through the cavern on a life preserver) and entertaining. Just walking through the ruins and and floating through the cavern in would have been breathtaking in and of itself but Gabo's knowledge and insights took everything to another level. If you go to Tulum, I highly recommend that you book these tours and that you insist on Gabo as your tour guide. I'm sure others are good but I have a hard time imagining they could be as fantastic as Gabo. He went above and beyond (offering us samples of Mayan foods and sending pictures me of our group in the cavern). Overall, just an extraordinary experience."

We booked a 4 hour snorkling trip on November 24 through our hotel concierge. Note you can get a better price if you book ahead of time. We were asked to be ready to leave at 7:15 am. When we awoke, it was raining. The ocean was angry. The concierge suggested we reschedule (as did my wife), but the driver said it was not raining at Puerto Adventuras. He assured us we would have a great day.Whether blind optimism or vacationer's stupidity, we got on the van. You see, my wife & friend had booked a spa day the next day and Thursday was Thanksgiving. Tuesday was our only shot at snorkling bliss. Despite the pouring rain, we got on the boat. Watch your step in the pouring rain as you climb aboard. The boat is very nice and comfortable. I suggest you decline the offer of a morning cocktail until you get your sea legs. I declined and was thankful when my heaves were dry while others' were not.National Geographic has some excellent shows on sea storms. I suggest that is best how such events get observed. The sea was both spectacular - like an amusement park ride - and stomach turning - like the worst flu you ever had. I found God on that trip and He punished me for missing all those Sunday masses.Sergio & crew were so kind and willing to help. I know they got several hugs from those sickest among us as we departed the boat.After an hour or so of taking turns throwing our stomach contents into the sea, we arrived at the snorkling location. Those recovered enough swim did so. I laid out on the front deck and enjoyed some brief sun. The return trip seemed quicker. We moored in a protected lagoon for lunch. I felt good enough to swim. I saw hundreds of fish. It made the trip worthwhile. Our teenagers & younger recovered more quickly and had a great time. Lunch was well received for those who could eat.If I were to go back, I would ask for the same crew and check the weather forecast ahead of time..."

Roberto and his crew were very sweet and showed us a really great time and they wanted to make our last day of vacation special for us. They told us we could sit wherever we wanted on the boat and gave us the V.I.P. treatment. Upon arriving to Isla Mujeres Roberto gave us a quick and informative tour and then allowed us to have the rest of the day touring the island. We rented a golf cart (which requires a valid drivers license so you know) and drove all over the island. To top it off, when we returned back to the boat they had a delicious bento box lunch waiting for us that consisted of: shrimp ceviche, shrimp spring rolls, pesto pasta, ciabatta fish sandwich, and brownies. Since we had some extra time on our hands they allowed us to sail on the boat for a long time so we could have the opportunity to experience it. I will admit I want to learn how to sail now. Roberto, thank you so much for making our honeymoon so special and being so generous. We look forward to returning someday."

It was a small group and he took the time to explain every detail. He even waited up for others who were slower to catch up with the group. First we went snorkeling with giant sea turtles in Akumal beach. SO amazing. I hope the pictures turn out. Next we saw the dos ojos cenotes, saw how the underwater rivers connect, so refreshing. It was fresh water too. Nice to wash the salt water off. After we saw the Tulum Mayan ruins, our guide explained each ruin to us. I thought it was so cool how they only used blue and red paint and that the spanish introduced other colors. As well as how the columns were spanish introduced. He also let us wander around and set up a meeting place so we could have free time. After we met up we ate at an amazing restaruant. I don't remember the name of it but it was SOOOO good. Awesome day."

We met Fernando and Alexi at the ferry pier where they took us straight to Cenotes Dos Ojos for an amazing experience of snorkeling in ancient Mayan caverns, a life changing event for me. Then off to swim with the sea turtles at Akumal, a once in a lifetime experience in my opinion. After a quick rinse off we headed to a beach bar in Playa del Carmen where we were treated to a taco bar with the most amazing pork and countless other great choices and drinks. There was a bit of time after the meal for some quick shopping (wish there could've been more time, but that's Princess' fault, not yours) and then back to the pier to meet up with the ferry back to Cozumel. Alexi was an amazing driver and kept all our belongings safe so we didn't have to worry about them (not to mention a great photographer). Fernando was one of the best guides we've ever come in contact with, full of very interesting information, extremely friendly and very accommodating to everyone's different needs. Both Alexi and Fernando were wonderful ambassadors for not only your company, but Mexico in general, and have us wanting to come back and spend more time in Playa del Carmen. Please pass along our immense gratitude to both Alexi and Fernando for an amazing tour! We look forward to future Cancun Adventures tours!"

One of the many highlights was our Luxury Sailing and Snorkeling Tour with Cancun Adventures. Yes, we just returned home yesterday. I wanted to post my review first thing so I would not forget. Despite snorkeling for the first time and getting seasick, I still had an excellent time on the tour because the crew was just wonderful. Sergio our dive master and snorkeling lead held my hand the entire time snorkeling to keep me calm in the water. He made sure I felt safe and had fun getting really up close with the sea life. After snorkeling unfortunately, I did get seasick back on the boat. When I say seasick, I really mean it. Again, the crew came to my rescue. I was able to recover and continue to enjoy the tour. My husband and I forgot to bring enough money to purchase photos of the tour. However, the tour photographer Aline arranged for the tour bus drive to bring the flash drive of the photos back to our resort later that evening. Thanks to Sergio, Aline and the other crewmembers, this first time snorkeler who does not drink and got seasick was able to fully enjoy the tour and get some fanatic photos in the water and on the boat. Thanks again Sergio, Aline and crew."

We finished the day with a buffet lunch and they even brought me out a piece of birthday cake (great surprise!). During the day, as much bottled water as you could drink was gladly provided and encouraged. We were also given cold/fresh towels during the excursions and snacks/cookies were provided. They even gave us umbrella's to shade us from the sun as we walked around the Ruins. The guide Edith was AMAZING. She really provided us with a great tour and was extremely knowledgable about the area and the history. The van was a bit crowded, but overall, that's my only complaint! Really well done."

He was very knowledgeable about the Mayan ruins at Tulum and about the Sea Turtles. I liked the Tulum ruins better than the rest of the tour. Tulum is breathtaking and just amazing. Snorkeling with the turtles was fun, however, the water was rough that day and my wife and I wore out before Alex did. No big deal because we saw what we had hoped to see. The snorkeling is not in a lagoon or cove, it is right off a beach so the ocean currents and waves make it challenging.We also wanted to Thank both Alex and the driver Nestor. Both very professional and kind. Alex actually gave some fruit and cookies with some of the water we didn't drink to people in need near the lunch site. Alex also has a great playlist of songs to listen to during your ride!"

I don't think I got burned while snorkeling, but definitely while walking from the beach to the parking lot where the van was. Our driver Cunelo was able to maneuver out of some tight spots. I liked snorkeling and Alex even helped us take pictures of the sea turtles with our camera (and he also took pictures of each couple at Tulum--score for an excursion where you're not pressured into buying the photos!). Afterwards, we had a buffet lunch, which was good but could have used more selection. I was happy to finally have Diet Coke in a can there.

Off we went, a little nervously, on our catamaran to view the ocean, shop at Isla Mujeres, snorkel and possibly indulge in spinnaker sailing. The crew was amazing, very courteous, humorous and acted as both bartenders and crew. First on our list, after a half hour of getting acquainted while sipping margaritas, was the snorkelling, which I, unfortunately, did not enjoy due to swallowing seawater before we even got going - certainly not their fault but my own. (The crew was very good to me and got me back to the boat where I sat and watched my hubby enjoy himself under water and sipping some regular unsalted water.) Thankfully, our next stop was at a beach where we could pat a shark (not me) and have lunch. Back on the boat, quite recovered from my malaise, we headed for Isla Mujeres. What an amazing place - we shopped, watched a dancing show, and roamed from one end of the island to the other. Souvenirs in hand we went back to the catamaran and headed back towards the mainland. I was starting to feel a bit disappointed that there would be no spinnaker sailing when we stopped and the captain asked if there were any volunteers. One gentleman put up his hand, got kitted out and up he went to roars of laughter whenever the spinnaker dipped him into the waves. Since no-one else was feeling brave that day, I decided to give it a shot too. What an outstanding thing to do, I just loved it! You don't go too high, you can easily feel when you are going to dip and hold your breath (no more seawater for this girl), then you are soaring again. I would highly recommend this excursion to anyone as it definitely had something for everyone!"

I guess CA has a lot smaller catamarans than some of the other tour groups in the area, making it a bit more intimate and less of a Greek week experience on the water. We went out with about 30 other folks. Make no mistake about it: This is intended to be a booze cruise (if you aren't drinkers, this might not be the outing for you), and I'm guessing your experience will depend heavily on the people who join you. We were put with other Americans and spent the afternoon drinking and having a good time getting to know our fellow travelers. It was a smooth ride (my friend gets sea sick but had no problem on the catamaran) with lots of sunshine. We stopped to snorkel and got to see sea turtles and sting rays and even an eel that chomped on our tour guide. Later they pulled over so that we could paddle board in an inlet.The staff (Pablo, Sergio, Charly, Victor, and Karen) were fabulous and fun. They are well experienced, and we felt like we were in good hands safety wise. It was a great way to relax, enjoy the water, and get to snorkel a bit. It was well worth the $109 USD we spent."

We were so excited to do both activities as we are both archeology/history buffs, nature lovers, and I'm a professional photographer. We are also avid travelers who have taken many tours over the years. Sadly, our excitement ended soon after the tour started. Our tour guide, Jorge, was by far the worst tour guide I have ever encountered. He made the whole tour feel like a race to the finish, as though doing his job was not enjoyable for him and that his tour group was a bother to him. He on more than one occasion made disparaging remarks about other members of our tour group, including one member who was slower than the rest of the group due to an injured foot. He also spent more time chastising past tour groups he led because someone supposedly asked about UFOs then actually talking about the history of Tulum or the Mayan people. When describing the Mayan people he basically said they were like the Mexican equivalent to Quasimodo. Even when he did talk about the history of Tulum parts of it were inaccurate. Worse was when we got to Akumal Bay and several of us wanted to run into one of the stores to buy a waterproof camera (since the tour did not offer the ability to purchase one) and we were told no. Then upon getting into the snorkeling tour he would repeatedly talk and then chastise us for looking up from the water to hear what he was saying. He also blamed the girl who had trouble seeing without her glasses, her husband who didn't complete the snorkeling trip because of Jorge's rudeness and another girl whose hair tie broke during snorkeling and had trouble seeing where the group was going for the group not making it to the reef. Later at lunch, not realizing that any of us in the group were fluent in Spanish he sat with our driver, Renee and made fun of all of us, especially several members of the group who were heavyset. Renee was nice and never responded to Jorge's complaints. The only redeeming quality of this tour was Tulum is breathtaking and getting to see the turtles and manta rays was amazing. Not only would I not recommend Jorge as a tour guide but since you don't get to pick your guide, I wouldn't even use this company for any tour. We did the Chichen Itza tour two days later with another company and had a much better experience."

One of our friends was afraid and they towed her around in a life ring so she could still enjoy turtles and sea life. Wow!Then fish tacos and lunch at Xpul-ha was AMAZING!!! Thanks Pato for an awesome day!"

The swim with the turtles at Akumal was a dream. We even liked very much the lunch that was provided with the trip.

First, A+++ for organization & efficiency; took a comfortable ferry from the cruise ship dock to the playa del Carmen mainland where we were clearly and quickly directed to our specific excursion. Next we met our awesome tour guide, Michelle, and our driver, Carlos, who took us in a comfortable mini van to our first stop; snorkeling in beautiful Paradise Cove. They were both extremely nice, helpful, & knowledgable, the snorkeling was great!! Next we headed to mystic river to explore the caverns, which was an unforgettable experience that was the highlight of the entire trip. Finally, we drove to a beach bar for dinner, which was better than any of the meals we got on the cruise, before heading back to the dock to catch our ferry back to Cozumel. Highly recommended, do not hesitate!!! Reputable and very well organized tour, they know what they're doing!!"

I purchased a go-pro mount for my snorkel, while it worked out great it was unnecessary.

I am not exaggerating when I say it was the high point of our trip. We had an amazing tour guide and driver (Alex and Roberto) and enjoyed our nice, small tour group size. Alex was very knowledgable at the Tulum ruins--we became very fascinated with the Mayan culture. The cavern swim afterwards was spooky but so neat. Both are such unique activities to the area, so I would highly recommend if you are going to Mexico!"

What made the experience even more amazing was the true passion and energy put in by our tour guide, Gabo. He is a very educated man who truly enjoys what he does. He did not treat us or the rest of the tour as if we were just another session. He put a lot of emphasis and passion behind the tour and customer service was his top priority. He carried a backpack with him that must have weighed over 35lbs that contained water, snacks, and other things to make the tour smooth for the tourists. Upon completion of the tour, we headed back to the van and Zeus (driver) had wet towels waiting for us. It was a relatively hot day.

Gabo spent so much time providing a lot of information on the places we visited with such enthusiasm, he went beyond our expectations of a tour guide. We began our day in Tulum to see the Mayan ruins. Gabo shared his extensive knowledge of Mayan history, as well as interesting facts about the region, all the while making sure we were comfortable in the intense heat- seeking shade as much as possible. He even brought interesting items to share with us- like dried grasshopper for those who were daring enough to try it, and cocoa beans (telling us the store in town to buy our own- thanks Gabo!). We were all given a cold refreshing towel to help us cool down after Tulum, which was very much appreciated. Our next stop was the cave and cenote, where we donned a life vest, fins, and a helmet with a light to explore the stalagmite and stalagtite filled cave- amazing! There was even time to try \"fish therapy\" before entering the cave- an interesting experience. Gabo showed us every square inch of that cave with all its splendor, taking so much time, we were amazed at how much we saw! Gabo and Carlos also kept an eye on everyone in the group, so we always felt safe and in good hands. Our last stop was a relaxing lunch at Xpo-Ha, a quant beach club with great food, hammocks, and loungers.

The tour of Tulum was marvelous--Gabo has great empathy for the Mayans, and made each one of us feel the same. The tour company provides umbrellas, which helped in the August heat. Only complaint about Tulum is the number of visitors there, and this is off-season. Very crowded! Off to Dos Ojos Cenote, where we went for a swim in the cavern and learned about cavern dwellers (bats, spider-looking things, fish) and more ecological history about the jungle and the Mayans. We ended our trip with a buffet lunch on the beach, at a restaurant outside Playa del Carmen. I can't say enough about Gabo, who speaks highly of his country and its history. I feel he went over and above what his company expected of him with us. Great day!"

We are seasoned travelers. Booked this expensive once in a life time excursion through Barcelo Maya Deluxe Hotel, Mexico. Let me tell you, you will NOT swim or see the Mante Ray- as told. You will do 2-3 jumps. And no, each jump will NOT last 15-20 minutes-as told. Not even including waiting for the boat to circle back to you! My first jump lasted maybe 1-2 minutes, if that. Second and third were a little longer. No breakfast- told there would be. The boat ride will be long- 15 nautical miles each way (Beautiful ocean). Their equipment is junk. Bring your own. They will take pictures for you to buy, but it will be NOTHING like the brochures or advertisement! You will be lucky with two or three ok pictures of one of your family member only. PS- we were also on the boat with another family of 4. They were told the same thing by the hotel but they paid more and the wife was not a very good swimmer. So after one jump, she stayed at the boat. She was also sick from the diesel smell. Now back to the 3 jumps. There will be 28 or so other boats all around you. Be-careful. Your boat will go near one Whale Shark and as soon as that happens, you have to jump into the ocean right away and start swimming next to it. There will not be ANY time to fix your mask or anything. The shark will be swim away- faster then you! Most likely. Unless you are like my 18 year old Elite swimmer son. You will tried to keep up but once the shark swims away, your guide will stop you. They do not like to swim out too far by yourself. Your 2-3 jumps will give you maybe 1-2 minutes next to the Whale Shark each time. If you are lucky. Bring your own GO PRO. Now if you are ok with these FACTS. Then please do your research with the other companies and go. You really have to be a pretty good swimmer to have any chance of enjoying the sharks. There were many Whale Sharks in the area and you can see them from the top. You will be at the whale site for maybe 30 minutes all together. Max- 10 to a boat. 2 swimmer per Guide. Your guide will make a big difference. Remember, you also have a Skipper on the boat as one of your Guide. Ours was not very good. Last thing. We did purchase the pictures of our excursion. There were maybe 8 pictures total. That is it. Most were bad pictures that could have been anybody swimming next to the shark. We were told it takes 2 days to receive the link for the pictures. After 4 days and five emails to the company. I still do NOT have the pictures. Hope this review will help you with your trip!"

First we snorkeled at Turtle Cove at Akumal Bay and saw beautiful turtles and an Eagle Stingray. Next, we went to Dos Ojos, a beautiful Cenote. This Cenote was so beautiful and was our favorite site. This is the perfect excursion and I highly recommend it. This was the first time my son and I had ever seen a Cenote and loved it! Pepe was awesome! Thanks for such a wonderful adventure, Monica and Matt."

He was very kind and accommodating. He was definitely a safe and competent driver. He also provided us snacks when we met up with our guide, as some of us didn't have a big breakfast -- this was very nice and welcomed. Javo knows his stuff, it's easily apparent when he starts the information on the way to Tulum -- he's very knowledgable. He gave us clear guidelines on what to expect, made sure we had enough water (it was very hot and humid). The guide was timed well and gave us enough time to get around the grounds before we had to get back. The snorkeling was nice, but don't be surprised if the water is a bit murky or the snorkel doesn't provide a 100% secure fit throughout the voyage (if you have a mustache, be prepared to try vasoline on your mustache to help seal the snorkel mask to your face). While snorkeling, we saw 4-5 turtles, 3+ stingrays, and a bunch of different fish. They provided food/buffet was delicious. I'd go here again outside of the adventure if I was ever in the area. If possible, do any early tour to avoid any crowds and the heat... If you're going to do a \"regular\" time, go with Cancun-Adventures, they were fantastic. Oh, something my wife noticed while we were all sleeping on the way back from the buffet... We were stopped at a traffic signal and the van was approached by a one legged homeless man. Eduardo, our driver, stated he had no cash to give him but did give the man all of our extra boxed granola bars (just a few) and water bottles(again, just a few). I didn't know this until my wife told me when I woke up prior to arriving to our hotel... This is a wonderful gesture by Eduardo. Who knows where the water bottles and granola bars would have gone, but at least this way they have gone to someone who may have needed them more than we did. "

However, if you are first to be picked up, and there are three or four other pickups after you, be prepared to spend a LONG time in the van. If you are first, and you get to the site of the attraction early, be prepared to wait a LONG time while the other vans pick up all the other people. There is no coordination with the central office and there is no communication with the staff as to why you are sitting there waiting. Please note that the staffers who are actually taking you on the boat or ride etc etc are terrific and very dedicated to their job. They are not to blame for faulty management. But still, when you are sitting in very very very hot weather, with no water or bathroom or shelter, it is a miserable experience. This happened to us a few months ago on an expedition to see and swim with the whale sharks. Most recently, it happened again on a boating excursion."

The catamaran is an incredible vessel and even on a slightly choppy day, like we had, it was a joy to sail on. We eventually arrived at the diving reef and were guided around by the crew. It's much better this way, because they know where to see the most interesting stuff, like sea turtles and rays. We then had a go at paddle boarding, which was fun. The staff are all so professional and personable... They came round and made us all feel welcome on board, taking time to have a conversation with us. The captain, Pedro, was a great guy and shared some great sailing stories with me and explained how the catamaran works. They fed us well too. The food is lovely. We had a beautifully prepared box with different compartments - a tasty bit of chicken, some pasta, chips, guac and salsa. The staff kept coming round and bringing us drinks (water, beer, tequila... Whatever you fancy!). I can't recommend this enough. Two small pointers... Buy some biodegradable sunscreen as you're not allowed to use the normal stuff (conservation reasons). Also... Take some sea sickness medication in advance in case it's choppy... We had a couple of people who had to lean over the side!! "

As well, this also meant our professional photographer/videographer couldn't bring their cameras into the water; thankfully the videographer brought his Go Pro so we were covered there.Also, we were told that there would be an opportunity for lunch and shopping as part of the tour from Divina - the tour guides had no idea about this and we had to ask him to bring us into Playa del Carmen and negotiate the amount of time we were going to spend there.

I booked this tour already aware I was paying over the odds ($203 when the average in cancun hotel zone is $160) but having one day left I had not much choice. The pick up was 45 minutes late ('problems with the van', excuse given to everyone). They charge $15 extra for using a wetsuit. The boat was not what I had been shown it would be, there was little room and no interior / bathroom (I had specifically enquired about it). Once at the whale shark site, it was a strictly controlled thing, and you were in the water for max 4 minutes. We got 3 'jumps' each, each jump terminating with shouts of 'stop, stop'. I actually was pulled by a fin from one of the guides, who forced me to stop and go back on the boat. Nice treatment for $203! After these short stints in the water, we drove off to a boring reef for 'snorkel' 20 minutes then to lunch on Isla Mujeres. Here we were made to drop in neck deep water and wade to the beach and the restaurant, basically enjoying lunch dripping wet and in nothing other than our wet bathers, having left also all our valuables on the boat. Of course after lunch, we had to wade back onto the boat. Again, I had asked prior and was told there would have been possibility to shower and change at lunch break. Rip off. Might as well choose a cheaper company and save yourself some money, since this seems to be the common 'tour' schedule."

We went on the Tulum & Akumal tour and the Whale Shark Experience. We would recommend both.The Tulum & Akumal tour is an early start (we left our resort at 0610). However, this means you beat the crowds at the Mayan ruins in Tulum and the heat is also more bearable. Having been to Chichen Itza the previous day (with another tour company which we have also reviewed), this was definitely appreciated. The tour in Tulum was a perfect duration and there was ample free time for photos and exploring the ruins ourselves. Some people also went swimming.We then went to Akumal for snorkelling with the sea turtles and to the coral. Despite this being busier, this was excellent and we saw many turtles. We then went to a beach club for lunch which had buffet of reasonable selection, especially for vegetarians.The highlight of our tour was our guide, Jorge. Jorge was hugely knowledgeable and candid as a guide, not to mention hilarious. He clearly cares about his country and their people and this was apparent throughout the tour. We were very pleased to have Jorge as our tour guide. The following day we went on the Whale Shark Experience where we snorkelled with the whale sharks. While this is a seasonal tour between June and September, if you are in the area then we would definitely recommend this as an amazing experience.The experience involves a c. 90 minute boat ride and if you're subject to getting seasick, this probably isn't a tour for you as the boat ride can be quite choppy. We had 3 jumps with the whale sharks and jumped in couples. The time between each jump could have been longer. However, it has to be appreciated that when the guide sees the whale sharks, time is of the essence. Our guide, Omar, was very good, as were his colleagues in being attentive to my wife who felt seasick throughout the boat ride. The experience also includes lunch on Isla Mujeres which is a picturesque location. Lunch for vegetarians was suffice. There are underwater photos for an extra cost and should you wish to have a wet suit (in addition to a life jacket), there is also a cost of $15.All the tours include complimentary water, fruit and granola bars. The tour groups are also a good size.Cancun Adventures is a very professional outfit for any tours in Cancun and we thoroughly enjoyed our tours with them."

My family of eight did the 4-hour snorkeling and paddle boarding via catamaran with Cancun Adventures and I can't say enough great things about our experience. We started the morning by sailing for about 40 minutes to reach a reef where we would snorkel. Drinks were provided shortly after we took off and were available during our entire time at sea. The reef we snorkeled at was beautiful! We saw many sea turtles, numerous schools of fish, some sting rays and even some eels. Just be aware that this is a popular reef and there were several other groups at the same reef. It is quite large though, so it never felt too congested. Our guides were in the water with us the whole time and did a great job leading and pointing different things out to the group. Once we got back on the boat we had lunch and continued to enjoy more drinks. Part way through our afternoon at the reef the crew took out the paddle boards and people were able to take turns on those (there were only 3). Lunch was great and much more substantial than what I was expecting. Sergio was the lead for our excursion and he along with every member of the team were just wonderful. They were highly energetic yet professional at the same time. They were constantly checking on everyone during the excursion and asking if people needed anything at all. One member of my family started to feel sea sick during the trip back to land and the team was very attentive to her and did everything they could to help her feel better (even laying cool clothes on her forehead and fanning her! lol). The team was very personable and we enjoyed just chatting with them about their experiences. I highly recommend this excursion. There is an option to take a speed boat out to the reef, but that one is only 2 hours and lunch is not included. If you have the time to be gone for at least 4 hours, catamaran option is well worth it! Thanks for a great experience."

I understand they probably dont want to serve something heavy due to motion sickness however it should at least be an option of a sandwhich or salad. Other than the photos and food it was a great trip."

The excursion was easy to book through our resort and the transportation picked us up promptly at 6:40 a.m., just as they said they would. It was a bit of a lengthy drive to the tour facility, but that was no fault of Cancun Adventures. Our hotel was simply a long way from the facility. At the meet-up point, we were offered coffee, bottled water and cookies while we waited for all of the tour guests to arrive. Our tour guide, Marij, greeted us as soon as we arrived with a smile on her face. We then rode in two vans to Tulum and Marij was extremely knowledgeable the entire time. She also made the trip fun by throwing in some light humor here and there.Following the guided tour, we had a chance to tour the ruins more on our own and to swim along the beach of Tulum. The ruins themselves were magnificent and we very much enjoyed learning about them from Marij. Marij then rode with our group back to our respective hotels (again, ours was the furthest away so it took a little extra time, but that was fine) and continued to tell us more about the Mayan civilization. We both took a little nap when we first got back in the van, but Marij was very happy to go over with us what we had missed. She was also very personable and enjoyed talking to us about our lives in the United States.We were a bit unprepared and did not realize Tulum has a small \"town\" outside of it now and so we did not have enough money with us to sample food and buy souvenirs like we would have liked to. We did take plenty of bottled water, sunscreen and bug spray, all of which were needed. The tour also ensured we had plenty of bottled water and snacks as well.I would recommend Cancun Adventures and we very much enjoyed our tour guide, Marij. We plan to tour Chichen-Itza on our next trip to the Yucutan and would certainly use Cancun Adventures again."

First we were picked up by Roberto in a nice air conditioned van and taken to a meeting spot where we waited for a few other people to arrive before we left for Tulum. We were greeted by our guide Michelle and while we waited for the others we were able to view some dolphins. Once the others had arrived we headed out to Tulum. While on the way there we got to know our guide Michelle a little bit and she got to know us some as well. Once we arrived we made our way to Tulum ruins. Wow this place is nothing short of impressive. There are not many places in the world where you can see these magnificent structures and learn some history in the process. Michelle provided a guided tour for about 45 minutes or so and then we had another 45 minutes on our own to look around, take pictures and enjoy the impressive sights. Once we finished up there we met back at the van and headed to Akumal. Akumal is snorkeling with sea turtles, sting rays and fish across a small reef. This was amazing!!! I wasn't so sure we were going to see any of these animals since this seemed to be a public beach that had a fair amount of people, but boy was i wrong. We saw around 10 sea turtles and two sting rays and all types of fish. We were here for only around 30 minutes or so. Once we left we headed to an authentic mexican lunch on the beach where we had a great time just relaxing and eating. After all of this we were taken back to our resort. We really enjoyed this excursion because it was only about half a day or so and we were able to get back to the resort and relax before the evening activities. We highly recommend this tour and if possible make sure Roberto (driver) and Michelle (guide) are there to show you a fantastic day!!!"

We started at a beautiful marina where we got to see Dolphins. We got onto a beautiful catamaran that took us on about an hour sailing adventure. We then headed to a reef where we got to snorkel with tons of sea life. Turtles, stingrays, beautiful fish and much more. The crew was wonderful, fun and made us feel so comfortable. When we got back on the boat you could try paddle boarding but the water was pretty rough and for the amount of people on our tour everyone who wanted to try didn't have time. Once we started sailing again we did get lunch that was okay. We were hoping for something filling like a sandwich but for a small tray of pasta, chips and salsa that had to feed two. It was maybe enough for one if you weren't hungry. Everything else was great and we would recommend doing this trip! Awesome time!"

Both left Puerto Aventuras, less than 5 minutes from our hotel.Our first trip, the speedboat/snorkeling adventure, included a wonderful tour by Francisco, Pablo and Victor. The boat ride was fun for the kids. Yes, a lot of waves and bumps but we never felt unsafe. In fact, my wife and kids were yelling \"andale\" so that the driver would go faster. We made it to our snorkeling spot and swam in a serene cove with multiple fish, manta rays and a sea turtle. Francisco was with us all of the way and would call out different times when a creature would be swimming by, in case we were adjusting our masks or not focused. Francisco is an awesome tour guide and I highly recommend that you ask for him on your adventure. See pics from our tour - purchased them on a USB drive for an affordable USD $30. Can't beat that price.Our second adventure was a lovely sunset catamaran ride from Puerto Aventuras into a cove where we could take a dip, if we wished. The team was awesome - though I can only remember the name of our photographer Natalia. When the sails went up and we were on wind power, it was a bit of a choppy ride and you really had to hold on if you tried moving about the craft. The bartenders were great and we were served snack boxes just as we arrived at the cove. A lovely, serene sunset without waves and just the sound of wind. At one point, my niece dropped her very expensive sunglasses into the water while docked in the cove. One of the guys heard what was going on and dove into the water to retrieve them for her. Of course, we took care of him for this gesture and it was great to see such an accommodating team. On the way out, my 76 year old dad had a tough time getting off of the boat and putting his shoes back on. The staff actually sat on the ground to help him put his shoes back on and walked with us all the way to our vans to make sure that he was okay. This speaks to their professionalism and caring. I highly recommend this company not only for the fun, but for their crew."

I went solo on this trip since many people that were with me had already seen Tulum. I booked the tour through the resort I was staying at in Riviera Maya. I was the first person to get picked up in the morning for the shuttle bright and early at 6:00am. The shuttle was extremely clean and comfortable. We picked up two more guests and then headed to the dolphin adventure cove. This is their main meeting point for their guests to get some coffee, cookies, and wake up a little. It was a great spot since you got to see the dolphins swimming. Once everyone in the group arrived we split into 2 shuttles and took another 45 minute drive to Tulum. When we got to the parking lot we were given water and snacks to bring along with us on the tour. (Take the water, it is super hot walking around the ruins) Our guided was wonderful. She ended up having to take two tours which meant she had to do the tour in english and then in german. Our guide brought us around the main points of the ruins which took about 45 minutes. Then she left it up to the group as to how much free time we wanted to explore. I walked around the ruins by myself for about 45 minutes and then headed back to the parking lot since there was street vendor shopping there. I bought a fresh cut coconut because it is my favorite drink to have on vacation. We then all gathered back at the shuttles and they brought us back to each of our resorts. Total time was from 6:00am-1:30pm. Like I said a perfect quick trip with enough time to lay on the beach afterwards at your resort.Beware walking into the ruins there are people with giant iguanas trying to get you to hold them and take a picture for $5. Keep your hands down otherwise an iguana will end up in your hands before you know it. And if you do not like iguanas this might not be the trip for you. The iguanas are all over the ruins everywhere you turn."

Once our tour was done, we were given and hour on our own, we decided to swim in the ocean there, as I said it was extremely hot. We had a morning tour, wouldn't advise it for the afternoon. It's not a large place, so sandals will do and make sure to bring a hat and your bathing suit. There is a restaurant at the beginning so you can change once your on your way out.

We especially enjoyed the Cavern Adventure. It can be a little bit intimidating at first, since you are going to swim inside a dark cavern for about a hour with fishes swimming around your legs and bats sleeping overhead, but you get used to the darkness and coolness very quickly and it is truly a life-time experience.

We were collected on time by our fab driver at 06:20 prompt and driven for an hour plus to the destination. My girlfriend is gluten free and as there was no hotel breakfast available, was offered a banana on the bus! Nine (9), yes that's right 9 (nine) hours later we finally got some food! Now I'm not ignorant but to sit for six hours on a boat with nothing! I mean come on! We found a shark, cool, all told 8 people 20 mins in the water, 3 hour boat ride back! Crazy worthless tour. I was nearly in tears and my girlfriend was! Absolute waste of time and money. I suppose we should be grateful that at last we weren't forced the commemorative DVD for a million quid on top! Any hoow, we cancelled the remaining tours we had booked as we'd heard bad reviews about those too and stayed by the pool. My recommendation is! Don't be ripped off by all the commercial scum trying to make a quick buck. And to Mr Cancun Adventure I would seriously recommend a thorough price review about your services and value for money! Because your Way Way, off the mark! And don't worry, I'll make it my lifetimes ambition to let everyone know. 12 hour trip! Paul and the other guide were cool, but 480 dollars! Nah! Sorry, I ain't having that!!!!!!"

The snorkel guide, Kelvin, did a fantastic job taking us right to all of the animals. The swim over the coral reef was amazing too. The Cenote was also nice. Peaceful and beautiful. Our van driver, David, was very friendly and talked a lot about the area. I highly recommend this company over similar ones. Great staff!"

He made you stop and think outside of the box.When we got to Akumal, Javo was also well trained in keeping us safe while being able to enjoy snorkeling without disrupting the Eco System.Javo and Carlos were very professional yet so animated- making the trip so enjoyable and safe for everyone. From the moment we stepped on the bus we were offered water, snacks, umbrellas for the sun, even cooled washcloths after visiting Tulum, which of course was very hot. We would recommend this tour with these guides 100% without hesitation. Safety was always first and foremost."

            "review": "Awful experience in a tiny boat on rough ocean for 6 hours IE: Whale Shark Excursion. This excursion costs $225 US per person. We had a nice air conditioned van as advertised. Snacks and water were available in the van. We arrived at the dock and were advised to rent a wetsuit for an additional $15 US - not included in the $225 US. We then waited to board our boat. There were 100 to 125 other people waiting for the same excursion that day. Many of them with the same company as us and many others with different companies. It appeared that our company did not have dedicated boats for the excursion. instead as we arrived our guide went to find us a boat. I don't know if it was just bad luck but we ended up in a small fishing boat (a lancha) that could fit 6-8 people. we loaded the boat and left the dock. The sea was rough and we had to go at a snails pace to get to the area where the whale sharks should have been. Becuase of the size of our boat we had to pound against every wave even though we went very very slow. every wave we hit splashed up into the boat and soaked all of us the entire time. (six hours)almost every other boat was equipped to handle the waves and they tore past us going 2 to 3 times faster than us and they just skipped through and over the waves with no splashing and no pounding. (we could see the passengers lounging in the boat as they passed us)Many of those other boats that passed us were able to travel farther and find the whale sharks. we were not. we were told that there would be a bathroom available to us on the boat - there was not - again because of the boat size we were stuck with. We were forced to jump in the water to go to the bathroom and then climb back on the boat to continue being battered by the waves and the water. we were fed homemade ham and cheese sandwiches with sodas after about 4 hours on the rough ocean. we were told and it is advertised that a photographer would be available with us to take pictures of our experience with the whale sharks and we would be able to purchase the pictures after the experience. there was no photographer on board and if we had found the whale sharks i would have been very upset that the photographer was not there. finally another boat from the same company as us pulled up along side us and as they did we could see that all the passengers were sunbathing on the upper deck of the nice large boat, others were laying down and sleeping and none of them were wearing life jackets or wetsuits (which were both a necessity for us because of the waves and water) we were not able to even stand up or lay down or anything for the entire 6 hours because of our boat. it is advertised that we would receive a nice lunch after the excursion and then be able to snorkel on a reef near isla mujeres. We were told that we would not be doing either of those things and we would return to shore. the other larger and nicer boat did stop at the reef for snorkeling, but we only sat on the boat and were battered for another 2 hours as we returned to shore. This was really a terrible, uncomfortable and, overall awful experience. none of the people on the boat with us were happy with the experience. We had a terrible boat for the condition of the ocean, it went too slow to see the sharks, the waves soaked us continually, other boats zipped past us comfortably and were able to lay around in the boat and see the whale sharks, we had to go to the bathroom in the ocean, we were not taken to isla mujeres to eat, and we did not get to snorkel at the reef, and no photographer accompanied us to provide pictures. really a terrible experience. If you attempt this excursion - which was supposed to be the highlight of our trip. do not board a tiny little boat like the one we were stuck with - some how request a large comfortable boat so that the experience is enjoyable.this excursion was not as advertised and not recommended under these circumstances. if you are able to have a different boat then it would be completely different and worth the time and money."

His name was Javier (we called him Javo). He was extremely knowledgeable about every aspect of the tour. We originally booked a tour of the ruins and swimming with the tortugas. Unfortunately, due to the stormy weather, the water was too cloudy to swim with the turtles. After given several options, we chose to replace that part of the day with snorkeling in a cenote. It was a great experience. We ended our day with a great lunch and a siesta on a beautiful beach which was included in the tour. Awesome fish tacos!!! We will definitely book tours with Cancun Adventures in our future Thanks to Javo and his driver, Luis!!!"

The price was right and the quality was unreal. Javier and Antonio picked us up from our resort and made us feel welcome. We went and picked the other groups and were taken off to tulum. On the way Javier showed his incredible historical knowledge and language proficiency. It was obvious he was passionate about his job and enthusiastically provided the group English and Spanish speaking people with historical facts, environmental facts, and logistics. He gave us a great tour around tulum and then let us free time to walk around. After the free time we walked back to the bus and my boyfriend and I got lost Antonio had his eye out and wrangled us back to safety luckily. We were then taken to a beach to see sea turtles. What really set this tour apart is the environmental concern for the turtles and the coral from Javier and Antonio. We saw atleast 7 giant sea turtles in their natural habitat two stingrays and a small octopus. The reef is pretty destroyed due to people lacking environmental respect and walking all over the reef. Javier enforced rules and expressed general concern for the animals and environments well being which is very important to us. After the excursion Antonio and Javier took all of our gear and got us all loaded up and drove us to a killer Mexican restaurant on the beach off the beaten path where there was live music and an excellent traditional Mexican buffet which was included in the excursion price. They then drove us all back to our resorts and had us back exactly when they said. Javier and Antonios skill and work ethic made the trip great! Would book again!"

Two friends and I decided to check out the ruins and go snorkelling to see the Sea Turtles (a dream of mine). Our morning started off great, we went to the ruins and were very well educated by our tour guide Hector. The ruins are absolutely beautiful, I think everyone should check them out - he ensured that we all heard the information and got to ask questions. Not once did we feel rushed. After the ruins, we made our way to snorkelling - so so so amazing! The swim was very casual, with all different levels of swim experience. Hector helped out a guest who seemed to be a little panicked, he kindly calmed her and assisted her for the rest of the snorkelling experience. Hector also made sure that everyone got to see the turtles, sting rays and different fish.Up next was lunch, great options (as I am a vegetarian), they had tacos, ceviche, pasta, rice and beans. No complaints about anything.Side note: I have traveled to many places, and have had many tour guides. Hector went above and beyond what was expected of him at all times. Always answering questions and giving more information than necessary - it felt like we were hanging out with a friend and not a teacher. He always helped when needed and had a great sense of humour. Thank you for an amazing experience, and a trip I'll never forget."

The service was impeccable with any need met at a moment's notice. The only change I would have liked to see was to allow more freedom while snorkeling. It was difficult to snorkel and to enjoy the surroundings with so many people on top of one another. I got kicked, and inadvertently kicked others, because we had to stay in a compact group. Had there been more freedom, it would have been a far more enjoyable snorkel adventure. But the cruise far outweighed the downside of the brief snorkel trip."

My husband and I went on a tour of the Mayan ruins at Tulum and then snorkeling with the sea turtles at Akumal, what an amazing experience! Our tour guide, Jocelyn, was a fantastic guide and she and Abelarde, our driver, provided water, snacks, and a lively atmosphere for our group. We left around 8:30am and returned to our resort at around 3:30pm which was a perfect amount of time. The ruins at Tulum are really spectacular but be prepared, it is very hot and it is useful to put some bug spray on before going. Snorkeling at Akumal was our favorite part of the trip. We were able to see the reef, several turtles and stingrays and have an all around enjoyable experience. After snorkeling we were able to go to a beach club for lunch and drinks which was very relaxing after a day of activity.My only advice is to wear your bathing suit underneath something that is easy to take on/off. There are not really places to change into your bathing suit when you get to Akumal. Several people in our group needed to change and there was some confusion as to where/when that would be possible. Also I would recommend wearing some type of comfortable sandal or water shoes since you will be walking a lot at Tulum but will need to have something that easily transfers to the beach."

There are a lot of warnings to keep a safe distance from them but you get very close. It was a great experience. The experience itself was wonderful but it was definitely made better by our guide, Uri! Uri's understanding of Mayan culture in general and Tulum in particular was impressive and his enthusiasm while presenting was contagious. I'm not always terribly excited about excursions, but Uri changed that quickly. He was excellent and had me ready for the tour. Afterwards, he arranged for Juan (our driver) to take us to what I assume was a restaurant locals frequent for lunch which was delicious! If you do this tour through Cancun Adventures I recommend requesting Uri (if they allow that kind of thing)."

Saw the Tulum ruins first, got tons of fascinating info from Ara about both the ruins and the Mayan people and culture, then headed to Akumal beach/bay, and swam with the turtles (and tons of other animals/fish). Obviously they can't make wildlife show up just for our entertainment, but we saw around 15 different turtles while we were snorkelling, and tons of fish among the coral reefs. Would love to come back for the whale shark experience one day... finished up with a luncheon at a little bar away from the busy part of the beach, almost like it was all to ourselves. Great food, and drinks. Highly recommended!"

One of our favourite days in Mexico was spent with Gabo (an EXCEPTIONAL guide - professional, knowledgeable and accommodating) on a day tour with Cancun Adventures.We took the Tulum Akumal tour, which starts with a 2 - 3 hour tour of the Tulum ruins, followed by snorkelling with turtles at Akumal. My elderly mother decided not to snorkel, so waited at a beachfront cafe where she could sit with a cocktail watching the rest of the family during that portion of the trip.Gabo is one of the best guides we have ever had (and we have done a lot of private tours). The whole day was very well run, by a very professional tour company."

The captain of our catamaran was Sergio, who like all of the others, was very fun to talk with and did a great job getting us to our destination. The two sailors on board were Victor and Charlie. These guys were hilarious and contributed to the very fun/laid back atmosphere. Our photographer was Alberto \"Beto\" who got some great shots thoughout the trip and worked very well with the rest of the crew to provide anything and everything that all of us on board needed.This was the first time that my wife and I had used Cancun Adventures for an excursion and we cannot wait to go again!!

We were recommended to do the Snorkeling & Paddleboarding excursion by Apple Vacations, and we thought it sounded fun, but we were extraordinarily disappointed. First and most important, we were told upon getting there that we needed to put sunscreen on before getting on the boat, because we weren't going to be allowed to put sunscreen on after getting on the boat, because it hurts the barrier reef. I'm all for protecting the environment, but after 4 hours on a boat in the blazing sun and multiple rounds of swimming, both my husband and I were very burnt (despite having towels draped over us much of the time) and as a result we both got very sick for the rest of our vacation. This tour literally ruined the bulk of our vacation. The excursion was disappointing in other ways too, though. The barrier reef was clearly dying and the snorkeling was lackluster. Paddleboarding shouldn't even be listed in the title, because they have 2 paddleboards for 15 people to share over the span of 30 minutes, so there's not really a chance to try it. And the water where we were supposed to paddleboard was so choppy that only the people who had a lot of experience were really able to pull it off. The \"lunch\" that was provided was offered 3 hours into the excursion (which for us was around 4pm - we hadn't eaten since 9am, since the brochure said lunch would be provided), and it was the size of a small bento box that was meant to be shared by 2 people. The vast majority of the excursion is spent on the boat waiting to get to and from the place where we snorkeled, so there was about 3 hours of just sitting on the boat and 1 hour of actually doing anything. What's more, during one of the big waves, my knee got slammed into a metal rod and I came away with a giant bruise and when they stopped for the paddleboarding, I got out to swim, but they anchored the boat in too shallow of water and I slammed my foot against a rock when I jumped in and cut my foot and it was sore for the next 3 days. The only positive was that the staff on the boat was nice."

Our shuttle picked us up and took us to the meeting point where we were able to stretch out, grab a quick refreshment, and watch dolphins swim while we waiting for our guide. A nice change from sitting on a bus for an hour while it visited each resort picking up passengers.Our tour guide was Gabo - and his knowledge of the ruins, Mayan culture, local foods, and local wildlife was incredible. He led us through the ruins, explaining in great detail the history and culture of the Mayan people. He shared a few native delights with us including roasted grasshoppers - which my 6 year old daughter requested seconds!On the way back to our resort, Gabo answered questions about the Yucatan peninsula and recommended places to eat in Playa del Carmen.

Our tour guide, Javo (Javier), was absolutely fantastic and was always 100% passionate about what he was doing. He told us at the beginning of the trip that we were his \"family\"' for the day, and he absolutely lived up to that promise by treating the entire group with courtesy and respect. Tulum was VERY hot and sunny, but was gorgeous and well worth the walking, sweating, and sunburn. I would recommend taking the advice of the tour guides and bringing at least 2 bottles of water (provided in the tour van) and the umbrella to block the sun as well. Javo painted a wonderful picture of how the Mayans used to live within the walls of this city, and even supplemented the actual ruins with pictures and background information while riding in the van on the way there. Akumal was fabulous as well! Javo took extra time to orient the entire group to the rules of the area and was very passionate about following those rules in order to protect the environment that the sea turtles currently live in. We were able to see lots of sea turtles and Javo was also very good about pointing out other sea creatures we came across as well! My husband and I brought our own snorkeling equipment for this part of the trip, but the provided equipment was in very good condition as well. My mask broke part way through snorkeling, but Javo was prepared with an extra mask so I could switch out and continue enjoying the trip without any delay!Lunch was provided at a private beach club after both of these adventures which was a nice relaxing way to end the day. The good was great and the little bit of free time to enjoy that area was great as well. Our driver, Tony, was very helpful to the entire group as well. Not only did he do a wonderful job driving, but he also took time to help keep the group organized and get the supplies ready for us for each part of the day's adventures!"

Pepe and Carlos E. continued to keep all of us safe and entertained. We had a short break with a nutritious snack and cold bottled water readily available at all times.

The driver picked us up promptly from the hotel, then picked up our tour guide Hector on our way out to Tulum. Hector gave us a bunch of historical information en route to Tulum, giving us the option to hear as much as we wanted or as little as we wanted. He was very courteous, fun and very knowledgeable. He made everyone feel super comfortable. Tulum was awesome. It gets hot and busy as the day progresses, as there is very little shade at the actual sight (fortunately my girlfriend took up the driver on the umbrellas they were lending us). In fact Hector explained that we could have gone to Akumal first, but he knew after a hot morning in Tulum that snorkeling with the turtles would be the perfect wrap around, and it was! The beach over which Tulum sits is beautiful, we took several pictures at the top of the cliffs when we had some free time. The best part of the tour for me was when I had asked Hector if they offer life jackets at Akumal because my girlfriend doesn't know how to swim (I was really worried that they might not let her participate because of it). I mentioned that I am a lifeguard back in the States, and was planning to help her along as we floated through that part of the tour. Well, it just so happens that life jackets are required for everyone. As soon as she started getting discouraged, Hector offered her his lifesaving ring for her to float on it while he and I pulled her. He was not going to easily let her pass up on the beauty and awesomeness that we experienced at Akumal, and we are extremely grateful for this. Hector saved the day. That being said, I wouldn't suggest that a bunch of non-swimmers to go on this trip, as the tour guide has to make it enjoyable for everyone. Since he was comfortable with my lifeguard background and the fact that I could easily keep her in tow, he had more opportunity to interact with the group and help to spot turtles. The water was warm and not choppy at all; I don't think I saw anything resembling a wave in the area we were - perfect for snorkeling.We finally finished the tour with a free buffet and one free alcoholic beverage at Xpuha, which was the perfect ending to a perfect day. We all were dropped off to the Hotel around 4pm, leaving us with plenty more day to enjoy (we headed straight to bed, then woke up and shared memories of our fantastic day over dinner). We thoroughly enjoyed this tour! Thank you so much Hector! And to the driver (I'm sorry I forgot your name), thank you for watching our things while we were enjoying the tour!THINGS YOU WILL NEED OR WANT TO BRING: Bio-degradable sunscreen for the Akumal portion of the tour, and an underwater camera (disposable will suffice). I wish I had remembered to bring the underwater disposable camera, my girlfriend would have loved it. I had done this while diving in Hawaii and always love looking back at the pics I took of the underwater sea life."

Lots of opportunities to take pictures without being rushed and a good pace to the tour.Upon arriving back to the van, nice cold cloths were provided by Jose and Hector as well as water. Next it was off to swimming with the sea turtles. After a brief time of everyone getting fitted with lifejackets it was about an hour of warm water and several sitings of turtles and other marine life. A buffet at a local establishment completed the adventure for me and my two children ( 19 and 17 yrs). Definately recommended. A few notes: 1. Security of personal effects was never in doubt. Somebody always was there to look after our gear.2. Good group size - about 12. 3. Bring bio-degradeable sun screen. We only had the regular kind and it is supposed to be bio-degradeable and we ended up getting our shoulders burnt...otherwise keep your shirt on. 4.

We started off at Tulum which was beautiful but HOT! After the tour we were welcome back in the van with cold and refreshing towels which helped a lot! Then off to Akumal. Akumal had asked for people snorkeling to use biodegradable sunblock to help preserve the reef, so purchase that beforehand. We saw a handful of turtles, which was awesome! Then we drove to a place with a beautiful beach and was served a delicious lunch and drinks. Abi was a great driver, always assisting us from the van, watching our items during the tour and getting us to and from our destinations safely. Gustavo was a great tour guide, providing a lot of interesting information in the van, at Tulum and throughout the rest of the trip. We would definitely do another trip with Cancun Adventures!"

Our tour guide was very passionate and loved to share his wealth of knowledge of this amazing archaeological site. It was hot out so he was kind enough to draw us together in the few shady areas which was much appreciated. We got about 40 minutes to walk around and take in the beach area. This was my 2nd time to Tulum, the beach is not as beautiful as it was 10 years ago but I suppose that happens after hurricanes. From there we went snorkeling with the sea turtles at Akumal. Our guide Reece was excellent!! It was obvious that he has a passion for the safety and wellness of all animals and their habitats. He was very thorough with snorkeling instructions and made sure everyone was safe and having a good time. He even remembered all 12 of our names! We saw several sea turtles and sting rays and beautiful fish. From there, we had a delicious lunch and beverages, then we went far back into the middle of nowhere to snorkel in a refreshing Cenote. The ride from Playa del Carmen was a bit long but the day was so much fun! I would recommend this trip to someone who has never snorkeled before or hasn't snorkeled a lot - with a small group and awesome guide, it makes for a very fun-filled, relaxing day."

            "review": "Tulum and Turtles make for a great day :). We signed up for this tour after a recommendation from our travel advisor. Manuel and Thamara came to our hotel right on time to get is and were really friendly. One of the first things she asked was if either of us had any food alergy's. We appreciated this because my husband is severely allergic to nuts. We went to a few other hotels and got more guests. Once we were together, Thamara gave us a choice of going to see the turtles first, or going to Talum. She stated the pros and cons of each option,(ie, turtles first = less people, but Talum would be hot, Talum first, not so hot, but turtles would have lots of people). Our group decided on swimming with the turtles first and Talum second. We were given time at the last hotel pickup to change into our suits. The whole time we were in the van on the way to Akumal, Thamera made sure we were all good with the rules, and that we understood all of her different hand signals she was going to use while we were in the water. Once we were in, we saw turtles almost immeaditly. It was an amazing sight. Thamara made sure we all knew where the turtles were, and that we all stayed together. We also saw an amazing coral reef. After we were out of the water, we were given time to rinse off and change out of our wet clothes, and have a provided snack of cookies and bananas. Manuel stayed with the van at all times, so it served as a rolling locker room. We were then off to Talum. On the way there, Thamara gave us a presentation on a tablet about the history of Talum and of the Mayan people. When we arrived, it was really hot, but we were provided with big umbrellas, and lots of ice cold water. Thamara gave an excellent guided tour touching on points she had told us about in the van, followed buy \"free time\" so we could roam and explore. When we got back to our meeting point, Manuel was waiting with ice cold towels and more water. We were then brought to a little restaurant on the beach for a provided lunch. Not the best food, but defeinetly ok. All and all we had a great time, and we are glad we had Thamara as our guide and Manuel as our driver. Two things to note, if you are booking this trip, be sure to let your travel advisor know if you have feet bigger than a size 13, or where prescription glasses. My husband has a size 15 foot, and luckly was able to fit barely into the flippers. We both wear glasses. Thamara told us if they had known, prescription goggles could have been provided."

Yummy food, hammocks, and swings instead of barstools. I could have stayed longer! We were back to our resort on time, tired, but stoked from such a great day. And there was energy left over for a fun evening at the resort."

The snorkeling was fun too. We saw lots of turtles and some fish in the coral. If you want to see lots of fish this may not be the tour for you. Alina was wonderful and patient with the newer snorkelers. After snorkeling we went to another beach for a lunch buffet and drinks. We felt very taken care of and would definitely go again!!!"

After discussing whether or not to go about this tour ourselves or book it through our hotel, I am so glad we booked it through our hotel (Platinum Yucatan Princess). Our driver was Jose and he was extremely friendly and helpful. Our guide was Hector. I cannot even express how great of a tour guide he was. He was very knowledgeable and super friendly. These two guides were detrimental in the expanding of our deeper understandings and appreciation of Mayan culture and for the area itself. They provided us with nice, cool face towels after a sweaty hike at Tulum and as well as with cold bottles of water and snacks to help us refuel. We then were off to Akumal bay to snorkel with the turtles. Not only did we see turtles but so many other sea creatures. It is well worth it. Hector swam around with us and made sure to point out the various marine life. It is also integral to point out that the buffet lunch that is included was absolutely delicious. The tacos were the best I've ever had. There is also a habanero sauce that is extremely hot, but worth a try. It is noteworthy to point out that this buffet is all you can eat too. We can't even express how much we loved this day. It was great. Ask for Hector and Jose! They are absolutely fantastic and take the worry out of the day. Couldn't recommend them and this tour any more! Thanks guys!"

(Not anyone to do with the tours fault) But this really was the only blip on what turned out to be an amazing day! We went straight to Tulum in a small mini bus which was nice cool and air conditioned, the driver (Jose) was very smiley happy and polite even though his English wasn't great. We picked up Uri and Pepe (our guides) on route and then they started giving us some background of Tulum before our arrival, they were very interesting and Uri's fluency in English and French was very impressive! They brought such a happy upbeat atmosphere to the group and made a special effort to make sure everyone was ok all the time. When we arrived at Tulum again Uri was great at making it very interesting for everyone and it allowed us to appreciate the history of Tulum as well as the beauty of it! It really was a special spectacular place with great views! Then we left for Akumal and this is when Pepe really was excellent! My girlfriend was very nervous of snorkelling so he gave her and one other lady special attention while Uri continued with the rest of us. He was so polite and encourage my girlfriend soon left the safety of his life ring and was swimming around and since has said it was on of the best things she has ever done. Considering she started off scared that is amazing and I do put that down to Pepe's patients and encouragement. (I was too busy turtle watching). We saw loads of turtles, some stingrays, fish and one barracuda! It was excellent and everyone should do it!!! On the way back we went to a beach club for a bite to eat before we returned to our hotel. The food was nice and we didn't stay too long which was good because we had an excellent and day and we were now happy to just return to our hotel. We are so happy we picked this tour, it was the perfect balance of culture, sightseeing and snorkelling! Would just like to say thank you so much to Pepe and Uri for making it extra special and to Jose for being a constant smiley face and a good driver!"

Next you take a dip in one of the cenotes and practice snorkeling. After you end off going to the beach and snorkel amongst the coral reef where I saw sea turtles, sting rays and a variety of tropical fish.The ruins were breathtaking. Something I really wanted to do in Mexico. It was so hot though. Bring sunscreen and maybe even an umbrella if you need to. The tour in the cenote was refreshing and really neat. The snorkeling in the ocean was cool. I got to see a lot of different fish and turtles. Mario was our tour guide and he did a great job. Very funny, personable and knowledgeable.

We had about 45 minutes in the van as we travel all over the place to pick up other guests. The hotels we were picking people up at were no where near each other. They should've split up the vans better so that we wouldn't have had such a long ride. There were 37 people on the catamaran with us, which is way too many people on a boat that size. It was like you were crawling on top of other guests the whole time, and people's stuff was all over the place. It took about an hour to reach the coral reef. Personally, I love catamarans, but my boyfriend started feeling a little sick after we had been sailing for awhile. When we got to the coral reef, we got in the water as a gigantic group and we were supposed to \"follow our leader\". We got kicked in the face by the 35 other people who were with us. It scared off all the sea creatures because of the huge group. We decided to swim off on our own a bit and we saw so many cool things. We were face to face with a gigantic sea turtle. We also saw countless sting rays and beautiful coral. It was so much better when we stayed away from the group. We weren't in the water for very long before they told us to come back to the boat. As soon as we were sailing again, my boyfriend became extremely ill. Several other guests were feeling sick as well. The crew took great care of him, which we really appreciated. The food they provided was delicious. I tried paddle boarding and it was a lot of fun. They only let you go out on the board for about five minutes, so you don't really have time to practice. They also didn't really teach me how to do it. I had to figure it out on my own, which is why I almost crashed into a rock.Overall, I think if my boyfriend had not gotten sick that we would have enjoyed the trip more. But they really need to consider limiting their group sizes because 37 people was out of control."

We were surprised that our guide, Alina, was so well informed and passionate about her culture, country and people. She made the excursion amazing with all the information she provided and the way she delivered it. After exploring the ruins and snorkeling with the sea turtles, we saw about 9 turtles total, we stopped at a beautiful beach called Xpuha and ate some delicious fish tacos. The beach was off the beaten path and full of locals, which is just the way I like to take in the culture of a foreign country. I highly recommend this excursion and ask for Alina, you'll be lucky if you can get her."

The boat had 30 + people on it and we were not allowed to move around. There was no way to actually get drinks. The snorkeling was the worst snorkel experience I ever had-- anywhere. We were rushed, and only in the water for 35 minutes total!! The coral was in poor shape. There were three other boats there so at well over 100 people in a small area trying to see one turtle. There was no long board experience, and the food was a snack as we rushed back to port. The crew was nice, but that could not possibly make up for the lack of \"adventure\" experience. Unless you just want a motorized Catamaran ride, don't do this trip."

The tour company picked us up in a air conditioned bus and looked after us and provided us with history and directions. Tulum was amazing and rich with history. So much stuff to see and we took lots of pictures that we will treasure forever. Panoramic pictures from the cliffs over looking the ocean. We felt half a day was enough at Tulum but wished we had a full day at Xel-ha. Overall, a great adventure with no regrets and nothing but smiles afterwards. All I say is Enjoy and soak it all up. "

He kept the group tight...had a bunch of bananas with him to keep those cute sunfish close, along with lots of other fish. Unfortunately, we didn't we any stingray, but we did see turtles..and that is what I wanted to see! Sergio did a great job touring the reef with the group. (He is also a great flirt!)

Our guide, Enrique, was EXCELLENT; same goes for our driver, Andreas, who was on top of things even in particularly challenging traffic-related situations. Enrique was very knowledgeable and at the same time very friendly and accommodating (I am speaking from experience because we went on a cenote/ziplining tour with a different operator a few days earlier, and the guide was the complete opposite of Enrique personality-wise).Snorkeling in Akumal was definitely our favorite part (perhaps, since I had been to Tulum before, and my son got tired pretty quickly in the heat, although he enjoyed the ancient city enormously). The lunch in the beach restaurant (forgot the name) wasn't anything special in terms of food options, but it was a wonderful experience nevertheless because the restaurant itself was quite \"authentic\".P.S. Judging by other reviews here, it seems like Cancun Adventures have an eye for talent as far as tour guides and drivers are concerned :)"

One of the things I was most impressed by on this tour was Javo's use of our time. While we were in the van he would show us pictures and talk to us about where we were going next. We never felt like we were just sitting and waiting to go to the next thing. We stayed for 5 nights at the Secrets Silversands near Cancun, which is a stunning resort, but my husband and I both agreed that this excursion was the highlight of our whole trip!

Our guide Ernesto was fantastic. We started the excursion at a small cave so the group could \"get our feet wet\" snorkeling. My friend and I have experience snorkeling but it was a good chance to get used to snorkeling in caves. We then moved onto a larger cave which was awesome. We left the caves and drove to Akumel, which is a cove with turtles. Despite the cove being a huge tourist trap, it was an amazing experience. We saw several turtles! The best is when they surface near you! The one draw back to this whole excursion was the size of the group. There were 12 people and I think it would have been better at half this size. The group we were with were a group of spring breakers, half of which were hungover and throwing up. Thankfully Ernesto recognized that my friend and I were strong swimmers and let us go off away from the group. This made viewing the turtles even more amazing as there wasn't a group circled around the turtle. All in all, it was a great tour and I highly recommend it!!!"

Walking the grounds doesn't take long and we were in flip flops which easily allowed for a dip in the gorgeous beach that you can access. Perhaps that's what some people actual came for? Akumal was equally touristy, but a neat experience. We saw many loggerhead turtles swimming around. I was impressed that our tour included a valuable lesson about the ecology of the area and how important it is to adhere to regulations in place to help preserve the natural habitat. Unfortunately, many people were completely unaware and took little care to not step on coral or get too close to the turtles. This is actually a punishable offence.

NOTE: You can't use sunscreen right before you Snorkel due to the sea life - so don't use sprays or other short term screens. We got decent sunburn due to being out for 4 hours without option to use more sunscreen."

In that time we saw roughly a dozen sea turtles and the coral reef with many beautiful fish. The day ended with a late lunch not far from Akumal. I could have done without the food since we were staying at an all-inclusive, but it was decent and set on a nice beach overlooking the water.

            "review": "Awesome experience!. If you can, ask for a guide named Gustavo (he goes by Gus). He is not only very knowledgable about the Mayans and Mexican history in general, he is also very worldly and well-traveled. We learned sooo much about Tulum. It's actually pretty small, so I felt that the hour or so we were given to walk around (after Gus' informational session) was sufficient. Climbing the structures is strictly prohibited, which is another reason why you just don't need that much time in Tulum; you can only take photos from behind a rope, and you really only see one side of most structures. After we walked around the ruins on our own, we regrouped at a restaurant/store near the entrance, used the restroom, and grabbed some drinks to go. The store there also carries biodegradable sunscreen and waterproof disposable cameras that you can use while snorkeling (FYI). From there, we headed to the beach. Fins, masks, and snorkels were provided, along with mandatory life jackets. Yes, it was sanitary - the mouthpiece on the snorkel is disposable and we were all instructed to take them with us when we were done, to ensure they were not reused. Be aware that you cannot use regular SPF d/t concerns about the effects of sunscreen exposure on the sea turtles and coral reef. Purchase biodegradable sunscreen at home and bring it with you - it runs about $20-30 USD if you buy it there! Gus taught everyone how to use the mask and snorkel properly, so if you're not very experienced, it's no problem. However, you do need to be somewhat capable of swimming; the life jacket will keep you afloat, but you still need to be able to maneuver yourself in the water. Also - if you go out to the coral reef, you need to be able to keep away from the corals, as they are razor sharp and will cut you. I'm not sure how much time we spent in the water, but it felt like \"enough.\" We saw countless sea turtles, and once we went out to the coral reef, we also got to see lots of interesting fish. Our group was small (7 people, myself included), and I'd say that was just the right size for this type of tour. We were driven to another location for lunch after snorkeling, and the food was excellent! The included alcohol, however, was a thumbs down...my \"margarita\" was literally Squirt soda, a bit of tequila, and some tonic water! I ended up going to the bar that was NOT included in the tour and buying a drink, which tasted fine and was reasonably priced. After we had some time to relax on the beach, we headed back to our resort. One last tidbit here - there were no lockers on this excursion, so personal belongings were left in the van, which I assume was locked. We had the same van and driver all day so it was not an issue, but I wouldn't bring anything extremely valuable."

After all of the activity, we went to a quiet secluded beach for a wonderful meal and some relaxation. Perfect day!

My preference (and the way most operations I've used work) is to go out on my own as long as I stay in the area defined to me. Not only that but there was a very limited amount of time you were actually in the water snorkeling. The equipment was not great, almost everyone in our group (13 of us went in and a couple stayed out as there were no magnifying masks available for them) was having issues with water in their mouth pieces."

After the morning at Tulum, we went to snorkel at Akumal and we really enjoyed it. The day was overcast but my husband and I had an experience we will never forget. We were snorkeling together, holding hands, and a turtle on either side of us! I'm sure that we will never experience that again but it was amazing.

First good sign: the tour van arrived on time. Cancun Adventures has limit on # of people per excursion, so we had a small group of 8, which was great! The weather was perfect for a day in the jungles (cloudy and not sweltering). The best part of the tour was our tour guide, Jose!! He spoke English fluently and was very knowledgeable, but what really made him stand apart was his personality. He was SO FUNNY and made everyone feel very welcome. Literally, he had everyone belly laughing throughout the tour. Then, after the tour was over, they provided water and granola bars, which was great because everyone was famished.Tulum itself was amazing. The ruins were incredible and the surrounding jungle was picturesque. Tulum beach was better than the beach at our resort-so be sure to wear your swimsuit! I HIGHLY recommend this excursion.Tip: you are not allowed to bring in video cameras to the ruins, but digital cameras and phones are allowed."

The next day, the van picked us up on time and took us to their central location to wait for others. We promptly left when all parties arrived and we had a small group of 8 people. We first visited the Mayan Ruins in Tulum and received some great information from our tour guide Thamara. She has a wealth of knowledge and eagerly shared it with us. The ruins are absolutely amazing and a definite must see if you're in the area. I suggest that you go early because it gets hot quickly and there are many others touring the place as well. I couldn't believe all the people there- it actually became frustrating at times because people are in their own world and don't pay attention to others. Nevertheless, the place is beautiful and you can see the hard work the Mayans put into their village.Then we stopped at a restaurant to wait for the others to finish tour. We had a couple of Corona's and just relaxed. There is a shopping area in this location as well though, we didn't venture there.Next we were off to the Cenotes Dos Ojos. WOW...what an amazing place! These cenotes have not been touched and truly show their beauty because of this. Thamara once again had a vast amount of knowledge about these Cenotes and toured us through the pitch black cavern. The only light was from her flashlight and the little miner lights on our helmets. I was amazed to see the lime formations underground- so beautiful. I didn't like seeing the big bats or the HUGE spider (the biggest I've ever seen in my life!) but those made this experience so wonderful. We wore wet suits and so the water wasn't too bad.After we were done, we were driven right back to our hotel doorstep. Very professional staff and fun people. We were gone for a total of about 7 hours and back in time to still sit on beach and get some sun. I highly recommend Cancun Adventures, they are wonderful!"

Enrique, our driver, was not only a very conscientious driver, but I greatly appreciated the fact that he took care of my wife and another lady who did not participate in the snorkeling at Akumal. Our guide Yuri was extremely good. Not only very knowledgeable for someone not from this country, but very attentive to all of his guests needs. It was fun talking to him not only about the tour, but also about Montreal, as he had lived there for a few years. Great job both of you.There was never any pressure to move fast at either location. Actually, Yuri was more than happy to give us all the time we wanted. The turtle swim was awesome, we even saw two sting rays. Yuri really impressed me, as he had to tow a couple of our guests most of the way as they struggled with the snorkel.The meal was OK, nothing really wrong with it, but nothing to write about either.The only thing preventing me from giving this tour a five star rating was the cost. I felt that $139 each US was pricey, considering access to the beach is free, and access to Tulum is a modest 64 pesos, or about $ 5 US. Knowing that both wages and the price of gas are considerably lower in Mexico than in Canada and the US, it seems to me that the price could be much lower. But then again, this seems to be the norm on the Mayan Riviera. As a result, this was the only tour we took. We would have done more, had the prices been lower."

These guys where awesome!!! Javo has a true passion for what he does. His knowledge and enthusiasm was extraordinary and we never lost interest in what he was saying. Javo wanted to make sure everyone was having a great time and smiling was one of his requirements. I had never been snorkeling before and was really nervous. Javo showed me everything and even let me use his mask so I could see more. I probably wouldn't have been able to overcome my fear if he hadn't been there to calm me down. He is truly great at what he does!! These guys made our day unforgettable and we made memories that we will cherish forever."

The dive with the sea turtles was exhilarating. At lunch we were well served, and I believe I nodded off in the hammock.

You won't be disappointed!My wife and I recently made a trip to Playa Del Carmen and booked a trip down to Tulum to check out the ruins. After the ruins we took a short drive to a Mayan village where there are cenotes, zip lines, canoes, we drove jeeps through the jungle, and then had an authentic Mayan meal made for us.The trip was amazing! Our tour guide Delio was the best! It was the perfect mix of sight seeing, history, and some good old fun.Delio was extremely knowledgeable on Mayan history and culture. We really enjoyed his guiding, and he knew everyone! My wife and I speak very very little Spanish and he spoke perfect English and was extremely easy to understand. We shared our trip with a family of 3 who didn't happen to speak English. Delio was able to guide the whole trip transitioning between English and Spanish without skipping a beat! It was actually a lot of fun communicating with the other family through Delio, as well as him helping my wife and I with our Spanish.It was just an awesome all around experience with tons of memories. I will also say that the Mayan food was one of the best meals we had all week and they were all so generous. I would definitely go back!"

I would highly recommend bring a water proof camera w/ flash to take pictures. Wish I would have, but I do have the pictures and memory in my head. Tulum was an amazing historical site and Vincent was very knowledgeable about the site. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!"

It was a bit windy that day, but we were still able to see sea turtles, stingrays, and other beautiful fish along with the coral. Martina was very patient, and our driver, Manuel, was very helpful as well! We didn't realize there would be snacks & water provided, so that was nice! Afterwards, we went to another beach and had a buffet lunch, which was delicious! I would totally recommend this tour to others, even if they've snorkeled someplace else before!

            "review": "Great guide but felt ripped off. . We are a family of four with two girls, ages 9 and 11, and were traveling with a family friend the week of Feb 13 - 20th. We booked with Cancun Adventures through the Apple rep at our resort out of convenience and walked away feeling ripped off. We were picked up at our resort at 7:40 and taken to Cancun Adventures to meet our guide. Once we got there, no one seemed to know who was taking our group. Over the course of the next hour, we watched group after group leave with their guides while we continued to wait. Finally our guide was identified. We were introduced to our driver (who was great) and were told that our guide would meet us at Tulum. We arrived at Tulum and were given another ten minutes to use the restrooms, etc while our guide got our tickets. It was now after 9:00 - mind you we were picked up at 7:40. Our guide returned and we were finally in our way into Tulum - about a 10 minute walk. It was about this time that we realized we would not be in a small group as advertised in the brochure, but that there would be 26 of us. Our guide gave us the option of just going off on our own or following him, but really, I felt like he was just trying to get rid of people. Everyone stayed. He said instead of taking us from site to site, he would take us to the highest point where we could see everything to give us some history, and then we could wander on our own until 11:45. After an hour of standing in the hot sun at the back of a large group so we couldn't hear much, we took off. And I'm glad we did because we barely had enough time to see everything. If we had stayed with the group, we would not have seen half of what we did. At this point, our girls were very hungry. The driver met us with cold cloths, bananas, and cold water, which was all much appreciated. We did not see our guide again and were off to Akumal where we would meet a different guide. Things were better there, and we were back down to a group of 13. We met our guide, whose name I believe was Yohel - he was young with crazy (but awesome) hair. He was so helpful and kind. My daughter first had trouble finding a life jacket and fins small enough - he was very attentive and helped her with making sure everything fit properly. We met up with another guide so we would have one at the front of the group with a life preserver and Yohel at the back. He was very kind to our daughter who was a nervous snorkeler, and had no problem with letting her hold on to the preserver. When my husband and daughter were ready to go back in, he went with them, as we were all almost done anyhow. It was about 1pm before we left for lunch at a private beach club. Lunch was just not good. The buffet was the worst set up I have ever seen and the food was cold and poorly prepared. Again, Yohel was great, bringing us margaritas and cold beer - soda for the kids. We had some time after lunch to lounge in the hammocks and Yohel again found us to bring us some drinks to go. He was fun to chat with and I wish we had more time to talk with him. We left around three and were back to our resort by 4pm. We wouldn't book through Cancun Adventures again, but would love to privately book our driver and guide in the future if the opportunity ever presented itself - I think that would make a fantastically fun day. CA itself just didn't seem to have it together and for $139/pp, I expected a better overall experience."

Luckily Pato and Abi had granola bars and bananas already packed in the van for us (thank you!!) :) The ruins in Tulum were amazing and Pato was very knowledgeable/funny and we learned a lot of facts. Then, we went snorkling with turtles which was again amazing and Abi was so kind and was guarding our towels, sandals, sunglasses while were in the water. They then took us to a Mexican buffet restaurant that is attended by locals and it was right along the beach. The food and the beach was amazing, you had a great view of the sea and eating/drinking. We had a such a great experience with Cancun Adventures that we decided to go on their excursions next time we are in Cancun."

Then the next day we were in the competent hands of Michelle, Paul, Darwin and crew on a beautiful catamaran sail boat. We motored out to the reef where we saw sting rays, a turtle and hundreds of colorful fish on the reef. We ate our delicous box lunch with open bar as we sailed peacefully back to the quiet bay near the harbor. There we could paddle board or swim in the quiet waters...still open bar. Both of these excursions were the highlight of my Carribean , winter escape. Now how to deal with our snow in Chicago!!!! I want to return!"

His knowledge and facts shared on both the ruins, sea turtles, and local history was so informative, interesting, and fun. We were misinformed by Amstar on the amount of walking and terrain in regards to our handicapped son, but both Enrique and Manuel with Cancun Adventures, were so considerate of his needs, helping him continue on with our group at a pace he could handle. Our group all knew each other so it was easily accepted, but it didn't really slow us down because of how Enrique incorporated his needs into the tour. Enrique's passion of nature shows in his tour making it feel as though he is a friend sharing rather than a dry tour guide rattling off facts. Would recommend this company for tours anytime."

They will put people together based on their language making it easy for the guides to talk with the group. We were picked up right on time in front of our hotel lobby. Our guide was Mau and our driver was Carlos and we could not have asked for two more friendly and helpful people. Mau was very knowledgeable about the history of Tulum and the Yucatan peninsula in general. He was also very knowledgeable about Mayan culture and guided us around the ruins as he explained all the sights. We were given some free time time to go down to the beach at Tulum or to wander around the ruins some more before we were to leave for Akumal and swim with the turtles. It was very hot at the ruins but when we arrived back at the van our driver Carlos had cold water and cold towels to cool us off (Nice touch). We then headed off to swim with the turtles in Akumal. Again Mau was very informative and explained all about the turtles and their habitat. Carlos got everybody outfitted with gear and Mau gave us a short lesson in snorkeling and we were off to swim with the turtles. We had two guides while snorkeling Mau and Kelly, we followed them around the bay and they helped us find turtles and kept us from getting separated (Akumal is a very popular and busy place). The turtles were spectacular and as a bonus we also saw a Stingray and some other reef fish. We were in the water for about 45mins to an hour. After the snorkeling everyone was hungry and ready to eat. Carlos drove us to our last stop, a small beach called Xpu-Ha where there was a restaurant with a buffet dinner. There was plenty to eat and the food was good. We ate and wandered around the beautiful beach area for a half hour before we boarded our van for the short trip back to our hotel. I would like to say thanks to Mau and Carlos you both made the trip enjoyable and memorable for us."

We were picked up at our hotel promptly the morning of our outing by our guide Lucy and driver Renee. Lucy did a great job introducing everyone in our group and making us all comfortable. She gave us a thorough overview of the day on the way to Tulum and provided us with some very interesting information leading up to our tour. Once we arrived at Tulum, she did a fantastic job of providing historical and anthropological facts during the first portion of the tour. She then allowed us all time to explore the grounds on our own. It was the perfect blend of tour and free time. Following Tulum, we regrouped and headed out to the cavern. On the way Lucy provided more information on the region and geography around the cavern. All of the information she gave was very interesting and really provided a great platform for the tour. Swimming in the cavern was a very relaxing and amazing experience. Everyone is given a life vest and a head lamp so there was not any fear of getting lost. Lucy took a very slow pace and made sure to point out some of the more interesting features within the cave. After finishing, the group loaded back into the vehicle and we headed to a very nice Mexican buffet on the beach where we ate a laid back lunch and had some free time. My husband and I found our way to some hammocks and enjoyed the surf. Overall, I would absolutely take a tour through this company again.

She ensured that all of our group (10) was well looked after and comfortable the whole time. After the guided portion and our free time we returned to the van where Raoul provided us with a cool towel and a snack of a granola bar and a banana. This was really appreciated and a very nice gesture. There was also unlimited bottled water available to us all day. We continued on to Akumal where we watched an educational video on the sea turtles and coral life we would be seeing. We were then kitted out with snorkeling equipment and headed into the water. The wind was a little high that day but at no time was anyone\u2019s safety compromised. Thamara and a second guide were always available for assistance and checked on the group frequently to ensure our comfort and safety. We saw many turtles, sting rays, fish of all different species and a great coral display. We were in the water for a full hour and enjoyed it immensely. One thing I would like to caution people on is the no sunscreen rule. It really is for the benefit of the coral and sea life. Even after being asked not to one of our group still slathered herself just prior to going in the water. Afterwards we headed off to a beach restaurant for lunch. We were provided with a nice buffet lunch and beverage and given as much time as the group wanted to just relax. All we could say at the end of the day was WOW! We highly recommend this tour group."

Carlos was our driver - helpful, friendly, funny. Javo our guide was fantastic, really knew the history of the area. Especially found his laptop pics interesting. So glad we booked the tour, I don't think we would have enjoyed Tulum as much as we did without Javo's info. Loved the snorkelling with the turtles, was my first time, I am going to practise at home, so I can do better for next year. Will be booking again next year. Thanks again Carlos & Javo!!!"

We were picked up at our hotel at 7.10am and taken to a meeting place for 8am to meet with our host for the day Javo. Who was a excellent host. We went to Tulum ruins where Javo certainly knew what he was talking about and made the tour very interesting. We then went to Akumul kitted up with our snorkel gear and saw turles and a stingray and this whisked away to a lovely beach club for amazing food and chilling out on the hammocks or luxury sun beds. I Javo was a excellent host who was very friendly, very approachable and made the experience a day to remember. Thank you."

Beautiful beach (we wish we had brought our swim gear!). They were flexible with time (asked us how much time we wanted to spend there for each part). The Sea Turtles did not disappoint, got to see a lot of them, nice to see them in a natural environment (not caged!), plus seeing the reef and all the bright and beautiful fish was such a bonus! It was nice that they provided snacks (protein bars, bananas, water) for those on the tour! The restaurant was kind of a let down, and I would have preferred skip it and go back to the resort instead, not much selection at the buffet and the food was kind of bland - although it was nice to have 1 drink included.Would definitely recommend this excursion to anyone!"

Our day began being picked up from our resort at 8:30am...we moaned and groaned at the early wake up, however we soon forgot about it as the day progressed. We picked up a few more people along the way and arrived in Tulum around 9:30am. The skies were blue and it wasn't overly hot, with a nice breeze. The walk from the parking area was about 15 minutes, and our tour guides Yuri & Tony made sure we had some cold water before we set out. The ruins were an amazing sight and Yuri was so knowledgeable about the history and vegetation. He took pictures whenever we asked him and even broke up an iguana fight! The views were breathtaking and overall it wasn't a ton of walking...the tour lasted about an hour and instead of free time to wander on our own, the group decided to head right for snorkeling! When we got back to our bus, the guys gave us granola bars, bananas, more water & cold cloths to cool down with. Twenty minutes later, we were in Akumal and after watching a short safety video, we headed down to the beach to get our life jackets and snorkel gear. My partner and I had our own, but we opted to use their masks as ours just weren't getting a good seal. A good tip to note is they will not allow sunblock unless it is biodegradable! You will get cooked out on the water, as we found out later that day if you do no wear sunblock! Once in the water, we got a quite lesson on snorkeling and then swam out to the reef. It didn't take long to spot our first Green Sea Turtle, accompanied by a Sharksucker, which apparently keeps the turtle's she'll in good health and also eats any bacteria and parasites. We ended up seeing a Hawksbill Sea Turtle, another Green Sea Turtle and then amazingly we saw a Spotted Eagle Stingray! What a sight to see! Yuri hadn't even seen one that close up before! We then saw a Southern Stingray buried in the sand right below where we were swimming. Also along our way, we saw Caribbean Reef Squids, Houndfish, Stoplight Parrot Fish, Blue Tangs, Bonefish, Blue Chromes, Bar Jacks & more fish I can't even remember! When we got back to the shore, Yuri commented on how we'd been out there for over an hour, which he's never done with another group before! After drying off and browsing in the souvenir shop, we headed out to the LaPlaya Xpuha Restaurant & Beach club, which was a little off the beaten path, but ended up being a fantastic atmosphere with a tasty buffet lunch. This beach was gorgeous, complete with swings at the bar! Then it was time to head back to our resort and end our little adventure. This excursion made our first trip to Mexico truly unforgettable and thanks to our guides, Yuri & Tony who were just fantastic and went above and beyond! We will definitely be back!"

We were picked up promptly at our hotel and transported to the Cancun Adventures location near Playa del Carmen. From there we broke off into groups depending on which tour you were taking (as they offer many different tours). We first drove to Akumal Bay with the driver and our Tour Guide Ernesto. Ernesto is extremely knowledgeable and provided us with a lot of information about what would we see, and was able to answer all the questions in great depth. At Akumal Bay we snorkelled and were able to see at least three turtles. It was quite amazing. Then Ernesto took us around the reef and we saw some fish, and later about 2 -3 stingrays. From there our group boarded the van and we drove down the road to the Cenotes at Dos Ohos. The first part of the tour at Dos Ohos was to snorkel in the smaller cave to get accustomed to the water temperature, and to see what it would be like in the cave. Then we walked a short distance to the larger cave. Ernesto guided us through the larger cave pointing out many interesting features and providing us with a lot of history of the caves. All in all it was a great day, and Ernesto was very entertaining.The tour itself was not too strenuous, however you should be a good swimmer."

I really wanted to go so I gave our guide, Javo, an exasperated high sign and over he came. He convinced my wife to hold a life ring he had and then proceeded to pull her throughout the entire 45 minute tour through the reserve.

Before going into the water make sure you know how to breathe with the snorkel!!! Tight seal with your lips. The guide brought in a life saver which I held onto as she led me throughout the water while I saw the amazing creatures of the ocean. I have never felt as calm in ocean (or in any body of water) than I did that day. The water is about 4 meters deep and the anxiety just goes away when you see the turtles.The ceynotes were great too the clarity of the water was such that I can see the many rocks and guppies that dwelled within.I hope this was helpful and I urge you, if you have the chance go for a swim and see some cool ocean life."

Thanks very much for a great time, Gus! - John and RayzaMore:We visited in January and had a fantastic time at the Tulum Ruins and then at the Cenotes (freshwater caverns). The Mayan ruins at Tulum were full of history and really beautiful, too. We had an incredibly knowledgeable guide who helped the ruins come to life and took the experience to another level. There were breathtaking views from the higher portions of both the ruins and the water. There's also a section of beach that is absolutely perfect, and I'd definitely plan on jumping in while you're there. The Cenotes were also fantastic. Walking and swimming through underwater caverns, carved over millions of years, was a rare and wonderful experience. The lunch was at a scenic place on the beach and provided a great meal.

When one of our group fell ill and had to be taken back, he showed amazing empathy and caring, waiting with her while the driver met her on the path and took her back. All in all a very enjoyable experience. My only complaint is that the site was very crowded which sometimes made it difficult to stay with the group. Not the company's fault in any way.

Swimming with the turtles was cool but we only got to see a few turtles. We mostly swam within the coral which was a dark colour. I wish we would have stayed closer to where the turtles and stingrays swim (away from all the coral). It was really hard on the body to swim as far as we did out. We did have life jackets but I would recommend this for strong swimmers. The restaurant we went to at the end was very relaxing and authentic. I would highly recommend the restaurant-La Playa. Overall I enjoyed the excursion."

Tulum ruins were good but not as impressive as the Chichen Itza ruins. Did not look like a wheelchair could be brought in but there may be a way - contact tour personnel. The beach at the ruins is BEAUTIFUL but we didn't have enough time to enjoy it. Went to the Cenote (means 'sinkhole' as well as something else). Road to Cenote was very bumpy but the snorkel through the cave was great! Water was kinda cold. Stalagmites and stalactites were impressive. They also have a preserve which contains crocodiles, spider monkeys, whitetail deer, various types of snakes, and flora and fauna. Served us lunch in a nice little restaurant on site which was tasty. After that we went to the beach at Akumal and snorkeled. Water again was pretty cool. Saw some turtles but not many fish and the coral was not impressive. It was about and 8 hour day with transportation. I would love to back to Tulum just to hang around on the beach!"

We received a snack, water and a cool, wet towel afterward. Then we went on to Mystic River Adventure, swimming into an underground Cenote! Alina helped me so much as I am not a swimmer and she made me feel very safe. We enjoyed this so much. Then lunch was provided at a beach side restaurant.

The cool towel after visiting Tullum was excellent! On to Akumul for snorkeling--the sea turtles and the coral reef was very nice! You will be fit with a good life vest and equipment--I don't consider myself a good swimmer, but because the equipment was good, I was confident I was going to be able to have a good experience--and I did! Lunch at the Beach Club was very nice also! The food was good, but the scenery and ocean views were spectacular! Avi--our driver was very accommodating, cleaned up after us, and was always there to assist. Great job to both Gus and Avi!"

We also continued on to snorkel with the turtles it was cool I think we saw half a dozen turtles in addition to some fish. Topped off with a trip to the beach club (think of the corona commercials and the guy on the beach). This is also a good trip for families.

The trip started off with are excellent chaperones Pato ( Patricia ) and Tomas giving us a nice wake up and a outline of the days activities as we were in route to pick up the other people in the tour. We arrived at Tulum first and Pato really knew a lot about the ruins and the way of life of the people. It was really cool. After a 30+ min tour we had our free time and looked at an amazingly spectacular view overlooking a cliff with blue waters. Then we went to the next stop at the beach and went snorkeling. Pato gave everyone a really good overview of the procedures and do's and don'ts for the reef and answered all questions very nicely. The snorkeling was around 45 minutes long and it was a very nice run for snorkeling. You got to see a handful of sea turtles some stingrays and some various fish along with some beautiful coral. Then after that we went back into the van for the late lunch and a local restaurant which was very good. On the way Pato gave us some advice on her favorite dish there, which were the fish tacos. Very good food in general but I can see why Pato raved about them so much. Very good adventure. Worth the time and money. A must see if you are visiting and this group with Pato and Tomas was the best tour yet. Muchas gracias guys for making my first trip to Mexico a memorable one."

My wife was having trouble and Yuri let her hang onto his float to make it easier for her. We saw at least 8 turtles, sting rays, and lots of fish in the coral reef. It was an amazing experience for us! Make sure to bring reef friendly sunscreen. (Not just biodegradable) Also a waterproof camera for the snorkeling. We didn't have one and sure wished we had. You can hire someone to take pictures for you, but it is not cheap.I must also mention our driver Thomas as he got us to and from the attractions in a safe and timely manner as well as helping with equipment."

He was knowledgeable about the fascinating history of the ancient Mayan holy city by the sea, as well as its surround flora and fauna. Gabo anticipated our small group's questions and answered them in interesting detail; individually and collectively. Gabo highlighted our tour across Tulum with samples of chapulines, a tasty dried and cured cricket that was an important protein source in the Pre-Columbian diet. Mayans did not have many animal proteins to eat because they had so few farm animals. So insects were an important food source. Our son-in-law said the Tulum tour with Gabo was the highlight of our visit to the Yucatan Peninsula. I'd have to agree."

We also swam through caverns in an experience I'll never forget. It was definitely a highlight. Since we had time we also visited a cenote and were able to jump into fresh water for a swim. Yolo was very nice and sweet to us all and I would definitely do another tour with her again. My only advice is for the company to let you know what to bring before leaving your hotel."

My wife is an elementary teacher and was very impressed with Javier's knowledge and the history he provided. Javier was friendly, funny, and incredibly helpful. I'm not sure how I can contact him but on our next visit my family would absolutely want to go on any tour he is guiding...he is just that good. We will recommend this tour to anyone we know going to the Riviera Maya or Cancun, and tell them to see if they can request Javier! For the actual tour, the amount of time at Tulum was perfect and the turtles we saw at Akumal were amazing! The lunch is at a 3rd location which draws the day out to about 3:30 but you get to see a lot in a little more than half a day. If you don't have 6 hours to give for the round trip to some of the other ruins, you get to see a LOT as well as snorkel with turtles. It was an awesome day!!"

As Tulum's just a few miles south of where we were staying (Grand Sirenis) I knew this tour would be a great fit for myself and my 11 year old daughter (she wouldn't have liked the long drive to and from Chichen Itza).There was a bit of confusion with the van pick-up - our resort had two lobbies and we were waiting in one while the van was at the other - which put us back about 15 minutes (the rest of the van seemed very forgiving!).Our guide, Myriam, was excellent (as was our driver whose name I didn't catch, sorry!). On the short drive down to Tulum she gave us a brief history of the city and what to expect when we got there. The van dropped us off, from where it was a ten minute walk to the site entrance. The van driver gave out umbrellas. I was glad I took one - the walk down is mostly shaded, but once inside Tulum there is little shade so it was good to be able to create my own.It got a bit confusing at the site entrance as we joined with one or two other groups to be led through the entrance by a different guide, only to break off again once inside to be led by Myriam again.Myriam gave us a lot of info on Tulum, and used a guide book to illustrate some of her points. She made good use of what little shade there was, telling us from there about some of the carvings we would be seeing before heading out into the heat to see them.After the tour ends inside Tulum you have about 45 minutes to explore some more on your own and then take the walk back to where the van was parked. There's a restaurant and snack and gift shops there too.We then drove to Akumal to snorkel to see turtles. The van driver provided us with a mask, snorkel and fins. We then walked a few minutes to the storefront of \"Pirates of Akumel\" to get life vests and watch a short video on what to do and not do when going to see the turtles. One of their staff then led us to see the turtles.Yes, it is very crowded, as someone pointed out, but it's organised chaos : )My daughter and another girl weren't very comfortable snorkeling so they hung onto a life buoy and Myriam pulled them around the bay single-handed. If she hadn't done that I'm pretty sure my daughter would not have lasted for the tour, so I was very grateful for that!We saw three turtles, two of which came up for a breath which only happens every twenty minutes or so, so we lucked out there.I'd actually done the snorkeling part before a few years ago (not with Cancun Adventures), but it was still good to see the turtles again as you get so close to them (the water's only about 8 or 9 feet deep and they feed on the bottom). I was glad to have my own mask and snorkel this time around as I know they fit me well and the time before I felt like I was being water-boarded as salt water kept leaking in!After snorkeling it was a short drive up to XePuHa for lunch. After turning off the highway it's a short drive down a bumpy road to a small restaurant and bar right on the beach. The tables outside were all taken so we ate inside. The food was basic, but very good, especially the ceviche. The beach looked good (better than the one at our resort!) and I'd have liked to have gone back to spend more time there but didn't make it. Maybe next time!From there it was a short drive of a couple of minutes back to our resort.Overall it was a great tour and I'd definitely recommend it, in particular Myriam."

We received a call in the hotel lobby at 7:50am saying they were running late and would pick us up at 8:00. At 8:10am we received another call saying they would arrive at 8:30. The van finally arrived at 8:50am. The excuse given was that an earlier pickup was a no show. This is completely unacceptable. If a customer isn't at the pickup location they should wait no more than a few minutes before leaving them. The remaining 10 people in the group should not be delayed by over an hour! The apology provided was insincere.The tour of Tulum was informative and enjoyable. The snorkeling was ok. It was very crowded and not relaxing. Akumal bay is very developed and in a \"city\" environment. We saw a couple turtles (more than expected given how crowded and busy it was) and a squid. Lunch was well over an hour late due to the pickup delays mentioned. The beach club for lunch was down a long bumpy road and the food was mediocre. Most of the group was anxious to have the tour over with by the time we got to lunch. Overall the tour was average, but with above average prices. I would recommend taking a taxi to Tulum and skipping the organized tours."

A big shout out to our tour guide Ara because she was the only reason why I was able to complete the excursion. I am not a swimmer and this was my first time snorkeling. She knew I was scared and she was able to calm me down fast. She also let me hold onto her lifesaver the entire time! I definitely appreciated her and really saw the love and passion she has for the culture. However, our group was small and didn't talk a lot for some reason. Ara acknowledged this and tried to make us laugh, which she did! Ara also took care of us at our lunch, explaining what to except from the food and even serving us drinks! Ara was just amazing! Shout out to our driver Mendez too! I only wished I gave the full $20 tip to Ara and not just $10 that I spilt with Mendez since Ara did a lot more work. I regret that! If I see you again Ara, I will give you a bigger tip since you deserve it! :)"

We probably would not have seen anything without Gustavo's knowledge and guidance. Lunch afterward at Paradise Beach was very good and very relaxing. All in all, a great trip thanks to Gustavo."

A couple hours was enough time to see some of the main buildings and learn some interesting stories from Ara. They provided a snack on our way to Akumal for snorkeling. Some of our group were new to snorkeling so it took a little time to get them outfitted and up to speed. We then set out in the bay and saw turtles immediately. Plenty of rays and turtles. Not as many fish and virtually no coral. Nevertheless we had a great time in the water. Lastly we drove to a restaurant on a sand beach - very cute! Good Mexican fare though nothing special."

Our guides were very knowledgeable and were able to point all sorts of marine life out to us. We even saw an octopus! There were loads of turtles to see and also plenty of sting rays.We were able to get showered and changed back where we received our lifejackets, then back to the minibus to go and get lunch.We went to a lovely private beach club for our fantastic lunch. A huge all you can eat buffet, with so much choice! We had a about half an hour to spare before the minibus arrived to take usd back to the hotel so we wandered down to the picturesque beach. My boyfriend, as well as all the other males on our tour were very impressed with the scenery as there were two models filming on the beach!

People were definitely getting antsy, most especially the young kids. The Staff was great and very informative. We enjoyed their knowledge. The Ruins overlook the most beautiful beaches and ocean I have ever seen. I could have stayed all day just gazing at the ocean. The guide kept it interesting but short so we had a little over an hour of free time. This was more then enough time as the ruins grounds aren't to big.

Then the trip to the mystic river cenote. about a 20minute ride into the jungle on an unimproved road barely wide enough for two way traffic.

The opening was to the cavern was quite large and the water was just about 70 degrees Fahrenheit. The tour was about 40 minutes long with plenty of rest stops and areas to appreciate nature. on the way out to the main road we also stopped at a dry cenote to take pictures and admire the beautiful jungle.

Gabo, our tour guide, was informative and interesting as he described Mayan culture as it would have been hundreds of years ago. He was diligent in pointing out various aspects of natural fauna around us. The ruins site overlooks one of the most beautiful beaches I've ever seen---and believe me, I grew up measuring all of my beach experiences against the sugar white sands of Orange Beach, AL, Destin, FL and Panama City, FL. The attentativeness of the staff was fantastic after spending 3 hours in the hot Mexican sun. Umbrellas were provided, if needed, for sun protection. Ice cold wash cloths were provided to us at the end of the tour. Snacks and cold drinks were waiting for us in the motor coach. Highly recommend this company."

Our rep at our hotel told us about this excursion and we knew this was the one for us! Our guide, Jorge, picked us up from our hotel at 730 am. We took a van to Tulum and entered the Mayan Ruins! We were in awe of them! Jorge did an amazing job explaining the city to us and was very informative! If he had an opinion on something he told us what he thought, but then also gave other theories as to what a building purpose was. We were able to explore the city after he was done guiding us around on our own for a bit. It is breathtaking there! We met back at the drop of point and enjoyed a quick drink at a little restaurant. We were then off to snorkel with sea turtles. This was our first time snorkeling and Jorge did an amazing job explaining how to do it. He accompanied us out in the ocean and would signal to us if he spotted a turtle. We were also able to snorkel the coral reef. Words can't explain how amazing and beautiful the reef was. We snorkeled for close to 45 minutes to an hour. After we were done, we were taken to a beach club and had lunch. The food was pretty good. We were able to relax on the beach there for about half an hour before we packed up and headed back to the resort. Jorge did an extraordinary job of explaining things to us and giving us information about the Mexican culture! We got back to our resort a little after 4. I would recommend this trip to anyone!"

We then headed to Akumal for snorkeling. I was pleased to see how seriously our guides took their responsibility to protect this area. Our snorkeling adventure lasted a little over an hour and we saw many small fish along with a barracuda, a 6 foot green eel, a ray and 10 sea turtles. We finished the day with a meal at a local restaurant where the food was great and well appreciated after a day of activity. I highly recommend this tour to anyone interested in history and nature."

Akumal was great as well as Tulum. At Akumal we saw several giant sea turtles, a huge ray, and many beautiful fish in the reef. Lunch was included and a beautiful beachside restaurant. Definitely recommend!"

The scenery was breath taking but because of our tour guide Omar, the tour was not only beautiful but extremely informative and he was a riot (funny - Omar). It's obvious he loves what he does and it made such a difference with the group that we were with. Tulum is amazing and anyone who visits this region needs to experience it and if you can arrange to have Omar as your guide it will be even better. Akumal was beautiful and so well organized. Omar with his orange tube made it so much easier to follow along. Overall I can't say enough great things about the entire day!!!! Can't wait to go back"

The minibus arrived right on time, we met our driver Danny and our guide Gus (he was super knowledgeable and friendly, he is very proud of his country, and very passionate about what he does) who were both very professional and personable. During the drive Gus gave us useful information on what we will see and how the day will go. After arriving we had had a chance to go into the local restaurant and shop, after that the walk to Tulum began. It's about a 15 min walk, Gus made a few stops throughout the ruins to give us our history lesson for the day that was filled with valuable information, we were provided with umbrellas for the walk in the hot sun/rain. After the tour, we had free time to wander throughout the ruins. Back at the van, we were provided with snacks and moist towels. On the way to the snorkel adventure, Gus gave us a great amount of information on where we were going, what we would see, and how to properly be cautious to not disrupt the environment in which the sea life lives. I\u2019m not confident in the water, I had my vest on, Gus had me hold onto the ring and towed me out to see the turtles, I thought he would take me back after that, but no, I got to spend the whole time with the group. We saw several turtles, the reef, beautiful sea life, fish, and coral. Even though Gus had me in tow, he was always looking over the group to assure everyone was safe and within close proximity, plus we did have a second guide with us. The snorkeling was awesome, I\u2019m not sure how long we were out there. Afterwards we took about a ride to a beach style restaurant, they had a very nice buffet set up for us, the food was really great, with a very nice beach to enjoy. I would highly recommend this tour, everything from beginning to end was great.Ask for Gus as your guide, he has a great personality, very professional, very knowledgeable, and it is obvious that he had a true passion for sharing all his knowledge with the group.

He and the driver picked us up at our hotel On Time, in a clean van with excellent refrigeration. We traveled to Tulum, where he gave us an excellent history of the area and the Mayans. Unfortunately, tourists are no longer able to touch or climb the ruins, so it is much more difficult to connect with and appreciate the history, but it is still impressive.Following the tour of Tulum, we were taken a short distance to the Akumal Sea Turtle Sanctuary. There, we snorkeled over the reef viewing numerous of the grand turtles, along with many of the fish and all of the different Rays that inhabit the area. The snorkelers are accompanied by guides, and are not allowed to touch or harass the turtles, but it is great watching them.After the adventure at Akumal, adventurers are taken down the street a little farther for an included lunch at the restaurant called La Buena Vida. Great food, beautiful scenery.All-in-all, a very good outing."

Fair warning: bring a little bug spray for the jungle area prior to entering Tulum, it was full of mosquitoes, and your guide will have a lot to inform you about this area. Our guide, Omar, was very knowledgeable about the historic site and the ruins, and his sense of humor propels the exploration along. Leaving Tulum, you will be on the way to the snorkel part, you must have a biodegradable sun block (if not..sun burn, or pay the $10 U.S. for a bottle at the changing stop). Akumal is not for first time snorkelers. It is pretty fast paced. My wife who is not a great swimmer, had some difficulty, and had to return to the beach. I did see lots of nice fish, a couple of rays, and some turtles. There is no diving! Omar has his own orange buoy, so you won't loose him if it gets crowded. You will end this day at an off the beaten path beach side cantina, which was absolutely wonderfully. Good food, cold beer! Perfect! Recommended items: Bug spray, biodegradable sun block, a hat, towel, swim shoes, regular camera/smartphone, and underwater camera."

The ride is about 2 hours long, meandering through the jungle and to the beach. At the beach we were given the option to gallop, and since my husband and I are experienced riders, we opted to gallop. What fun that was. Our appointed guide took us gallopinig on the beach. The paparazzi are there taking pictures of the gallop and you have the option to purchase them later. This is definately something one must do when in Mexico. We loved it, the day was perfect and will definately do it again!

We were given cold water and umbrellas to help with the heat but the ruins are on to of a hill and the sun just melts ya! The ruins were amazing the things these people built were crazy. Our guide was knowledgable about the building and civilization. The view and beach here were spectacular you could see out in the water where the coral reef went across.

Pick up was prompt and because there were only 3 of us on this day, we arrived at Tulum quite early which turned out to be a blessing. Jocelyn was our guide for the day and began the tour with a history of the area and the Mayan people. We were given snacks (bananas and honey wheat crackers) and cold bottled water on the ride out.Once we arrived at the site, we were given the chance to get organized and leave anything we did not want to carry with us secured in the transport van and were given option of taking an umbrella for shade (a good idea since there is hardly any shady areas once inside the walled area of the park).I am a fan of historical ruins and this place did not disappoint. Jocelyn gave us an overall tour with lots of information about the place and then gave us time to explore on our own.If you can plan to go first thing in the morning, do so. Since we were one of the 1st groups to arrive, it was like we had the place to ourselves, again, giving the tour a VIP feel.By the time we were ready to leave, the place was getting quite busy and hot!Through no fault of Cancun Adventures, of our outing had to be changed. We were supposed to go snorkeling to see the sea turtles, but the weather had other ideas. Strong winds and turbulent waters closed the area to snorkeling as it is a eco-sensitive area.We were given the choice to go either snorkeling to a lagoon or to Los Ojos Cenote. We chose Los Ojos and I was glad we did. This was an amazing experience and one that I may not have other wise done. Make sure you have a waterproof camera (disposable or otherwise) to take advantage of taking pictures of the amazing rock formations below the waters. We were taken to a restaurant in North Akumal for lunch. \"La Buena Vida\" was right on the water in a small and tranquil setting. The food was simple and tasty and was a nice way to finish the tour. Our tour finished sooner than expected but that was because we were such a small group.Jocelyn and our driver (Gabriel I think - sorry I can't recall his name exactly) made for a memorable day.Things to know -Have breakfast before as it is not included on this tour (snacks and lunch were)Bring bug spray/repellent for touring around Tulum.If you do get a chance to swim with the turtles, you are not allowed to wear sunscreen unless it is an eco-friendly, biodegradable sunscreen as it is a ecologically sensitive area. We want to keep those turtles thriving!Bring a towel for after swimming as the company does not provide them."

The good thing about the tour is that we didn't have to keep all our items on us, they were securely left on the van - so we were able to walk around Tulum with just our cameras.You get about an hour or so to walk around Tulum. Before you get to walk around you will be briefly talked about the history of Tulum, the Mayans, and other facts. Our tour guide took us away from the rest of the people so we didn't have to be bothered - which was great because there were alot of people there. Be aware ahead of time if it hot outside (which it tends to be alot of times in Mexico you will get burned really easy. There aren't alot of places to cool off - only a few places had shade.

            "review": "Fantastic excursion!. Trip date: August 25, 2014My husband and I love to go snorkeling and have been with a couple of different companies while on vacation to experience the the sea life. Our transportation arrived at our hotel on time but unfortunately they only had us booked for one person. They offered to call in to confirm that the excursion was for two people but we decided to go back to our hotel room to get our voucher because it was our belief that this would be a faster solution. With proof that we were on an adventure for two we got in the van and were on our way. We are pretty laid back people so the glitch didn't really upset us too much. The gentleman that transported us to puerto aventuras was very nice and courteous. Once we arrived at the marina we discovered that on this particular occasion the other couple that was scheduled to do the tour cancelled last minute. That meant that we were the only couple and were on board for a private tour! We were told that there is on average about 8 people that do this tour a day so we got really lucky! Since we had had previous snorkeling experience getting acquainted with our equipment was a breeze. Martina was our tour guide on this particular day and was absolutely fantastic! She was so nice, sweet and knowledgeable. I cannot say enough about how great and professional she was. Charlie and Chris were also part of the crew who took us on our excursion and both were also very polite and helpful.The weather this day was beautiful and the ocean was very calm. Our first stop was in a smaller area where there was a Mayan ruin that sat up along the coast line. The ambiance was amazing. Since it was a relatively small and shallow area, and because we are both experienced swimmers, and also because it was just the two of us, we were allowed to explore the area on our own at our leisure. Although there weren't too many fish in this particular area an interesting thing to see here is the underwater river.On to our next destination. Since we were a party of two, we were treated to seeing something our tour guide said she hadn't even seen. The other guide that accompanied us took us to see a Mayan statue that was partially sunk into the sea floor. It was in so far that only from it's shoulders up were visible. It was gazing upward toward the sky and the sun was shining down into the ocean. There was a very ominous feeling to it and it was just incredible. My husband (always the skeptic) doesn't believe that it is a real Mayan statue but rather was put there. As to it's validity I am unsure but I still found it worth seeing.In reading some of the other reviews for this tour I feel sorry for people who did not see many fish. Perhaps it was because of how calm the water was on this particular day but we saw SO MANY DIFFERENT FISH!! It was absolutely fantastic! Remember not to look straight down but also in front of you and from side to side. We saw angel fish, rainbow parrotfish, needlefish and barracudas to name a few. There were much more than that and they were all so colorful and beautiful, I'm just unaware of what type of fish they were. Most of the time we were surrounded by schools of black and white striped fish. They would swim right along side of us. So close that I was afraid at times to move my arms or legs for fear of touching them. It was such a fantastic experience. Although the coral did get pretty high in some areas and I thought for sure we were going to touch it we never did. Again, I'm not sure if it's because there weren't any waves and the water was calm. We just made sure to keep our bodies horizontal in the water and all was good. Toward the end of our snorkeling at this particular site a stingray began to swim along with us. It would follow us or circle underneath. It kept up with us for a good 15 minutes. I, personally, thought this was pretty cool. Then as we were just floating in the water watching the stingray a sea turtle decided to make an appearance! It swam very, very close to us and even swam up near my husbands face and around him! Martina told us that one of the turtles in the area is very curious and has a tendency to come and inspect snorkelers! But to see a stingray and a sea turtle in the same field of view was such a unique experience. I have not seen anything like it on our previous tours. On the way back to the boat, stingray in tow, another sea turtle decided to swim by and check us out! There was only one other group snorkeling in this area for a portion of the time we were there but were no where near us and I was not distracted at all by their presence. From here we were taken back to the beach club. It was very quite and very clean. They served us lunch and also serve alcoholic beverages. All of this was included in the price of our excursion. The staff at the beach club were also very kind and friendly. There are bathrooms on site as well. There are lounge chairs and umbrellas on the beach to relax in while you wait for your return transportation, which for us, was pretty seamless. This was a great trip and well worth the money. We were back at our hotel around 1:00 PM and had plenty of time left to enjoy our day on the beach.If you decide to do this excursion I advise you to bring a towel, BIODEGRADABLE sunscreen (I cannot stress biodegradable enough. Other sunscreen is harmful to the coral and marine environment!!) & sunglasses. The boat does go very fast so be mindful of your sunglasses and hat (if you bring one) so they don't blow away. There is a cubby under each seat on the speed boat to put your belongings. We were offered bottled water on the boat. Bring an underwater camera if you desire. Also, we were sure to bring tip money (because if we have a good time we think it's nice to show our appreciation!)."

Also, he was very ecologically conscious of the environment and cared greatly about the animals and the preserved areas we visited. He recommended we only wear biodegradable sunscreen or none at all. First we went on this beach and swam for about 40 mid- we saw huge sea turtles and some stingrays. The water is super salty. The next stop was the cenotes which are natural caves- it was fresh water. It was so pure and absolutely the most amazing thing I have ever done. It was the cleanest water you will ever swim in. Last we stopped at a night club to have lunch right on the beach. The food was amazing. They give you two drinks. I absolutely recommend this excursion. It was about 7 hours total you cannot beat the price.

After snorkeling we were taken to yet another beach where lunch was provided on the beach. It was a great trip! Speedy was our tour guide for the whole and he was just wonderful, full of history at Tulum, made sure every saw the turtles, and he made sure everyone that wanted their picture taken, got their picture taken!"

He made us feel safe and even went out of his way to make those in the group who were not great swimmers feel comfortable. The cenotes and caves were so beautiful, and we saw several sea turtles and sting rays at \"Turtle Cove\". The lunch was at a very nice beach resort and the food was pretty good. My only complaint is that everything we did felt rushed. There was not enough time to enjoy the scenery or take photos because you were trying to keep up with the group. However, we chose this excursion because it had several different aspects to it and because we came from a cruise ship we had limited time. Overall, we loved the excursion!"

Do not expect to see lots of colorful fish as there were not a ton at the coral reef. Some spots were very, very shallow, to the point where you would scrape up against the coral while snorkeling. We were able to see a sea turtle which was the highlight of the trip. After snorkeling you are taken to a private beach for lunch, drinks and some time to relax which was nice. Overall, a fun, quick, half day adventure that is perfect for the beginning snorkeler that is wanting a change of scenery from the resort."

The sea out to the site was a bit choppy but the captain did a good job navigation to the site. We arrived at the first site and enjoyed getting our selves orientated with our gear while seeing some scattered marine life. Back in the boat and on to the next site. There were several other boats on the reef when we got there. We got in the water and were instructed to follow the guide and her orange float. We took off and began to discover the reef. If you are expecting a beautiful colorful reef this is not what you will be seeing. The fish were amazing and the water was great. We struggled keeping our group separate from the other groups. some places were very crowded and at times we were bumping in to each other as we were fed through a bottleneck. At one point we were led over a very shallow portion of the reef and sever including myself we forced to touch the reef as it was not deep enough to cross with out doing so. Several were injured with cuts and scrapes. After the shallow portion we headed back to the boat. On the way back we encountered two turtles. This was awesome. We got back on the boat and headed to the beach club. There was a bit of distress at having to carry gear over our heads while wading to shore while dodging unseen rocks. We then hopped on the truck to the beach club. The food at the beach club was what I expected and that was not great. It was edible but not to the standard of the resort. Showers and restrooms were available, but they were \"out of order\" for the duration of our visit. After eating and laying on the beach for a while we were told it was time to head back. We were put in a van that was smaller than the one we arrived in and as it turned out there were not enough seats for everyone. One person was told to sit on the floor of the van as it was just 15 min to the first stop. This was very unprofessional. Their lack of attention to detail was unfortunate. Everyone in the van was uncomfortable and felt terrible for the passenger sitting on the floor. Everyone was dropped off at their resorts and the adventure was over. I know other couples canceled there following trips with this vendor and my wife and my self decided to not book any more with them. We had a good time but the lack of attention to detail turned us off of using them again."

This gave us something to do on the ride & then we didn't have to stand in the hot sun at Tulum while she told us all these things. Tulum was neat, if you're a history buff you'll enjoy it. My husband enjoyed the iguanas, which were everywhere. Great views of the ocean, bring a camera! After our tour of Tulum we were greeted by our driver with cool washcloths & a snack of bananas, crackers, & water. The cool washcloths were a nice touch, very nice after walking in the heat! Then it was off to Akumal for snorkeling. Cancun Adventures has a shop close to Akumal where you can change into your bathing suits, most of us just wore them under our regular clothes. This was my first time snorkeling & I was a little apprehensive. I panicked a little when getting out in the water & trying to use my mask & snorkel. Lucy was very patient & helpful, even let me use her mask so I could see the turtles. It was very crowded when we were there, just watch out for other people. It was amazing to be swimming with these turtles! We also some a couple of sting ray, the coral reef, & some fish. If you want to see colorful fish this probably isn't the excursion for you. This was mainly to swim with the turtles! After snorkeling we were taken to a Mexican buffet. There were showers there & bathroom to change out of wet bathing suits. Food was okay. Restaurant is right on a beach. All in all it was a very good tour. Cancun Adventures really knows how to take care of its guests."

Imagine the harassment to the animal!They drop 10 people every 2 minutes 10m in front of the feeding fish mouth and 2 meters above, and the fish is passing by hardly 1-3m away, some are diving beside or under it, morning to 2pm every day.And BTW, there wasn't any snorkelling on a reef as they advertised (minor point)."

I was excited to see that the tour included a visit to Akumal as many people at the resort mentioned Akumal was a wonderful place to swim with Sea Turtles. Our trip on 7/28/14 was unforgettable. Our tour guide Gustavo \"Gus\" was very personable, entertaining, accommodating and extremely knowledgeable about both Tulum/Mayan history as well as the wildlife at Akumal. He demonstrated the utmost respect for nature and it's preservation as well. While at Tulum he explained so much about the area and Mayan history that even though I had visited before I even learned a lot more. After wandering around the ruins a bit, we returned to our van and the driver had chilled wet towels for each of us to cool down from the extreme heat. And Gus handed out bananas and crackers to replete our lost minerals. At Akumal Gus gave us several pointers on the best way to keep our masks from fogging (one I was not aware of despite having snorkeled many times before. ). And. While in the water he constantly came over and got my attention when there was an interesting fish in the water. Gus also stayed close to My son, who was youngest on the trip and not one to use snorkel or flipper. This making it easier for me to enjoy as he was in good hands. Afterwards Gus took us to a really nice beach club for lunch. The food was outstanding and he had the bartender make us some celebratory margaritas when we arrived. When we spoke of what else we wanted to do while in Mexico, he even suggested a certain tour of the underground river that turned out to be an excellent day as well. I highly recommend this tour and Gustavo as a guide. I especially like the fact that it was a small group limited to 12 people and much more personable than those others.

Jorge will ensure that your food and drinks are ordered and delivered. Tulum ruins is a must-see! Jorge took us in through his favourite entrance and we were struck by the view. He was a knowledgable guide who shared info with us and still left us time to explore on our own. The umbrellas that he and Carlos distributed provided some relief from the beating-down sun.

This was for practice to get used to using your snorkel if you haven't done it before. The inlet was beautiful and we saw some fish there. The water was pretty shallow here so you could stand in most of the areas. Then you get back on the speedboat and they take you out to the 2nd largest Coral reef in the world. The water is clear and we saw many different types of colorful fish, an eel, and sea turtles! Then we were taken on the speedboat again to the nearby beach where transportation was waiting for us. It was an off road ride through the jungle to the Beach Club. Once we got to the Beach Club we ate the buffet lunch and had drinks. The food was delicious. We had a little time to relax or swim. I choose to swim but getting into the water was a challenge. It is very rocky and slippery getting in. The bottom is almost all rocks. So be careful when entering the water. The beach is beautiful here. We got back to the resort around 1:30 with plenty of time to enjoy the rest of the day. We really enjoyed this excursion and would highly recommend it:-)"

Maximum number of tourists are 12 at one time, which is good. You go on a very smooth speed boat ride to a small reef where a Mayan ruin is near by. Here it gets you used to snorkelling / swimming close to the reef before getting back on speed boat to visit a much larger coral reef. The water was clear and we saw lots of beautiful coloured fish and a turtle! After nearly an hour in the water we headed back on the boat to a short trip to a beach (by the palm tree which was in the Corona advert) where we were picked up in a jeep type vehicle, to a short trip to a lovely area of a beach, where lunch is provided, clean facilities and shower, time to sun bath and spend time in the clear blue sea. Definitely recommend this trip if you like snorkelling. The Captain on our speed boat (sorry I forget his name) & his help Charlie were very welcoming and we met some really nice holiday makers too. Thank you for an enjoyable day! I'd recommend this trip to families with teenagers, and couples of all ages."

I was a little worried about the speedboat ride for my wife- she usually doesn't like bumpy boat rides- she had no problems. The staff was knowledgeable and very entertaining. The only thing that would have made the trip better is if a turtle or two had been around. The beach club was great. The fod was excellent."

Our trip included visiting the ancient ruins of Tulum, snorkeling with sea turtles at Akumal, and enjoying a fantastic buffet lunch at a remote beach club. Our tour guide, Jorge, was awesome. He was so much fun and made us feel very comfortable as this was our first excursion in Mexico. Jorge is very knowledgable and has a true passion for preserving our planet. You can tell he loves what he does. He was accompanied by \"Abby\" who drove us to and from our hotels and to each of our destinations. He was an excellent driver and both my wife and I felt very safe with him driving. Tulum is beautiful and Akumal was as advertised. We got to see some sea turtles, rays, and an abundance of tropical fish. My wife and I WILL be booking another excursion with Cancun Adventures when we come back. Well worth the money!"

Our driver, Jesus was very prompt and knowledgeable. He gave us water and umbrellas before we went to the ruins because it was a very hot, humid day. Our tour guide, Alejandra, was completely educated on the tribal history of Mexico and her English was perfect. She was also very funny! There were only 17 in our group which made it much easier to follow and hear what was being said. I highly recommend the Tulum ruins and taking a quick dip in the ocean, although you will have to go back very sandy and wet so you will need to carry around a towel and change of clothes if you decide to swim. Not recommended if you have an injury or issues walking up and down stairs/hills. Bring plenty of sunscreen!"

Not so with Pato. She had us laughing and waiting to hear what was next. I worked hard keeping up with the swimming. I could easily have gotten distracted by just floating and watching all that was going on beneath me. The Tulum trip was very nice too. Again, Pato made the history interesting and related it to things going on today. I would highly recommend Cancun Adventures and especially the guide, Pato."

After days of rain the first week of June, we were excited that our last full day was clear and sunny. The site of the ruins is amazing and we really enjoyed our tour guide Jocelyn. We visited Chichen Itza as well (which I also recommend) but if you're staying in Cancun and time is short, you may want to go here instead. The cliffside city is wonderful to visit. Umbrellas are provided on really hot days to help keep some of the sun off of you and there is a beach down below the cliffs where you can swim or walk along the sand. BUT the turtles were my main reason for booking the tour. We were told by our guide that we were guaranteed to see turtles and she was absolutely right. It's an amazing experience. We also saw a barracuda as well as other fish and rays. You're snorkeling near the second largest reef in the world so the turtles are only part of the fun. Tips:- Bring an underwater camera (you can also buy one but it's cheaper to plan ahead)- We wore water shoes/aqua socks which made it easier to walk on the sand and we didn't have to leave our shoes behind like the rest of our tour group. - Make sure you have biodegradable sunscreen with you. For the animals' health, you can't wear normal sunscreen but it's easy to burn when you're snorkeling."

He was also very proactive and was able to keep us moving just in time to beat the large crowds. We at no time felt rushed in any way either. We then got to shop at a little store and get more drinks. The driver had prepared our scuba diving kits in the meantime and we went to Akumel to snorkel. We saw plenty of turtles and fish. It was so awesome! Jorge also taught us how to be respectful to the reef and animals. We went to an awesome beach for lunch and then relaxation! Great food and a great time. The driver had the sand all cleaned out of the van by the time we got back to go home. I highly recommend this trip. If Jorge is your guide, you're in for a real treat."

It is a fair amount of walking in the sun, but they provide you with umbrellas for shade. There was a beautiful beach to swim in, though you don't get much more than 45 minutes to relax before snorkeling. The snorkeling was just ok, since it was a public beach it was a bit crowded. The free food afterward was VERY good! Also, we were allowed to take our time and relax by the beach before heading back to the resort. The only reason for 4 stars is the price."

Alina swam over and yelled at us for not keeping up. We told her that we were just trying to help our daughter and instead of helping us, she had our daughter hold on to her life preserver and pulled her the rest of the way. I thought we were there to snorkel not watch our daughter get pulled around the ocean. Not that there was much to see anyway. All we saw were 2 turtles and some fish. After lunch, we went to see the ruins. Again Alina walked way too fast. Sometimes she would turn around and glare at us because we were walking too slow. We were taking pictures, and enjoying the views that we don't get to see back home. She seemed very annoyed at us most of the time because we were not standing close enough to her to hear what she was saying. I did inform her that we could hear her just fine. I recommend that if you have small children, please ask for someone other than Alina. She goes at her own pace which is fast. I think she needs to remember, that while she has seen the ruins and the turtles many times, we have not and she needs to slow it down a little and let everyone enjoy the sights a little more. I asked her if she had another tour that day after ours, and she said no she was done for the day. Maybe she was in a hurry because she had better things to do."

We always like the feeling that we have a few excursions/experiences in one, and this was exactly that. There is the historical portion (Tulum) followed by the fun/exploration portion (Akumal) and ending with the relaxation portion (lunch & drinks at a restaurant by the water). We had a WONDERFUL tour guide named Vincent that made the full-day experience as wonderful as it was. He had such knowledge of the history and culture of the area and a glaringly-positive outlook on life. It was contagious.Tulum was breathtaking and provided the cultural experience we were looking for. Make sure to visit the top of the stairs and look over the cliff down on the water- the view is awesome and the breeze is even better on hot days!Akumal was a great time. The snorkeling adventure was filled with different fish, sting rays and turtles. We saw 5-8 turtles in the time we snorkeled and left very happy with the photos to share.Lunch at the restaurant on the water was wonderful. After hours of walking and swimming in the heat, it was nice to relax and cool off with food and drinks! After eating, they gave us about 30 minutes to sit on the beach, swim or enjoy the music. Unexpected Pros: We were very happy that they provided cool rags, countless water bottles and snacks throughout the day; this wasn't something we had thought of, but greatly appreciated.Advice for Future Travelers: Bring an underwater camera and a shirt for snorkeling at Akumal! They ask that you avoid sunscreen with chemicals, so they offer to sell you chemical-free lotion. Although environment-friendly, it wasn't very friendly to our skin. We burnt badly, so I recommend wearing a shirt instead of using the lotion (or both!).Overall a wonderful experience I am happy we booked. Highly recommended- Ask for Vincent!"

My favorite part of the tours was honestly seeing how much Gus cared about nature and wildlife and how much he wanted to share that with us.After this we went to this awesome authentic place for tacos & they were the best food I had the whole trip (the name escapes me but it was in Akumal and it was good!)My husband and I loved this trip & the next time we go to Mexico we will book more things through Cancun Adventures!"

Leon was our guide and is extremely friendly and knowledgeable. Leon made this easily the best excursion we've ever taken.Our first stop was Akumal for snokeling. Leon had everyone eat a banana to avoid cramps. We saw numerous turtles, rays, fish and the reef. Leon was patient and allowed us to lag behind and explore on our own while keeping a watch for our safety. Meanwhile, Memo stayed with our belongings at the beach.We then did lunch at La Buena Vida in Akumal. What a special place. The food was excellent, even for us vegetarians, along with a great atmosphere. No walls and a sand floor right on the beach. Think something from your dreams, and you'll be close to what La Buena Vida offers.Our next stop was Tulum. We were given umbrellas to provide us all with much needed shade. Leon's knowledge of the ruins and his visual aids are spot on. He really shines here without being loud and overwhelming like the other guides we saw. At the end of Tulum, we were offered cold wet towels to wipe down with and very good crackers and ice water. We will definitely use Canc\u00fan Adventures in the future because we were catered to and our every need met. What a spectacular company."

Plus, they provided water, snacks and even cold wash cloths. Plus, he took us snorkeling at Akumal and guided us to the sea turtle sanctuary. For a first-timer in terms of snorkeling, this was a wonderful time. Be sure to take organic sunscreen, as they highly discourage chemicals around the sea turtles (most, if not all, typical American sunscreens) and will ask you not to use it.Lunch even included a vegetarian option, though all passengers got a standard 'sampler' plate at the restaurant we stopped at. There was no reason to complain, considering our table was seated on the beach with the Caribbean at our side. What an amazing view during lunch!Thank you, Leon and Cancun Adventures!"

It was a blast!Snorkeling was absolutely wonderful as well. We saw numerous turtles, sting rays, and tons of fish. We were able to snorkel directly above most of the coral which was very cool. Gus was very attentive to ensure that nobody touched the coral and explained how it would damage the environment if we did which we appreciated. Overall this was a blast. We would recommend this. Bring your towel, a change of clothes, and tons of water. Cancun Adventures will provide water as well, but it is quite hot in Tulum and there is not a lot of shade. DO NOT FORGET A CAMERA!!!!"

The history behind the Mayan ruins is astonishing in it self. You will be totally blown away when swimming with the turtles and other sea life. Gus our tour guide only made the experience that much better. His excitement and passion regarding the history made it seem like he was sharing his knowledge of the Mayan history for the first time. He never made you feel like this was his \"job\". His excitement was contagious. His good sense of humor provided quite a few laughs which made the day light hearted. Plenty of water was provided and a much welcome ice cold towel after spending a few hours in the sun(there were quite a few shady spots to rest) at the ruins. Gus made us all aware as to what to expect during each portion of the tour. No surprises. Don't miss this wonderful excursion and hope you are lucky enough to get Gus as your tour guide."

She was happy to answer all of our questions and offered interesting pieces of history during our tour. Unfortunately, it rained and it was very windy once we got to Tulum Akmal, but Alex still made it an enjoyable experience regardless of the weather. I definitely recommend this tour! It was one of the highlights of my vacation in Mexico. I learned a lot and the view was breathtaking. The history was incredible and the ruins were astonishingly beautiful. I still cannot believe that the wall is still standing today! It's amazing. I would also recommend to take the tour with Alex because she is fantastic! Enjoy your trip to Mexico!"

The Ruins of Tulum are beautiful and the beach is fantastic. The group does a great job of keeping you hydrated, gave us tons of water and even some cold bananas and granola bars when the tour of tulum was over. After that we went and snorkeled with Sea turtles, and what can i say, Bucket list item for sure! Again, Mounir was amazing and professional, making sure that we were all comfortable for the 45 minute swim. We saw around ten Sea Turtles and a sting ray, not to mention all the fish and coral reef. It was truly amazing. After that we were treated to a private buffet lunch on the beach with other cancun adventure go-ers. the food was AMAZING (much better than our resort!) and the beach was stunning. Lots of hammocks, beds, and beautiful nature to look around at. Not to mention- lots of drinks! the Paloma is my new favourite, thank you Mounir for suggesting it! I would do this trip ten times over if i could, Especially if it was with Mounir, he is fantastic! ( If anyone was with us on our trip to Tulum/Akumal on June 11th and want to have a few pics of the turtles, Shoot me a message and i can email them to you! i know not everyone had a camera that day :) )"

She gave us so much information - much more enjoyable than just walking around randomly and reading a guidebook. The company provided us with water and umbrellas (SO HOT) for the tour then after greeted us with more water and cool towels to freshen up with. The beach at Tulum was very crowded and rough so we didn't venture into the water but the view was georgous! Snorkeling with the turtles & sting rays was amazing! Again our guide was great at pointing out all the interesting sights just under us and so close to shore. Only drawback was no shower on site to get off all the VERY salty water. However last on our list was the private beach club and a yummy lunch - with showers available! We drank our fill of rum punch and beer and ate every bite of the civeche and other great food prepared before taking a walk on the beach then relaxing in a hammock for a brief nap before going home. Wonderful day!"

Then our fabulous guide Gustavo took us to a great location for lunch (included), followed by a trip to Tulum. His knowledge was endless.

Next, a tour of the Mayan Ruins at Tulum with another swim at Paridise Beach - you won't believe the clear, green ocean and white sand. You MUST ask for the guide named Mounie - he really made the difference. He provides each section of the tour in English first, then sends the English speaking group off to have fun. He then provides the tour to the Spanish speaking guests - and they have their fun while the English speaking group receives the tour. THis allows us to understand everything about the tour, instead of 1 sentence in English, then in Spanish, and back and forth. It is a satisfying, complete experience. Mounie is fun, outgoing and flexible. My husband and I felt like King and Queen. This tour really goes all out to serve the cutomer - plenty of food, water, etc."

Sho was a wonderful guide, took us out to meet many fish friends, a pelicano, starfish, eel, and even a tortuga! The water was incredibly choppy on our day out, but the guides and captain made sure to keep everyone near each other and near the boat. The initial snorkel run near the mayan ruin is really incredible too. After getting beat up on the water for a bit, the captain got us back on the boat, and did a wild little spin into the bay where we all got off onto the beach.From there, they take you on a cool modified pickup, down a long dirt road with the ocean on one side and the jungle on the other, until you finally get to a cool little beach bar. The food served there was incredible... fresh guacamole, ceviche, fried chicken, pesto pasta and pasta bolognese, fresh fruit... Great, fresh chips. The smell of limes in the air... and good drinks! Sho always kept my margaritas full and the fresca + tequila concoction was really nice too!After chilling on the beach for a few hours, we were scooped up by Patricia where she entertained us with her ipod and the hilarious songs that accompanied it. Made friends with a couple that lived only a few minutes away from us at home too! We had a really memorable time and hope to see the Cancun Adventures crew soon!!"

The ruins were impressive and the history Ara shared with us was very interesting, the beach at Tulum is gorgeous. Akumal was just as impressive, we snorkeled for an hour and saw a doxen sea turtles, parrot fish, stingray, baraccuda and an eagleray. The marine life is an arms length away and does not spook with people around. Being in the smaller group was great and really made the event even more enjoyable as we could take our time and were not swimming over each other. After Akumal we went to a private beach and had a great buffet lunch, with plenty to eat and drink. The ride both from our resort and back was enjoyable with water and snacks provided. Cancun Adventure really nailed this trip and we plan on using them again when we go back next year."

She was very informative, intelligent, entertaining & got everyone involved. She remembered everyone's name on the tour & called us by name. She was able to answer all our questions.Tulum is awesome, beautiful & rich with history. The beach there is postcard picturesque. Part 2 was snorkeling at Akumal. I've been snokeling quite a few times bit this was my first encounter with Giant Sea Turtles & Stingray. Lunch was at a little beach restaurant where the food was fabulous. I could go on & on about this trip but you must experience it yourselves."

My wife and I went on three excursions during our stay in Riviera Maya and this was the best. Judging off of solely the excursions themselves this would be equally as good as the others but these two went above and beyond in every aspect. For someone who slept through most of my two semesters of Spanish in college, Nicole's incredible fluent English was greatly appreciated. On the way to the ruins of Tulum, Nicole taught us a tremendous amount about the ruins, the Mayan culture, and the green Sea Turtles with which we would later by snorkeling. This not only was a great learning experience but made the drive go very quickly. We spent about 40 minutes being guided throughout the ruins in which Nicole continued teaching the group about each building and aspects of the Mayan culture. We were given 20 minutes of free time to wander that my wife and I used venture down to the gorgeous beach below the ruins. Upon returning to the van, Adrian presented each member of the group with a banana, some crackers, and a cold towel. These were all greatly appreciated and some of the small things that made us appreciate their kindness. We were then taken to the beach of Akumal to snorkel with Sea Turtles. Upon arrival, Nicole provided us with great instructions on how to most successfully snorkel throughout the cove. My wife and I thought we would be fortunate to see one turtle. Within 50 feet from the coast we begin seeing amazingly beautiful green Sea Turtles and probably saw close to 15 throughout the entire trip. As if that wasn't enough to complete the day, Nicole and Adrian then took us 20 minutes North from Akumal to an amazing beach side bar where we were given a great buffet and drinks (yes alcoholic ones). This day was great not only for the experiences but the extra effort both Nicole and Adrian made to make us feel comfortable."

They will offer you tours and bikes and train rides and on and on. We just walked the short distance to the gates, got our tickets and walked ourselves around. That's our style though. The ruins all have signs that explain their significance and history. They do offer tour guides. I heard more than 5 different languages being spoken by the guides and a few interesting stories so it might be fun to have a guide, just get the ones at the actual Tulum gates. There are iguanas everywhere! Big ones and bigger ones. There is an access to the beach and I really loved playing in the waves there. Warm water, nice soft beach without the rocks and coral to hurt yourself on. Great waves come crashing on that beach. Again, my style. I had no problem finishing my day at Tulum with wave washed hair and a damp bathing suit. There isn't a place to rinse off though so bring shorts or something to help with that salty, sea-water chaffing."

After Lunch we went to Tulum this was very hot but they provide you with umbrellas so you can get some shade which we thought was a brilliant idea and very much needed.

Our family, including 2 adult children, was met almost punctually at our hotel in Playa del Carmen by our guide, Gustavo, and a good driver. The complete group was about a dozen in our van and a few more from another that joined with us part way -- maybe 18 total. We sat near the front for the one hour trip, giving us the chance to talk more with Gus. His passion for Mexican history and its people, his knowledge of the Tulum ruins and their place in history, and his excellent English all made him a great guide. This tour can be combined with others afterwards, some of which sounded fun, but we opted just for the half day tour, and it seemed just right to us. Strongly recommend this."

The whole week was a blast, but our very favorite part of the entire vacation was the time we spent with Pol on our Tulum Akumal trip.Our visit to the Mayan ruins of Tulum was pretty hot, but the ocean breeze and astounding views made the trip not only comfortable but picturesque and SUPER fun! We learned a ton about Mayan history and got to see a bunch of iguanas :) We also had time to swim in the crystalline blue waters before moving on to the snorkeling bit of the excursion. If possible, ask to be in an early Tulum trip -- the sun only got hotter as the day went on.Snorkeling at a nearby beach was THE BEST part of this adventure! We saw sea turtles, stingrays, barracuda, and tons of colorful fish in a gorgeous reef. I only wish we'd thought to bring an underwater camera! The water was warm and comfortable, the sand white and hot, the views amazing.Our trip ended with a delicious buffet lunch at a third beach location. The food was some of the best we had during our entire time in Mexico. In addition to the planned activities, we were able to see some of non-resort Mexico and stop at a local hacienda to purchase snacks. This little extra mini-excursion was really fun, too!We can't say enough positive things about the commendable service we received, and we highly recommend Pol as your Cancun Adventures guide! Great job, and thank you so much for the fun day!!"

Tulum was gorgeous, I was there several years ago and I think it has been fixed up quite a bit and it looks bigger, like more areas had been cleared since I was there last. We got some incredible shots when the storms that were supposed to hit later that week came through early, the temples with the storms in the background made for a great photo opportunity. Our guide, Gustavo, was very knowledgeable on the history of the temples of Tulum and the culture, what they know if it, and brought along books and his own literature to refer to while telling us all about it. That afternoon, the bad weather prevented us from swimming with the turtles, but our wonderful guide, Gustavo, made sure we had other options and we chose to go to the Cenotes instead. It was wonderful, we got some great shots from the caves with our underwater camera, and the water was beautiful and clear. We snorkeled and did some free swimming, and we were in the caves, so the we forgot it was even raining while there. After other opted to return to their hotels or go on a different excursion, we met another nice family on the tour and ended up having lunch with them and Gustavo (buffet lunch and 1 beer or other drink included) on a beautiful beach with warm water, great for swimming. I would definitely go back and use Cancun Adventures again, they offer other tours that looked just as fun."

The stretch of beach behind the pyramid was just as breathtaking as the city itself. After exploring, we went back to the shuttle and enjoyed cool towels, cold water, a light snack and a few more stories from our guide.

After our time in Tulum we were taken to the beach at Akumal for about 90 minutes of snorkeling. Pol took us out a short distance and put us right on the turtles. We saw at least 6-8 in a very short period of time. Water was very clear and we got some great underwater pictures and videos using our gopro camera. We swam out further to the reef and encountered lots of colorful fish and underwater reef structures, it was awesome.

When we got to Tulum we were greeted by Alejandra and immediately felt at ease. She was so kind, informative, relaxed yet so knowledgeable, and presented the excursion as time to learn in a fun but info filled way. As we started our tour I noticed other tour guides going straight to Tulum while our group and Alejandra took the time to stop multiple times to tell us the background of Tulum, the Mayan people, and the geography. I appreciated this because I had no clue about anything that had to do with Tulum except the basics.Once we got to Tulum she took pictures for us, showed us fascinating parts of the structures that weren't written on the info boards, and let us go off by ourselves which we loved! Once we rejoined she continued with witty yet informative remarks and even showed us where to buy goods from real Mayans. Once on the van she made sure we were all okay and Luis greeted us with bananas, crackers, a cool towel (for our necks and hands to cool down), and multiple bottles of water. Alejandra and Luis were by far the best tour guide and driver we have ever had and we hope when we bring family back we will have them again!Tulum is beautiful and we would recommend anyone to go - it is beautiful, spiritual, and so amazing to see and touch the past!"

Our guide Luca really made the trip a success for everyone in the group by being able to speak in French, English and Italian. He did an excellent job explaining to everyone what to expect and what to do and what not to do. The snorkelling was good with many reef items, fish, and even sea turtles. In addition, Luca showed us an underwater spring of fresh water coming into the ocean from about a 8\" diameter hole which was very cool. The only isue with the trip was the long time needed to get to and back from the adventure due to all the hotel stops (a common problem for most all Cancun excursions). I wish more of that drive time was spent in the ocean snorkeling."

Our guide, Luca, was amazing. Very attentive, and he spoke like 4 languages fluently. We were happy to see some sea turtles and tropical fish, but we really didnt see anything too exceptional-- not within the company's control. At the end we were treated to an AMAZING all-you-can eat buffet & drinks on a beautiful white sand beach. Would definitely recommend this to anyone! Ask for luca as your guide!"

From what I am reading, the experience you have really depends on your guide. We had \"Lara\". While she was informative, when it came to snorkling, she was way out in front of our group and my son was at the end of our 'line'. This concerned me as this was his first snorkling experence and was not a strong swimmer. One of the other tourists in our group was kind enough to stay back with us to make sure we were OK and he also remarked that it was odd that she did not even ensure we were out of the water before walking the rest of the group up the beach. Other than that, we did not regret the experience."

The spot on the cliffs, just south of the main temple, is one beautiful site and certainly one of our favorites. Just earlier this month (April 2014) we visited Tulum again in the care of Cancun Adventures with our tour guide Alejandra Gonzalez and had a wonderful time. Alejandra provided a wonderful tour with a wealth of information about the site with botanical, cultural and historical perspectives. Thank you Alejandra and Cancun Adventures for the wonderful tour of such a gorgeous site!Note that our TripAdvisor profile picture was also taken at this same site! We really do love it here."

The underwater cenote was the highlight of the trip! Loved the beach - had probably the best margarita of the whole 2 weeks in Mexico. My only comments on the trip would be that we would have preferred more time to snorkel and less time on the beach. Also, pointing out the fragility of the ecosystem of the reef would have been a good thing as I kept seeing people standing up with their flippers."

He spoke great french and english, made sure everone understood. He is definitely passionate about his work, gave us a lot interesting history facts about the archaeological site and its people. We then had about 45 minutes to roam around and take pictures. We were not permitted to touch the ruins, in order to help preserve them. Very beautiful site, but too many people. It was hard taking pictures without there being random people in them with us. After that, we drove a bit to Akumal. They had all the equipement necessary for everyone to go snorkeling. After the guide made sure we all knew how everything worked, we got the chance to snorkel near the sea turtles and many colorful fish. After all of that, we got back in the bus and drove a few minutes, to a restaurant on the beach. The food wasn't great but it felt good to sit back and take a drink before going back to the resort."

We were provided with our gear and away we went with Gus, he was very helpful :) We seen turtles, sting rays and lots of other sea life, we truly loved the experience like none other. When we finished we went bk to the van and our driver had it spotless and we got snacks and cold water. Then we went to eat real Mexican food at a little restaurant on the beach, wonderful! Then when we got bk in the van our driver had it spotless AGAIN and our towels rolled up on our seats, he even cleaned my sandals that I left on the floor! Wow!! Very very nice men!

We were all ready to go and the van and guides arrived at our hotel and advised it was too windy and the seas were not safe to snorkel. They offered to rebook the tour on Sunday, March 30 with the hopes it would be safer then with the option to cancel with a full refund if we couldn't do the tour on that date. I was impressed with the concern for safety from them which carried on when we did the tour.We chose to go on Sunday, March 30. Our tour guide was Thamara. I have a feeling it was really busy because of cancelled tours due to weather because they did something a little different in that we snorkelled first and then went to Tulum to avoid a large number of people snorkelling at Akumal at the same time. The snorkelling was amazing, we saw sea turtles, fish and sting rays. We were out for an hour and Thamara was a great guide ensuring everyone stayed together, pointing out things to see and making sure everyone was okay with the equipment and snorkelling. There was an 8 year old on our tour who had never snorkelled in the ocean and she even offered to provide him with some extra assistance. We then went to a restaurant for lunch, which was very good. The view was amazing!!Afterwards we went to Tulum. At this point it was VERY hot there and it was difficult to really walk around and take everything in. We were trying to stay in the shade as much as possible. Thamara is very knowledgeable about the ruins and gave us some really interesting information. A nice touch from the company was the cool towels after Tulum when we got back to the van. We really needed the cool down.Overall we really enjoyed both aspects of this tour although the heat was tough at Tulum."

Next stop was an authentic and delicious Mexican lunch at a cool spot overlooking the sea. The surprise entertainment was a traditional Mayan ceremonial dance in full costume! We then headed south to beautiful Tulum perched on the cliffs overlooking the Caribbean Sea. This is a magical place whose history was painted so beautifully and thoroughly by our guide Ivan who provided detail that would take many long days to research on your own.

Our group received a warm welcome from the young staff (Luca and Carlos), and boarded the Zodiak inflatable boat for a fun ride to the first location (no interesting fish, but a short, \"get-your-feet-wet\" experience). After the boat ride to the second location, we saw a sea turtle, and a variety of colorful fish. Next, we were sped through the water towards the \"private beach club\" (outdoor tent pavilion) for lunch. Unfortunately, Luca decided to do some boat acrobatics, and I flew off my seat and ended up on someone's backpack on the boat floor. Since Luca continued the acrobatics, I wasn't able to get up, so remained on the floor until we went ashore. Nevertheless, lunch and relax time on the beach was very enjoyable. In sum, I would NOT recommend this adventure since the staff is immature and inexperienced. I was fortunate to land on someone's backpack since it possibly saved me from screwing up bilateral hip implants. Luca never apologized or said a word to me, although he did avoid giving my boyfriend and me a sheet to rate the trip. Other snorkel adventures are available on actual sailboats, likely with mature staff and for less money than ours ($110/per person) on the Zodiak inflatable boat."

The same was true while snorkeling with the sea turtles in Akumal (large crowds vs our small group). After snorkeling, we had a great lunch at a beach restaurant in Akumal. Someone told me to rent a car and go see these places by myself. I'm glad I didn't.

He pointed out different fish and made sure we saw lots of turtles in Akumal. I'm sure it wasn't easy for him as our family speaks English and the rest spoke French. It would have been better if we had a group with English speaking tourists because it took a lot of time to talk with both groups. I am sure the French speaking group thought the same. It all worked out in the end. We were told by our Apple Rep. in the hotel that there were bathrooms and changing rooms available in Tulum and Akumal. There was only a bathroom going into Tulum. Our guide told us to change into swimsuits while we were there. There are no other bathrooms available until the end of the day when you get to the restaurant. We left the hotel at 8:40am and returned at 4:00pm. We picked up other people along the way. There is a paid bathroom in Akumal but it is a hole in the wall and doesn't have soap or toilet paper. We were told to leave everything on our van except for our towels and change of clothes when we got to Akumal. It would have been great to have a few minutes to reapply sunscreen but it was back on the van with our wallets and phones, etc. We are lucky it was overcast and we didn't burn too bad. The Apple rep had told us they would provide lockers for our belongings but that never happened. One of the tour guides stood watch over our belongings on the beach while the van driver stayed with the rest of our belongings in the van.We stopped at a local restaraunt in Akumal on the way home and the food was good. My daughter and I went into the ladies room with the female tour guide and we were all three disgusted and couldn't use the facilities. She said she would get someone to clean them. She never came back. My husband had to stand outside the men's room so my daughter and I could change out of our wet swimsuits. There is nowhere to change after the snorkel trip and it is unreasonable to expect people to stay in their wet suits through lunch and the trip home. In the future I suggest they provide facilities to change clothes, use rest rooms and give people time to apply sunscreen. "

Many of us were sad when we had to leave.Lunch - We had a wonderful lunch at La Playa Xpu Ha Restaurant & Beach Club (see separate review for it).**Recommendation- Start the day with your swimsuit on under your clothing.

Ivan was our tour guide, and with his geology degree and an iPad packed with photos, maps and information, he provided an excellent educational tour for the whole group. Tulum is a fascinating site along the Caribbean, a former Mayan trade port with trade wind breezes which shows the sophisticated nature of the Mayan people, and swimming with the sea turtles at Akumal was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. A great tour!"

I have done this trip before on the big tour bus, which is comfortable, but the private tour was perfect, and worth the difference in price. Angel, our guide, and Samuel, our driver, picked us up right on time at the resort. Along the drive Angel gave us a good introductory history lesson to the area. Once at Chichen Itza, we had a 2.5 hour tour of the site, and before we started he asked us what we were interested in seeing. He stayed with us the entire time and gave us a very detailed history of every ruin and area we visited. Next we went to the cenote, where we had time to see the cenote and eat lunch. Throughout the visit, Angel allowed us to determine the needed time, so we could have stayed longer at Chichen Itza or at the cenote. I appreciated the attention to detail, the professionalism, Angel's knowledge and story-telling, and that we could go at our own pace. I would certainly use Cancun Adventure again."

Yuri was our guide and he was very qualified and very nice, as was his assistant Carlos and the captain of the boat. It was really rough seas the day we went, but the captain of the boat did his best being that its only a pontoon boat... The actual snorkling was a little confusing it was hard to follow Yuri and I missed out on feeding the turle!! The sights were beautiful though, we saw turtles and giant eagle rays along with some pretty colorful fish. We were dropped off on a private beach and enjoyed a wonderful lunch and open bar! The food was probably the best I had while in Mexico and there were nice beds to lounge on for a while. The timing was perfect. We were picked up around 7:30AM & were back before 3PM. One of the best excursions I've been on!"

Our guide, Israel, took time to learn our names and where we were from. His personality, energy, and knowledge helped us through each adventure. Tulum ruins were awe inspiring. It's hard to believe how long they have survived. Repeling and ziplines were a new experience everyone should have. Again, Israel gave us the ability to do so quickly and safely. What a blast! Snorkeling the cenotes (underwater cave) was interesting, but not my favorite. I prefer pretty fish and coral. I would recommend for people wanting to squeeze in several activities in a short amount of time."

We just got back from the Playa del Carmen area last week; this is the first chance we've had to comment here.The tour of Tulum was fascinating thanks to our guide, Thamara, who was very very knowledgeable about the culture and the area. She walked us through the site and gave us a feel for what it must have been like to live in those times and pointed out all sorts of things we wouldn't have noticed on our own. Only down side to this part of the day was that the site was quite busy but I guess everyone wants to see it....Next we were off to Akumal Beach. Thamara, our guide for the day, warned us that we might or might not see sea turtles as they can be fickle..... but we saw quite a few, maybe a dozen or so. They are so impressive. We also saw five or six large rays on the bottom and swimming around (a fascinating motion to watch). Many and various tropical fish near a small reef and I saw a very large barracuda. It was there and gone in the blink of an eye. After that we were off to another beach to eat a real Mexican lunch with a cervesa, of course. And we were given time to swim or walk along a really long beach.We took several tours/trips while we were there, but this one was our favorite. We'll be back in December and we'll go again..."

We got picked up from RIU Palace Mexico at 7:35am. It was about 10 of us on the bus and on the snorkeling trip. He had an iPad that he used to give us instructions. It was about a 5 min drive south from our hotel. He took us to a private beach for locals first in tulum so we could stretch our legs.. it was simply beautiful!!! Then when we ggot to the ruins we joined with another group of 13 and he was the tour guide for all. The place is crowded, but we knew that going there. The ruins are beautiful and so is the beach!! You will enjoy it. You are given water by Ivan. We spent about an hour and a half touring then he gave us an hour to explore alone and go to the beach.After we got a snack of graham crakers, bananas and cool towels. Great touch! Then we were off to Akumal for snorkeling. OMG!!!!! Would do this part over and over. Ivan was great guding us and making us feel safe while out in the water. He took us to the reef and we saw tons. We did this for an hour. It felt much shorter though. Anyway then it was time for lunch at Xpu-Ha. I rviewed this separately.All in all, great day!! Would recommend!!!!! We were gone from 7:30 to 4pm."

Vincent provided a very informed description of the Mayan culture and the Tulum site that made our visit unforgettable. We then snorkeled with the sea turtles. We felt lucky to have seen a lot of them and various other aquatic life. Finally, we had a meal at a local restaurant on the beach. A perfect ending to a perfect day.

The Sea Safari tour takes you from Puerto Aventuras, to a very close inlet for very your practice snorkel, then on the boat for about 15 minutes for the ocean reef snorkeling. The boat is quite comfortable as it rides over the waves. The snorkeling on the ocean reef is very interesting as we saw turtles, several schools of fish and many individual fish. I can see that the area around the reef could get wavy so consider that if you bring children or weak swimmers. The life jackets make it pretty easy, but you will get tired in the waves. After the snorkel, we took a truck (a fun ride) to a park along the beach for our lunch. This was a nice quiet area to relax in after the snorkeling.All three guides were all very good,experienced and attentive. However, the main guide, Luca, was exceptional. The reason was that he checked with each individual on the tour to make sure that they were OK several times during the trip. This is really important when there were a variety of ages and abilities, as there were on our tour. Luca's attention to the customer was noticeably higher than what we observed on other guided tours we took that same week (with other companies). The four of us that traveled together agreed on this."

We went snorkeling with the turtles first and this was awesome and our favorite part of the trip. We saw about 10 turtles and were very close to them. The coral reef was good but not as vibrant as others we have been to but we were very close to the reef and could see everything really well. The waters were warm and very clear. We then had lunch at a great beach restaurant with authentic Mexican food. The beach restaurant was a lot of fun (treehouses, hammocks, swings) and the food was excellent. We then went to Tulum. Tulum was hot but beautiful and worth the trip. Our guide, Ivan, had studied archeology and was VERY knowledgeable about the Mayan\u2019s and Tulum. It was a long day (7a.m.-5p.m.) and a lot of driving but we really enjoyed our day and got to see and do a lot. It was also a small group of only 12 of us which was nice and manageable. If you are looking for a full day excursion I would recommend you check this out. The staff was awesome."

When we went snorkling in Akumal she was organized and helpful and we all got to see turtles. Afterwards we went to a \"locals\" only restaurant on a beautiful beach. The only thing that I would change is to provide more time to swim after lunch."

I was hesitate to snorkel but thanks to Thamara, our tour guide & our small group, I had the experience of a lifetime. Our group was 9 & they were great to get to know. We saw plenty of sea turtles and colorful fish including a barracuda!!! Lunch was amazing. Thamara eluded the pushy venders upon entering Tulum. Her enthusiasm, energy and knowledge made Tulum so interesting. When we arrived back at the van, our driver handed us cold towels, cold water and plantains. Refreshing! Highly recommend this excursion. Thamara, I will taste your pastries the next time our paths cross :)"

I think Ivan was the only tour guide we saw that day using either an ipad or a playbook, the rest had laminated pictures or nothing at all. At Tulum Ivan took his time and talked about the history of the ruins, answering all our questions - very informative. The beach and view from the top of the ruins was breath taking. At Akumal he was very patient with those of us who were first time snorkellers, stopping frequently to ensure we were all together, and showing us were the turtles were. Before we swam around the reef he explained the importance of staying horizontal, so as not to damage the coral. Lunch was at a wonderful little restaurant on the beach, Ivan's office as he called it. The locals were awesome, food was plentiful and delicious, beers were good and cold. The shower was outside, and the washroom were small which made it awkward for changing. That is the only negative thing I can say about this excursion. Thanks Ivan!"

The tour van arrived at the hotel right on schedule. The van was small and we only had 6 people on the tour. We proceeded to Playa del Carmen where we picked up our guide Diego. It was still one hour to reach Tulum and Diego spent this time giving us a history of the Mayan civilization as well as the history of Tulum. Diego was very friendly and spoke excellent English. Upon arrival at the ruins we were each given a cold bottle of water and a large umbrella which came in very handy in the heat as there is limited shade and you spend most of your time out in the open. We were the only group that came prepared with umbrellas, a real nice touch! The first hour was spent with Diego giving us an up close and personal guided tour. His knowledge of the area was impressive. We had visited the ruins about 20 years ago and at that time took a taxi and went on our own. What a difference having a guide like Diego meant. The second hour was free time to explore and take pictures or go swimming. We chose to explore and took some really great pictures, it was a perfectly beautiful day. Those in our group that went swimming said it was the best beach and clearest water that they had ever seen. We then went back to the van where the driver had cold wet towels for us, a great relief from the heat. On the trip back we were also given cold water and snacks. It was a totally wonderful experience made even that much better by the information provided by Diego.We would highly recommend this trip and our thanks again to Diego for a great day!!Bob and Roselyn B.; Sebring, Ohio"

We had 5 couples in our group and he handled one very self absorbed woman with more grace than she deserved. Her antics made the rest of us bond in lightning fast friendship. A big shout out to my new friend Grace from Chicago and the rest of the \"Not From Ohio\" group. The stop at Tulum was beautiful. The ruins were amazing and Ivan was a wealth of knowledge about the Mayans.The beach has sand that is soft as silk. The snorkeling with the sea turtles was at another location and once again Ivan was great. Two of us in the group were unable to snorkel due to claustrophobia but my husband said they saw sea turtles, stingray's and many types of fish. Ivan tried to help the two of us with claustrophobia get use to the snorkel equipment with extreme patience. Although we could not do it we had a great time on the beach and in the shallow waters while the others went on a great snorkeling adventure. Lunch was at a perfect \"tropical\" setting. The small restaurant sat on the beach with a beautiful view. The food was delicious. We were served chicken fajita's with mexican rice and refried black beans. The \"Tourist\" salsa was very good and I was bold enough to try the \"Local's\" salsa. It was warm. Very very warm!! I have to say this was an experience that I will always remember with a huge smile."

Truly enjoyed this! After the Ruins, a snack and cool cloth was provided on the bus which was much much appreciated!! We then had the opportunity of snorkeling. When we booked the tour, it was rated as moderate exercise. However, I would not rate the snorkeling as moderate, i would rate as high. The distance and length could be overwhelming for a first time snorkeler or weak swimmer. Once you venture out there is no rest area. Myself being a lifeguard had concerns with the intensity of the waves when we ventured out, (I don't recommend with small children). However, if you are a strong swimmer, the experience was awesome, we saw plenty of turtles, large squids,stingrays and plenty of fish. The corals were ok. We truly enjoyed the local restaurant, the food was great. The bus ride was fun, we really enjoyed talking with Nicole and driver and listening to the music. Much enjoyed the day!

Driver Miguel was really nice. We went to the Akumal beach to do the snorkelling in the morning. The beach is incredible. Place was not crowded. Our tour guide Nicole took her time to explain how the equipment works, what to do when in the water and is happy to help anyone. Being my first time doing snorkeling, I appreciated her explanations. We did not had to swim long to see turtles, fish, sting rays and plenty of corals.After the snorkeling, it was time to eat. We were driven to La pura vida restaurant, about 5 minutes down the road. Meal was good. Typical Mexican food (beef and chicken fajitas with one of the best guacamole I've had in Mexico) The food is good, the beer's cold and the view from the restaurant is amazing. I loved this place.After lunch, we were driven to Tulum. This place is so nice. Nicole explained plenty of stuff without being overwhelming in details. I liked that very much. We had free time to visit by ourselves (grounds and beach) The visit to Tulum itself is not very expensive. It's about $7.00 per person (which is included when you buy the tour) At the exit, native mayan people sell popsicles for $2.00 each. I highly recommend them, they are really good and refreshing."

You walk away with a good understanding of the history of the ruins and the area, but he also has a great personality. He isn't boring and doesn't talk incessantly the WHOLE trip. He's also very approachable and enthusiastically answers any questions you might have about the region as a whole. Also on the bus ride from Tulum to Akumal, Ivan gave us a snack. After all the walking, we devoured the bananas & honey crackers before we went on our snorkeling adventure. We felt completely safe the entire time. Ivan watched over the group & Tony the driver stayed in the van with our belongings so we didn't have to carry everything we brought with us. While snorkeling, a person in our group got a severe leg cramp and was struggling. Ivan went to help right away. He was also quick to check on/help another person who dropped something while snorkeling. Lunch was delicious & relaxing. Overall, this was a great trip for the price/time commitment. It's not as far as driving all the way to Coba or Chichen Itza, but you still get a taste of the historical Mayan ruins. As for the snorkeling, you actually get to see several sea turtles and other animals in addition to the coral reef unlike other areas where you'll just see the reef. Enjoy!Gracias Ivan y Tony! :)"

Visiting Tulum on our own would have been an enjoyable walk through some interesting old rock structures. Gus, however, gave an extremely detailed history of the area and the people who lived there, including their culture, ancestry, and where they are now (he has Mayan ancestry himself!). His knowledge of the fauna and flora made his \"lectures\" more interesting than the structures themselves. I can't say enough good about Gus. He also led us very expertly on the snorkeling trip. It was unseasonably cold and cloudy that day, which took away from the coral reefs/sea turtles/fish viewing, but it was well worth it nevertheless. The local restaurant for lunch was true \"local cuisine\", something we never would have found on our own. Our first trip to Mexico, and our first snorkeling experience was excellent because of the location and the tour guide."

We were all anxious to go snorkeling, so when she gave us the option of spending some free time at Tulum or continuing on, we went on to the snorkeling area. Seeing the large turtles was amazing, and Ara did a good job of letting us know when something was visible below. We were a bit disappointed in the lack of brightly colored fish, but none of us had ever gone swimming with the big turtles before, so that was a treat. Lunch at a local place right on the beach was fun, and that cold beer really hit the spot after our snorkeling adventure."

I was a little disappointed in the snorkeling experience, but that was not the fault of the Cancun Adventures team, the man that booked our tour (Delta/United Vacations) told us we were going by boat and we ended up going to the beach and walking into the water for the snorkeling. We had NICOLE as our tour guide and she was amazing! If you get to experience this be sure to ask for her. She is so personable and made the experience great. It was raining when we went through the ruins (which was awesome as well) and she did a wonderful job considering the conditions! Thanks Nicole for making it a trip to remember!"

Enjoyed seeing Tulum and imagining it as a thriving center of activity, thanks to her information. Very much appreciated Alejandra's help with those of us in the group who were inexperienced or first time snorkelers. Seeing the sea turtles that way was lovely and we were also able to see a bit of coral reef and other fish. It was a fairly windy day and the water was quite choppy, which made the snorkelling more difficult and a little less enjoyable and than it could have been, but not much you can do about the weather. Lunch after snorkelling at another beautiful beach was also very good. I felt we got our money's worth from this tour."

Ivan explained to us that by going to Akumal First we would avoid the throngs of tourists later in the afternoon. He was a great resource of information, and really seemed to enjoy his work. The snorkeling was absolutely amazing. We saw sea turtles, 3 different kinds of rays, even a barracuda. The reef was beautiful and the schools of fish were so close you could practically touch them. Ivan swam out with us and pointed out all the sights, and again, he was really enjoying his time. We then were taken to a beach-side restaurant/bar for lunch in Akumal with stunning views of the water and beaches. The food was traditional Mexican and delicious. Plenty of time to relax and enjoy the lunch hour. Then it was off to Tulum, and the Mayan ruins. I can honestly say it was one of the best tours I have err experienced. Ivan was an amazing guide, and the sights and history of the Mayan ruins left us speechless. I cannot recommend enough this tour!"

Our guide, Mounir (who was awesome and from France but loves his home in Mexico ) said that during season, some 7000 people a day come through the park. Very crowded but expected. Bathrooms are available but not for the picky. A lot of folks going through there so don't expect sanitary. Mounir and our driver provided water, cool wash cloths and snacks. Nice surprise since we did not have a chance to eat before being picked up."

Our snorkle equipment with correct life vest sizes was underneath our seats. The beach at Akumal was a bit crowded and while you could just swim out on your own, our tour guide Ara knew where to find the best creatures. We saw at least 7 sea turtles! After snorkling we were shuttled to a beautiful beach bar where we sat outside and ate the best Mexican food our trip!"

I have to say this was an amazing tour and our Guides Patty (Patrica) and Alejandra were over the top! They were awesome. Very knowledgeable and well spoken. Patty was our main guide, she explained and answered every question we threw at her about the Mayans and the City of Tulum. Anything she didn't know which wasn't much Alejandra answered. They made you feel very comfortable and at home. The van that transported us was very nice and well maintained by our driver, the tour to Tulum was just like you would hope it would be then we went to Akumal to snorkle with the Sea Turtles. Once again Patty and Alejandra made you feel very safe and brought us to some incredible sights namely the Sea Turtles (Magical!) was also saw and Eagle Ray and Small pods of Squids (Very Cool!) then it was off the another location for lunch. It was way off the beat and path to a very secluded location where there was a building for dinning, a little store for souviners, a bar and a beach that was spectacular. After that we headed back to our hotels. If your in the Cancun area and your looking for a GREAT Tour and Company to use for that tour I highly recommend Cancun Adventures. This was pretty much an all day tour. Bring regular and underwater cameras, beach attire and swim suits, sunscreen and walking shoes. Your gonna love this one! Thanks again to Patty and Alejandra for all the memories!"

Patricia explained a lot about the Mayan culture and beliefs. We had some free-time to walk around the site, after Patricia showed us the main Mayan temples. Nearby, was an excellent beach, the view was amazing! After the great tour in Tulum, we went snorkeling with turtles and stingrays at Akumal. It was an unforgettable experience- a one-of-a-kind! Patricia gave as some training on how to use the snorkeling equipment, and after that we went into the water to snorkel. There were a lot of turtles (big & small), some colorful fish, and huge stingrays. After our snorkeling experience, we went to a Beach Club to eat at a buffet. The view of the beach was phenomenal. Just like you see in the pictures! At the beach The food was OK, and after the whole tour, we went back to our hotels! It was amazing. If you are in Mexico- you definitely want to go there! It's an ALL-DAY event. (Bring camera,walking shoes, cash, swimsuits, and extra clothing!) GREAT TOUR, once again!"

He was extremely informative about Tulum and you could tell how seriously the company takes their safety standards when we went snorkeling. We knew this would be the case from using their sister company`s in PV and Cabo.We were not crazy about the food at the Mexican stop we had on the way home. This company is just starting off the ground on this side and I am positive it won`t be long until they are well known for their truly excellent service.

We were fortunate enough to go on the Sea Safari with one other couple (just the four of us!) along with our awesome and gracious guide, Nicole. We went snorkelling in areas that we wouldn't have found unless we were on a tour. The first stop of the day was an ancient lighthouse from the Mayan age in a small lagoon type area (to test our snorkelling skills). Then we ventured out in the boat to more open waters and saw all sorts of awesome fish and sea life - moray eels, lion fish, parrot fish, starfish, etc. We were fortunate enough to see more than one moray eel, which was awesome because I had never seen them before. Our final stop was at a little beach restaurant, where we had an awesome and fresh lunch (guacamole, chips, pasta, fish, etc.) and a few drinks. Even though the weather was unpredictable (started out sunny and ended up stormy!) we still had an awesome time. Everyone was in good humour and Nicole was a fantastic, patient, and interesting guide. We were so happy with this tour that we booked the Whale Shark experience through the same company!

We got on the boat about five minutes from the hotel, close enough to walk. All of the boats were new and comfortable; very speedy and they seemed to soak up the waves. There were six of us, all family, so we got a private tour. Javier's wife even came along! We had a perfect day too. A clear sunny sky and smooth seas. The snorkeling was great. We started in a protected bay near a Mayan lighthouse. There was a mix of both fresh and salt water in that bay and it was really cool to move from the clear water of one or the other into the cloudiness of where they mixed. Once we were all comfortable with our gear, we boarded the boat and headed out to sea for a ride to the coral reef. The reef was amazing. We saw turtles, sting rays, barracuda, an octopus, and more fish than you could count; lots of different species too. After snorkeling, we boarded the boat for a short ride to the Blue Venado Beach Club, where we had a nice lunch. The ceviche was excellent. Javier really went the extra mile as my wife was feeling a little sick from the day and he went out of the way to help her. This excursion was the single most fun thing we did during our entire vacation in Mexico and easily the highlight of our trip. Highly recommended!"

The beach in Akumal is beautiful...white sand, palm trees, flowers and clear blue water. We saw lots of fish in the reef, sting rays and sea turtles. It was very calm and relaxing just floating in the water with the turtles. The snorkeling area is not far from the beach, and you have a life jacket, so even if you are not a swimmer it is doable. We then returned to the restaurant (a place I would never have stopped to eat at driving by), to again change and have lunch (included in the price). The service and the food was great. The outside dining area was on a small cliff, so the view was spectacular. It was our anniversary, so our guide arranged a piece of cake for us too. We never felt rushed, our guide said he only does 1 tour a day, so it was a very relaxing trip. The van then drove us back to our resort."

I needed prescription goggles to snorkel and he was able to pick up two for me to try on. It was too bad that the original snorkel area was closed off due to safety reasons (high tides) so we didn't get to see turtles. But despite that, the alternative snorkel area we ended up going to was still beautiful and full of fish. It was my very first time snorkeling and I'm not a very strong swimmer so I was a bit nervous at first but it turned out fine and has convinced me to go on more snorkeling trips in the future!"

She shared lots of information about Tulum that was very entertaining. Having never been to the Mexican Caribbean before it was a totally new experience for us. Alex made it a great day. They picked us up at our hotel on time, educated us on the way to the ruins at Tulum and were very helpful. After spending about two hours at Tulum we went snorkeling at the back of Akumal Bay in a lagoon type area. Unfortunately the waters at Akumal Bay were too stirred up from the storms that had occurred almost daily so the bay was closed. We so wanted to go swimming with the sea turtles but were not able to. The lagoon was very nice, calm, and scenic. It was most enjoyable. After our snorkeling adventure we were taken to a great Mexican restaurant that was situated on a beach. I couldn't tell you today where that was but the food was great and it was a very relaxing lunch. The food was great. After lunch we were able to do some shopping at some local shops. My wife really enjoyed that. If you have the chance you should do this tour in the Riviera Mayo. Hope Alex is your guide because she is great!!!"

We were watched carefully, coached and received lots of information on the area and the event. Then we headed out about 25 minutes on the ocean - fast and fun. Another 45 minutes in the water over the reef with a good variety of sea life to observe. Then on to lunch by way of a open bus through the jungle.

Our 10 year old had a great time!The day we went was beautiful with clear blue skies and clear turquoise water and soft white beach area. It was very hot and humid within the ruins, but you are able to go to the small beach area to cool off and get wet if you choose. There are not too many areas with shade. Bring bug spray, you will need it. You can purchase it there, but it is very expensive!There are people who charge for pictures with Mayan warriors, iguanas, parrots, etc. They took several pics with our camera. Even though we paid them for the photo opportunity, to us it was worth the $10.00 or so to capture our adventure then be able to print what we want.At the entrance is an outdoor market. There are food and drink restaurants there, I think only one is air conditioned. You can purchase almost any gift item you would want. The prices end up reasonable, but always bargain price!"

Had snakes while we got organized and then headed out , 8 clients and 1 guide ,I assistant guide and the captain. We had to go out for almost an hour and a half to find the whales as it is at the end of their season but was well worth it! You go in 4 at a time with 2 people and in for about 10 mins a time. You do get close sometimes and the whales don't even seem to notice you! Ones we saw were probably 30-35 feet long! And then in a group of 20 foot manta rays who are friendly and Big and Gorgous too! We were in the water 4 times. We had told them earlier that we were vegan/vegetarians and they had great lunches for us. We anchored off isles manures in wonderful 4 foot blue water and ate standing in the water with cold beers! Magnificent! Did not have time for any reef snorkelling as it took us so long to find the whale sharks but still just a great trip. On the bus back, rubin the guide talked about a great coffee shop in playa del Carmen and presto, off the highway we went for the best cafe mochas! All in all it was a super day!"

Nice! off we go snorkeling the coral reefs. It was so magnificent! So glad i did it! Some people decided to stay on the boat, but i wanted to try the open seas. Eddy stayed back with me as I am not a great swimmer and new at snorkeling. He was always in eye view and was there giving me the thumps up! As I moved along (slowly) amazed by the sights of the oceans, Eddy was there. I catch up the the group a couple times, but there was just so much to see. So amazing. About 20 minutes in, i was tired. Eddy saw my fatigue and told me to hang on the the life ring. He pulled me along. Yes, I was pulled along while still enjoying the sights below the water. The coral reek was amazing. I was ctch up with the group again and Eddy was off to help others. Again I got tired...and Nicole was right there. I mumbled I was tired and she also pulled me along for a while until Eddy returned. Te whole experience was so exhilarating! I am not adventurous and this is probably the most adventurous thing I have ever done. Cant wait to do it again. Thanks EDDY. You are my hero. NICOLE thanks for being there to help me too. You both are my heroes. George you were a great host. So funny and personable. You were the perfect host. Captain you also gave us a great ride.

Overall we were very pleased - the site at Tulum is a neat thing to behold, and Akumal is a really picturesque beach with lots of sea life on display. We ate lunch at a very nice restaurant on the beach and still got back to the resort in good time.The best thing about the tour were our driver Enrique and guide Jorge. Their enthusiasm, humor and attention to detail were outstanding and really made the trip a memorable experience. We never felt hurried or pushed along - quite the opposite, we were given free time to explore and lounge around, yet everything was well-organized and on time. Kudos to them and we'd highly recommend this excursion if you're looking to expand your activities beyond your accomodations."

The waters were calm and uncrowded and we saw close to 15 turtles. We spent two relaxed hours snorkeling and Diego knew all the best spots along the coral reef in Akumal.Then we went to Good Life restaurant, which was kitschy but very cool. Beautiful location, and the food was delicious. Had a slow, relaxed lunch break.After that, we traveled to Tulum, where we took our time to visit the ruins. Diego took us on a side route that maximized the unveiling of the ruins, and it was just spectacular. He took panorama shots of us, told us the real truths about the Mayans and their civilization, and was overall the best tour guide I've ever had.

From the very start our tour guide Diego was enthusiastic, knowledgeable and patient. We headed out to Akumal first, which meant we got there early in the morning for clear turtle viewing and fewer crowds. We even got to explore the coral reef farther out from the coast. Diego was great at reading our group and he knew just where to take us to get the best experience. We even had a person who was afraid of the ocean and she stayed in the water for 2 hours with Diego's reassurance! After stopping for (yummy and authentic) lunch and showers, we headed off to Tulum where we really got to learn about the Mayan culture. What really made the experience so unforgettable were all the little touches...cold towels, drinks, umbrellas, and especially Diego's willingness to answer lots of questions and get to know each one of us! It was definitely an experience we will never forget and it helped put an already amazing vacation over the top! Can we go back now??"

We stayed away from other groups, which allowed us to have a more special experience and see things most other tours wouldn't have. Diego was a wealth of information and was extremely accommodating, even for some of our more difficult group members. Going to see the turtles of Akumal in the morning is the way to go as there were fewer groups, the bay was glass, and the visibility underwater was fantastic. After spending nearly two hours way out in the bay we went to this FANTASTIC little beach restaurant for lunch and a beer. It was easily the coolest establishment and best local food I had during our entire vacation.Tulum, the Mayan ruins, were great as well. Once again, Diego really knew his stuff and had TONS of spots off the beaten path to show us. All in all, I couldn't imagine taking this trip with another guide or company. We made a great new friend in Diego and gained memories to last a lifetime.HIGHLY RECOMMEND"

Carlos was our guide and Elmer was the boat captain, Taylor was our other guide and chef. There were several other tours at the site but they took us away from the crowd and made sure everyone on our tour had several up close encounters with the sharks. We went in - 2 people per guide- so you always felt very safe. They also took a lot of great pictures of the whole day. After swimming with the sharks we went to Isla Mujeres to swim and have fresh ceviche and guacamole that Taylor made for us. It was the best! Overall one of the greatest adventures we have been on over the last 15 years on our trips to Mexico. Would HIGHLY recommend!!"

When we got to Tulum I saw the other guides like robots just spitting out information but with our guide he told us different things, and we always found a way that we were not anywhere near big groups! From there we went to Akumal for the most amazing snorkel experience of my life. We saw huge turtles, baby turles, eagle mantas, sting rays all while feeling very comfortable with our guide. From there we had an amazing lunch at a little restaurant around the corner that had great food.

The day included Tulum, Coba, lunch, a Mayan village, and snorkeling at Akumal. The snorkeling required swimming out about 1/4 mile to swim with sea turtles, so if you are not a strong swimmer you may want to skip the snorkeling. The water felt great though after the hot climbs and bike riding around the Mayan ruins. Defenitely a highlight of our trip!"

The best part was then being taken to a local beach bar called La Buena Vida for a real mexican lunch (best food of the trip) and corona's. There were tons of funky decor all around the bar and swings instead of stools - we felt like locals and it was awesome. Alex let us decide when we wanted to leave and we were having a great time talking with her. This trip was very small and we only had one other couple and a family of four with us, which we loved, as opposed to a busload of people (we saw many of these types of tours).

It was a smallish catamaran, called Sunshine, with a crew of 4 and about 20 guests. We snorkeled in 3 distinct areas. One featured more coral than fish, the second more fish, and the 3rd starfish. The crew was very attentive and friendly. Our group snorkeled together lead by our tour leader, Romina and another crew member, who both were intent on us enjoying ourselves. We were given non-alcoholic drinks and chips after snorkeling. The only negative about the snorkeling experience was that the crew collected the snorkels after the second stop, so when we stopped to see the starfish you either had to skip getting in the water to snorkel or just grab a snorkel from the used pile and hope for the best. No one offered a clean snorkel. After returning to the marina we were served a surprisingly good lunch with alcoholic drinks. Transportation to and from our Cancun resort was included and very efficient. The entire experience was very enjoyable and worth the time and money."

Our wedding party of 14 booked the Reef Adventure tour, and because it was our wedding, they gave us a private catamaran. It was so unexpected and so generous of the team, and allowed us to have a more private setting. Shortly into our catamaran tour we happened upon a pod of Dolphins, which we later find out is extremely rare there! The captain even turned the boat around a few times so we could get some good looks. It was amazing! The snorkeling was really very good that day with calmer waters than I have experienced in the past, so visibility was great, and there were so many fish!!! I had my GoPro going and it got some great video. The guides were so nice to the entire group of family and friends, and even drug around my older mother who got very tired trying to snorkel. She gave it a go though, and they were so patient with her. We also saw a Sting Ray and a Sea Turtle, and countless other fish. It was truly a family experience we all will remember. I cannot again thank everyone at Maroma Adventures enough for their hospitality. One of our guides, Joel, was extremely nice, but the entire crew was top notch."

They also gave us snacks and drinks. the view was beautiful. Then we went to the restaurant to eat and the food was really yummy. In the afternoon, we did the jet skies, which they call wave runners, and had a blast because the ocean was rough and that made the experience so much more better. After that we did the dune buggies and the trail was gorgeous. The view of the beach was breathtaking. They take pictures of everything and then you have the option of bying the cd with all of them for $60 dollars. It is worth it because they take a lot of pics. Since there were three of us it was cheap. I would recommend this tour to anybody who wants the outdoor experience. The place was clean, the staff supper friendly."

I gave mine away to a fellow fisherman that didn't catch anything, we took my husbands fish to the marina where it was prepared for no charge. Best meal we had on the entire trip and the staff was more than happy to help you with anything there they were very nice. The only complaint I have for this trip is the time you depart from your hotel is 6:55am and that's a bit early considering the trip to the marina took maybe 20 mins and then it was just a waiting game until about 9:30 when you actually loaded to boat."

After the ride they took us to a beach front location for a soda and a snack of tortillas. The only disappointing thing is you don't can't to ride in the ocean with the horses but it is a law that they are not allowed to do that anymore.

I always thought I was a strong swimmer, but not this day. They take you to two different sites, and you have the option of staying on the boat. Afterwards we ate at an inclusive meal, then did the jet skis and the ATV. The jet skis were the best part of the trip since the water was so choppy you hit lots of waves, I had never ridden one before, and could have stayed out there all day. The ATV was fun, make sure you get one of your own. The trail goes through the jungle, and then your not done, you go out to the beach and back to a muddy jungle trail. The service was excellent."

I'm not here to bad talk the staff as they were well experienced fishermen but I want you to know what you're booking before you spend the money. -shared 4 hour trip up to 6 pax-$126 per person-$5 Roundtrip transportation per person - no dock fee, sweet!Expectations--Learn about deep sea fishing in Mexico. What kind of bait they'll be using for the fish we were trying to catch.-Have our guides (fishermen) more interactive and communicate with us.-Have our own pole to fish with. -Put our own bait-Have the staff assist us on our trip.-Go over safety on the boat *Note My boyfriend and I fish almost every weekend on our boat, so this was supposed to be the highlight of our trip as we were super excited to fish in MEXICO!!Our experience--Driver arrived on time and everything seemed to run smoothly. -There was a big group of us that was broken into 3 groups, we were the last group to be introduced to our \"captain\"-Each group, one at a time, was introduced by their captain. The captains seemed up beat and ready to take their paying customers on a unforgettable trip.Then it was my group, a group of 3; me, my boyfriend and a gentleman named Mark.It seemed we didn't have a captain as we were waiting for about 15 minutes for one. The workers were running around and you could tell something wasn't right. Then a staff member came and said follow me, which was weird because he didn't introduce himself like his fellow colleagues did for the other groups. He seemed a little irritated, like he was asked to do this trip last minute or something. You could feel the vibe wasn't right. He was also the only \"captain\" who was carrying bait, the others didnt. While the 3 of us were walking to the boat, mind you he was walking pretty fast, he slowed down to THEN introduce himself. (I totally forgot his name). As we were walking to the boat, I tried making small talk with him and asked if he went fishing the day before because I wanted to know what kind of fish were being caught. Now, I don't know if it was a language barrier but he told me, \"no, I don't fish, I clean the boat\" so the first thing I thought was, IS HE EVEN A CAPTAIN?!On the boat, we were greeted by 2 fishermen. While docking they were setting up all the reels. THEY BASICALLY DID EVERYTHING ONLY HANDING YOU THE POLE TO REEL IN THE FISH. Now, that's cool if you don't fish but if you do, it's not fishing. You must do the work to call it your catch, in my eyes. I think THEY think customers only care about reeling in the fish and taking the pictures. They have to remember not everyone is the same. I had no desire to reel in what they caught. -They didn't go over safety and I didn't see any life vest. Though, it was beautiful being out on the water and seeing some exotic fish being caught. I was disappointed that I didn't get to truly fish and I ended up sleeping on my fishing trip in Mexico. I know this was a long review, just want to give you a heads up on our experience and hopefully you have a better one. Cheers to fishing!!"

We walked along the beach, stopped for a rest to feed the camels some carrots, and then walked back.

I was with someone else and I ended up buying a CD of pictures. I now have a few good pictures of me on camel, them on a camel and some of both of us.

There's a photographer running along the beach taking pictures the whole time but the picture packages are super expensive. Ended up only getting one picture for $20, but didn't mind being that they let you take as many pictures as you like with your own cameras during the break.

This was a great activity to do as a family or large group. The ride itself is about an hour, with a stop half way through to get off the camels, stretch, and feed them carrots. The camel wranglers were wonderful, and handled these magnificent beasts with a firm but gentle hand. We passed others that were on horseback, and they took pictures of us on our camels lol. After the safari was over, we were served snacks and cold drinks, and were able to explore the beach and pier for about an hour. The water was incredibly clear. The only negative thing I would say is that there was a lot of garbage on the safari trail - between the beach and the forest, above the seaweed line - which detracted from the beauty of the scenery."

Sadly when we got there we saw the beach was covered with many Sand bags and the water was very very murky and yellow and smelled like jet fuel. I guess from all the speed boats and wave runners..If your going there and not gonna do the activities its a waste of time and money. The beach area was horrible and very disappointing. I would not recommend spending the day hanging out at this beach with those chemical s in the water. Not a great place to hang out for the day."

I WOULDN'T recommend it for future weddings, the price is high and they DO NOT uphold their end of the bargain. OVERCHARGED AND UNDER DELIVERED"

We were told that there would be max 12 people on board the catameran, only small groups of people. Suddenly, we were around 30 people that were going on the same boat. Everything took a long time, and it was too crowded. The crew were constantly shouting at each other, or at the guests to keep close to the guide in the water. It ruined the whole trip for us, not very relaxing and enjoyable when we constanly had to consentrate on what the crew were shouting.When we got back to the boat, the crew immediately turned on laud music, so we could not even hear each other talk. And they did not even dock the boat until they got tips in their \"happy box\" as they called it. They were kidding about how they only accepted 50 and 100 pesos, and that we only should write good reviews in tripadvisor, or nothing at all. This was even more irritating!The food was OK, but then we had to wait 45 minutes for our booked transportation back to the hotell.The quality of the reef was not to good either, if you have seen other reefs before to compare. Just a few colorful corals. So dissapointing. A total ripoff."

First, a piece of advice: don't visit the Maroma Adventures web page, because this awesome view of one of the \"most beautiful beach in the world\" no longer exists. Then, if you don't believe me and decide it's worth a visit, here is our review:EXCELLENT: The restaurant and staff. The food a la carte is tasty, prices are very decent considering this is a beach club in the middle of nowhere. Waiters are very friendly, always trying to please you and not pushy.GOOD: The facilities and grounds. Palapas and loungers, table and chairs, everything is at your disposal under palm trees, for you to spend a idyllic lazy afternoon between siesta and margaritas\u2026BAD: Maroma Adventures is a beach club with no (more) beach. Unfortunate priority has been given to motor and water sports, and to dolphins show, for obvious reasons. In front of your lounger, there are only huge piers with plenty of boats, and the water smells really bad. No way to swim there, between noisy wave runners and speed boats.WORST: This is when you decide to go for a walk along the coast, looking for the \"most beautiful beach in the world\" the waiters have sworn you will find. Don't forget beach towels, hats and bottled water, this is a one mile walk to Punta Maroma. The first quarter mile will give you a perfect idea of what to be lost in the desert means, but it's worth the effort: at last, here is the pristine water and powdery sand you were expecting, plus this gorgeous peacefulness. Too bad, it won't last: five minutes later, putting aside the Federal regulations, like swarms of annoying bees, ATVs will brush past you between palm trees, or wave runners will come too close to the shore.May this review work better than repellent, and allow Maroma Adventures CEO understand a Beach Club needs a beach, and Punta Maroma is a Federal protected area the motor and water sports \"amazing activities for the whole family\" (sic) must respect."

We arrived at Maroma Adventures through our booked excursion with about a dozen others and we all had to wait about an hour and a half before we could check in so we all just sat around which was a complete bummer. When we got off the catamaran we were served \"dinner\" if thats what it can be called. The food was horrible, the drinks and service were worse. After dinner we waited another hour and a half for our booked transportation back to our hotel. Wasted an entire day on what should have been 2 hours plus transportation (10 minutes each way).

Romi was our guide - she was very nice and it was apparent that she enjoyed her job.My 9 year-old daughter and I wore our bathing suits in the open-air, beach front 'restaurant' and were asked to put cover-ups on. There was an extra charge if we wanted to eat at the buffet. After spending $205 plus tip on a mediocre trip, we were not willing to pay up. You could purchase beer on the return bus ride. Had I not been paying attention to where we were going, the driver would have skipped our resort. Overall, I would not recommend Aventuras Maroma for a snorkel trip. I have gone on NUMEROUS snorkel excursions in Cancun which were way more enjoyable and better priced.

We could then take what we catch and have it cooked any way we wanted with $1 beers and free sodas at the dock. The Reality:First, the pick up time. We were told to be at the lobby at 7:45 am. We were there at 7:40 and were greeted by an angry driver that told me, that my group should have been there at 7:30 and I was late. My fiance proceeded to show him the paper we had and he said \"well I was told 7:30 and I need to follow that.\" We booked this the night before, so how were we suppose to know. Instead of being gracious towards us and telling us there was no issue, he continued to rush us to get in the car. Upon getting in the car, we found out there were more people in the shuttle which explained why the driver was upset. We were surprised to see other people in a private shuttle but it wasn't a big deal to us. We liked getting to know the other group!When we got there we were told we would only be given 1 liter of beer per person on board. This was not unlimited. We were told we could buy extra beers at the bar for $18 a six pack. This is a ridiculous price for beer anywhere but especially in Mexico, We were not the only ones that had this same problem, as our fellow shuttle members had the same thing happen to them. They \"kindly\" gave us two litters per person, which was nice but the feeling of being deceived had already been felt. The ship crew itself was great. We caught so many fish (only Trigger fish). We chose the four that we were having and the crew filet and cleaned the fish nicely. We then sat down and were told we could only have the fish cooked two ways, pan seared with butter or pan seared with garlic. Any other way would cost more, even ceviche because of the cost of making it. Upon ordering drinks for the group, we were told that beer was $3 for a 10 ounce drink. (We were told $1 beers and meals cooked any way we wanted). We of course were upset because some of the selling points were not made clear to us. I talked to the manager on staff and it became a \"let's point the finger to someone else\" instead of trying to make it better. When I asked for a receipt so I could speak with the person that booked the excursion, they at first denied it to me and then hesitantly gave me a copy.The trip itself was fun, and we had a good time with the crew. We were disappointed that some of the things sold to us as part of the \"package\" were not included. This will be the last time I book any excursion with Maroma Adventures."

Starts out with 45 minutes of scuba theory which I thought would be boring but the instructor made it interestingly fun. After that we got on the boat and went 10 minutes out to about 10 foot of water for initial training which was great so you can get a feel of being in the ocean rather than in a pool. Once done we came back up and then went to the reef where we then again dove down to a depth of 40 feet and spent about 35-40 minutes swimming along the reef. We went along for about 2 or 3 hundred yards. All this time I felt very safe as the instructors and a team of 3 swam with us making sure air supply was good and that we felt ok. I would highly recommend this over snorkeling."

We have 12yr old and 4yr old boys and were nervous about finding activities that would be appropriate for both kids. Snorkeling - We went out on a large catamaran and visited two reef areas for snorkeling. They provide all gear (life jackets included) and the guides are knowledgable, well spoken, and entertaining. They even gave my 4-yr old snorkeling gear, and stayed with us when we first jumped in the water because he was a little scared and didn't really understand how to use it. He never really got the hang of using the snorkel and mask together but he is a good swimmer and quickly got over his nerves and swam right along with us, and rode on our backs when he got tired. I would not recommend this for young children who are not comfortable in the water. There were a couple families there with kids ages 3-4ish that ended up spending very little time in the water because their kiddos were scared. You have to jump off the boat and then you're just out on the reef in the middle of the ocean, I can see how it would be pretty intimidating for a little one.After snorkeling we came back to the beach for lunch, our lunch was included in our package and was buffet style - traditional Mexican flavor and was quite tasty. Our youngest wouldn't touch it though so we were able to order him some chicken nuggets and fries for the extra charge of $6.Our next event was swimming with dolphins and wasn't until 3:30, it was about 1:30 when we finished lunch. They happily moved our time up to 2:00 and even called our transportation to ensure we wouldn't have to wait too long for a ride back to the resort.The dolphin swimming was AMAZING and our trainer Andrea was phenomenal, so smart and good with the Dolphins and so patient with the little kids, she really worked hard to make sure everyone had a special experience! We had booked the Royal Swim (which included the dorsal ride and foot push). Our littlest couldn't do these things but was able to come along and do lots of other things (kissing, shaking hands, petting, hugging). Something else to note, there are different areas of the platform, the Royal swim takes place on the deepest part of the platform, about shoulder deep on me (5'2) and way over my 4yr old's head. Everyone wears life vests but if your child is not comfortable treading water on their own or holding the side, I would not book this particular event unless they are not taking part. I would not have been able to do the activities if my child had needed me to hold him. They have other encounter activities that would be perfect for little ones that don't require them to be on their own in the water for any amount of time.Overall I am thrilled that we booked this excursion, it was the best day of our vacation!"

He didn't turn 6 until our 5th day there so we had to wait until then, but on his birthday me and him got up early and caught our bus to Maroma Adventures. We did the ATV and Speedboat and he LOVED it. It was great and the circuits they bring you through are perfect. Only downside was that once you are finished you get a quick meal then transportation back. It would of been nice to get to enjoy this beautiful beach a bit more. And it is one of the nicest beaches I've ever seen. The sand was so white and fluffy like walking in piles of baby powder. The have a superb resort being built right next to this with Villa type rooms over the water (kinda like the resorts in Fiji). All in all, it was a great day and me and my son had a fantastic time. Highly recommend this short tour to anyone. We left the resort around 8am and were back by 12:20pm."

We arranged the trip with our hotel through Lomas travel which included transportation. Snorkeling was great. The catamaran ride was very smooth and our tour started right on time. We all had life jackets - the water was 10-20 feet deep. This was my 2nd time snorkeling and it was good - you were actually swimming with schools of colorful fish at times - it frequently felt like virtual reality. Our guides were great (Joel and Pepe) - they would go ahead and we would all follow. They would point out things underwater too. I never felt unsafe and I am a non-swimmer. We had adults and children (ages 10-adult) and other than a few with motion sickness, we all had a great time. The wind was good, so whoever wanted to do the spinnaker off the boat (a swing on a parachute) was able to, an added bonus. After snorkeling we had the lobster lunch (or you could have had surf & turf) and that was very good - great service, drinks, etc. One of my kids had the mexican buffet, which also looked good - chips/salsa, fajitas, rice, etc.). Our group then split up and some did parasailing (all had an awesome experience), some did horseback riding (wished more of the path had been on the beach - most was through the jungle), and some stayed back on the beach. The beach is amazing - the best sand anywhere (powder fine), there was plenty of shade. One of the kids had an allergic reaction to some grass in the jungle and they had an on-site medic who gave her benedryl. We did end up buying the photo dvd which was expensive ($90), but we split the cost between families. They also emailed us the pictures. Overall we had a great experience and would recommend it - the beach alone was worth the trip."

Walked under cabana... it was infested with mosquitoes! The guides DID NOT have bug repellent available. In the height of Zika, and no spray.They told us to walk across the street to a convenience store. $17.50 USD later we had two very small sprays. Bathed in it!! Walked back, then the guide advised us it was extremely hot, and we needed water. They DID NOT EVEN PROVIDE WATER! we walked back to the store for waters. A two hour horseback riding excursion through the jungle and no bug repellent or water ! Should have known it wasn't going to be good. Rode two hours minus 10 min on the \"beach\" for photo ops, through stagnant water that smelled like sewer. Behind construction sites filled with garbage and debris. Worst experience EVER !when we realized the ATV went on the same route we decided not to do the ATV. Well, they wouldn't let us cancel !Then we were told they couldn't/wouldn't take us back to our hotel because they didn't have \"room\" since we were supposed to stay for a second excursion. After being persistent they finally sent us to the bus with another group of four. We were on a bus the size of a greyhound and there was only 6 of us on the entire bus.We went to the trip planner at El Dorado Royale to complain.He (cesar) told us we couldn't get a refund because we didn't have our coupon. The same coupon the manager at maroma took and refused to give it back to us.That was tuesday. I wrote a formal complaint. And on Thursday cesar told us they would give us back 50% of the ATV cost.... even though we never went on the ATV, didn't use their time or gas.We will never use Lomas Travel again. They have no customer service whatsoever. And as far as the El Dorado Royale... the resort is beautiful and most of the staff is courteous. Our concierge wouldn't even go to bat for us, and didn't help us resolve the issue. Stay away from maroma adventures. Once you get to their location they want to keep you there to buy their junk. BAD EXPERIENCE !"

I recommend sunscreen since you're right out in the open. Don't worry about getting wet. They launch you off the back of the boat without you ever having touched the water. If you ask for it they will give you a toe dip at the end when they're reeling you in. Scared of heights? Not really a problem since your'e so high you lose ground sense. But if you do start thinking worst case scenarios you are over the water lol. It is just like being on a Ferris Wheel without all the looping. It's really a soft, zen-like feel of freeness. You're just floating on air. Worried about safety? No need. You are harnessed in there pretty tight. Can my spouse come? Sure can. My wife and I rode it tandem style. Do I have to know how to swim?

There were people on my trip who were outright reaching out to touch the reef and also not paying attention to where they kick/stand. It was very sad.

Going parasailing is an experience in itself, but doing it along one of the most beautiful beaches in the world made it even more amazing! Fly high above the ocean waters and see the beauty that Riviera Maya has to offer and see the Maroma Beach from an entirely different angle. See the beautiful reef below you and take it all in during your 15-20 minute flight. Was a great time it was! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this to anyone visiting Riviera May!"

We were staying in Cancun and it takes a while to get here so try to get it all scheduled in one day. The ATVs were a lot of fun and we had a blast on them. The camel riding however was probably the highlight of the day since it is a rare opportunity to do something like this. The camels were easy to ride and liked to nuzzle and get petted. They looked well cared for and the crew treated them like their pets. We rode for about 20 minutes and got off to take pictures and feed them carrots. Then we turned around and rode them back to their sheltered area. No problem taking as many pictures as you wanted but we did buy some of the pictures they took as well."

He was a little disappointed that when they did bottom fishing he didn't get to fish himself, the workers do it and then when they catch something they rotate boat passengers reeling them in. We caught red snapper and amberjacks. The two guys worked really hard and made sure everyone got turns and we all had fun laughing when someone's arm got tired. :) I got pretty hot towards the end and they let me go up top with the captain under the shade so that was very nice. I didn't want to sit inside and that way I could stay outside, but in shade. Overall a lot of fun and we would do it again."

The shuttle ride is included in the package so I had to pay $16 if you're just an observer for the shuttle ride.The swim with the Dolphins package is so worth it since you spend a good time in the water with the Dolphins. I'd recommend this package if you have not done this experience ever.The negative thing is they get you in the photos. It cost about $40 per photo or just pay $85 per person for all photos (which basically ends up worth it) but if there's 2 or more of you, then it gets really expensive.The place itself to offers more activities so if anyone in your party wants to do something else, then you can do it all in just one place.Also, you can just hang out in the beach if you're not doing any of the activities."

My son and I signed up for discovery SCUBA where you get 30 min class room basics and go to a location not far from the dock to pass a few checks of equipment and practical equipment use exercises in shallow water (going over what was given in the class). This is to make sure you can handle basic situations you may encounter 30-40 ft below the surface without panicking. Once everyone checks out ok, it's on to the dive location just a few minutes away. I'll just say pay attention to everything the Dive Master is telling you, just relax, and you will have an amazing dive in the crystal clear Caribbean blue water. All the members of the team were very professional, very friendly, and made safety a priority. The equipment was sooo much better than the other two places I had tried before. Better equipment makes for a better experience all together. I would highly recommend this outfit for diving. I plan on going back to them for a dive certification vacation :)"

They picked us up at our hotel in a nice big, air conditioned bus (we were the only ones on the bus!) around noon and in less than 30 minutes we were at MaromaAdventures. What a beautiful spot! The water is all shades of gorgeous blue!! We met the captain Pepee (not PeePee as he informed us) and he let us board the beautiful catamaran Jo & Lo where we met with his crew - Louis and Gil and off we went! Pepee first gave us all life jackets, explained the safety rules, gave us a brief history of our surroundings, and asked if any of us were snorkeling for the first time or were nervous about snorkeling. Three hands went up.We made two different stops at the reefs, each around 45 minutes, and the snorkeling was incredible! We saw many different and colorful fish. Pepee and Louis stayed with the first timers/nervous snorkelers the entire time. Both of them had life rings and pulled the nervous snorkelers so they could concentrate on the fish. They were great!! Pepee brought a bottle full of fish food which attracted many beautiful fish!!After we left the second spot, but before we returned to the dock, those of us that wanted were treated to a \"ride\" on the spinnaker. I was one of the four that did it and am so glad that I did!! It was a little bit like parasailing but the sail was attached to the boat. What a spectacular view!!I can't say enough about Pepee, Louis and Gil....what a fantastic crew! They were funny, attentive, answered all our questions and kept the group from getting thirsty! The beer and soda flowed the entire trip and we were even offered tequilla (declined) and champagne (accepted)!When we returned to the dock Pepee announced \"welcome to Cuba\" and brought us to the restaurant for our Mexican snacks. Some of us got nachos, guacamole and salsa but we had asked if we could be returned to our hotel earlier than out 6:00 pickup time so opted to skip our snacks and went back to the hotel.This beach is absolutely beautiful! And Maroma Adventures offers other activities besides snorkeling. While we didn't try anything else, based on our experience I wouldn't hesitate doing something else with them if we are ever in the area again!"

He pointed out tons of stuff that the rest of didn't get to see, He even dove down and brought up a conch for him to see up close. There were 2 dives and on the the 2nd dive we actually swam with a sea turtle, that was so awesome! After we were done diving they let us do a spinete (it's kind of like parasailing but not that high) you sit on a rope swing and it has a large sail that lifts you out of the water and you float behind the boat. It was fun! The crew were very safe we say some other boats doing it and the people were be whipped all around and falling off, our crew were so conscientious and safety oriented no one feel or felt insecure.We bought the lunch and free drinks with the package. The food was ok, drinks were strong and cold. Thanks for a great time!"

Dolphin Discovery - we paid extra for the royal swim and it was well worth it. Everyone did two riding tricks with the dolphins.3. Parasailing - this was by far the best parasailing experience I have ever had as well as the longest. 4. Scuba diving - I really cannot say enough about how perfect this was. We spent extra time and practiced in the hotel pool with one of the dive instructors and I would recommend that to anyone. The reef was beautiful and the instructors were all wonderful.

The instructor was well trained and and the dolphins were so much fun to interact with. We especially loved being pushed on the boogie board by them. The reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because they have you pose for various pictures during your experience. Obviously, you can't have your camera in the pool with you while you are doing this adventure, so I was happy that there was a photographer there to capture these moments. However, when we went to the gift shop to view them my husband and I were shocked by the price. $40 a picture...now you do the math. There is 5 in our family. Even if we were to pick 5 pictures from the vast selection that would still be $200 in photos and that was after we spent $400 to swim. They also offer a \"deal\" that you can purchase ALL the pictures for $85 per person. Yikes! We vacation many places and I have never ran into a price that high for pictures. It really turned me off to the experience. We zip lined in the Smokey Mountains and payed a whooping $60 for the whole CD of pictures of the experience. A suggestion would be to include a group photo as part of the package vs. the outrageous cost."

The horses read your body language, so incase you want to leave a negative review if your horse was uncooperative just know that a woman on our tour thought her horse was not working for her. My husband who has experience with horses, switched this woman because she thought his horse was more tame, they switched and she still had the same results. And be honest with the tour guide, if you say you are an expert he will know if you are being truthful! This horseback riding tour was the most memorable and my favorite part of our entire trip!

Enjoyable if you have experience. Very dusty (bandannas provided along with hard hats). Five speed semi-auto gearbox Honda's which were plenty equipped to cope with the conditions. We had five riders in our group with a single 'leader' at the front who found it hard to control some of the silly antics of those at the back. Good fun though.SPEEDBOATS - single hull monocoque fibreglass construct with Honda 30hp outboards. Very rigid - if you suffer from any kind of back issue do not go out in anything more rough than a mill pond. We went out in a little swell, not too many waves but a bit lumpy in places. Minor tuition again so unless you know how to handle a 'speedboat' or small RIB go as a passenger with someone you trust. We set off and were pretty much flat out most of the 30 mins of the session. The 'dead mans cord' was not utilised, so if the driver got thrown out the boat would carry on, which was worthy of a mention; at approx. 25-28 knots max speed that could lead to a bad incident. We did become airborne almost completely on two occasions when encountering wash from other boats combined with swell. Exciting, hard landings. Not much seat padding. Life vests provided. You get very wet from the spray. Great fun if you know what you are doing. Single 'leader' at front - found it challenging to keep some of the (six) boats 'in-line' behind him which could have spoiled the fun if he had to keep stopping and repeating the need to 'follow the leader' Luckily he had a loud voice and was assertive enough. Great fun!DEEP SEA FISHING - aboard a fishing boat with up to six guests and four crew. Everyone gets a go at trawling for game fish and then static fishing for smaller fish - about four hours in total. If you get sea sick then take tablets before hand. We were about 1-2km offshore outside the reef and caught a number of 'trigger fish' that were filleted on the boat whilst returning to shore and bagged up for us to take to the chef who rustled (pan fried) them up with a salad and nice sauce of your choosing (garlic works well). Crew were friendly and experienced and knew where to go and how likely a big catch was \"we only said we were fishing, we didn't say we were going catching!\" was the quote of the day. Take your sun cream. Beer, soft drinks provided on board. If you like a boat trip with added excitement and activity this is a good trip."

            "review": "Excellent Activities. We booked four excursions through Lomas Travel, which has an office at El Dorado Maroma (our resort). We participated in an ATV Tour, Swimming with the Dolphins, Speed Boating and Deep Sea Fishing. ATV Tour: Was well guided and a lot of fun! They keep you close to the grounds, but have some fun twists and turns along the way. They had a person or two taking pictures which was amazing and you absolutely cannot take your own while riding at a quick and exciting pace.Swimming with the Dolphins: Neither my husband nor I have ever participated in an animal encounter. The guide was very kind and gave great instructions on what to do and not do during the encounter. This was an opportunity of a lifetime and we thoroughly enjoyed every minute!Speed Boating: My husband and I got a boat to ourselves and followed the guide around the ocean right out front of our resort, it was fun and exhilarating. My husband LOVED driving the boat!Deep Sea Fishing: This is a must when you visit Maroma Adventures. We paid for a shared boat, but got upgraded as luck would have it and we had a boat all to ourselves. The captain and crew were all very kind and patient. I even got sea sick and one of the crew members was very kind and attentive. They made me cheer up and push past the sickness and I caught a few fish myself! I am so glad they pushed me to do a little more to get my mind of my queasiness. My husband caught two beautiful Amber Jack fish. One he paid to have mounted as the staff at Maroma Adventures helps coordinate, and the other the crew cleaned and sent with us to our resort to be prepared for our dinner. It was the longest 4 hours, but so worth the money and time spent!Traveled November 2015, as a couple"

My husband (32) and I (28) showed up for the fishing and the location was a little shabby. But there were many people there waiting for their own deep sea fishing excursions. When it was time to go, the process was pretty efficient and we were luckily paired with other couples who were of much the same mentality that we are. There were 3 couples and 3 crew members on the boat. The captain and his crew were very efficient at handling the gear and made sure that we were comfortable while heading out to troll for larger fish. We had a bit of a slow time trolling for larger fish. My husband asked to be shown how to bait a hook and make a lure. The crew seemed super entertained or impressed with his effort. Finally we caught a few fish and the crew was good about making sure the everyone was shared a turn on the reel. We also fished by hand, not just trolled. That was the most fun and fast paced part of the day. We had a great time and of what we caught, we gave some of the fish to the crew and took some back to our hotel to have the restaurant cook and eat for lunch! It was amazing!"

The second site was smaller and calmer than the first, the captain moved the boat so the swimmers didn't have to swim against the waves to return to the boat. Did a great job while we were snorkeling, showing us ocean creatures. Very fun timeWe stayed and had lunch buffet that was provided. Nothing special but it was ok and included 2 free drinks. It was niceThe dolphin swim was amazing. Totally worth the money. We selected the two dolphin package and it was most worth it. So much time with the dolphins. When the dolphins pushed you from the water is was so very cool. Mauricio was so informative and you could tell he has passion for these mammals. He made you feel so comfortable. Some people complained about the cost of the pictures, well its vacation ,break out the wallet and live a little. The pictures are professional quality and they are for memories, they are priceless.

The driver was a few minutes late which was a little annoying and then to make it worse we had to make a stop that was out of the way. We did the speed boat and AtV package. The drive was about an hour. When we got there we got lockers and then went to the meeting area for boating. When we got to the beach we were given instructions that were a little hard to understand. Since we were a family of 5, we had to split up between 2 boats. We did get a lot of salt in our eyes which hurt, which was to be expected. In the middle, we got yelled at twice in each boat for not going fast enough and not following him which was very hard. He said other people were paying to go fast and we were holding them up. He also said we would have to go back if we didn\u2019t go faster. This was not fun and made it an even worse experience for us. When we got out we were taking to the ATVs area. One of the kids had to go with the guide because we had 3 kids and 2 adults and no kids could drive. Once everyone got on their ATV we started going off on the same windy road that we took to get there. Driving was not too bad but took some getting used to and was a little hard. That road was not that great because we saw a bunch of cars and even a guy with Camels because they do Camel Riding and it wasn\u2019t that great. Then, after about 10-20 minutes we turned into this area that was more rocky and fun. We liked that better. We were on that for 15-30 minutes. Then we got back on the windy road. After driving for another little while, we went to the beach. The driver who had on of the kids ATV got stuck in the sand and he had to get help to get pushed. Then we drove around on the beach which was probably the best part. Then I think we went back to the beginning. After that, we had about 30-60 minutes to get ready for our transportation. We had time to buy the outrageously expensive pictures. We bought 2, $20USD each. We had the driver drop us off at a restaurant because it was dinner and it was very helpful. Overall, this was okay, but I would not do this again. I\u2019m not saying this is a bad place, just that the activities we did weren\u2019t that good. We did ATVing again at Loma Bonita (no website, we did it through our Lomas Travel guy who helped us with this) and it was so much better. They even let the kids drive a little bit. I hope this review helped."

Not a lot to see on the trails as it was pretty tree lined. The beach is beautiful but didn't spend a lot of the time there.

The camels seemed well taken care of, and the tour guides were so nice and helpful! The guides were always able to answer any questions that we had about the camels or the area of the safari. What we appreciated most about this excursion was that the tour guides offered to take pictures of us on our phones! Other excursions charge $20-$50 per picture, which is outrageous! These guides understood certain pictures we wanted to take (selfies with the camels, pictures with our families, pictures of us feeding the camels, etc.), and generously offered to take these pictures on each of our phones. Even though they took great pictures on our phones, the excursion also had a professional photographer following us throughout the whole safari. The best part: our WHOLE photo package (included over 100 photos and videos) only cost $70, which is a steal compared to other excursions! If you're an animal lover, or simply enjoy seeing the scenic view of the beautiful beach, this excursion is for you! The safari included a lunch at the buffet afterwords, which was great!

The only refreshments on board was water and maybe beer for after.We have been to the Caymans, Jamaica, Bahamas and Cozumel and the snorkeling is much better at those destinations. The weather was very windy so the ocean was so choppy it took everything out of you just to keep from getting pushed around by the waves. What we saw of the fish were just so-so. We did snorkel at the second destination because we were exhausted. Not the relaxing swim I was expecting.We did the lobster lunch after and that was delicious. Very gourmet at a table to ourselves with a waiter.Make sure of the weather if you go. If it's windy, skip it."

We booked what we believed was a catamaran with snorkeling for a half day excursion, after the end of the trip it was clearly a snorkeling only excursion - we never left sight of the dock! The first boat the tour guide ushered us to was pretty scary looking - we actually thought they were kidding, it was the most disgusting boat I have ever seen when docking a catamaran (I have done t least 15 catamaran excursions). A few people did talk to \"customer service\" about the boat conditions and we were changed to a different catamaran ( the second one looked just like the brochure). The catamaran \"putted\" around close the Marina anchoring twice for snorkeling. We were all given an 18g bag of potato chips and one bottle of water for the duration of the excursion, this was not the all inclusive trip we had booked by far.When we arrived back at the marina we were told we had a \"Mexican appetizer\" not including beverages waiting for us in the restaurant. Overall - very overpriced (85.00 USD) to put around by the Marina (for 2 hours) and have 6 potato chips. I wouldn't return to this venue as the base price seemed expensive and every time you turned around you were offered drinks but at additional costs. At the end of the excursion we were told our transportation to the resort was delayed 1.5 hours and I believe this was to encourage you to buy food and beverages while waiting to return to your resort. After talking to customer service our transportation was suddenly ready."

We spent the morning snorkeling, which was wonderful and the highlight of our day. Victor was a vivacious and professional snorkeling guide. We saw amazing fish, turtles, stingrays and eels at two seperate coral reefs. After the snorkeling trip , were dropped off at the beach ( which is gorgeous), but the lunch that was included in our price was very fair with few choices at the buffet and the wait staff seemed well staffed but disorganized. They served the drinks and we sat at our table for 15 mins ( with our food from the buffett) before someone waited on us to serve drinks. Had we known, we would have much rather just done the snorkeling trip and then returned to our hotel to have lunch at our all inclusive hotel ( which was wonderful). Lastly, my 16 year old son did the wave runner for 40 mins, which he really enjoyed and my 11 year old daughter did the Dolphin Discovery which we truly felt was a tourist trap. It was overcrowded and it appeared they had overbooked, which turned out to be a disorganized and expensive 1 hour. Lastly, the shuttle service back to our hotel at the end of the day was a 30 min. wait, and that was disorganized as well. They had one attendant with a radio attempting to direct all the people/famililies to their correct shuttle."

The trails takes you on the road, through the jungle and across a beach. It is about 45-50 minutes. Then we had a quick break and did the Waverunners. The beach was nice with enough waves out there to make it fun. The water was so blue. The folks there were friendly and patient with folks. Always laughing either with us or maybe at us. But who cared we were having fun.The food there was decent and a bargain. Beach lounges and tables near the beach made it relaxing. The only one knock is if you go later in the day, you will run into all the groups who are returning from fishing charters( did not see any big catches, only small ones) and catamaran tours so there are a lot of folks walking by. But there is a long stretch of nice beach to enjoy and avoid them. We did not see any beach vendors but I won't go as far to say they are not there. The facilities are nice, bathrooms are OK by relative terms. "

They were constantly changing bait and working hard to try and get somethingThen stopped the boat and essentially we fished with rods for the last hour or two. Caught a bunch then. They help and once something was on would give the line to my daughters to pull in which was cool. You can keep what you catch so we kept a nice white snapper for our lunch. They clean it in the boat and cook it in their restaurant. We bought some side dishes which weren't great. Could probably go with the free beans and chips plus our grilled fish and call it a day but it was only $20Shuttle back to the resort and doneWe did the 4 hr private for $597 plus tips I booked it all online with Daniel who was great Resort offered to take care of the booking but price was $697Would definitely do it again to try and land a sailfish or marlin"

We booked our daughter 5 years old who needed to be accompanied by an adult so that they could sell two full $79 US packages. They took them to the other end of the pool so that I could not take any decent close up photos. They charged us right off the bat an extra $15 US for transportation (which were not told about) for the spectator (me and my 2 year old son). After the Dolphin Encounter which was pretty lousy and did not impress my 5 year old daughter they offered photos that they took. They deliberately took individual photographs of my wife and my daughter and not one photo of them both even though she had to hold my daughter the whole time. They did this so that a single photo of both of them did not exist. This way they could hustle two individual photograph packages. Simply rude in my opinion to not take a single photo of a mother and her child. They wanted $40 US for a single photo in either print or CD (they would not give both for that ridiculous price). I ended up buying an individual photo of my daughter as I wanted her to have a memory of her encounter with the dolphin. It does not end there. They gave us a voucher for a lunch at their restaurant. There were four choices of food which we found pretty gross and the restaurant was pretty basic. They asked us what we wanted to drink with our lunch and we ordered a couple of juices for the kids. At the end ,when we were leaving they told us we need to pay $7 US for the drinks. We were shocked, and asked about the included lunch and were told (after the fact) that drinks were not included. The whole place just feels sleazy and you feel hustled in the end. I regret leaving these people any money of mine and would advise caution when dealing with this place."

The transportation was on time, the staff was organized and ready for us, and we experienced no delays either day. Of the two, the Ocean Safari was the best. Hop on to a wave runner, and take a nice long ride in the ocean to an anchored buoy to snorkel. The best part of it was that there were only the 2 of us in our party, and our guide. It was our first time to snorkel, and we got personalized, one on one attention. Safety was a priority, and he went out of his way to point out different features, and after an hour in the water, we took another ride to a second snorkel spot. We spent another half hour here, and received additional dive instruction to view the entrance to an underwater cave. The parasailing was fun as well, but most of us know what to expect with that! Again, great staff, well organized, and safety first! Afterwards, there are showers and privacy to get cleaned up and change into dry clothes if you'd like, and soft drinks and a snack are provided at no additional charge. All in all, a terrific value, and I highly recommend this excursion company."

They told me 12 minutes. There were 4 other people that were also in the boat. We timed how long we were up, from the time our feet left the boat and back down was only 6 minutes. Far from 12 minutes. The other 2 couples also were complaining also because of how short the para sailing time was. Also because they were so late from our scheduled time to para sail, our ride back to our resort was missed, so my son and I got to sit and wait for another 1 1/2 hours for a ride back. I talked with my Lomas Travel agent, Samir, about getting some kind of refund, I agreed my son and I went up, only for half the time so I was asking for one ticket refund. The Lomas Travel agent called Moroma and Moroma said that none of this happened. They totally lied, I guess the \"customer always being right\" is not the case with them. It was not so much of the short time of being up for the para sailing but it was how much time my son and I had to wait to go up and then wait because they made us miss our ride back. We had to spend all of this time sitting at a table, not what I consider a fun adventure on our trip to Mexico! I emailed back the travel agent with Lomas to check whether a refund would be coming and I didn't get any kind of response, which I feel is unprofessional!!

We used the live chat on the Maroma website to get our location for pick-up (complimentary pick-up and drop-off were included). We were picked up from the Gran Porto Real Resort at 8am. The resort is clean and beautiful. We had a great boat ride out into the ocean where we had two 45 minute snorkel sessions at two different reefs. We were provided snorkeling equipment and a snack on the boat. The tour guides were super nice and made us feel very safe. After our tour we had about an hour to eat in the restaurant. It is a buffet style and with our package we were allowed to get free alcoholic drinks and food. There were lots of people there to do different activities, so you can easily fill your day with land and water activities. I would highly recommend this tour!"

            "review": "Paid entrance to enjoy beach; did not book any tours.. We are on an extended stay in Playa Del Carmen. As someone not staying at a resort, we enjoy searching for a nice, clean beach. Playa Maroma is cleaned and groomed. There are showers, bathrooms and nice lounge chairs to sit in. You can bring your own picnic or buy something from their bar/restaurant. We opted to bring our own food and drink as we are on a budget.We paid a 100 peso per person entrance fee at the gate for the day. Lockers and towels are extra money. It was a windy day; too rough in water to swim. Enjoyed the sun on beach. Went for a long walk in sand. There's lots of chairs to choose from, so you can be all by yourself if you want.This beach location is more desirable to visit if you have a car. If you want to take the collectivo, you likely will want to pay for taxi to beach (as it is a long, curvy road to beach). We were fortunate, as a young couple visiting offered us a ride in the store just outside the gate.While we enjoyed the day, we felt it was a bit cost prohibitive for us to go to this beach on a regular basis as we do not have our own car. However, it has been the cleanest beach we have visited near Playa del Carmen that isn't part of a resort. It is worth a stop if you want a quiet, romantic walk on a clean beach. There is also an abundance of tours offered if you want to pay extra to go on them. They seem to have the usual tours you find elsewhere in and near Playa Del Carmen, as well as a camel tour that may be interesting for someone looking for a different way to explore the mangroves and beach."

The riding was for our daughter who is an intermediate rider and the snorkeling was for me, be the 3 of us including my wife joined in both activities.The ride was 1.5 hours through a mangrove wooded area to a beach and back. It was tailored for beginner riders, but they did provide an opportunity for better riders to trot and canter. The scenery was lovely and the ride was a pleasure. It was led buy 3 experienced riders and the lead rider spoke very good English. He spent extra time with our daughter knowing that she was a good riders who wanted to experience different riding. All the riders were professional and fun to be with. The horses were very responsive, although the saddles were a bit hard. We all had fun. Bring your own camera as the pictures taken by the tour were expensive.After riding our package included a snack. We were expecting chips and fruit, however it was a whole buffet with beans, rice, fajitas, enchiladas, fresh fruit, and a beverage. The food was very good and the restaurant very clean with a wonderful view of the beach.The snorkeling was beautiful. I have snorkeled in the past, but my wife and daughter were beginners. We took off in a catamaran-like craft that was very stable. While going out the captain provided instruction to all for how to use the mask, snorkel, flippers, and vest. The lead diver had my daughter start from a life preserver and took special care of her. I stayed with my wife. The equipment was in perfect condition. The first area we snorkeled in near a reef was calm, being a good way to get started. The fish, plant-life and ocean bottom were interesting and the water clear.We moved a bit further in the boat and the 2nd dive was even better. The water was more choppy but the fish were in great abundance. They were colorful and varied. We way octopus, sea anemone, and sea urchins. My daughter gathered the courage to go off on her own. It was wonderful.The dive ended with a ride on the spinaker for those with enough energy left.Again, the staff were neat, professional and fun.The tour included transport to the beach from the hotel and back.Bring a change of clothes, and sun screen. They provide all the gear for riding and snorkeling.This area had many other activities including scuba, jet pack and wave runners, which we didn't try. I couldn't recommend this place enough."

I did a number of tours but Maroma's horseback riding adventure in Playa del Carmen was the absolute best of them all. The staff was top notch. Each and every one of them went out of their way to make sure you were safe and having an awesome time. As a horse owner for 30+ years, I obviously paid very close attention to the condition of the horses from their overall body condition down to their hooves. Riding a horse that wasn't in good shape would have been a deal breaker for me. These horses were rested and happy. Enough can't be said for the staff. They made this play date so much fun. I'd highly highly recommend it to anyone seeking a memorable experience whether you've ridden before or not. A must do!!!"

We didn't quite know what was happening but soon found a sign that directed us to the correct place for parasailing.Two of us went together and had a great time. The staff was fun and helpful. We shared the boat with 4 other customers. The bay was almost empty of other people. We had a blast! We could both go up side-by-side at the same time. The staff was great and allowed us to make a second trip up for a reasonable fee if we wished (due to the low turnout that day). They even took photos and videos of us with our own phones which was a great bonus!!! Back at the beach, the staff was great at making sure we found our transportation back to our hotel. We were also surprised that chips and salsa, re-fried beans, picante sauce and soft drinks were included with our ticket! One caveat would be to bring a water proof bag if you have anything you don't want to get wet. We were surprised by a few big waves! But it was a warm day and it felt good anyway.

Immediately we were introduced to our captain and crew mates Chili and Willi they were all very gracious and helped us on board. The asked if we wanted beverages and served us. We trolled for over an hour and did not catch anything but the one small bonito. The captain took us to the other side of the reef to bottom fish. Again the crew worked very hard to keep poles freshly baited continuously while asking if we were doing alright and needed more to drink. We caught several different types of fish. Rainbow runner, blue runner, trigger fish and what I thought a nice sized grouper probably about 12 pounds. Then our friend hooked into something heavy, they had the bait down about 400 feet so it took him a while to land the fish but he caught a very big Grouper 48 inches long and 36 inches wide estimated wait 80 pounds. The crew was very excited and were helpful so that we could get nice pictures. They kept us fishing right until our time was up, then they laid out our catch onto the deck so that we could again take more pictures. We were pleased with how hard the captain and crew worked to keep us satisfied. They cut up 2 of the trigger fish and the small grouper I caught and we took them to the restaurant at the marina the cook was most helpful telling us how he would grill them and along with the fish for $5.00 we could get salad and salsa to go with our fish everything was delicious! Because it was the largest fish our friend had ever caught he chose to have it mounted,but they did not pressure us at all into this they were helpful and answered questions as best as they could. Thank you to the crew and captain and the Marina for giving us the best deep sea fishing excursion we have ever been on. I would highly recommend our boat the Pelicano 2 and its crew!!"

            "review": "Great day of deep sea fishing. To set up this review: what follows is a pretty long and detailed review of my entire experience of chartering a boat for a full day of fishing with Maroma Adventures, but the short of it is that besides a few bumps in the road the trip was great. This review is geared towards people who want a comprehensive review with details, not just two or three sentences, and it has some thoughts for people who have had some bad experiences with deep sea/offshore fishing. Second, I have been to Mexico a few times and have not always had the best experiences. To be fair, I have had some wonderful experiences as well, but to be frank, there have been times when I have felt ripped off, and that has happened enough times to where I am now somewhat wary of booking activities, especially activities that are as expensive as chartering a boat for a full day of offshore fishing. A little about me (since I believe that the writer\u2019s experience is relevant to how a reader should take the review): I grew up fishing in Hawaii and am an avid offshore fisherman. As an adult I have chartered fishing boats many times in numerous locales, and I will say that overall this experience ranks up with the best of them.I was in Riviera Maya for a family reunion, so initially I wasn\u2019t sure if I was going to be able to get time off to go fishing, but I found out when I arrived that I would have a full day to myself. I looked at some websites for charter fishing companies in the area, and I spoke/emailed with a few of them, but I did not get good feelings, so I ended up I booking through the hotel (Fairmont Mayakoba, but you don't need to be staying there to book with Maroma - you can contact them directly). The hotel charged a commission, and in booking through them I was unable to speak directly with the captain, which I wanted to do in order to get a feel for what to expect, so I was a bit apprehensive, but I figured booking through the hotel would at least give me some kind of insurance/reassurance against something going wrong. I had arranged for transportation to/from the hotel, since I was without a car.On the morning of the trip the driver picked me up right on time, around 7:30am. We went to the marina (10 minutes from the hotel) and the driver dropped me off and told me to wait for someone to check me in. I was expecting a small fishing marina, but Maroma apparently owns a beach with a marina and offers a bunch of water-related activities (fishing, parasailing, snorkeling, jet skis, etc.). I saw a bunch of other people arrive, and we all waited around for about 30 minutes until someone checked us all in for our various activities. That took about 15 minutes, and then a staff member gave a quick brief to everyone who was fishing all at the same time, and then five different groups were split up onto five different boats according to what each group had booked. From arrival to getting on the boat, the whole process was pretty unorganized and not well explained (which might have been in part due to the English/Spanish language barrier), but all in all everything worked out. I booked a full day exclusive charter which was supposed to be 8:30am-4:30pm. My brothers-in-law were going to join me but ended up not coming, so it was just me. The name of the boat I was on was called Moon Shadow, with Captain Jose and mates Luis and Omar.A light storm had hit the area the day before, and the water was a bit rough, with winds around 10 mph. January is considered a bit of an off time for many of the larger species (like marlin and tuna), which made dorado, wahoo and barracuda the prime targets per the crew. They also said that trolling would give us the best shot at putting something larger in the boat (as opposed to bottom fishing for grouper or snapper), so we set the trip around trolling for dorado, wahoo and barracuda. The crew were very accommodating in terms of including me in on the gameplan. Ten minutes outside the harbor we set out five lines and headed for an area close to Cozumel called The Channel, which is only reachable on a full day charter (it\u2019s too far away to get there, fish it and then get back on a half day charter). We trolled dead ballyhoo on 50lbs test with 100 lb leaders and 6/0 conventional reels. The equipment was a little old but still worked well (we hooked at least a few fish on every rig). We caught three dorado on the way to The Channel. We had a fourth one on but it got off right near the boat. We reached The Channel around 11am and continued trolling but hooked up two of the five rods to downriggers in order to get the bait closer to the bottom, and we spent the next two hours catching barracuda.Around 1pm Luis (who spoke the best English) offered a choice: we could go to a nearby bottom fishing spot and try that, or we could stay in The Channel. He told me that the bottom fishing spot was primarily fished by jigging, but that the fish this time of year are generally smaller (groupers and snappers under ten pounds). Since I don\u2019t mind trolling, which is actually sometimes more comfortable when the water gets rough, I opted to keep catching larger fish, so we spent the next hour hooking more barracudas (I was hoping for some wahoo, which frequent the same area, as well for variety, but you can\u2019t control what bites). Then we removed the down riggers around 2pm and headed back towards the harbor. We caught five more dorado on the way back. At one point we had four on at once, and it was mayhem on the boat for about fifteen minutes, but we landed them all. Since we were now out of ballyhoo, Luis offered to go to a bottom fishing spot near the harbor to use up the rest of my time, but I was beat, so we ended up back at the marina around 4pm, 30 minutes ahead of schedule. All in all we totaled eleven barracudas (my guess is between 10-30 pounds) and eight dorados (my guess is between 15-35 pounds).A few thoughts: Definitely do some research beforehand. Hit some websites and talk to a few different companies (I looked at websites for five companies and ended up speaking or emailing with two of them). Ask about the different methods your charter will use to catch fish and see if that sounds like something you want to do. A lot of people don\u2019t want to troll all day, but in many instances trolling will be the most productive method. In my case, I could have spent part of the day bottom fishing (or even the whole day if I had requested that upfront). That would have meant that I had a rod in my hand the whole time, and that I would be able to feel each strike, but it might have also meant not catching a fish over eight pounds. I wanted to go for something bigger, so trolling the whole day was worth the trade off of not holding a rod in my hand the whole time. Also, the best area for the type of fishing you want to do may not be right near the harbor, so chartering a full day may truly be beneficial (and not just an upsell by the charter company) if you want to maximize success. I reckon that I would have caught maybe a third of the fish that I did if I had gone out for just a half-day. One thing on that, though - a full day of offshore fishing is a long day on the water, so it may not be for everyone, but if you are serious about catching fish, don't mind being on a boat all day, don't get seasick and don't mind some rough water and being exposed to sun, wind and other elements, it will maximize your chances at catching fish. One last thing - if you book transportation, the driver taking you back to your hotel may not be the same driver that dropped you off, so make sure he or she is clear on where you are going. I almost ended up at a different hotel, even though I told the driver where I was going, because he had a piece of paper that had a different hotel than mine. That kind of echoes back to the lack of organization in the check-in process, so I guess the bottom line is to ask questions and confirm everything so you are clear on exactly how the day is going to unfold.As I stated before, I was a bit apprehensive of things not going well, but the day ended up exceeding my expectations (really, the only things that didn't go smoothly were the check-in process and the transportation). The captain and crew were very professional: knowledgeable, hard-working and accommodating. Fishing doesn\u2019t always mean catching, but effort is effort regardless of the catch, and these guys put in every effort to catch fish. Luis told me that he, Jose and Omar always fish together and always on the Moon Shadow, which is important, since that kind of familiarity among the crew and boat helps to maximize fishing success. And, even with a language barrier, Luis was very generous in explaining tactics for fishing the local waters. The boat was stocked with lunch and beverages. Never once during the entire trip did I feel like I was being \u201csold\u201d or \u201chustled\u201d anything, and when we returned to port Luis offered to cut up some fish for me to take to my hotel to have them cook (I politely declined, but the point is that they offered).All in all, it was a great trip, and I would highly recommend Moon Shadow with Captain Jose, Luis and Omar."

The $77 USD price included round trip transportation to and from our resort, a 2 hour ride and a snack at the end. Being a lifelong equestrian and horse owner, it was important to me that the horses were healthy and well cared for ... which they absolutely were, and it is apparently that they have visits from the blacksmith regularly :) It might seem a bit strange at the beginning (we were dropped off by the taxi near the main road in a small corral with a covered water trough area, and a few minutes later the horses were brought out, already tacked-up and lead by the guide), but it's evident immediately that they all know their job and are very peaceful and content.The guides ask everyone their experience level and put you on an appropriate horse. \"All of our horses are gentle,\" he says \"but some are just more gentle.\" haha! They all were really wonderful though. I rode a grey mare named \"Paolina,\" who apparently has figured out how to untie herself while waiting at the water trough and then go around and untie all of the horses! That's my girl hahaWe headed off down the mangrove trail, around a cenote and through many water crossings to eventually arrive at the beach. We weren't able to ride through the water due to new Mexican regulations, but it still made for a beautiful ride. After riding back to the corral, we dismounted and the horses were lead back to the water trough. The guides then hopped on a bus with us and we went to the Vive Maromoa park for our complimentary soft drinks and chips and salsa while we waited for our taxi to pick us back up. The guides were wonderful (talkative, funny and caring about their horses), the horses were great and the ride was beautiful. You simply cannot beat that for the price. 2 thumbs up!"

We had to pass a skills test which was done at about 8 feet in the ocean, unlike most training places in pools. The ocean helped give us a better idea of what it would be like when we went out deeper. We passed the skills test and were allowed to continue, which was at around 40 feet deep. We had a small group so we felt safe because they could give us a lot of attention to each of us. Hector was our Master Diver and he made me feel very comfortable for being a beginner. They also have a photo/video diver who joins along and you can purchase his pictures after the dive is over. Definitely worth it. The diving staff was wonderful and if you have ever wanted to try scuba diving, this is the place to go!"

The first spot we had to swim quite a ways to get to the reef. It was ok for me, but my younger nephews (first time snorkelers) who were a bit nervous anyhow, were tired from fighting the waves on a very windy day before even getting there. I was one of the few in our bunch who made it close to the reef. There weren't that many fish, and it was pretty disappointing. There were also 2 other boats of people there, which caused a bit of confusion for some snorkelers.The second stop to snorkel at was MUCH better. There were lots of fish to see, and we were dropped off at a much more convenient spot. Unfortunately, many people on my boat didn't want to get off after the disappointment and physical demand of the last stop (including my nephews). Wish this would have been the first and only stop, and the tour would have been shorter.The staff was good about providing drinks, helping us get our equipment on, and being informative. Our guide was Joel, and he was very thorough in what was going to happen on the tour.We had the buffet afterwards at the Maroma dining area. I would skip this next time and opt to eat back at our own resort. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good enough for me to feel comfortable telling others to pay for it.There was about a half hour wait for us for the ride back to the hotel, which was somewhat long and boring. Then, we had to drop everyone off at their resorts making the ride back to our resort longer than necessary.As you can tell, I was pretty disappointed in this experience. Maybe I've been spoiled by awesome snorkeling experiences in Bonaire and Hawaii ...nonetheless, not a tour i would do again or recommend to others."

Generations hotel is the fist pickup in RIviera Maya. We had to at be at the lobby by 8. After stopping at several hotels, we got to Maroma at abut 8:30/8:45 and had to sit and wait for a large group to be assembled by 9:30. They take you \"sailing\" for about 45 minutes only to end up about 200 feet from the dock you left from. The reef is probably 3/4 dead. It's very sad to see. They have to chum the water to get fish to show up. We snorkeled for about 45 minutes. We then got back on the boat and \"sailed\" for anther 45 minutes. At the second stop there were so many jellyfish that I had to turn around and to back to the boat. You could not go more than a few feet before running into one and I just didn't want to get stung. We then got back on the boat to go to shore. We were then told we could not get on a boat until 2:00!! WE had to sit and wait for the people who purchased the lunch with their package to eat. The group I was with was furious. We had to sit and wait for close to two hours and then stop at every hotel on the way to our hotel since we were the last. We later found out you just had to demand to be on a 12:30 bus. Make sure you do so or you will be stuck! Most hotels are all inclusive. Why would you ever want to eat on a 1/2 day snorkel tour?! I would not suggest going. Save the reef. I doesn't need more visitors. Save your time. Get ready to sit for about 3/4 of your half day snorkel tour."

I have to give the crew a 5+ star rating for how they treated not only me but the other sick passengers. They quickly handed out water bottles,poured water on our heads & behind our necks to keep us comfortable. As far as the other passengers, they were able to continue the excursion and didn't miss a single beat! The whole crew was so knowledgeable of the reef and the customer service was spectacular. My friend was sick the entire trip and Luis catered to her in anyway possible, helping her in and out of the boat. I cannot say enough good things about this crew!!

When you first arrive you sign the appropriate paper work and they have you wait for about an hour....so you will buy things. The beach itself is very nice, I wish I had time to explore...but in doing so I would need no sense of smell because the water stinks pretty bad! We took the catamaran out...and back in...then out again. We (all six of us) and some of the others were looking around like what's going on? They put the sail up for a few minutes but everything was just for show. There was maybe 20 patrons on the boat. The snorkeling itself was pretty good for a first timer. They threw out fish food so the few fish that were there would come up to you. We kicked and got kicked a few times because there were about 20 people but its wasn't too bad. After the first tour, about 30 minutes or so we boarded and were given a snack, a whole 1/2 ounce bag of regular chips, really? a tiny salty snack after most just drank a pint of ocean water? Then we chugged over 100 yards to the next spot, the same or less than the first but the current was a bit shaky in some spots. After everyone was aboard and headed back we got the \"begging for tips\" speech and I don't think a lot of people ended up giving. When you get back you get chips & salsa (that come with the tour) which is actually very good and you can buy anything else that you want. It's a scam. The transportation back does not come for an hour and a half after you get back from the boat, they give you a tease on the boat, they know that you're hungry from a hard workout and purposely make it so you almost HAVE TO buy something there. Over all it was fun for the family but the \"scamminess\" was obvious. Would I recommend this? Maybe to first time snorkelers but definitely not to novice or above. Also I recommend bringing some granola bars or something to help with energy on the boat and to have something to tide you over if you don't want to eat in their restaurant. Apply sunscreen BEFORE (or out of sight) you get there so they don't hassle you about biodegradable sunscreen and want you to pay $20 plus for it. I do understand why they do it but just the same, another scam."

They only had one snorkel small enough for the boys, so they took turns. One used it at the first stop and the other used it at the second. The guide had the boys hold the ring and he pulled them around so they didn't have to swim. The guide also fed the fish, so schools of fish surrounded us.

Joel and his partner were friendly, polite, courteous and most accommodating. The ride went thru a scenic jungle and out onto the most beautiful beach I have ever seen. Their photographers were awesome and Joel assisted with more personal photos that some of us requested. The trip was a once in a lifetime experience thanks to our guides. THANK YOU!!"

We spent the morning sailing out to the coral reef on a catamaran where we then snorkelled over the reef. You can be brave enough to jump off the boat or use the steps, you will have help from the many helpful staff on board. Water and soft drinks are provided on board and all snorkelling equipment including life jackets. Be sure to have plenty of sun cream on, there are two locations for snorkelling and each one is 45 minutes, very easy to get burnt. We had a lovely lunch at this site and in the afternoon swam with the dolphins. This was amazing, the trainer was brilliant and we did everything from rubbing there tummies to a foot push out of the water. A brilliant day out, highly recommended."

However the team quickly catered for just me to go out on my two dives with Hector, one of the Dive Instructors. The two dives were both very enjoyable, and there were a lot of different things to see whilst under the water. Hector was very informative whilst under water, using signals to indicate what I was seeing and where to look. I also had to use his emergency regulator during my second dive, during which he was very professional and the transition went very smoothly. The whole experience was one I enjoyed immensely, more so thanks to Hector and his professionalism throughout both of my dives and also on a personal level.I also had the use of a Jet Ski whilst on Maroma Beach for 30 minutes, which again was very enjoyable and would definitely recommend doing for an adrenaline rush!Overall Maroma Adventures ensured that my visit to Maroma Beach was both memorable and enjoyable!"

There were 6 in our group, 3 of us are certified SCUBA Divers and 3 had never snorkeled before. We booked it so we each had our own wave runner. There was brief orientation at the beginning. He could have been better with the snorkel gear, but since 3 of us came with our own, he probably thought we all knew what we were doing. We spent about 50% of the time on wave runners and 50% snorkeling. We saw a small reef and went over fairly deep hole. Our guide swam down and brought up a starfish and a large shell with an animal in it. He also made sure to take them back to where he found them."

Not being certified, I had no problem with the instruction and felt very comfortable with the equipment and the usage. The instructor was attentive and patient. While at Maroma adventures, our expectations were managed and there wasn't much waiting around to begin the dive. There was a one hour wait after the dive because we spent so much time in the water that we had to wait for a later shuttle, but that's hardly something to complain about. We got more diving! There were members of the excursion who had less experience or trouble with equipment and the dive masters were very helpful to those individuals."

I booked this through one of those ONLINE discount sites. The cost was pretty cheap considering the ride was almost 2 full hours. It was very enjoyable. As part of a group of beginners, we were given instructions before mounting the horses. We were told how to steer them left and right, and how to make them stop. We were also told, to make them go faster, to kick them with our feet while in the stir-ups. I swear... those horses seem to have a mind of their own. I was able to steer mine left and right, and to slow him down, but he picked up speed and started to trot whenever he wanted to. There were times when I was lagging behind, and when I kicked the horse (as instructed), he still didn't pick up his pace. There was an instructor lagging at the rear, and occasionally I would hear him make some sounds, and then my horse would start to move faster. Whenever there was an opening between me and the horse in front of me, he would suddenly start trotting to pass the other horse... just never when I tried to coax it. After the two hours, I was very soar in the upper thighs (which is a normal experience if you haven't ridden a horse before (or haven't ridden in years)). All in all, I had a very nice time."

After the ride, they took us back to the main area where we were treated to soda, chips, salsa, and guac (included in the price of horseback riding). The main area is really cool! Palm trees and tables and music. Deep sea fishing: we were paired up with another couple and were escorted to our boat. Our crew was the captain and 2 guys, who helped with the fishing. The first 2 hours were trawl fishing (?), where the boat kept going and the lines were in the water. We didn\u2019t catch anything that way so we stopped the boat and cast our lines again. We were able to catch a few snappers\u2014the biggest was about 20 lbs. I guess the waters were not in favor that day, bc that\u2019s all we caught. When we returned to shore, we learned that the family that had gone out at the same time as us on another boat had much better luck, catching marlins and other huge fish!The guys on the boat were really nice and helpful.

They also fileted our catch for us and we were able to eat it fresh at the restaurant on land. On the boat, there provide water, sodas, and beer so there is plenty of hydration.

The reef was beautiful and the buffet afterwards (an additional, and well-worth-it charge) were wonderful! These guys take photos which are available and which you should consider buying! A great group and a safe and enjoyable excursion! We will use them again! Bueno!"

            "review": "Adrenaline Warning. When me and my wife enjoyed ATV at Punta Cana, we decided to try again at Mexico since that was the best activity we did at Punta Cana. Wow... we were wrong.... We did ATV, Speed Boat, and then Jet Ski all at one day. ATV took about 45 minutes to go around jungle and beach. It was fun and good experience as we expected. Then when we tried speed boat, we forgot about ATV. With faster speed and sailing through nice Maroma beach, we felt like we were in action movie. Speed boat lasted about 30 minutes. It was so easy to control the speed boat. Then we had few snacks and drinks for free while waiting for Jet Ski (Wave Runner). I never tried and rode before, and this is the activity I will do again and again for other trips. Jet Skiing at Maroma beach is so adrenaline rush and can't even explain how awesome it was with beautiful beach next to it. It is so fast so I won't recommend anyone who doesn't like extreme sports or scare to roller coaster. Staffs at Maroma adventures were also professional and make sure our safety comes first. for overall, i recommend Maroma Adventures to anyone who want to try extreme water sports."

            "review": "Average snorkeling experience. We went snorkeling on an excursion off the coast of Maroma beach. Good snorkeling experience, but very much for beginners. If you've snorkeled before, you may be disappointed in this one.Also, the package we bought also had a buffet meal included in it. We weren't aware of that. Two unfortunate aspects of this. 1) we certainly paid for this meal, and we were staying at an all-inclusive. So, this was a waste of money in my view. 2) We had to wait for the 6:00 shuttle back to our resort, which was timed to allow time for everyone to eat at the buffet. So, again, a waste.Also, this excursion stops to do some parasailing with the boat's spinnaker sail. This was more than just a little boring, as the wind wasn't strong enough that day to get most of the people more than a few feet off of the water.So, to my way of thinking, this $100.00 per person, 5-hour excursion could have been more like $75.00, and just 3 hours."

We also didn't know we would have to wait a whole hour after our ride for the transportation back to our hotel. Overall, the guides were great and we had a fun ride."

            "review": "Definitely not worth it. My wife and I booked this tour through our hotel and we definitely regretted it. We booked camel back riding and the jet skis.Let me start by saying that these individual activities weren't horrible. It was just the overall experience.They started off by picking us up and then we had to wait in line to check-in to our various activities. There is very little instruction as to what we had to do and where we had to wait. After a few minutes, we finally figured out the line for camel back riding. It was actually pretty decent, but it was in the blistering hot Mexican summer heat. The whole thing was about 45 minutes, but we only traveled a very short distance. We spent about 15 minutes letting the camels rest. Don't expect anything too extreme from this. Finally, we had to wait for the jet skis. If you've ever done jet skiing at a beach before, they normally let you rent it and ride to your heart's desire within reason. For this one, you had to follow a line. For someone like myself, who has gone jet skiing several times before, this isn't ideal. Better if you're new or riding with children and don't want to go too fast. Being in a line, you're stuck behind the person in front of you, and if they don't go fast, you don't really go fast, which is what happened to me for a good portion of this activity. Still, it wasn't horrible. I was able to go as fast as the jet ski could take me for a few small portions.Finally, it was time to go back to the resort. This was the worst part. We had to wait over an hour for the next ride back. Additionally, I had to keep pestering them to ask them when it was arriving. They made up excuses of traffic, but if you've been doing this for a while, wouldn't you arrange it accordingly so that traffic wasn't as big of an issue?"

My husband had never been on an ATV and had a little bit of a tough time but once he got the hang of it, all good. The trail they take you on is tight, like really tight. We almost hit a couple of trees. After that we headed over to the speed boats. We thought it was one of those giant speed boats everyone piles in but no, we were wrong. Each person got their own speed boat to drive. We had a blast.After a short intermission we were going to do the Ocean Safari. We were told to be a certain spot at 2:40. At 3:15, still nothing. There were several people waiting with us. The staff said the tour left and we were all puzzled. It got straigtened out and we all headed over to the wave runners. We had no idea it was 2 hours long. We were a little concerned about sunburn. We had lotioned up but snorkeling and being on the water for that long can be a bit much. You ride the wave runner and they take you to one spot to snorkel. The first spot, not much happening. Then you climb back on and head to another area. Much better and a lot more fish to see.Leaving after the excusions was a bit choatic. They call out your hotel and you walk up like it's The Price is Right. It was just odd. I would definitely recommend visiting. They have all different excusions including dolphin swimming, horseback rides and camel rides."

We booked this excursion thinking it would be a great catamaran ride to Isla Mujeres; it was sold to us as snorkeling in a nationally protected reef; then snorkeling in an area with placed statues, unlimited drinks, lunch, sailing, spinnaker, and 3 hours in Isla Mujeres. Problems: The bus picked up us 50 minutes late.At arrival all these catamaran companies meet up at the Cancun marina and herd' about 400 people. Employees yell through megaphones telling people to get into their colored groups: black, grey, blue etc. There are people that are mad due to waiting over 1 hour for their boat... It is most unpleasant. The staff are rushed and upset. The catamaran that we got was actually a beautiful vessel, the water was amazing. But there is NO sailing, all diesel motorized. They say it is due to lack of wind. We are sailors and we think it is more about cramping 40 people on the vessel then the wind. The \"unlimited drinks\" are served only from 1 to 3- Sol (beer) powered orange juice, water and some soft drinks.VERY LITTLE FISH LIFE TO OBSERVE. The reef is actually DEAD. Employees chum the water to attract fish. You end up snorkeling with the 300 people you started from the launch area. The employees yell directions at the snorkelers to keep the groups from mixing up. We had two different groups merger with us and our crew yelled at us for not \"keeping up\" A woman on our boat began vomiting as we were getting on the boat. There are two ways to get in the boat. The crew insisted that we swim through the vomit to get on the boat. We refused and we used the other stairs to be greeted by an upset crew member that yelled at us again. The experience was SO AWFUL that we ended up bailing the excursion. We found our own way back and made the rest of our day a great experience. The money we spent for the excursion was a loss. SAVE YOUR MONEY DON\"T GO ON ANY COMPANIES THAT USE THIS SMALL MARINA IN THE PORT OF CANCUN. IF you want to go to Isla mujeres use the ferry, go snorkeling with a group in Isla Mujeres. Check to see when the last ferry back to Cancun leaves. There are two options one to Puerto Juarez which requires a taxi or bus back to the hotel areas and one ferry that drops off closer to the hotel area. Ask to see the schedule; during peak session the ferries goes back and forth until about 11 pm, but ASK. SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY DO NOT USE THESE CATAMARAN SERVICES."

If you have little ones that have never snorkeled i would recommend buying a cheap snorkel set at home and taking it too a pool and have them practice. My child had issues, so my adventure wasn't the greatest. After the two snorkel trips they had enough wind to do what they call a spinnacker (sp). Not parasailing. Similiar but the boat doesn't move.

If your looking for water activities, swimming with dolphins, horse back riding, ATVs riding camels and just enjoying the outside that Maroma has to offer its all here in 1 spot. The area is all natural very little is built up here. Snorkeling the reef is awesome, and swimming the beach is spectacular. Have no complaints and our guide Alex was awesome was there July 13. Have been several areas in Cancun this is definitely a place to go away from the hustle and bustle of the Normal touristy areas. A little expensive but very worth it."

            "review": "Great Snorkeling. We booked the snorkeling trip here on a Sunday. They take you out on a catamaran with about 20 others to two different spots. They sailed us in a big circle that took about 20 minutes to get to the first snorkel spot, which was originally probably 5 minutes away. Not sure why, maybe there's a sailing reason. We got to see some cool stuff and the water was perfect. The guide did a good job of pointing out stuff we would have missed. He found a stingray, eel, lobsters, and other cool stuff. I stayed off by myself most of the time since everyone was crowded in a group. The 2nd spot is where they take you to the actual reef. That was the best area. This is a great option if you just want to snorkel, but don't want to spend all day at Xel Ha. We got picked up at 8:45 am and were back by 2:30 to enjoy the rest of the day at the resort. Do the buffet option! Worth it."

            "review": "Scuba Maroma Dive Center is great, but not LOMAS travel!. Stayed at Eldorado Royale and booked at the hotel lobby the PADI open water diving course. Before I begin this review, let me say that my PADI open water instructor Paco and his supervisor Joel were fantastic, very friendly and totally accommodating. They made the below experience so much more pleasant. Booking for PADI open water:A word of warning, \"Lomas travel\" agent Oswaldo Weber was terrible. Make sure to pre-book your vacation or go to another agency. We booked several trips from him and had the worst experiences. Firstly, the PADI open water scuba diving course. Oswaldo instructed us that the confined dive would take place on the beach. He assured me that it wasn't in a pool environment after I had asked since I did some research before the trip. At 9am while eating breakfast at La isla, my partner and I had witnessed a group going into the pool to practice their scuba. I figured it was a different level and just ignored it. Once I showed up at the lobby at 12pm noon as he had written on the ticket, he had informed me that it was the instructors fault and he made special accommodations for me to do a make up class IN THE POOL!!!! It was incredibly frustrating coordinating time for the course as we were there for a wedding and to have know that I could have spent the afternoon with the wedding party infuriated me. He also had the audacity to blame the instructor who was there on time in the morning. Oswaldo needs to get a day planner and clearly has very limited knowledge to type of packages he is selling.Secondly, we booked a night out to cocobongo for our last evening in Cancun. Oswaldo Weber forgot to request our transportation there, which never showed up. We ended asking the concierge lady named Sophia to call to find out and Lomas travel said that there was no request submitted. When we tried to get a refund the following day, Oswaldo said \"Are you sure you were not here?\", looked at the sticky note that stated \"Transport No Show\", tore it up, and said \"It's ok I will make an exception for a refund come with me\". Clearly he was trying to cover up his own mistake. Concerning!"

My boyfriend and I had never done deep sea fishing before and the first mate Luis was amazing about explaining what he was doing and answering all of our questions. I freaked out a little and he did a great job calming me down and telling me what to do. My boyfriend did get a little sea sick and the crew was so attentive to him but still kept us fishing. When we returned we ended up with six beautiful Mahi-Mahi. They cleaned the fish after we took pictures (we even has enough to give them a fish!) the waiter met us at the dock and took our bag of fish. They cooked it up and for $20 gave us all the fixings to go with it all of which was delicious. We even brought two take home containers back to the resort, kinda wish we had a stove here to cook the rest! Didn't wait long at all for the transportation back to the resort! We were so happy we booked a snorkeling trip with them tomorrow!!"

            "review": "Lame horseback riding tour. I have been on many trips, vacations, etc. and know what value is and what is a classic tourist trap. Unfortunately, this is a tourist trap and I am kicking myself for not having read the reviews before I did this...brain snafu. We booked the afternoon horseback riding tour which promised to be 1 hour in the jungle and 1 hour on the beach. The tour started off with the guides haphazardly gathering us at the Maroma beach area (which is nice-ish) to get us on buses/vans to the entrance of the facilities to get 60 seconds of instruction on how to ride a horse and then onto our horses. We then took the horses (most of whom were more interested in eating grass than in going for a ride) down a mile plus straight line long path back towards the beach, the tour then winds through nasty construction areas on the resort (avoiding backhoes and dump trucks), it cuts through the parking lot at which point they take you to the beach for about 200 yards in a circle through the trees where they ensure they snap your picture and then back through the parking lot, the nasty construction areas and back down the straight mile long route through the jungle from where we came and back to where we started the tour. It was SUPER lame. The tour is advertised as part jungle and part beach. The jungle portion had us going in a straight line to the beach, the beach portion was maybe 3-5 minutes...just long enough to take our picture. They don't tell you about cutting through the parking lot or the lot full of old junked boats or the construction site. I don't mind spending the money but this was truly not worth the $74/person nor the time we took from our trip to do this \"adventure\". AVOID THIS AT ALL COST.I am sure the guides are good people but they did not talk to us much nor were they the slightest bit interested in providing any education about the area or adding any value to our experience. One of them spent more time on his iphone than he took to explain to us anything we were viewing (which was nothing). He also had the gall to ask us to write a good review if we liked it and no review if we did not like it. Nonetheless, they are humble people so we tipped them but still it was really not worth the time let alone the money for this tour."

Discount for children, transportation on time going there, 30 people on catamaran plus staff. Water/soda available throughout trip plus small bag of chips in between stops. Condition of equipment was ok. Amount of fish seen was not very much, but the coral and underwater vegetation was beautiful to swim through. 45 minutes of constant swimming and they kept everyone moving in a group. The \"leader\" was very careful that everyone was safe. We were able to spread out enough though that we weren't constantly bumping into each other. Distance of swimming was too much for my 10 year old and first time snorkeler but was fine for me. The end was a little weird after we were dropped off. We were at an outdoor restaurant/bar where we could change. We were not told what to do to wait for our ride back and there was no one around to ask until we finally changed clothes and had lunch. If you go, you will have fun but don't expect a lot of fish (may have been the time of year we were snorkeling?) and get clear directions for waiting for your ride. Staff was all very nice, especially the guys on the boat."

We enjoyed our Snorkeling and Caballo tour at Maroma but coming here can eat up your entire day!!!We first went to Maroma for the Caballo (Horseback riding) tour. We were told we would be riding horses on the beach. We waited for 45 minutes for the instructor to pick us up after check in. Then we learned we had to catch a bus to the front of the property to begin our tour.(Another 15-20 minutes) We rode for 45 minutes in a swampy, mosquito infested area and through construction to get to the beach. We finally rode on the white sand beach for about 5 minutes before making a u-turn and heading back the way we came. Me and my husband were ready to get off at the transportation center and leave at that point. After riding back to the front (another 45 minutes) we were told that we would have to catch a bus back to the transportation center. We were like hitchhikers trying to catch a bus and were turned down a few times before someone agreed to take us back. Then we were asked to wait on our bus yet again before finally getting to leave the property.The instructor, Nina was helpful but I would never do this tour again or recommend it to anyone.The snorkeling however was great! This was our second time to Maroma and we expected the 40 minute wait after check in. We were given the opportunity to snorkel in two areas and the crew was very helpful. The reef was amazing! Upon leaving the boat we were told that we would need to wait an hour for the next transportation back to our resort. Since we had been there before we understood that transportation picks up every hour and they fill buses at 45 after the hour. Since it was 40 minutes after the hour we went straight to transportation and were able to go home right away instead of having to wait. Warning to all--They want you to buy their food, souvenirs and photos so they try to make you wait for hours on their property. This is their downfall in my opinion. I would give transportation 1 star if I could."

The journey from the hotel zone was roughly 50mins. The transportation came on time and driver was very lovely .ATV was my favourite part , at no point did we feel unsafe , the workers made sure we knew how to use the ATV and we're always driving near in case anyone needed help. The ride on the ATV lasted around 35 mins and was great , driving through dirt tracks and jungle was thrilling. Speedboat was great too, the water was a bit choppy , so at times I got a bit anxious of the boat tipping over . Once again the workers made sure all life jackets were secure and everyone , understood how to work the boats . They was great care and safety from the workers to ensure we had a great time on both the ATV and speedboat .Overall I really enjoyed the two excursion. The area is very beautiful , nice white sandy beaches and beautiful scenery . I would defiantly recommend maroma adventures for an excursion ."

So here goes-We booked our Fishing Excursion with our Lomas Rep. and was lead to believe that water,soda and beer was all included along with lunch and if we are lucky and have a catch they would cook it up at no extra charge for us on site, following our 4 hr fishing adventure. We booked our excursion and left the resort early the next morning We arrived at Maroma and were then told we have to pay additional for transportation-$5 per person -we had 8 in our group(First red flag). We had a one hour wait before boats are even available and of course if you want beer,water or soda -no problem that will be $3. Was told the all inclusive drinks were for boat only.(Second red flag) Was greeted by Maroma spokesman with other guest and told about our day and once again told no more extra cost -enjoy have a great day of sun and fishing.. The Beach is probably the nicest beach in the region very nice location-boat was very nice and our Captain and crew were WONDERFUL. We were one of 8 boats that fished that day and unfortunately catching fish was a issue that day- as we were the only boat with a fish at the end of the morning, And Boy was it a fish -a 9ft Sailfish that was a catch of a lifetime. We chose to buy the fish and paid the deposit which is half before you can dock($1400) we then proceeded to the lunch area to buy drinks cause we were the happy fisherman of the group! Once back at Maroma for lunch we were given chips and salsa ordered beers -and was told we would be charged for Lunch $15 per person!(Third Red Flag & Unacceptable) At this point we had HADDIT! The Maroma staff was told of what we were told about lunch but showed no interest in making this right. in fact I spoke with the El Jefe in charge and he seemed even less interested in making this situation right. He said sorry & told us we would have to wait another hr for transportation back! So after $600 for the Boat & $2800 for the fish we just purchased, $200 in Tips for the crew, along with $45 in transport fees -added to the $50 we spent on celebration beers-& they were still sticking it to us. The other fishermen that were there were just as upset about this behavior as they too had been told lunch was included. So shame on Lomas for being dishonest with the sale of this excursion and double shame on Maroma for ruining a wonderful father& sons experience. It truly is a shame because the area and beach is beautiful The Boating is wonderful and the crew was great-We Tipped Large-but the Maroma Gig and Dance is just not worth your consideration or hassle -as you have plenty of Fishing and other excursions groups to choose from while visiting Playa. So when purchasing this excursion -please get all the details in writing and Buyer BEWARE!"

            "review": "deep sea fishing. This was the worst way to spend 130 USD per person ever in my life! My Groom and I have been deep sea fishing and bay fishing numerous times and have never had an experience like this before. The trip consisted of us getting on a boat with another couple, sat there as we drove around on the boat as we thought we were trying to get to a place to drop anchor. Apparently we were top water fishing and we literally sat there until they got a fish on the line then we were called over to real it in. To me this is not fishing and where I come from you don't reel in another man's catch. Not once in the 4 hour trip did my hands even touch a fishing rod. All 4 of us took naps on the boat while we watched the boat guides fish for 4 hours. As I went to my travel agent (Oswaldo) to inform him of my lack of satisfaction he stated that it was how they showed they were \"taking care of us\". I stated that I would pay for my grooms fee since he was at least able to reel in one barracuda but that I wanted to have my ticket refunded. He said that fishing is not guaranteed on an excursion like this. In response I told him that fishing is guaranteed but catching a fish is not and every fisherman understands that and that that was not what I was upset about. He stated this was not possible and that I would need to write a letter. Needless to say I was not going to waste anymore of my honeymoon time writing a letter on an occurrence that had already wasted a big part of my day. This excursion is perfect for a couple that has never fished before and want to get that experience but if you actually enjoy the fishing part that precedes the catching of a fish DO NOT GO!"

They kept informing us that the food comes after.Once we got back to land, they brought us to the restaurant where we were offered free chips and salsa. That was it. If we wanted to eat from their plentiful buffet we had to pay $15 USD a plate. If we wanted another drink we had to pay for those, as well. On top of this, we got back at 4:00pm but Lomas didn't have our bus picking us up until 6:15pm, so they were trying to make us stay for two hours so we would have no choice but to pay to eat. I will never use Lomas Travel again, nor will I return to Maroma. The entire situation felt like a set up scam and was extremely aggravating.Buyer beware!!!!

A member of our group timed the activity for us. Wouldn't be such a big deal if it weren't for how expensive it is at $150 per half hour per person. When we questioned the organizer she apologized and we were told we'd receive a partial refund for the unused time. That was the amicable agreement we had all accepted and were considerably happy with. Once we arrived back to the main staging area we were given the run around from being offered photos as compensation to being directed to multiple people who'd further pass us along to someone else. Needless to say, never received a partial refund or photos.Experience of the jet pack was great. Just wish it wasn't soured by being treated poorly. Would not recommend purely on the basis of the mismanagement and the feeling of being deceived. Be aware there's a ton of other companies offering similar activities in the area who might not only be better priced but also not as likely to steal your money."

After about a 45 minute drive, I arrived about 30 minutes prior to check in, which allowed me to stop by the cash bar and hydrate myself. After check in, they rounded up the camel safari group and we went to go meet our camels. There were plenty of time allowed for pictures. What I loved most about this tour was that the guides were using OUR own cameras to take the pictures. I assumed they would have a professional photographer on site (which they did) and charge you $100 USD for the pics like most tour companies, but nope. Not them. They just ask for a tip at the end and fill out a comment card, which I was happy to do.After the ride, you got to go to the restaurant for chips & salsa/refried beans snack, which was nice since I had about 40 minutes to kill anyway before the bus left back for Cancun.If you want a different type of excursion, choose this one!"

Whilst I realised when booking that we wouldn't be going far in a 4 hour trip, I expected to go more than 1/4-1/2 mile off the coast for what was labelled 'deep sea fishing'. This obviously meant that any of the big game was probably not going to materialise. Sure enough this is what happened. Whilst I am fully aware that fishing is a hit and miss affair in respect of catching anything, I would have liked the opportunity to actually had a go. What transpired was three hours watching two of the crew fishing with no involvement from the paying guests except for the three false alarms we had. Furthermore, there should have been a system to dictate who received the rod when a 'bite' occurred. What actually happened was one person (who happened to be the pretty young female) 'lucked in' and had the opportunity to try and reel in all three bites. A simple numbering system where everyone knows which order they get a chance would be easy to organise and provide a fairer result. Also if I am to pay all this money to not catch anything, I would prefer to be the one not doing the catching! I can watch fishing on the TV and pay nothing for it. Having said all the the crew were very friendly and worked hard albeit to no avail. There were 4 other boats out at the same time and all failed to catch anything worth talking about."

Speed boats are mad, you follow the instructor round at speed, getting smashed as you hit the waves, 45 minutes of white knuckle ride. The ATV's are driven round on roads, then round a lagoon with crocs, and finally in the jungle for about 45 minutes, great fun, although wear closed in shoes to enable you to change gears with your feet, otherwise you get bruised toes. Photos are taken, which you can buy later. You may feel that you have to leave the beach soon after your adventure, not so, as buses run every hour, and you can leave when you want, within their closing times. Therefore you can then take advantage of the beach and sea. They have showers, toilets and snack bar, so we'll catered for. Excellent and friendly staff, can't recommend enough. "

As I was about to call them they appeared. Once we were on the road I quickly forgot about him being late. We were in a van with a bunch of others who were doing various other excursions at Maroma Beach. Once we arrived they asked us what excursion(s) we signed up for and the group was split up. I went to check in for the Camel Safari, and yet again I was forced to wait unattended to for 5 - 10 minutes. It wasn't until my friend walked back up to the front desk to ask for assistance did we receive any help.Once we were checked in we walked across the beach to the camels. Riding the camels was a lot of fun and the guides were amazing. We were riding camels for about 30 - 45 minutes and there was a photographer following the group around to get pictures. I would actually give this activity 4.5 stars if this was based solely on riding the camels, but the cons brought my review down to 3 stars. Once you're done with the camels you're brought back to the starting position and the guides encourage you to write about your experience in their guestbook, which just so happens to be next to the tips container (go figure). Once everybody has written in the book you're brought to the restaurant and forced to wait until the next pick up to get back to your hotel. This was the biggest problem for me. The excursion was scheduled for 9 AM and was supposed to last for 1 hour, but we were forced to wait around on the beach, in the restaurant or at the exit for 2 additional hours to be shuttled back to our hotel. This usually wouldn't be a problem, but we had another activity scheduled at 12 PM that day, so we had to get back to our hotel. We ended up having to pay $20 for a taxi so we could get back to our hotel. I had made my peace with them being late to pick me up... and forgetting to check me in once I arrived, but forcing me to stick around for 3 hours when I was explicitly told it would only be a hour was the last straw. I'm not sure if I'd give this place my business again, but if I do I'll make sure I don't have anything else planned for the rest of the day."

The Catamaran only served water or soda so eat a big breakfast. Lunch can be bought, but the buffet isnt anything great. We only ate it bc we were starving. Snorkeling and catamaran ride were cool, but wait and food were not great."

Daniel our snorkeling guide provided the highest level of customer service and made special arrangements for us to get back to our hotel for dinner resevations. The snokeling was awesome, clear water, colorful fish. The equipment was clean and fit perfectly. Oscar, the photographer was delightful and we enjoyed talking with him, We we inadvertently left our shoe on the boat, every effort was made to retieve them. I highly recommend this spot. Lots of sports there - parasailing, fishing, swimming with dolphins - very well run facility."

            "review": "Great trip and crew - good eats as well!. My family and I went on a private fishing trip (we were a total of 6). First the good. The Captain and crew were all very nice/friendly and really worked hard to try and hook us some fish. We got very lucky and landed 5 Barracudas and 1 Jack Crevalle. The first mate fileted one half of the (probably 45 pound) Jack and we were able to take that back to the resort when we docked and the chef cooked it up for us to have as fish tacos. The fish was delish. I don't know what spices were on that but it was great. And it was free, the only thing way paid for was to get guacamole. Note: they say people don't eat Barracuda but we met a couple who have had it and said it was good, so choose for yourself.The \"eh\". On our trip we got the Barracudas first and then snabbed the Jack. My dad tipped the captain and crew on our way back to shore. At first the crew said the Jack was only so-so flavor to eat. One crew member approached my uncle and asked if he was going to trip and indicated that my dads tip was a little low. This is quite rude in my opinion. My uncle did tip a little more, however. At this point the crew was then insisting that we take the Jack to get cooked up and it was great to eat. We did and it was in fact really good. Seems a little shady to change their tune that way. Certain amounts are expected to be tipped I guess. It was the only thing that rubbed me the wrong way.All in all, I recommend their deep sea fishing, it was a great time. Note: They say that beer is included in the price but just be aware that they only supply 1 liter of beer per person and the beer at the resort that you can purchase is $3 per can. I recommend buying some beer off the resort and bringing it with you onto the boat if you think you'll want more."

I am so happy and it was the BEST decision we made for our entire group ( 30 ppl) we paid for 2 hours of alcohol and some snacks. Pepe and the rest of the crew were amazing!! They were extremely courteous and pleasant offering the BEST attention to our entire group, everyone in my group kept raving about how great that trip was. We spent about 3 1/2 hours on the sea, which included 2 stops for snorkel. The snorkel experience by the Riviera Maya reefs was absolutely cool and amazing, they also had a parasail connected to the catamaran and allowed all my guests to hop on and \"fly\" it was amazing and would recommend them any day, I think the catamaran we use was Tahuma (name of the catamaran I think) or the one that Pepe and the rest of the crew are in charge. The catamaran experience will be to remember with a smile and want to go back!"

A late review*** We booked for scuba diving.. started our class before heading out since we are not certified, about half way through they added people to the class making the teacher restart. That being done we headed out very late around 4-4:30 which made it very dark in the ocean. We did in fact talk to a BD rep and arranged for us to go again (paid the second time out too), we did .. the ocean was VERY rocky and they sent us out anyways. This time we were a big group and i dont know what happened but we ended up about 9 people with 1 guide and since the water was rocky we went in a more shallow part were i can honestly say I saw one tiny (2inch) fish ... again very disapointing, also very hard to swim due to the bad weather(I am very aware they cannot control the amount of fish in the ocean). We talked to Joe about it once more and arranged for us to go again ... unfortunately it got cancelled due to the weather (They didn't call to let us know, judging by what I was seeing I had the BD rep call and it was in fact cancelled). They sent us out fourwheeling instead, when we got there we had to wait about 30 mins because they couldn't find us in the system. They offered it to us complimemtary and they look all lost. Other then that the four wheeler was pretty awsome. On a better note, the staff was increadebly helpful! I sadly only remember them saying if you had a bad experience my name is Joe so i don't remember their name but very very caring staff!."

            "review": "Deeping Sea Fishing - Definitely a \"fish tale\"!. Just returned from an all-inclusive resort in Mexico after a great week with great friends. We decided to participate in one off-site excursion and opted for the deep sea fishing at Maroma. Since there were four of us, we choose the private charter. It was a bit more expensive but thought it would be worth it. The crew and captain were very pleasant and friendly. They spent the first hour (of a four-hour tour) setting up and organizing all of the fishing gear. For the next two hours, we watched them watch the lines that were out in the ocean. Periodically, there would be some action which always turned out to be seaweed on the lines. At one point there seemed to be a significant amount of commotion and then, mysteriously, there was a \"big fish/a trophy fish\", on the line. One of the members of our group was handed the fishing rod and began reeling in the fish. At this point, the sales pitch began. The friendly and somewhat talkative crew, suddenly had more energy than ever and began \"selling\" the mounting/taxidermy of the fish. This continued for over a half-hour while the fish was being reeled in. The crew was virtually in the face of the person reeling in the fish - shouting and trying to make a sale. Once the fish was at the boat and we declined the mounting, we asked if we could take some photos with the fish. They said we could photograph the fish in the water but could not reel it all the way in. We then handed off the fish to another boat that had not caught anything and supposedly had two seasick children. We never caught another fish but, in hindsight, do not think they even tried. Once we got back to shore, we realized that the whole excursion may have been a bit of a scam. We were told we were the only boat that caught anything (that was a lie). The two seasick children never existed. I now believe the fish that we handed off was actually handed off to us earlier in the excursion (probably at the time when there seemed to be a lot of commotion). The food and snacks that was included was water, beer and a snack size bag a potato chips. Definitely not worth the money we spent!"

My two teenage children were with me as well. This event was follow the leader as well. The wind speed was high so the surf was very strong. They took us out into 6 foot and higher breakers and my daughter and I both wiped out. I found it very difficult to get back on the wave runner in the high surf. I know another mother and daughter in our group also wiped out in this high surf. My son had experience on a wave runner so he ended up being fine. The trip before I remember going out with my son in a speed boat in high waves as well and it seemed dangerous. I think overall this place does an ok job. Be very wary of their water activities when the water is rough as they will let you take risks that would not happen normally in the US."

I went on a snorkeling tour whilst on holiday and right from the start I knew this would be a trip I could forget.We were picked up half an hour late and when we arrived, stood around for another 25 minutes. I have been snorkling quite a few times and I was glad i had my own equipment. Theirs was primative and not a good standard.The advertise this trip as swimming in the corals with fish a plenty. All i saw was destroyed reefs that have obviously been hammered by tourists for years. I am aware of the hurricane some years ago, but the damage done here is from tourists standing on the reefs and swimming into the coral for years on end. I have been to the reefs off Belize many times and that really is fish paradise. People in the group were excited to see a few lobsters. It was devoid of any wildlife.They didn't keep an eye on swimmers properly and some of us in the water last actually lost the group. We decided to stick together and headed back to the boat than try and locate the group amongst other swimmers from tours. Safety was not obviously a priority. I will never recommend this place for that reason.We were dropped off nearly 90mins before the bus left for lunch and i felt half a day should be half a day, not 2 hours of which only 45mins was spent swimming.A lunch was stated on the activities and this ended up being some nachos and watery guacamole. Ten dollars was requested for the most horrible looking mac cheese and salad buffet. No one ate this.We were hassled for tips by every member of staff. The guides actually said they do not get a wage for doing the trips and relied on tips. What an outlandish lie. The photos taken by staff in the water were out of focus and not professional in any way but they wanted 20 dollars for a picture.Horrible day out if you are used to seeing nice reefs with wild life and you hate being hassled for tips. Once again, those reefs are a disgrace. Whatever the 2 dollar fee for reef conservation per person goes towards is a mystery."

Part 1 : Organizational Disaster We were mislead by tour representatives (at our resort and once arriving at Maroma) which was a very frustrating start to our tour. First we were told it was a \"short 15 minute bus ride\" from our resort. We were traveling with our 83 year old grandmother AND we had some family members caring for 3 infants back at the hotel - so we wanted everything to be easily accessible and efficient - this was not the case. We arrived after an almost hour long drive to be told that our boat wouldn't be ready until 12:15 (an hour later). We told them this was unacceptable. We were given the run-around by a number of staff and then told our boat would be arriving to pick us up at 1:30 (and wouldn't we like to buy lunch here? what a scam!). As soon as we asked for transportation to be arranged back to the hotel there was miraculously a boat available to us to leave immediately. Part 2: AMAZING Sail, Snorkel, Spinnaker We had 2 snorkels - the first was very long - 50 minutes - so novice snorkels be warned! The second was 15 minutes. The reef was beautiful - lots of variety in both fish and coral. We saw a lobster, an eel, and some squid. We then had the opportunity to ride on the Spinnaker. This is basically a special sail with a rope swing attached. You should be a strong swimmer if you use it but everyone had lots of fun on it and those who didn't participate enjoyed watching. SO - overall it was an excellent trip once we go going..."

We were picked up at our allotted time, from our resort and taken for a short drive to Maroma. Once there, the check-in for the snorkeling was fast and efficient. Within 15 minutes we were escorted to the catamaran and set sail. The staff was very attentive to our level of expertise while snorkeling. The first reef we stopped at was a shallow one and the coral was OK but there were no fish. The second stop at a deeper reef was great. We saw some great types of coral and LOTS of different fish. On our way back they put out a spinnaker at the back of the boat and people could sort of parasail behind the boat. That was great. If you can, it's worth the short swim. Upon our return we had a snack (included with the basic package) and shortly after returned to our resort. The day was well organized and I only wish we had more time to take advantage of other activities.....there's always next time."

The boat was not really situated to fit the amount of people that were on it. We went down about three miles, the reef was quite far from the boat, so we were to swim to the reef, explore and then swim back. There were many inexperienced people on the tour. The guide was trying to hurry all into the water, the rough surf made it difficult and 1/2 the people returned to the catamaran without snorkeling. There were no refreshments offered but water, and soda when asked for. The second stop was better but most of the people did not venture into the water because of the first experience. We then went three miles back toward the dock. The ride was boring same scenery. The only saving grace was the fabulous dinner we had at Maroma. We had lobster and steak, the service was great, the drinks were lovely and the food delicious. We should have tried the Dolphin swim, since we had never done that."

We booked the catamaran because our friends were swimming with the Dolphins and could do the catamaran after. There are no alcoholic drinks on the catamaran so if you are looking for a booze cruise, this is not for you. Overall, the snorkeling was nice but we could have done that at our resort for free. When we returned from the catamaran, they wouldn't let us leave early, we had to wait for about an hour for a ride back to our resort (which we found out after booking that it was an hour away). So....two more hours until we could get back to our resort. Needless to say, we weren't very happy. Then before they would allow us to get into our shuttle back to the resort, they had a group of people arriving that were \"welcomed\" by a Mariachi band and the rest of us travelers ready to leave Maroma Adventures. I don't know if this was to make them feel special, but at this point we were just ready to leave. All in all, it was an experience, however, I don't think we would recommend it or would be going back. However, please know our ideal vacation is sitting in the pool or on the beach not doing much so we were disappointed to lose a whole day (when we were told 5 hours tops) from our resort."

My husband brought his own fishing pole and they let him fish off the back of the catamaran, while we were in route and while the others finished snorkeling at our first stop and while we where at our second stop. He caught 3 fish and let the one of the crew members take them home to eat. It was a beautiful day to be on the ocean and it was a BLAST!! After the Catamaran we headed back to the beach for lunch, we ordered the Surf N Turf, we hightly reccommend this to you, it was steak (very tender and juicy and large) with a large lobster tail, plus salad, bread, soup and desert!! I was delicious and because we were celebrating our 10 year anniversary, they set us up in a more private hut right on the beach, but in the shade! It was beautiful!!!

On the first day we did the catamaran ride out to the reef and snorkeled for 45 minutes, the other catamaran had black smoke pouring out of the engine. There were tons of fish, coral, turtles, ells, stingrays, etc. Then the boat continued for along the reef while we ate a bag of chips and had some water. The snorkeling then continued for another 45 min and we headed back to the dock. There we had some chips with black beans and salsa, everything we were promised and just what we expected. I did make sure to get reef safe sunblock before we left, it was hard to find, but I noticed we were one of the only people using it, I am not sure if it's a requirement here.Next we had an appointment to swim with the dolphins in three hours, there was not much else to do here besides drink at a cash bar or walk the beach and my wife and I don't drink so we walked the amazing beach. When we returned I spoke the to check in for the dolphins, they were able to move up our check in time to an earlier group. I was worried about the treatment of the dolphins, but it was amazing, they were in great health and the trainers took great care of them. We went into the pool with the trainers, and they instructed everyone on how to do the hand signals for each trick. They teach some facts about the dolphins while each person does a trick with the dolphins. After you are offered some very good but outrageously priced pictures. With the pricing they had it was about 10% cheaper to buy them in US dollars than Pesos, so bring both. Then we waited around for a van to go back to our hotel, the van driver was great too, working with my wife and I on our Spanish. The next day we returned to ride the camels. This was a lot of fun, you ride them for about 20 minutes, then sit on the beach with them, feed them some carrots and take some pictures. Then you are able to ride back, they move slow, so you maybe only go a half mile, but it was still very fun and worth the small charge."

We did not like the fact that we were picked up at our hotel an hour before are scheduled tour and afterwards we had to wait almost 1 1/2 hrs. (I'm wondering if maybe we had asked someone at the pickup area if we could get a ride back sooner they may have been able to accommodate us but we didn't think to do that. We were on vacation so it was ok) to get our ride back to the hotel...They did give us some chips and salsa to share after the ride to help pass the time. My husband ordered a cup of coffee asked for a refill and it ended up costing him 6$ or 8$ don't remember the exact amount. Again this was our fault as being from the US we are use to getting refills on coffee, there it may not be the norm. Now for the reason of the excellent rating. We had purchased the photo disk of our tour and upon returning home the photos were gone...I contacted Maroma and Martha at Cancun best discounts, between Ventas Maroma and Martha our photos were sent by email within days of me notifying them of what happened. They saw we did purchase the disk of photos. We all know something like this may happen with one in maybe thousands, I was the one. They took care of it and that to me is what customer service is all about. I will use them again in the future and will recommend them to family and friends. We have a photos and memories.

The beach and waiting area is beautiful at Maroma. Once we had our mini review we set on our way to our private boat. It was quite windy that day but the water didn't seem very rough so we headed out anyway. About twenty minutes in, the ocean became very rough. While we were in a very secure vessel I wasn't afraid of anything happening to us - but I did get very sick. Hoping that the waters would calm down we kept going so the others in our party could keep fishing. About two hours into our fishing trip we agreed to turn around and head in early. The crew members of the boat were great trying to make me as comfortable as I could while feeling sea sick. A medic met me at the boardwalk and took me by wheelchair to an examination room. The crew members were the only ones with the means of calling for a medic - how caring! After I was checked out and good to go we asked for our shuttle to be called to inquire if they could come get us early. They did! Everyone at registration and reception were concerned when we came in early and wanted to make sure we were fine, didn't feel threatened in any way and had a good trip. Other than getting sick we had a great trip! We even got to throw our remaining bait out for pelicans to catch and eat. It was a great day overall."

            "review": "EXPENSIVE but amazing catamaran snorkeling adventure and dolphin experience. Really, it's hard to beat an attraction that has a dolphin - a real, living, entertaining and personality-rich dolphin - pushing you around a giant pool. Our kids (11 and 13) were amazed to be able to touch Amal, the matriarch of the dolphins. They really are amazing creatures. The trick was that nearly every action is set up as a photo opportunity, which they then charge a HUGE amount for (more than the adventure itself), so be prepared to spend a lot more if you want to take the pictures home.The catamaran snorkeling was a highlight of our trip to Mexico as well - the whole extended family was there so there were enough of us to get a private boat. We spent a beautiful half day on the boat enjoying the sun and the turquoise water. We made two stops for snorkeling, and the guides did a good job with both experienced snorkelers and the younger, less experienced swimmers in the group. We did need to keep an eye on the kids though - the guide led the group out to the reef, and stragglers fell behind. I followed to make sure everyone was accounted for, and escorted my 11 year old back to the boat when she got tired, but was able to catch up with the group and continue. We stayed on the shallow side of the reef (which is the second largest coral reef in the world) and saw lots of schools of beautiful fish and colorful coral. It was really beautiful. The catamaran had a spinnaker as well, but the wind wasn't blowing enough for even our lightest teenager to sail very high. Several of the other boats were able to launch them at the time so I'm not sure what the difference was ... but it was a beautiful day even without it."

Maroma beach is just North of Playa Del Carmen so it was a 30 min. drive. On arrival, we waited another 25 minutes with a nice crowd of folks looking to fish until the crew, captains showed, and then we were 'paired' with a boat to ensure a six person maximum. The facility and personnel were fairly organised. The beach / marina were basically right at the center and were beautiful. We lucked out because there were only 5 on our boat which was your average fishing boat, but clean. All of the boats are essentially the same. I recommend taking a sea sickness pill in case it gets rough (you never know). One of the great benefits of the RM coast is that you dont have to go far to be in game water (maybe 1.5 KM). However, we did have to endure the deckhand selling us on taxidermy services. Its part of the experience in the RM. Folks work hard to make extra money/tips. The water was blue, clear and mesmerizing. I think I would've paid for the ride along the coast seeing that beautiful water. The mates set and dropped five lines with different rigs. When the fish is 'on', you essentially take turns on the chair and are handed the rod. I 'caught' 2 Spanish mackerel and my dad caught a bonito. Another passenger caught a large barracuda (4 1/2 ft long). The crew really care about you catching fish. They try, but the ocean (and conditions) dictate your outcomes. If the swells are strong, you may have to fight for balance, but you forget about that when you're in a heat of a battle. The boat did have soft drinks and beer. Caution against drinking beer as it will just dry you out and get you sick. Ginger ale or water is best. Back at the docks, we did see one boat that landed a 6 ft marlin. However, the best part was yet to come which was eating the fresh mackerel and bonito that we caught. The crew and restaurant were highly organised. They were waiting for us when the boat docked. They cook the fish for free and soft drinks are included. Best fish tacos that ive ever had, by far. Pablo (our waiter) was under the weather, but still excellent. Best $14 US (for sides) that ive ever spent. The view, the food, the weather, wow. They rearranged our transport back to the hotel (because of the optional restaurant lunch), but again were organised. The trip back was a little longer because of a hotel stop, but ok. All tolll, the morning trip was 6:45am to about 2:30pm door to door. We had a great time fishing and would not mind this place again"

We tried snorkeling on our first tip at Isla mujeres which we really enjoyed so we're keen to go away! We were really excited to try this tour as the snorkeling looked incredible! It most defiantly lived up to expectations and we had the best day of our entire stay! Transfers from the hotel were perfect and everything was well organized! We were very lucky that we only had 20 people on our trip as the guide said it was normally as many as 50! I'm glad it was less as I don't see how the boat would have taken us all! Our guide May was an absolute legend! He was so funny welcoming and above all when it mattered he was there to help! We went to 2 different locations where the boat stopped and you had to swim to where the reefs were! This was fun and we really enjoyed it!! My husband unfortunately had a panic attack on the first stop in the water, the group had moved forward and I looked back to seen him really struggling! I waved over the guide who swam back and assisted him! He calmed him down in the water and then took him to the reef using a float! This allowed my husband to regain his composure and feel more comfortable! After this he was able to swim on unaided and enjoy the reef! We swam back to the boat with group ready to head off to the second reef! If May hadn't of done this I'm in no doubt my husband would have refused to go back in the water and enjoy the rest of our trip! But he did and we both had a fantastic time! At the second reef the other guide (sorry I forgot his name) came out with us! My husband said that every time he surfaced from the water the guide was looking out for him and checking he was ok! Small things but that went along way! We didn't stay for the meal options afterwards so can't comment on that aspect but I would recommend the snorkeling 100% Massive thank you to May and his team!"

Our guides and everyone on the boat were incredibly nice as well.We had signed up for a Surf & Turf lunch afterward and had one of the best dinning experiences of our entire vacation. Victor is one of those people that you can talk with for just a few minutes and feel like you know his entire life story. He was incredibly friendly, funny, and attentive the entire meal.

It was truly a memorable experience and we both enjoyed it very much. The only problem was that you were not allowed to take any pictures. They had their own photographer taking photos and after it was over, they greatly overcharged for the pictures. One picture cost $40 US. The set of pictures of one person cost $85 US. For the 2 of us they wanted $170. When I told them it was too much, they lowered the price to $150. Even that was a huge ripoff."

            "review": "AMAZING DAY FULL OF ACTIVITIES!. My boyfriend and I booked through our sunning rep & Lomas Travel at our hotel for a day of fun.We booked the ATV and speedboat adventure, paid extra for 30 minutes on the seed's, as well as paid extra for the Jetpack Fly boarding. Overall with all 4 activities for the day 8-5 for two people we paid around $650 Canadian Dollars. Yes, it was expensive, but it was my boyfriends birthday so we thought we would splurge for the day and have a day filled with fun... which was what we did :) First off, when arriving it was a bit hectic just because there were SOOOOOO many people. There are also so many different things to do there like camel rides, ATV, seeds, etc... But once we knew where to go, all was good. There are actually signs (that we didn't see).. that tell you where to check in. So its really not bad if you stand in the right line and check in. ATVs:We started off ATVing.. which was so fun. The ATVs are standard but you can ask them to put it into automatic.. Everyone wore shoes.. we wore flip flops and were okay. The trail was amazing we went into the forest, along a swamp, on the beach, etc. The ATVs went fast and no one had any issues. The only thing is that there is a guide in the front and back of the line.. so if you really want to go fast and have fun try to get a spot in the very front behind the guide or the very back so you can wait, than let it RIPPPPPP! We stayed at the back and had such a good time, we just waited a few minutes till we dint see anyone and maxed out our ATVs than when we caught up to the group we did that again.. its not like the group had a slow pace, we just really wanted to try to go fast! The guide/ mechanic on this trip were both very friendly, and super nice! Also there is a safe place you can leave your bag, towels, etc that the guide locks up! :) After this excursion if you have another, bring al your stuff with you because the next place will have a spot where you can lock up all your belongings. We probabaly ATVed for around 40-45 minutes! SPEEDBOATS:This was probably my most favourite activity. At first you have to walk through about 2 metres of seaweed to get to your boat but once you are in the boat, you are ready to go. There is one speed you use.. and its fast... the other is neutral.. The guides tell you that you always stay in fast, even around corners and the boats will NOT flip. Its kind of cool, you stay in a line but with a lot of distance between you. It sounds kind of lame but it was nice because, with the person ahead so far away you can make sharp turns or zigzags you just have to follow their general direction. The guides for this trip were also amazing!! My boat actually broke down in the first 15 minutes so they just switched me boats and I was good to go! The speedboats was probably my most favourite part of the day along with the flyboards. You catch air, and go so fast! Sometimes if you land on a wave the water will jump and mist you a little bit, no big deal though. Overall, soon glad we did the speedboats!SEADOOS:After ATVs and speedboats we went on the jetski's. This was my boyfriends favourite activity. Again, you have to follow a general direction and line but you are far apart so you can go as slow and fast as you want. They say don't pass anyone, but we passed this couple that was going super slow and an older lady. On the seed's you catch so many waves, its such a rush.. But you can also opt to go slower if you wish. There is no pressure to go fast or slow, which is nice. A few people were actually going so fast that they fell off their seadoo, which is normal! Its just all about having a good time. Again, theres a spot to safety leave belongings. While seadooing there is no individual free time, a few guys on our tour said they would pay extra if they could have free time. So i think they did that. For us it was $55 US per person for 30 minutes on the Seadoo. The guide for this one was kind of a dick.. like he was a bit rude.... we still tipped him, but we just got a vibe that was not friendly.JETPACK:Jetpack was amazing.. it was pricey ... $350 canadian (paid on the credit card) for 2 people for 22 minutes each. WORHT IT though! The guides were AMAZING, the experience was AMAZING! It was an awesome time. We did the fly board which was like a little skateboard and it wasn't hard.There is also the option to do the jetpack which is literally a jetpack that you wear. What we found really cool was that the helmet you wore had a speaker in it so that they could tell you what to do, how to help, etc.. LOVED IT!!!!!!!!FOOD:Because we paid for I think more than 2 excursions lunch is included.. there is a little buffet restaurant.... i think there is a hotel attached to this place.. you can go here to eat and drink.. All food, soft drinks and beer are included. You can wear your swimsuit and don't have to wear real clothes in. You can sit inside or outside, or even take your food to the beach! Food was OKAY, not too much selection but not bad, service was great though!BEACH:The sand was white, but the water had ALOT of seaweed in it. As you went like 2 metres out there was no seaweed.. but just getting out there you had to walk over a ton of seaweed! TIPPING:Also for tipping, you don't tip the place as a whole, you tip each guide after each activity. They have a little box or hat that you can put tips in for them after your excursion. And at each excursion place there is a spot for you to leave all your belongings where they are locked up! So you can bring your tip money with you to each place... along with all your belongings... TRANSPORTATION:Another thing is that transportation to and from the hotel were included in the price also... we stayed in cancun so it was about a 45 minute drive each way for us to get here. Also..... forgot to mention about the ATV, speedboats, & seadoo's- you can either do them alone or with someone else. We did each one on our own.. It was more fun! OTHER:There is also a little store you can buy souvenirs from, and drugstore items.Throughout the day there are photographers taking your pictures where you can purchase at the front desk! There are nice bathrooms, also a restaurant to eat at.There is also a cash bar where you can purchase drinks.Overall, it was a great birthday and an amazing day! Would definitely recommend doing the ATV, seedboats, seadoo's and flyboarding... it was such an amazing, fun and adventurous day.

We were on land for 2 hours and saw no one go to the lounge chairs, so I don't know if people reserved the chairs and then left for their tours, or what. There was also nowhere to sit at any of the outside tables. The only outdoor seating was on the swings around the bar (where the weak drinks are $6 each if you have to use the cash bar).When it came time to leave, there were a couple hundred of us and we were told to get in a line up depending on where we were going. And then we stood there sweating for over half an hour, until they began loading us on various buses.

When you are not on an activity, you can hang out on the beach or visit the restaurant/bar.The dolphin encounter was amazing! They have a huge pool and very well-trained dolphins. It looks like they take good care of them. The \"Royal\" package was worth it - got to be carried on dolphin fins and lifted into the air by a \"foot push\" from 2 dolphins. They take excellent pictures of your experience (not allowed to take your own), but they are very expensive.The camel ride was an interesting experience. The camels were very nice and well-trained, and it was a more unique thing to try.Snorkeling was pretty good. They take you to 2 spots within 30 minute boat ride. The water is clear, and there is a decent variety of coral and fish.

My 13 year-old daughter and I booked the catamaran ride with snorkeling along the reef, a half-day excursion that was supposed to last from 1-4 PM. The pick up from the hotel was very late; we had already gone to the agent in the hotel because we had not been picked up when the bus came a half hour late to pick us up. We were told the boat would sail to a point so we could be on the water and look around a bit and that there would be two snorkeling stops along the reef with a guide. The sail never went up. Two other catamarans were out on the same day, and they had their sails up, and the weather was lovely, so I don't know why we didn't sail. We were not given an explanation as well. The crew, while very friendly and helpful, played loud rock music the entire time--not exactly my choice for a boat outing on pristine water.The reef area is lovely and interesting for snorkeling. However, the guide really did nothing other than swim with us. It would have been very nice for the guide to point things out and explain things to us along the way. The water was crystal clear; there were signs of pollution damage to the reef that would probably not be evident to people who don't know the difference, but I understand that conservation is now being taken more seriously in this area. We returned back to the dock and were ready to head back to our hotel by 4:30 PM. However, we were then taken to a large dining area and told to help ourselves to the buffet. It was an awkward time to eat; too late for lunch and too early for dinner. We were told our bus wouldn't be picking us up for another hour, so we had to sit and wait in the dining area and later in the outdoor bar area for over an hour. We didn't get back to our hotel until 7 PM and missed our dinner reservations. When we booked the tour, we were told that we would be back to our hotel by 5:30 PM.Would I recommend this excursion? Yes, if you really just want a nice afternoon of snorkeling along the reef in beautiful water. But, be aware that the transportation arrangements are not respectful of your time. It took us just as long to be transported back and forth and to wait for transportation as it did to do the boat tour, and our hotel was only 20 minutes away from the marina."

Then we spent less than 10 minutes going through jungle area, another almost 10 minutes driving back down the same paved road and about 10-12 minutes up and down the beach. The only good thing I have to say is that our guide was great and it's not his fault that they have such a terrible \"trail\" layout. They do not split up into smaller groups varied by experience so all of the men that wanted to rip around fast were stuck going the same slow speed with the rest of us that had kids or not a lot of experience. At the end, the guide told us that was had a free snack and drinks at the beach restaurant included in our tour (which we didn't know but that's the hotel tour desk's fault) and that our transportation left in 40 minutes. Before getting something to eat and while we are briefly standing at the photo desk looking through the handful of pictures a photographer took (it ended up costing us $60 for about 15 photos), an employee comes rushing in telling people the transportation is leaving right then and there and they're not waiting for anybody. So we were left in a panic thinking we had no way back until someone told us that there are shuttles leaving all the time so we can actually stay there as long as we like. It is so unprofessional, unorganized, and a cash grab. If you want to go ATVing, ask to book with a company called Mexxtremo instead. The tours are longer, there's no wasted time on paved roads getting to the trail, the guides are amazing and they split you up into groups based on experience. This place is no comparison."

My entire tour was only to ATV and when I called the company, they said they would pick us up from our hotel at 10am and the tour would end at 2pm. To my surprise, the ATV tour was literally only 20-30 minutes. It was the shortest thing ever. I believe the tickets were worth like $40 each. Ridiculous!!!! On top of that, they wouldn't even bring us back to our hotel when we were done. ATVing was done around 1pm and we had to waste an hour waiting for the shuttle to take us back at 2pm.I can't believe we 'paid' $40 for 20 minutes. Never again. They really know how to rip off tourists."

We did walk through some trails and a distance from the beach. There was a lot of construction at one section of the ride we passed. Camels waiting for people to come ride them as well. The ATV riders flew passed us a few times. To me as an experience rider didn't bother much and seemed the horses didn't really spook much, but as an inexperience rider I would probably be a little more anxious because of that. We did get back and promise lunch and not much time to do that before they were calling us back to the buses. The lunch although only contained of a basket of nachos and a plate of beans to dip into. It was good, but I don't consider that lunch more of a snack. Overall I rode every year during every vacation and yet nice leisure ride I have prefer many locations much better. Staff was nice. I also do have to say the horses were very healthy and in great shape. A lot of time at stables you see horses dirty and not up to par in their weigh, but they were all beautiful horses. Elmer was mine and he was awesome."

The activity consisted of about 100-110 minutes horseback riding. We were offered helmets. The ride was a tranquil walk thru muddy paths toward the beach, passing construction sites in progress, a walk along the sandy beach (not in the ocean) and back. We rode the horses with essentially no acceleration throughout, and when we returned we were offered to buy our photos for $20 each, 2 for $35 or the entire DVD for $60. Didn't get lunch yet we were promised to be fed. By the time we were done looking through photos (20 mins) they started yelling \"transportation, transportation\" so we were led to board our busses.A few kids who were on tour did not wear helmets. Found it puzzling how helmets aren't mandated. Comparatively speaking, other horseback rides were smaller groups and have included elements of paced acceleration and, what seemed like higher ratio of guides-to-tourists. Here we had roughly 1:7 or so. All the guides riding were very nice, though. "

The snorkeling was the best , it was lead by a colorful ship captain named Pepe who was entertaining and very knowledgeable about the waters that we snorkeled.The tours were done on two separate days and after each tour we received refreshments at a local eatery. I would highly recommend the tours. If your not a strong swimmer you might want to skip the Snorkeling; the waves can get a little strenuous."

Finally we hooked a small Mahi Mahi then he pointed to everyone on board...You buy trophy..no. You buy trophy No.. Finally someone said yeah to reel it in. It was so small hes like you buy trophy she said no I eat its to small. The waves were really rough that day and they pressed for a trophy while 3 people on board were sea sick. Finally the last half ohour they went closer where the waves were steady and started catching smaller exotic fish like crazy. Im thinkin you idiot we have 6 people on board bored out of their mind/sick and we could have been catching all kinds of fish!!??? Then the first grouper we caught he said you mount?? Over and over it was ridiculous!The funny part is don't ever buy the trophy. Nothing of a fish is used for mounting they measure it, weigh it etc. So if you want it mounted meaure it, weigh it,etc, then eat it go back home and pay a normal price for mounting.They also did not show us were any life vests or anything safe about this operation.Highly advise against this fishing trip we got through lomis travel.Jeff from U.S.A"

Staying at Hidden Beach Resort - Au Naturel Club, we booked the Nude Cruise advertized on the Hidden Beach website and organized by Lomas Travel (Maroma Adventures), which is owned by Karisma Hotel or who own Karisma Hotels, unless they are both owned by a third company.It was supposed to be a nude cruise on a large catamaran, to sail to a snorkeling spot, to have a tropical lunch on a nude beach. Our group of 18 guests met at Hidden Beach and since the sky was overcast, we inquired from the Lomas Travel representative whether the cruise was still on. We were told that the sun was shining at Maroma Beach. We boarded our coach which was filthy with dust and sand on the seats, the windows dirty outside and inside. After an hour drive we arrived at Maroma Adventures (owned by Lomas). Upon arrival it was raining. Again we inquired whether the cruise was still on: it was. They collected our vouchers, made us sign a waiver. After approximately one hour the group was taken outside to the departure dock. It was still raining, the wind was blowing at what some members of the group estimated to be 15-20 knots. Remember: we were to spend the day nude on a boat, do nude snorkeling, and sun ourselves on a secluded nude beach. None of us had brought storm clothing! Again we inquired whether the cruise was still on: it was. Then, as a group of 18 intelligent adults, we decided unanimously to cancel the cruise. The weather was neither suitable nor safe for the planned activity. We were told later that another snorkeling group saw their activity canceled: the skipper of their boat refused to let them dive in those weather conditions. Two younger members of our group decided to stay behind to try another activity: swimming with the dolphins. They regretted it: it was way too cold!We asked the manager to return our vouchers: she refused.An hour later we were transported back to Hidden Beach in the same dirty coach. We then met with representatives of Lomas Travel and of Hidden Beach. We were told that the activity would not be reimbursed, since WE had canceled, and not them. After an hour of discussion, a meeting was scheduled for 16:00 hours: the Lomas representative would discuss the problem with their authorities and report back. At 16:00 we were told that the group meeting was canceled: they would speak to all of us on a one-to-one basis. I was contacted the next day. I was offered a rain-check: the next nude cruise would occur after my departure. I was offered other activities: I would certainly not accept anything else organized by Lomas. I was offered a one-year credit: I had no intention of coming back to Hidden Beach. My only demand was a complete reimbursement. This was not possible for them. I met with a higher-placed representative 3 days later. Same result: no reimbursement. Same reason: WE had canceled the activity. Of course THEY would not cancel it, seeing that all the members of the group were canceling. Thus they would keep our money and not incur the expense of the activity!"

            "review": "2nd time back, can't wait for a 3rd visit!. Every time I visit Mexico, I like to take a snorkelling trip. My husband and I first visited Maroma Adventures in 2010, and of all of the snorkelling trips I'd been on, this was my favourite!The marina is beautiful, and the staff are very friendly and organized. The guides are professional, and genuinely concerned for your safety.When I've gone snorkelling with other companies, my biggest complaints were that there were too many other groups snorkelling in the exact same area, and there is way too much pressure to spend more money on pictures, or shopping. Maroma Adventures DOES NOT do this. They took us snorkelling to two different locations, and at the first location, we were the only group there. At the second location, there was a second boat, but the guides from each boat went in different directions, so we weren't swimming amidst another group.There is a photographer on the boat that will take your picture, and when you return to the marina, you can go to the counter to look at your photo's to decide if you want to purchase them.Because we've been snorkelling so many times, we usually stay back a bit behind the guide, and check stuff out a bit on our own, but we learned this time, that that is a mistake. For the second location that we snorkelled, we stayed with our guide, and he knew all of the little hiding spots, so we saw so much more than we would have on our own. We saw a ray, a moray eel (which I've never seen before), red starfish, baby lobster, and lots of other colourful fish.We had the same guide (Joel) this year that we had in 2010, and he is fantastic! He speaks loud and clear, and provides lots of interesting information about the reef and about Mexico.We've been recommending this company to other friends visiting the area since our first visit in 2010, and will continue to do so."

            "review": "Not for serious SCUBA, but good nontheless. We were staying on Maroma beach at the beautiful/exclusive El Dorado Maroma. Maroma adventures was a convenient 5-minute walk from us but from what i understand most guests are bused in from other resorts. We signed up to do a SCUBA outing with SCUBA maroma; they seem to be part of Maroma adventures.We're certified SCUBA divers; I have ,a lot of experiences but my wife has only a little, so she was a bit nervous and wanted to do a \"refresher\", which is something they offer. What we didn't know is that we would be lumped in with a bunch of uncertified first-timers on a \"discover scuba\" trip (like, 12 of them). The divemaster team does a safety briefing, and they show a couple safety and instructional videos. This part annoyed me because there was some waiting around and some confusion about when to go to the boat. I must say, though, the gear was in pretty good condition, and the training was thorough enough for the beginners. The boat was not my favorite dive boat; it's very barebones. Only a captain's helm, and benches, which are covered, but no cabin, and no seating other than in front of your tank/BC. However, it is extremely functional for diving on short trips like ours. The checkout refresher dive seemed a bit rough for the beginners; I was on the boat. the water was rough and murky; they were only down 10-12 feet to check skills. This is not the fault of the crew; it was windy and stormy the previous day and that day; there was nothing to be done about it.At this point, I should point out that my annoyance is primarily with the \"excurisions\" liason at my hotel, who failed to tell me this would be a mostly beginners discovery dive.The divemaster team earned back a lot of my frustration because they had not one or two divemasters but four to help all the beginners. Sergo, Paco, Ruiz, and a guy who's name i didn't get were very helpful and encouraging even to the newbies who were struggling. On our one-tank dive, I went down first, which was dumb on my part because i sat on the bottom waiting for the new divers to descend and equalize and troubleshoot. The divemaster picked up on this and took us and another couple who was experienced out first. We saw a turtle, moreys ,arrow crabs, all manner of fish, and rock lobsters. I was pleasantly surprised as I was spoiled by diving in cozumel before, the wildlife is great, even if the coral isn't as impressive. One of the divemasters took some great photos of us, which we were pleased about, but the maroma adventures reception area wanted $20USD to e-mail me one photo. Yes. To e-mail me a photo. Something that is literally free for them to do. Needless to say we didn't even bother haggling and walked away.Overall: great equipment and divemasters; if you're looking to do more advanced diving stay away from the one-tank dives and do a real two-tank. Don't expect any frills on the boat even though the staff is very friendly."

They took us to 2 different sites. The water was perfect. Pepe would swim around and call out when he saw something interesting, sting rays, lobsters, red starfish, etc. There was a cameraman that took amazing photos of everyone. They provided drinks and snacks on the boat. Pepe even had a great sense of humor regarding one \"whiner\" girl on the boat. We returned to the dock where we were taken for lunch, which was good. It seemed a little rushed at the end, but I believe that is due to time and transportation. Wish would could have stayed out all day. Would highly recommend this adventure."

They were named \"Brains\" and \"55\" Both dives were almost the same dive. I would've like more variety such as a wreck dive or canyons. The dive masters were very professional and concerned about our safety so had no idea the locations would be just ok dives. Seems we spent alot of time in the sand just off the reef. I call it dessert. I would not call these terrible locations because when we finally arrived on the reef there were pretty morays, parrot fish and angels. It's just we have scuba dove quiet a bit in this area and maybe a little spoiled to great diving. We should've specified what we expected to see on our dives more.Day 2 we rode the ATV's and Speed Boats and had a very exciting time on both. The time on each were 45 minutes which was plenty of time we think. The ATV trails went from the jungle to the beach many times.The speed boat was a real blast. The rougher the water the more fun. Even though we followed a guide boat with about 6 to 8 boats in a line we were spread out nicely with very little chance of ruining into each other. After 45 minutes of this we were ready to return to the beach. Again safety was emphasized in detail by our guides before boarding the boats.The Maroma facilities are really something to see with the many functions under one very tall grass roof building. I hear there is a all inclusive resort on the same grounds which would be great but not sure if it would equal the ones we have booked this t time and in the past. Maroma has a dive shop, center tiki bar, store, nice rest rooms and a booking desk for activities. Oh yes, camels outside?? For all this I give 5 stars to Maroma!"

The animals are HUGE! Well looked after, friendly, gentle giants - you are led around the area on them. My daughter is highly allergic to horses and had never ridden an animal in her life - to see the smile on her face as she rode a camel was amazing, and to be able to make my four year old granddaughters wish come true was amazing.We were picked up at our resort and driven straight there - lovely driver too! After a short wait in the wooden swings we went to our camels, rode around and then had a lovely snack of chips and guacamole, pico de gallo and refried beans. The kids enjoyed French fries and ketchup. We could have waited and taken a later shuttle - we were very tempted as the menu looked amazing and the prices were very reasonable. I will return to spend more time and do more activities. Everyone treated us very well!"

They sailed the catamaran from one end to the other then back to original area for our first snorkel spot. then drove to the other end to anther snorkel spot. what a waste of time. why not snorkel at one end then sail to the other? Drinks were suppose to be included- not before you snorkel, but there is no time after you snorkel for drinks. The Lobster dinner, was suppose to be a chose of surf and turf or just lobster, well there was only three couples, one was offered surf and turf, we were not, one couple sat on the beach, which it was suppose to be a beach dinner. we were not offered the choice. the mentioned when we arrived, that if it was raining we would eat in the restaurant, we ate in the restaurant, not the option of the beach, but we paid for lobster dinner on the beach. when we asked about sitting on the beach we got the run around, we asked three people and each time we got a different answer. although the food was good, and snorkeling the reefs were great. they rushed up through dinner. we were suppose to leave at 5:30-or so they said, our ride back came at 6. I would not recommend Maroma beach adventures. I have had better tours and received what I paid for elsewhere. The beach is beautiful and empty, I felt they were rushing us so they could close up for the day. not sure if that is true"

It included round trip transportation via a large chartered bus, catamaran ride, snorkeling, spinnaker, and chips/salsa and soft drinks at the end. Here's what I didn't like about this...1. The tour was supposed to have lasted 3.5 hours. We left our hotel at 8:30am and didn't get back until 2pm. Evidently no matter if you choose to have the lobster/steak lunch or not, everyone gets there and leaves at the same time. So we had to wait for those that purchased the lunch to finish before we could leave. AWFUL. We waiting nearly 1 hr 45 min AFTER we got off the boat to return to the bus to go back to our resort. 2. The snorkeling gear was used and not brand new. That grosses me out. 3. The bus people were not friendly at all. The plus side-1. The people on the boat were super nice. Always offering beer, coke, sprite and water. Never even had to ask for that. No snacks on the boat though. 2. While snorkeling, the guides would dive down and retrieve starfish that we could hold and they were always on the look out for something they thought we'd all like to see. We got to see a stingray. Overall, I'd never do this tour with this company again. Even though the people on the boat were great, the transportation is what put a real damper on things. "

I had dived in the past a few times in Hawaii, but my last experience 30 years ago in Hawaii was horrific due to TOTAL INCOMPETITANCY of the instructors, so needless to say I was quite nervous!! But aside from that one time, I had loved diving and I really wanted my son to experience it! From the moment we entered the office, Alex and Luis, welcomed us, we were the first to arrive out of our group. He talked to us in general while Luis got busy fitting us with our gear. When all of our group arrived, Alex explained everything about the equipment and safety as well as all the fish, turtles, etc., we may see. He knew all of our names very quickly. By listening to him, I could tell he was very knowledgeable, but he also gave me the sense that SAFETY was of the utmost importance! I can RELAX!! We went on the boat out a little distance, not very deep, and we had a practise dive. When we were all on the bottom of the ocean, we practised our drills again that Alex had taught us on dry land. When the instructors felt we all were good with these new skills, we surfaced, and went back to dry land to pick up some more certified divers and off we went to do the REAL DIVE!! I had some problems de-compressing my one ear going down the rope and immediately I was able to get help from Sergio! He tried to help me, but my ear just would not pop, so he took me up a bit, and I tried again a few times, still wasn't working - I was getting nervous!!! Sergio took me up some more and again I tried, thought I got my ear to clear and we started to go down, with Sergio's eyes totally on me- NOPE- my ear did NOT CLEAR! I tried again, and FINALLY it cleared! I am soooo APPRECIATIVE for Sergio's patience, as I truly was starting to get more nervous! But after my ear cleared and we were all down on the bottom of the ocean, we divided into small groups and went on our Merry way with Luis! He was constantly checking on the four of us, making sure we were all ok, as well as checking our amount of air that we had left, I knew we were DEFINITELY in COMPITANT hands and he would look after us SAFELY! The fish and coral were absolutely beautiful, we even saw a pretty big stingray that Luis pointed out to us. When it was time, we surfaced and the boat was there immediately to pick us up. I am soo glad that I went diving again and ESPECIALLY GRATEFUL TO ALEX, SERGIO AND LUIS for making me feel comfortable and safe diving!!! I know my son, Sean truly enjoyed his first experience and I know he will DEFINITELY be going again when he can!!! These guys are first class all the way!! I would definitely say even if you are a little bit nervous, they will help you and definitely teach you so you will enjoy your dive - without question!!!! Thankyou for our most memorable and best memory of our trip to Mexico! Sandy, Sherwood Park, Alberta Canada"

The reason why they stay so close to the beach is that they want to be immortalized while they do that by a photographer that is on the beach. Side-effects: the annoying noise, disturbing not only people on the beach, but also all living things below the water, and the ecological impact of all that oil spilled in such a small zone in a beautiful sea. Also, unless you want to stay within a tiny spot \"dedicated\" to bathers, it's basically impossible to swim, let go snorkel: you are definitely too afraid to be killed by one of the idiots on the boats, even if you're staying REALLY near to the coast."

If some one read this and is on favor of the disabled human rights please help me to do something against the ignorance of the people. Thanks"

While both were fun, you are restricted to following the guide and the speed they set, so you cannot travel outside the caravan either with the ATV or the speedboats. We never got to go very fast in either one which would have been more enjoyable, but if you like being led around, then this should work for you."

My husband and I paid for the snorkeling at the Maroma Beach, with Maroma Adventures, they take you to two points in a catamaran to snorkel, they explain very well how to adjust the mask, flipper, life vest. signs of emergency and so on. At the first point they help you to get down and up the ship, but at the second point none of the crew were there to help you, I got a pinched hand trying to get up the catamaran. The have big groups that seems harder to handle, between points they offered water and soft drinks.Once you are snorkeling you get the chance to see the life under the sea and it is pretty amazing, there are coral and fishes of all colors and sizes swimming all around, for me that was a great experience. I think would be better if they offered small group trips, they'll have more control and everyone will enjoy better the experience and not crashing with others while swimming. If you can afford a private snorkeling I think would be much better service."

A long visit with 2 dolphins and a trainer, with your own photographer. So you do all the tricks, etc. and really whatever you want for the entire time. Great pool facility. I was definitely a little worn out by the end - those dolphins are fast and strong.

The cost for 2 adults & 2 children was a whopping $265.00! The trip was to also include the crew feeding the fish and then WEATHER PERMITTING, a ride on an attached spinnaker (sort of like a parasail), along with water, soda and snacks. Everything started out great. Catamaran was clean, nice and we were all excited. Our first stop was nice, we saw coral reefs, lots of fish, kids were happy. Second stop, barely any fish, mostly coral - still, that was ok. But in between the two trips, we were only offered soda or water and no snacks. I saw a clear bag filled with small chip bags but never did they give them out. Then at the end of our 2nd stop, I asked one of the crewmembers about feeding the fish. He looked at me like I had three heads and said \"no, no feed the fish.\" What?! That's the best part! Just floating in the ocean with fish surrrounding you everywhere! You couldn't just throw a few pieces of bread for a couple of min?? Jeesh. And of course in between the two trips, the WEATHER PERMITTING factor kicked in and the winds weren't strong enough for the spinnaker. Ok, yes I was very upset, but I understood - not one to put anyone in danger. But looking back, I don't think there ever will be strong enough winds for a spinnaker from a catamaran. And if all 25 or so of us went on it, that would add another hour or more to our \"half day\" excursion. The beach is beautiful and the waiting area is nice but that in no way makes up for the cost of this trip and I didn't get my money's worth at all."

Maroma beach is just North of Playa Del Carmen so it was a 30 min. drive. On arrival, we waited another 25 minutes with a nice crowd of folks looking to fish until the crew, captains showed, and then we were 'paired' with a boat to ensure a six person maximum. The facility and personnel were fairly organised. The beach / marina were basically right at the center and were beautiful. We lucked out because there were only 5 on our boat which was your average fishing boat, but clean. All of the boats are essentially the same. I recommend taking a sea sickness pill in case it gets rough (you never know). One of the great benefits of the RM coast is that you dont have to go far to be in game water (maybe 1.5 KM). However, we did have to endure the deckhand selling us on taxidermy services. Its part of the experience in the RM. Folks work hard to make extra money/tips. The water was blue, clear and mesmerizing. I think I would've paid for the ride along the coast seeing that beautiful water. The mates set and dropped five lines with different rigs. When the fish is 'on', you essentially take turns on the chair and are handed the rod. I 'caught' 2 Spanish mackerel and my dad caught a bonito. Another passenger caught a large barracuda (4 1/2 ft long). The crew really care about you catching fish. They try, but the ocean (and conditions) dictate your outcomes. If the swells are strong, you may have to fight for balance, but you forget about that when you're in a heat of a battle. The boat did have soft drinks and beer. Caution against drinking beer as it will just dry you out and get you sick. Ginger ale or water is best. Back at the docks, we did see one boat that landed a 6 ft marlin. However, the best part was yet to come which was eating the fresh mackerel and bonito that we caught. The crew and restaurant were highly organised. They were waiting for us when the boat docked. They cook the fish for free and soft drinks are included. Best fish tacos that ive ever had, by far. Pablo (our waiter) was under the weather, but still excellent. Best $14 US (for sides) that ive ever spent. The view, the food, the weather, wow. They rearranged our transport back to the hotel (because of the optional restaurant lunch), but again were organised. The trip back was a little longer because of a hotel stop, but ok. All tolll, the morning trip was 6:45am to about 2:30pm door to door. We had a great time fishing and would not mind this place again"

I was very worried after reading some of the reviews about them pushing for mounting a fish, drinks, tips, etc. But I was very surprised that the guys (Chilly & Willy) were very nice... they did do most of the fishing at first but it's because they have to get the lines set up and get them baited and rebaited if necessary. They also offered us drinks throughout the ride however it is only one beer per person on the boat so the guy at the bar before you board will offer you drinks but he doesn't chase you down lol. Also, at the very end they did \"ask\" for a tip but it wasn't over bearing and did not come off as rude. My only complaint is the restroom on the boat is VERY small& the sink did not work ... I held my fish and felt gross after, bring hand sanitizer. We were not offered snacks on the boat but we packed sandwiches & there is chips and snacks in the gift shop before you board. Also, the sea sick pills are in the gift shop for ($11USD). We did have our barracuda filleted and cooked for us at the restaurant. I am not a big fish eater but it was very good. Service there was okay... the waiter did not speak good English though. Overall this was a great trip. A guy with us caught a 50in Barracuda within the first hour... that was pretty awesome. We had a great time!"

The ATV ride was fun but I felt like we could have used a stop somewhere in the middle of the 40 min. ride just to get off and stretch. The ATV's seemed to be well kept and maintained and the guides very helpful. The location is very well set up, the food was good and the people were great.

If things could go wrong they did go wrong, but the guides were very helpful to attempt to turn the situation around.

They herd in tourists for snorkeling, horseback riding, camel riding, dolphin encounter, etc. We opted for a morning ATV/Speedboat adventure. We were picked up at our hotel in Cancun at 8:00 am by a van to head down the 40 minute drive to Maroma. When we arrived, we checked in and the 6 of us in our party signed waivers to do the adventures. The ATVs were first and there must have been at least 30 people or more in the group. Some of the ATVs are not in the best shape and stalled a few times. The 19 and 23 year olds in our group had a great time. You really get to drive through some wooded trails which are bumpy so they enjoyed that. The only issue is that so many people are in the group, they can't always keep track of the lost drivers. One of my sons got stuck in the sand on the beach and the ATV stalled. Everyone kept going and were out of sight. Luckily, my husband and I were behind him. My husband was able to get the ATV started and pushed out of the sand. If we weren't there, I'm not sure then the tour guide would have noticed someone was missing. The speedboats were a lot of fun, too. The Thomas More agent at our hotel said you get on the boat on the shore but should wear a bathing suit if you get splashed. The boats are actually tied up in the water so you are in chest high water in order to get into the boat. You definitely need to wear a swim suit! The boats are easy to keep track of in the open ocean so no one got left behind. The only disappointment was that snacks, soft drinks, and water were supposed to be included in the excursion. We got back to the pavilion at about 11:40 and got no direction on where the snacks or drinks were. There are so many people milling around that it is very chaotic. I think it would have been better if we were brought to the eating area as a tour group so we knew where to go. Instead, they want you to look at the hundreds of pictures they take on the tour in order to sell you photos. Overall, my kids really enjoyed the trip. My husband and I thought it could have been better organized."

Also, I have taken other Catamaran snorkelling trips previously and with another company in Mexico.Maroma adventures was overall a good experience. The actual snorkelling part of the trip was a great experience. The guide was wonderful and took the time to explain how to use the gear as well as help anyone who was not a strong swimmer. You get to experience two separate reefs, with many fish and coral. It was beautiful. The staff on the \"catamaran\" were helpful and informative. However, I say \"catamaran\" because I have been on many catamarans at other destinations in the Caribbean, along with one in Cancun and the boat they use is much much smaller. I was not impressed, especially because they advertise their boats as large catamarans. It did not have any guard rails, the nets which usually fit 6-10 people comfortably would barely fit 2 and were extremely worn and unsafe. Also, The actual sailing time was maybe 30 minutes in total, including the sailing time from the port to the reefs. That was most disappointing because we had specifically booked the excursion to be on the open water and to sail on the catamaran, that was second to snorkelling. The second part of the trip excursion is lunch. We had specifically booked a lobster lunch and that was wonderful because it was my birthday. There were a total of four of us, two couples and we were seated at a private cabana on the beach with a view of the water just past the palm trees. It was beautiful. Our waiter Vitor was especially wonderful. His service was exceptional. He was attentive and made my birthday luck a great experience. Lunch was appetizing, we were served an appetizer, a lobster entr\u00e9e and a dessert. I would definitely pay the extra for the secluded lobster lunch. Alcoholic drinks are also served with our lunch package. Overall I had a good time. What made it wonderful was the actual snorkelling and the lunch. If your looking for a more fun catamaran trip with alcohol on the boat then this is not the excursion for you, but if your looking for some great snorkelling and a lovely lunch then this is the right choice."

We stayed for a few hours had lunch and enjoyed one of the most beautiful beaches on earth. I highly recomend this tour. The staff is wonderful and so knowledgeable. What a great day!!"

After getting settled on one spacious catamarans were moved & crammed on to a smaller one. Not much space and we didn't spend much time sailing as the reef is very close to marina. Back at the marina, groups were separated by lunch type - lobster lunch versus buffet. Buffet restaurant was more like a cafeteria. Ugly cafeteria. Waited 20 minutes for server to bring drink order (sodas) so we left. My daughter wasn't feeling well so asked if we could be transported back to our hotel (7 min away, max) since transportation is included. Well you would have thought I asked for a pot of gold. Scheduled departure times were about 1.5 hr away but we were the only ones from our tiny hotel on this tour. I asked 3 times and I got various excuses which were just one delay after another. When we thought we had finally found someone to transport us, we were stopped by staff, including a manager, who was quite insistent on our staying to eat. We again explained why we were leaving & at this point were too angry. For a few moments, we felt trapped. And FYI, the \"free alcoholic drinks \" with your meal are watered down & tasteless. The \"real\" bar on the property is a cash bar. Bartender was RUDE when I showed him my bracelet thinking I could get a drink.This was the biggest waste of money. We are furious and disappointed. Don't book any water sports activities through this tour company. None."

Anyway, we chose to ride horses one day and take a snorkeling excursion another day. We enjoyed both.We rode horses a 3pm to avoid the worst of the sun, which was a good suggestion from Luis, the gentleman who books excursions at the hotel. The horses are all older, but friendly an easy to ride. Mine seemed tired, but it's hot and he was carrying tourists around all day. This is definitely a tour for the beginner-- don't expect to do much other than walking with your horse.The path through the mangroves and to the beach isn't as scenic as it could be. We did see a crocodile which was pretty cool. Still, riding the horses was relaxing and we enjoyed being outdoors.Our guide was funny and helpful, and kept things going smoothly. They do ask for tips at the end of these excursions. I tipped both the horse crew and the snorkeling crew $20 USD, which I hope was enough. These guys work hard, and they deserve the tips. Snorkeling was done from a huge catamaran in two places on the reef at Maroma. Expect a huge group-- we had about 50 or more in ours. This didn't really bother us at all, as there is plenty of reef to explore.Our guide great. He was constantly leading us to swim to various locations on the reef to see different things-- coral, fish, etc. I feel like if we had been left to drift on our own, we would have missed a lot. He was also very personable and made the whole trip enjoyable.We stopped in 2 places, and got in about 90 minutes of just snorkeling. For the price, this is a lot more than I've ever gotten in the water on one excursion. The day we went out, the spinnaker ride thing was canceled because of the wind. The ocean itself was also quite choppy, but not so bad as to make it really difficult to enjoy snorkeling. It was a particularly windy day here, and most people will have calmer seas when they visit.We snorkeled in the morning, which seems good for light to see the reef and fish activity. We saw a lot of fish, coral, and plants. It was definitely very pretty.Equipment was good, though next time I come on a vacation where we plan to snorkel, I'm going to invest in my own. We have a 9 year old son, and at least on the day we went out, this may have been a bit much for him for his first time snorkeling. We didn't take him on this excursion, but instead took him to Xel-Ha, which was perfect for him. We got snacks and soft drinks included with both of the tours, which was great. Not such a big deal for us since our resort was next door, but definitely great for those taking a tour bus back to Cancun and other points. With my review, I'm splitting the difference of what I'd give the two experiences. I'd really give a 4.5 if I could-- but the horseback riding just wasn't a 5 even though we enjoyed it. The only issue with snorkeling would be that I did like being with a smaller group when I did it in Key West, and there are other outfits here that cater to that. However, it would have cost more money, and I still feel like it was a great experience."

The fishing trip, however was a huge disappointment due to the actions of the Captain. After hooking a massive Blue Marlin, the 4 of us on the trip spent an hour of hard work to bring it in. However, as the fish got close to the boat & started jumping, the Captain said he would have to cut the line unless one of us agreed to spend ~$2000USD to have it mounted. Otherwise, no picture with the fish. In the end, he kept the fish on the rod & passed it off to another boat in the area. We never got pics after spending an hour of hard work to bring it in. The Captain also lied to us (I am assuming to get a bigger tip) & told us that none of the other boats caught anything at all. To our surprise after we returned to the dock, there were fish everywhere from the other boats. Perhaps this was just one bad Captain in their crew, but I will not give them another chance."

We saw LOTS of fish!Only downside (which is where 1 star came off), they had a lot of people on the boat, and that made for sometimes crowded and dangerous (danger of getting kicked) snorkeling. 36 guests on the reef at once.

While it was a long drive to Maroma from Tulum, it was well worth it. When we arrived, our Cat was not quite ready, so we were offered a short tour to go and see the new Dolphin aquarium. As we watched the people swim with the dolphins, were were offered a nice icy-cold beer. Then we were taken to the Camels to hear a little about them and get some fun photos with Clara the Camel. Within about 20 minutes, our cat, The Dreamer was ready to go. We were given some instructions on the beach and loaded up. Rafa was our cat \"guide\" and was outstanding. He made sure everyone was enjoying themselves and kept us entertained.The snorkeling was great, the water was perfect, clear and warm and when they offered us the spinnaker instead of another snorkel stop, we jumped at the chance. There were about 10-12 of us that did the spinnaker rides. On our sail back, we also stopped for another dip in the ocean to swim with the starfish. What a cool experience.After our 3.5 hrs on the water, it was back to the beach where they had set up some beautiful tables in the shade of the palms for our Lobster lunch. We were each served two large lobster tails in addition to the side dishes, plenty of margaritas and beer and music. It was a wonderful meal, and a wonderful day.

It was fun to ride them on the trails with puddles and close to the beach. The jet-skis were pathetic. I had my throttle maxed and felt like I was barely planing on the water. Maybe they had governors, but I'm pretty sure it was just old and abused equipment. The snorkeling would have been fun, but unfortunately the sun disappeared the entire time we were out there and the wind made it really chilly. Obviously I know this isn't anybody's fault. The beach at Maroma is really pretty though. Our biggest complaint is that we were picked up at 7:40 in the morning and not dropped back off till 6:30 at night. We only did a total of 3 hours worth of the actual activities, so lots of down time. We wanted to be back at the hotel the entire day.

We arrived at Maroma and proceeded to do the first of three activities - a morning of sailing on a catamaran with 2 stops for snorkelling and using a spinnaker afterwards. The snorkelling was AMAZING! So many beautiful fish that are close enough to touch. Bring a waterproof camera!! The guides on the boat were funny, helpful and thorough in explanations. After the snorkelling was done, they got out the spinnaker, which is basically a big rope swing attached to a giant kite that's controlled by a rope from the guy on the boat. DO IT, it's so neat! This is coming from someone who is afraid of heights. You don't go up too high, and it doesn't last too long. Just long enough to give you a beautiful bird's eye view of the ocean and area, and to get a little adrenaline rush. You don't have to do it, but it's really neat and not difficult!Next was a buffet lunch in the beach restaurant, included with our tour, followed by an ATV.excursion. It wasn't that spectacular, but we've been ATVing ourselves where there's no rules or guides! Next was the jet skis, which was fun, but again, you're following the guide and do what he does, and we've been on them where we are free to go where we want.

They drop you off an hour early at a central plaza for activity pickup - water adventures, horseback riding, ATV's, Camel rides, wave runners, etc. They spend the hour trying to sell you things (drinks, food, trinkets, other activities). We then waited another 30 minutes to get a van back to the horses, which you already passed on the way in.The horse riding crew is great and the horses are very calm. However, it is just down a trail back to the hotel, down the beach 50 meters, turnaround and return on the same trail. There is no narrative, highlights, or anything on the 90 minute tour. We've done several of these at different places, and this by far was the most boring ride ever.You then spend another 30 minutes trying to catch a van to go back to the main center; where you find out your ride doesn't leave for another hour. You are then encouraged to go to the restaurant where they try to sell you lunch and drinks (free chips and soft drinks). You are not allowed to wait at the front where the bus picks you up. They require you to wait by the bar. We couldn't have been happier to finally leave this place! We felt like we were at a prison for tourists - no one leaves until your pockets are empty!"

We drove south to Akumal and it was so crowded, but still pretty and a lot going on if you like to snorkel. We found Maroma on our last day in Playa and now I just can't wait to get back. Plenty of beach chairs, tables with palapas, places to walk, etc. The water is turquoise and the sand is a pretty light tan. A convenient little store, multiple restaurants and food and drink service at your chair or table. We took a short walk up the beach north and saw a couple of shipwrecked life boats and what looked like an abandoned hotel. Much to explore. I'll be here my second day in Playa del Carmen on my next trip."

            "review": "You just have to go!. Maroma adventures has something for everyone -just checkout their website. This is a beautiful beach area and not crowded with resorts. El Dorado Maroma (we stayed there a few years ago) is next door but there aren't any others closeby so it is a unique place. My husband had booked the deep sea fishing trip (4 hrs) on two previous trips but we decided to go together on this trip and I am tickled pink that I went! I had never been fishing before and wasn't exactly thrilled at the thought of it. There were three other people on the boat other than the crew and you just took turns. There were several lines in the water, some at deeper levels, some at more shallow levels as different types of fish inhabit different depths in the water. The captain did a great job of finding good spots. Everybody caught fish. We caught a banana fish, a queen trigger (colorful, beautiful) a huge amberjack (which they will cook for you when you get back - $5.00 a person for fish, salad, beans, tortillas, really good and a memorable experience) and a 89\" sailfish! I wore out trying to get the fish in so my husband finished reeeling it in. I will try to add the picture. Victor, part of the crew, kept giving me much needed instruction and encouragement. I could see the fish jumping as I tried to reel and it was a beautiful blue. When we got it in the boat it looked black. Victor explained that when the sailfish are excited/stressed they change colors. Victor and the crew spoke limited English and I speak almost no Spanish so here are a few things you need to know if you catch a fish and are considering having it mounted (which we did). The fish you will receive is a replica, not the actual fish. The actual fish condition would deteriorate much more quickly than the replica. Ours is beautiful and we are happy it will last a lot longer. The cost that the crew gives you is probably about a third of what it will actually cost once you add the shipping costs from Gray's taxidermy in Pompano Florida and the fee Gray charges for the actual work (Gray's are wonderful to deal with and have been doing this a long time). We contacted them when we returned and it took about 6-8 weeks to get it. I think you can break it up into a couple of payments if you need to. This was a fantastic day, a wonderful memory that will last a lifetime.The captain and the crew were wonderful. As I mentioned before, the restaurant will cook the fish you catch. It's a little piece of heaven to just sit with your toes in the sand, looking at the beautiful blue water and eat deliciously prepared fish that you caught. Go create some good memories! Even if you don't catch a big fish, it will be a memory to enjoy."

The crew was very polite and well mannered and tried their hardest to give us a good experience. It was a 4 hour expedition and they left it up to us how much deep sea fishing we did and how much drift fishing we did. We decided to do two hours of each. We were unlucky with the deep sea fishing only catching a small tuna which was use for bait. However the drift fishing was very successful and we caught a variety of fish including trigger, snapper, needle, suckerfish, and some other varieties which I can not remember the names. All the fish were filleted for us and we could of taken all the fillets but we just chose some of the trigger fish which was prepared for our dinner back at the hotel. You can have your fish prepared at the Maroma adventure facility for lunch if you wish. Aside from very small bathroom facility on the boat I can find no fault with our experience. The crew made sure my wife had a good time. Thanks. wish I could remember the name of the boat but the crew was Balou, chilly and willy."

The two guides that we followed on a \"trail\" were great and made me feel secure as there was snorkellers, etc in the same area. My suggestion is to wear goggles, salt water in the eyes isn't so nice while driving. The ATVs felt like a short ride, the trails weren't very long, the beach/sand trails were fun. You also follow a guide for this. They are half an hour intervals, and a lot of your time is taken driving down the road up to the first trail. You'll see 2 alligators in natural ponds. It is not a rough trail by any means. I don't suggest doubles, there isn't much room to sit two people on the ATV.The buses were mixed up on this day and ours arrived and hour early, we did not have enough time to check out the shops or have a snack. Barter with the photo counter, they don't have a set price. We paid $70 for 4 people and all the photos of 2 activities. The pictures turned out really great!! We had enough fun to come home and want to buy a jet ski!"

The Lomas van was on time and the drive to the Maroma beach dock was comfortable and safe. We arrived about 20 min. before the boat was ready to leave, so we walked around the beach area in front of the El Dorado Maroma resort and were blown away by the gorgeous sandy beach.Upon departing from the dock area, we were jiving to the sound of the Bee Gees while touring the ocean on our way to our first of two snorkeling destinations. The guide was exceptionally funny and witty and spoke very good english. Once we got in the water our guide was feeding the fish right in front of us which was a great way to get a close up view of some tropical fish. The dive site itself was nice with lots of coral and some interesting reef formations.After our first dive, we travelled a short distance to our second site. Less than half of the people went back in the water for the second dive which was ok because we spent less time swimming to the reef and more time exploring it. The second site was even nicer than the first and we really enjoyed it. After we were done snorkeling, they un-furled the kite swing. Only 4 people took advantage of the opportunity to swing under the kite, and I was one of them. The swing was alot of fun and felt very safe. The ride was short, (only 3 or 4 minutes) but it was a blast!Once we returned to the dock, they had refreshments for us inside, which included pop and a plate of nachos and dip. It was served up with a smile and very tasty. Overall I feel this excursion was a great value and well worthy of a 5 star rating!"

First off, we didn't get a ton of info from the rep besides where and when we get picked up at the resort. We had no idea what was included, where we were going, or how long it was all going to take. We should have just walked along the beach at our resort and gone with one of the vendors there...Once we were driven to the Maroma facilities we were herded to a waiting area and told to wait for the parasailing person. We waited, and waited. Finally, the guy checks us in and tells us that we are waiting for two more people. So we wait some more. He finally comes to get us, without any additional people. The boat and crew themselves were very friendly and knowledgeable, and set my scaredy-cat mind at ease. The parasailing portion was wonderful, I just wish it would have been somewhat longer, for the price it seemed like a pretty short ride. Once we were docked, the pleas for tipping and buying photos started. Honestly, I don't mind tipping, except when it's blatantly asked for. Rude. I agree that the \"snack\" was fairly lacking as well, again for the price paid. Once we were done with that rigamarole, we sat and waited to be called to be transported back to our resort. Not a horrible experience, but the service could have better if we were more informed of what to expect and such."

( I was terrified but hubby loved it). The captain and crew clearly know what they are doing. We parasailed together and it was really easy getting up and back on the boat.My disappointment is not with the parasailing experience, but the rest of the day was disgusting. We felt like it was a fleecing operation. You arrive and wait at the bar for your tour guide to get you (there are a number of options so lots of people waiting around) or shop in their store.We were told we would get a snack after the parasailing. It was a bowl of chip and bean dip and a soda. But they try to get you to buy beers and order other items from the restaurant.We were told that buses left the beach every 1/2 hour. Don't believe them! Getting out of there is the worst! I think they want you stuck there to buy more stuff! When you want to go, you have to go back to the bar and wait for the bus guy to call your hotel. While I sort of understand that there are some buses that only go to certain hotels, but we felt very mislead about how easy it would be to hang out on the beach as long as we wanted and then go home when we wanted. Instead we felt trapped and pressured to spend more money.Don't bother!"

We booked with 8 friends and did the snorkel/parasail on catamaran all inclusive. We were told it was only a 25 minute ride from our Cancun hotel, but was 45 minutes away. Got there and was told no drinking until we get back. All the tours we have done have done rum punch and beer after the snorkel on the boat and then food and drinks when we got back. They did say we could purchase alcohol before our boat ride at the bar. What is all inclusive for $40 more for? We were got on the boat and it was stuck in the dock area because of low tide. After 30 minutes of trying to get out, they had another boat tow us out of the dock area. Once onboard, the snorkeling was great, tons of fish, barracudas and stingrays all around. The snorkel mask and snorkel were cheapest version out there. They didn't even have the fog solution, you had to spit in it. On the second time out to snorkel, the crew did not even help us back on the boat. The other patrons took our fins and snorkel gear and helped pull us out of the water onto the boat. It was windy so parasailing is out. They did do a startfish show and tell where we could hold them since no parasailing. When we got back for food and drinks, we were told we only had 20 minutes left since took so long to get the boat out of the dock. The food was terrible. We went to the bar and were told to sit down that someone would wait on us. After 15 minutes passed and us yelling, they finally came to serve us our alcohol. The all inclusive was a joke. Save your money and book somewhere else, as this one sucked. Go to Isla Passion or Carlos N Charlies Beach Club or Punta Sur. Much better tours there! Also we were supposed to be back to hotel by 5:30 and didn't get back till 7:30."

If you a local, speaking Spanish, or going in a group, you could even get a print with US$1 only!!! I was told of this during my return.I joined the dolphin encounter as well. There is changing room, but washroom only, so it is very inconvenient. There are no lockers to store personal belongings neither. The pictures combo is US$83, I reduced to US$52 after the camel ride experience. However it was still too much expensive then it could be. Others can get at US$1 each print!!!The travel agent said the above activities were called a combo, which means transportation and lunch buffet are included. It was not really a \"buffet\", it has just a few trays of meats and vegetables. They do not taste good at all, just very simple food.I appreciate the trip because I have the chance to have close contact with camel and dolphin, but anything else."

After a few minutes, our group of 30 or so were lead to the catamaran. It was dated and not in great shape. Once onboard we saw there was no place to sit. Everyone was forced to squish together at the front and put our bags in a huge pile on top of the cabin. It was way too small for the amount of people onboard. We got underway and after awhile we parked near the coral reef. We had to get into the water as a group and swim to the reef and back as a group. The life jackets they provided were frayed and had buckles broken. The drop down from the main level of the catamaran to the water level was more than a foot making it difficult for some to get down. The current was strong ( not their fault, of course ) so it was a difficult swim. Getting back onto the catamaran was difficult as the ladder was really short and you had to give yourself a good push to get high enough ( and there was only 1 ladder, the other side had none ). They opened the sail to reveal a very worn, torn and patched up sail with huge pieces of tape crumbling off. Several pieces fell off into the water. We went to a second snorkeling stop and the same system of going in as a group. Nothing was really seen in the water, very few fish and some coral...We sailed back and the crew asked for tips. Once back on land we had the option of a snack or lunch. We then waited approximately an hour for our transfer back ( even though we were told we would go back immediately after we ate ) and a 20 minutes transfer ended up taking 90 minutes due to the van being packed with people staying at other hotels. We had a second excursion booked for later in the week. We cancelled it once we reached the hotel. stay clear of this company."

We own a timeshare here in Playa Del Carmen and (December) 2 years back I joined a offshore fishing charter with this company and had a great time. The captain and his mate were very polite and worked hard to get us on the fish. I went out with 5 total and I ended up landing a nice 46\" Barracuda. This year I wanted to go again but with my family; wife, son (11), daughter (13). We booked a private 4 hour fishing excursion. Captain John, and his deck hands Luis & Jonathan worked extremely hard for us. Within minutes of leaving marina they had 7 lines out as we began to troll for \"fighting fish\". All the staff but especially Luis made us feel very comfortable. His English was fair but he was very polite and patient with us. My wife injured her arm prior to our departure to Playa so she sat up on fly bridge with Captain and took in the great sights. The rest of us all caught a great amount of fish. We caught (3) bonita, (3) snappers, (1) 27\" AmberJack, (1) large mutton snapper 30\", and a large queen ann trigger. The staff worked hard to ensure we hard a great time. We trolled and jigged throughout our 4 hours. We even decided to have (2) of our catches taxidermy. In short, I Highly recommended fishing with this operation no matter if you are a 1st time out, seasoned angler, or looking for a great family trip. SIDE NOTE: If you do get seasick or not sure if you will make sure to take (2) low-drowsy Dramamine as the boats are 34-43\u2019 but it can get a little rocky through the day ;)"

Today I visited the beach with my family, I couldnt believe the amount of garbage there is in the ocean, I dont know where it is comming from, but there is garbage everywhere. People that paid 100 pesos to enter were cleaning and picking up all the crap instead of enjoying themselves. Management at Maroma need to do something about this. I feel bad for all the turist paying so much money to see this. It is pretty damn discusting. Other than that the staff is friendly, and the place is very convenient, it has all the facilities. The food is not awesome. There are atv's, waverunners, camels and horses. If you dont mind the nois you will he here. I will be sending a letter to Semarnap, the local authority to report this situation."

You get 2 hours through jungle, 5 minutes along a beach path, not the beach.The horses looked very well cared for which was very important for me. The cowboys who take you on your ride are always on hand, really professional.The downside is the company that drag the day out. An extra 3 & a half hours was added to our day in waiting around and transfers. I totally appreciate they are running many excursions from this resort, but my holiday time is precious and i felt a lot of time is wasted here. That aside, the experience was fun, horses well cared for and the riding staff professional and considerate."

And it was only after a lengthy conversation with the on-site excursion coordinator that we finally learned about this great place.We paid $81 USD per person for 45 mins of speedboats and 45 mins of an ATV tour. This rate gave each of us our own boat and own atv. The speedboats appeared to be a little \"tired.\" The atvs were in much better condition and appeared to be fairly new. Both the speedboats and the atvs provided lots of excitement and were safe to operate.With the speedboats, we raced in the ocean close to the shore and it was very scenic along with being exciting. For the atvs, we took a ride through a jungle past some small ponds and got the chance to see young crocodiles and monkeys. The atv tour ended with a race around a speed track in the jungle that was a lot of fun.The beach at this facility is amazing. The water was calm and refreshing. Our package included a light snack that consisted of nacho chips with dips.We had great service from the moment that we were picked up at our hotel until we were dropped off. I would recommend these activities to anyone looking for some adventure on their vacation in the Cancun area."

When we arrived in the early afternoon we had to wait about 30 minutes at the main entrance until we were told where to go. Then as we were waiting for more information we were told that Lunch would be after the snorkeling trip around 4:00. The snorkeling was ok, but there were not a lot of fish and very few reefs. When we arrived back at the marina we went to the restaurant for lunch. Lunch was ok, service staff was pretty good. One of our servers then told us that our shuttle would be out front in a minute so we finished our food and drinks and went back out front. When we got to the main entrance we were told that our shuttle was still 45 minutes out. Finally when the \"Private Shuttle\" did arrive two additional groups of people were placed on our shuttle causing us to have to go in a completely different direction than our resort. We were originally told we would be back at our resort by 5:30, but we did not arrive back at the resort until after 6:45.

Maroma Adventures were very professional, accommodating, and concerned with our safety. They took us out on a catamaran and set us out about a 1/4 mile from the shore. The reef was not deep and manageable for us and our 10 and 6 yr old boys. They provide everything from booze & water, snorkel equipment (masks, tubes and fins) and flotation devices; which we discovered later you did not have to use if you chose not to. For those with peanut bladders and or young children, have no fear there is a toilet on board. They would also alert us to various under water creatures and even brought up a sea urchin to show us. The sand on the beach of amazingly soft and silky. Next to the beach we were on was an inlet on a private beach. We didn't lay out on it but did in enjoy more snorkeling in the calm waters. We saw large crabs and many fish. Because it was on a sand bar it was very easy and safe for our kids to enjoy. They also served up a good buffet lunch as part of our excursion, although specialty drinks/alcohol/dessert were not included. Plenty of water was available though and good beach side service. Great day and fun time was had by all. Plan on coming again."

We had some problems getting to the site - Lomas was great but I think the shuttle forgot to pick us up so we got to the site we were late and they seemed a little unhappy with us. We waited around a long time after we arrived and the people at the desk were not so nice at first - once they saw we were unhappy they got a little better.The guide for the ATV was nice enough but be aware they do not tell you to wear closed toed shoes until you arrive - to late. I probably should have realized but have never been on ATV's before. I rode with my husband and our machine's breaks were not working correctly - one was actually missing! My husband told them when we got back but they did not seemed to be concerned and showed that they were working by pulling the machine forward? Made no sense to us. We were told we would see gators, birds, monkey and deer - we saw one gator which my husband is convinced was fake - I think it was real. The other side of the tour was on the beach and that was fun but this site has tons of things to do so if I were to go back I would skip the ATV and do one of the other things.We also did the little speed boats. They were fun (not really my thing) but the guide was extremely nice and accommodating to what we wanted to do. The boats were in good condition and the help was very good about explaining how to get in & out of boats and what to do when we were out. The tour comes with soft drinks and chips and there is a restaurant there. You could sign up for several things and have lunch or dinner there - make a whole day of it. I would recommend it but not the ATV's."

When on the phone, scheduling this event, we were told that we would be in the air parasailing for 10-12 minutes each. In actuality, I was up for about 8 minutes and my husband was up for about 7 minutes (we had to go separately because there wasn't much wind that day, which was completely fine by us & yes, I timed it because I wanted to make sure we got what we were sold when we booked this). We both loved the parasailing. The issue with us was that we weren't in the air for nearly as long as we were told and we paid $66 each to do this. The captain of the boat spoke zero English and we don't speak Spanish, so we tipped him $10 at the end and then went to speak to a manager at Maroma Adventures about the short \"in the air time\". The manager wanted to make it right with us and said that the owner of the boat would take us out again and make up the shortened time. Here is where things went totally south. The manager took us out to where the boat was docked and explained to the captain in Spanish what the expectation was and how we were both shorted on time. The captain had an absolute meltdown in front of us, yelling in Spanish and pointing his fingers at us in a disapproving manner. Up to the point, we hadn't been upset with the captain in the least. We even tried to explain to the manager that we had tipped him and loved the parasailing but were disappointed that our time was shortened and we thought $66 each for 7-8 minutes each wasn't fair or what was sold to us, when we booked the excursion. This arguing, between the manager and captain of the boat, went on for several minutes. It ended with the captain refusing to take us out again. Another manager got involved and about 30-40 or so minutes later, the captain had reluctantly agreed to take us out again and make up the time. By this time, it was around noon, and we had to be checked out of our hotel by 1 PM. Now we not only didn't have time to do a \"make-up\" session, we weren't about to get back on that boat with an angry and hostile captain. It really put a damper on the last thing we did in Playa and we were very disappointed in the captain and also Maroma Adventures for not discounting our parasailing adventure."

Then we went to ride the jet ski's and the guide doing this told me I need a locker to put my stuff in and they were $5 each so I paid that. While in the locker room there was a sign on the wall that said ( lockers $2 each). We made our way to the water and we had rented 2 jet ski's for 1 hour. they started my wife and mine with screw drivers and told us we were good to go. My jet ski broke down 10 min. out so the guide gave me his and he jumped on the back of another girls jet ski who was also on her honey moon and drove around with her between his legs for the next ten minutes., then my wife's machine broke down too. She jumped on the back of my machine with me and we were brought back to shore after 25 min. Then they followed us out to the parking lot asking us to write a good review about the place on there comment cards because it meant a lot for the guide. We said we weren't interested and they hounded us for 20 minutes until my wife told the women that she would write something nice about her but not the guide who scammed us on the locker and brought us to the shore after riding the jet ski for 25 min. She said that would be great thank you, so she wrote something and we left. I would highly recommend to stay away from this place.

We had a special rate, so the value was excellent for us as well. Having free time to hang out with the dolphins was priceless, and most of the activities you engage in with them are a thrill. A few others are just geared at getting a photo-op. The price of the pictures is obscene. As I said, spending time with the dolphins is incredible and my review is based on how I felt about it at the time. However, I am now having mixed feelings about their captivity and have heard that I should spend more time researching the entire business of 'dolphin encounters'.

The crew was concerned for our safety at all times and worked very hard for the meager tips they received from the 15 or so people.

            "review": "So much fun!! ATV & Speedboats. The beach here really is beautiful! They do offer different packages, for different prices. We chose the ATV and Speedboats. It was around $165 for both of us, which included transportation from Playacar. We had to sign waivers saying that we would not damage anything and if we did we were liabable up to $60,000. That was a bit scary. Even a popped tire could happen and you'd be in trouble!After a quick lesson on how to drive the ATVs,we were off. You are required to stay in a single lane which means you can only go as fast as the person in front of you. They should ask people that prefer to go slower to go in the back, but no trouble. You get 45 minutes and drive through mud, sand, and a bit of stinky standing water. Lots of fun! After that,we headed to the beach for 45 minutes on the speedboats. Once again you are required to stay in a single lane. You must walk in the water out to the boats and get hoisted in. Some people did not want to enter the water and apparently weren't aware of this. While it was fun, it was basically driving in circles in a line of boats. I would've prefered to jetski (which is an option, but you only get 25 minutes). Still, very fun.At the end of each activity, they blatantly ask for tips, so be prepared for that. Other things that weren't mentioned - you can rent a locker. It is $5, but when you return the lock you get $3 back. So it's a $3 deposit and $2 to rent - bring cash! You get soft drinks and chips in the restaurant. They did a poor job of showing us which one, and once we got in an unfriendly person brought us one soda each and the chips and beans (yum!). Apparently that is all the service you get and we would've had to go up to get a refill, which would have us bumping into waitstaff. That was a litle frustrating and made us feel like second rate citizens.You can also purchase the pictures. They are very pricey as they always are at these types of things. I believe it was $90 USD for a CD or $20 for one photo. We'd go back to ATV, Parasail, or Jetski. :)"

I would definitely do it again, thanks to all, especially Arturo, who made us first timers feel extremely comfortable. Saw plenty of coral and fish; water was quite clear."

The rep assured us that we would get 4 hours fishing time with free drinks and snacks.First of all, to get the easy bit out of the way, there were no snacks, none at all.Secondly, after being dropped off by our taxi, we had to wait 40 minutes at a bar before boarding our boat with the barman constantly trying to sell us drinks. we also had to endure this for 30 minutes at the end of the trip whilst waiting for our taxi. If I want a drink, I'll ask for one!The main reason I booked the trip then, sea fishing. We boarded the boat which was shabby, run down and the exhaust fumes were awful for the entire trip. Really awful. I have been sea fishing many times before so I do understand that at low speeds depending on wind speed and direction, you may get the odd whiff but this was CONSTANT for the entire trip.After over 1 hour at sea, we eventually stopped to \"fish\". Well, the 3 crew actually fished and the 2 fish that they caught in what seemed like a lifetime, they allowed someone to reel in the fish and land it. They even lost a fish and managed to lose 4 or 5 rigs. I could understand this in the North Sea wreck fishing but not in the Caribbean.They continued to fish, catching nothing then we moved to another spot where they eventually let us have a go. They wouldn't let us drop our lines though, oh no they had to do that. After 5 minutes, I got a bite and caught a fish which was a reasonable sized trigger fish so at least I had caught something. We fished for around 30 minutes before time was up and we had to head back to shore. We caught about 6 fish altogether in that time, treble the amount of fist the crew caught in around 1.5-2 hoursIn short, I totally understand that sea fishing is dependant on a number of factors, including luck. I have no problem at all that we didn't catch much or even that 1 prize fish. What I do object to though is paying $120 for the most part a boat ride or watching the crew fishing.If I wanted to watch someone fish, I would have stayed at home and watched the discovery channel. Maroma adventures, very poor effort indeed."

So we decided that Secrets Maroma would be the place for us to celebrate our 25th anniversary reunion together from 17/8/13 until the 31/8/13 and had the most amazing time at this hotel. The rooms are stunning with stunning views over the gardens and the ocean view, and always so nicely cleaned. The staffs taking care of the gardens were very attentive to detail and ensuring that the grounds were cleaned and that the beach sand was raked and prepared for the next day. The food was amazing at every restaurant that we went to and they always prepared the food just as you liked asked. The pool and beach staff were all absolutely fantastic with their warm, caring, and friendly manners and they couldn\u2019t do enough for you to ensure that you were happy and receiving the best possible services. There was never a dull moment at the resort as there was always something to do or you could choose not to participate and there was never any pressure. The activities were well planned out by the \u201cExcellente! Entertainment team\u201d all of the members were extraordinary always smiling, full of energy and truly a really a hard working group of individuals, who were also involved in assisting in all of the amazing well designed evening shows.We would like to acknowledge special thank you\u2019s to some of the staff that made our stay like home.Jesus Banana- #1 staff for creating a loving atmosphere of fun no matter what activity he planned or took on each day.

If you're a first time ATV rider then you may enjoy the atv tour but for experts or a casual rider (4th time) it's beyond a failure. They take you on a trail through the \"jungle\" (it's really just a path with trees and you don't see anything at all but trees). I had regrets but when my son enjoyed his scuba i was happy that we didn't waste our time driving from Cancun out to here for 1 hr. take your camera - the tour desk take lots of pics but charge you $20 usd each picture - you won't even pay this in the US so not sure why they overcharge you so much money. They give you chips and a drink with your tour - watch out for their runny beans (my son got sick). The chips isn't good either but the drink - soda etc is safe.

The guide, I cant remember his name, was very good to deal with. We took a very nice horse ride down along this trail then back along the beach. We returned to the farm and climbed onto the ATV's. We started riding through the jungle then stopped to look at some caves. After the caves we drove to a small cenote. We did some swimming to cool off then proceeded through the jungle another five minutes or so until we came out to the beach. The guide pointed out to the water where the cenote was purging up out of the ground into the ocean. We stayed here for about twenty minutes then went back to the farm. We then climbed aboard the \"Mexican Cadillac\" as the guide called it and drove to a small restaurant on the beach. The food was pretty good. After lunch we walked over to a small equipment building and put on life jackets. We jumped up on the jet skis and headed out onto the ocean. We goofed around out there for a while the rode down the shoreline until we came upon another small equipment building. The guide informed us that we are going to do some snorkeling now. This was a surprise because snorkeling was never mentioned on this excursion. We went out along some very nice reefs and were able to see a lot of very colorful fish. We returned to the jet skis and headed back to the restaurant where we had lunch. Up to this point everything was pretty good. The van arrived to take us back to our resort. On our way back the driver decided he was going to do some favors for his friends at everybody else's expense(time). He drove down through the back streets of Playa Del Carmen giving a tour to his friends. The driver drove around showing them things on the back streets of Playa. We finally stopped on one of the streets we went down for the third time and dropped off his friends. The driver proceeded down through the town and stopped to pick some personal belongings. We then voiced our opinion to him because everybody had dinner reservations. Almost two hours went by and we finally made it back to our resort. This was ridiculous. Overall the excursion was pretty good except for the ride back. Somebody should organize the transfers better."

All went smooth but then had to wait in a plastic chair for another 45 minutes to head to the speed boat which I was told would be last.

I had asked several times and they said atvs first.The speed boats were....... Boats, no speed to them lol, I was not surprised but the follow the leader routine makes it a bit dull.The atvs were better, except for many of us complaining that there were no functioning rear brakes on them and we were instructed to use only the rear brake so we wouldn't flip forwards. The ride was nice except having our wet clothes covered. In sand and dust due to the prior speed boats.We were there until 3pm when we were picked up at 10am for 80 min of excursion, and were not offered any type of snack or drinks at all except if you want to purchase them at the conveniently placed ca$h bar, I bought a small bottle of water for $2.50 usd!!

It is not the safest, they give you a choice to wear a helmet or not, and you should, bewaring horses can take turns, as we got 5 minutes into the trip, on the horses one of the 13/14 horses went on it's two back legs flung a man off his horse, he was advised to go to hospital, it is not the safest place.

I asked what was the 2 dollars was used for, I got a shrug of the shoulders and an intimation that it went into someones pocket and NOT to protect the reef. These boat should be at least 2 miles + out in deep water, NOT inshore and right on top of the reef. The fact that I had hauled my gear from the UK and from El Dorado Casitas Royale which took 2 hours to get there because of pick ups from 8 or 10 other hotels.

            "review": "RIP OFF FISHING TRIP!!!. While in Cancun on first week of July i decided to try the deep sea fishing experience. Things seemed great although water was pretty rough we rigged in about 5 barracudas and a Blue marlin which we had to release if no one wanted to mount it. Like the other fishing reviews say they put extreme pressure \"TROPHY FISH MY FRIEND TROPHY FISH\" and kept asking if I wanted to mount it. This was my first big fish and almost gave in but I also have other priorities. Although half of us got sea sick being that the waters where really rough we survived and tried to enjoy the trip. I thought it was a bit suspicious that we had to take pictures before we got to the marina. and they kept putting pressure on big tips! What really did it was when we got off the boat there was a lady there rushing us to get back to our transportation and when I asked her where do I get my fish fillet she said that I could not because barracuda was not a fish you could eat. I told the lady Ive had barracuda before and she continued on how dirty the fish is and could have disease and said it had to be thrown back in the water which was ridiculous I told her the fish is DEAD!!! If that was the case they would warn you ahead of time and release the fish. I had to rush back to my shuttle where I see another guy with a bag of fillet fish and asked what kind of fish it was and he said barracuda, I felt ripped off. I have a feeling there is a scam going on, they make you fish pay for all their expenses and probably sell the fish to a market or either keep the fish. It was very disappointing and felt helpless."

WOW, Mexico's great reef is exactly what all the hype is all about and Maroma knows how to showcase it. Only 2 of us plus dive master Francois on the trip, so we got spoiled. Francois was excellent, pointing to all the awesome sea life that I was not expecting to see. Tons of pictures and video. He let us take our leasure time to explore and we dove at our own pace. He was excellent to explain all the safety precautions and checking our air supply to assure we got the max out of the dives. We were even set up with GPS in case we got lost out there. Imagine. Explored two different dive sites, so made it very interesting, the corner and the brain, so cool. Recommend to all! Excellent and can't wait to return for more!"

However, I suggest they put some thought into the sequence of activities and clothing required. It made no sense to go snorkeling first, get dressed to have lunch, and then put on the wet cloths to do the waverunner. Also, photos were kind of expensive. I suggest tourist negotiate aggressively because other tours charged 30-40% less for the same quality of photos. Try to pay between $30-$40 US for all photos. Overall, I was happy! I traveled alone, and I'm a single lady in my 30's. All the guys were gentlemen."

            "review": "ATV Jungle Tour and Speed boats. My family and I were super excited about doing the ATVs and speed boats. All of us being experienced drivers on ATVs we were hoping that they would like us kind of go free a bit. They split us into two groups with the non-experience doubles and the experienced singles. We weren't really able to even get the ATVs up to a decent speed. Had to stay in a single file line. No passing. I do recommend bringing a face mask and glasses/goggles/ sunglasses to help cover you from the dust. The tour was nice and their photographers get some great pictures. (If you're willing to fork out $15 PER photo or we were offered for both experiences for all 5 of our photos $100... seriously it should be like maybe 3 for $15, I understand they have to make a living but that is a freaking rip OFF.)The speed boats were another story. The speed boats looked pretty dinky and old. When you go to the speed boats they have them floating off shore. You walk into waist deep water and then basically dive in. There's no step ladder or anything. Then once we actually got out there we had to stay in another single file line. For everyone in my family but myself they were all experienced drivers. They wanted to be set free. Instead we all basically just followed the guide and couldn't get decent speed at all. It's called a speed BOAT. In fact, my entire family expect for one got yelled at. Two for too much speed, and the other two for not staying in the line! I mean I understand there's a reef there and all but shouldn't you be out deep enough with a speed boat that it shouldn't matter? Or at least that's what they should do. So, over all it was an all day event. They did provide chips and beans, with drinks as the included snack. But their restaurant staff were really not happy to serve you unless you were ordering a full meal. Over all this place offers a lot. But at the same time, you get what you pay for. The picture thing really irked me though. My family and I were overall unhappy due to the fact we weren't really allowed to have any freedom in our experiences."

The dolphin swim was amazing, down side is that Lomas Travel booked the kids as adults for the Royal swim $139.00 each rather than the $79.00 and would not refund it. Totally crappy things about the Dolphin experience was that they would not let the observers take any pictures as they had there own photographers there and really pushed you hard to buy your CD/Disk after the encounter. Price for one disc of pictures for two adults and two kids (6/10) was offered at $220.00, or you could buy 3 pictures for $40 on a disk if they were all of the same kid/person. Was a total rip and put a bad taste in our mouth. Even offered them $20 for one really cute picture and they actually laughed at us for asking. I have swam with dolphins in Acapulco and Honduras, both places let you take your own pictures and actually encouraged it. I highly recommend you search out a place that isn't there to take all your $, but rather to promote the animals and good fun for all. The animal interaction was amazing, but the staff actually told an observer she had to put her camera away and that she could not take pictures. I would not recommend this place to anyone that does not plan to spend $800 for a family of 4 (picture disk included) for a 1 hours interaction. Oh, they get you there early by 45 mins and make you stand in the gift shop trying to get you to buy stuff before the swim."

Francois, our instructor, never rushed through his explanations, and made both of us feel comfortable before, during, and after the dives. Coming from the American Midwest, we were shown a world unavailable to us at home. He showed a familiarity with the area that allowed us a vision of fish, coral reefs, and other undersea life that neither of us had seen before. The rest of the staff, Joe, Felix, and Blacky were helpful, and courteous at all times. We have been talking about almost nothing else since then.

The staff was friendly and gave us free drinks as well as a champagne toast/shower for the wedding couple. We felt as if we were miles out but we were not too far from shore.Then we went inside ashore to eat! They had prepared a buffet lunch with an area of tables for our crowd of 27. The food was more authentic Mexican recipes than the resort caters to and it was delicious, and all you could eat, with more free drinks. The trio of guitar players making rounds made the experience relaxing. There is much more to do in this complex, ask your tour guide in the resort about this. The bus was back as scheduled to deliver us back to the resort. They group travelers together from nearby resorts, so you may not be the first stop. Relax, have fun and CHILL big time!"

Our first dive was choppy but once we got under we enjoyed the dive - divemasters were great and saw a huge sea turtle, tons of lion fish and an eel. Two people on the boat ended up getting really sea sick and I slipped coming out of the water and banged up my knee - like I said, it was a rough day at sea.

            "review": "Great Experiences With 2 Activities: Reef Snorkel & Parasailing. During a vacation to Riviera Maya April 11-17, 2013, a couple friends and myself decided to spend the day doing a couple activities. We settled on doing the Reef Snorkel in the morning and Parasailing after lunch. Our travel coordinator at the resort suggest Maroma Adventures for doing these and even offered a combination deal with better pricing. The bus picked us up at the resort at 8:30 and we were off to start our adventure. We arrived at Maroma Adventures a little after 9 and we greeted by strolling musicians in the bus waiting area. It was really a nice touch! We then went to the main desk to check in and only had to wait a little while until we were ready to board the boat to start our snorkeling adventure. We kicked off our shoes and went on board. The group for snorkeling was maybe 14-16 people total, which was a manageable number. We went out to the first reef after about 30 minutes. The water was a bit cold and choppy, but the reef was nearby and we were able to get to them quickly. Our snorkel guide took us out and showed us different things to look for while snorkeling. After our first stop, we all boarded the catamaran again and then went to the next location. Being that it was too windy and the waters were a little rough, no one was able to do the spinnaker swing at the back of the boat. :( The second snorkel location was much better than the first, as we were literally on top of some of the reefs we were viewing. Our guide located a lobster hiding out in a rock, a spindly starfish, and a few other things. Each snorkel outing lasted approximately 45 minutes each. After the second one was complete, everyone relaxed as we took an extended cruise before returning back to port. The trip was fun and a great experience. The guide and crew were great and took good care of everyone. Also included with this trip was a buffet lunch on shore. My two friends and I chose to skip it so we could get to parasailing next, so we weren't able to say whether or not the food was good. It should be noted that alcoholic beverages were available on a cash basis and were not included.Right after we returned, we went on to the parasailing activity on a different boat. There were a total of three groups going parasailing on the boat: two groups of two and our group of three. The crew was great in getting us out there quickly and getting the first couple up in the air. Each group was up in the air for 12-15 minutes and as they were being brought down, they were dipped a few times into the ocean for good measure. Our group of three was easily accommodated and had no problem doing the parasailing. The only complaint that I had was that when I was being hooked in, the guy doing it moved my leg support straps too low so I wound up not sitting upright during our time up in the air. I was forced to lean back, which made it a bit uncomfortable for me. Other than that, it was fun and everyone who did it enjoyed it. After we were done, we were taken back to port where we had enough time to relax before boarding the bus to come back home. We took a look at the pictures that were taken throughout the day and I decided to buy the parasailing pictures being that there were a lot of pictures that were taken. The snorkeling pictures didn't turn out well and weren't worth the money. The cost of getting all of the parasailing pictures on DVD was $90 USD. It was a little pricey, but the quality of their camera was amazing and the photographer did a great job capturing everyone's facial expressions.All in all, the two activities we did were phenomenal and I highly recommend that people use Maroma Adventures to do them. They also offered other activities, such as Deep Sea Fishing which 6 other members of our group did the same morning we went. They said they enjoyed their trip as well. They also do: Horseback Riding, Camel Safari, Scuba Diving, Deluxe Snorkel & Lobster, as well as a Paradise Adventure (ATV & Speedboat), a Maroma Adventure (ATV & Wave Runner), and an Ocean Safari (Wave Runner & Snorkel). They are a well-rounded location and have been doing this for 10 years. Again, they are highly recommended for a wonderful variety of activities."

Anna taught the resort course to my girlfriend while I went out diving with the certified divers. Joel, our instructor was very professional, and had a beautiful smile!. The shop even offers GPS/radios with the harbor that you can carry in your BCD!! I have never seen this in 20 years of diving... Kudos to your shop! We had a very relaxing 1st dive at around 40 feet, seeing a big green moray, a few small, blue spotted sting rays, 2 stone fish, a cow fish & other tropical fish. As divers were running low on air, they were able to surface with the drift dive buoy & get on the boat, while the rest of us continued diving. That was a plus! We didn't have to end our dive when the first person was out of air!!! Our first dive was 48 minutes! We returned to the boat & went back to shore to pick up the resort course divers, my girlfriend being one of them. I am used to seeing resort course divers try their skills in the pool before going to open water. At this shop they do their water skills inside the break waters at about 8 feet. Joel took the 2 of them down on the anchor line & we waited. My girlfriend was very empowered by Joel's positive feedback as she completed each skill & received a handshake under water for a job well done!! At 53 years old, , trying a new skill like scuba diving can be intimidating, but they made it easy! When they had completed their skills, they returned to the boat & we went out in open water. Joel helped the new divers down the anchor line while the rest of us did a free descent, staying around 40 feet. We had another very relaxing dive, seeing two large stingrays, a red spotted eel, many garden eels, lobster, & a lot of carribean reef fish. Joel kept a good watch on everyone, especially the resort divers. No one panicked or surfaced early. We enjoyed a 45 minute dive together! I am very proud of my girlfriend and her first experience diving! She is very proud of herself and now has many stories to tell! Hats off to Joel and Anna for their great customer service, genuine love for diving that reflects in their teaching skills, and professionalism. My husband is a scuba instructor, & I admire these qualities in him as well! PADI is proud to have you sharing the underwater world with all you come in contact with! Anyone reading this review, you are never too old to try something new.... as long as you meet the health requirements & have an interest, this dive shop will show you how wonderful diving really is!

I can honestly say that the Dinner/Sunset Cruise is WAY UNDERADVERTISED and believe it or not DIRT CHEAP at 120.00....What do you get?Tranfers to & from the pier from your hotel,upon arrival at the pier , a beautiful mariachi/champagne welcome, then you board a lovely Catamaran for a slow sunset cruise around the most beautiful beach (all with appitizers, music, fun and unlimited drinks of ALL kinds while on board) then back to the beach around sunset- OH MY GOSH, upon exiting the catamaran, there are about 20 wait staff on a beautiful beach set up for your arrival, ready to serve you with a BEACH front private 5 COURSE meal complete with soft music, drinks,appetizers ect.. then just as the sun sets and they light the tikki lights, you are dancing on the beach with your honey, in your private fully netted cabana, a live saxaphonist comes by and serenades you!!It is THE MOST ROMANTIC and surreal experience we have ever had!! when we went last May-2012 we \"rented' this excursion for just us and another couple.We have done similar in Hawaii & Virgin Islands and paid over 6,000 USD for it , but it DID NOT come anywhere NEAR this for 1/3 of the price!!) I PROMISE THIS IS THE BEST 120.00 you will EVER spend in your LIFE! ( we will be there in 7 weeks, cant WAIT!) this lasts a total of about 5-6 hours!! Hope y'all enjoy this as much as we do!!"

Most of the catamarans from Maroma will cruise over to Mexico's famous reef, if you're presented the opportunity to snorkel, do so! The reef a few miles from Maroma's shore is the second largest reef in the world and is abundant with beautiful sealife. Tips: Remember to buy organic sun lotion. The grease is terrible for the sealife. No matter how good a swimmer you may be it's worthwhile to snorkel with a life-jacket. The waves are typically great for swimming to the reef, but depending on the weather it can be hard to get back to the boat."

The whole settings is very resort-like, where you check in for your activities, given a wristband. We first went ATV, the ATV was well-maintained, i can rev the engine, accelerate a lot. The path was excellent which started in broad roads so that you can warm up, then into narrower, \"jungle\"-like paths leading to the ocean side. There's even a corner where everyone speed through it. The waverunner next was even better, the equipments are again well-maintained. You are told to follow the guide and not to deviate from his path, but he actually just started accelerating and you basically can do whatever you want in the ocean. It was the best activity I had during my trip.It's also the first time I bought pictures, got a deal for USD100 for both activities for both my girlfriend and myself (down from USD160) in a CD.They then have complimentary soda , chips and salsa while you wait for your van back to the hotel. The beach is also quiet, beautiful.Locker is $2 USD. Extra $2/person for water activities to \"protect\" coral reefs. Guides are very nice. Definitely recommend !"

Victor and his mates were accommodating in every way and completely put my concerns at ease immediately. The water was very rough but we were asked the entire time if there was anything that we needed. As we landed the \"big one\" we were encouraged the whole way in.

I was like ok just dropped $200 with nothing to show but an automated confirmation with no details. After a flurry on emails and getting auto generated replies I was contemplating a verbal Trip Advisor beat down on them.The website link above hyperlinks you to the Maroma Adventures website the bookings are processed through Lomas travel. The online booking form needs work information is duplicated and it takes to long even auto fill cant work.Brenda Romero sales manager to the rescue I hope her bosses appreciate her she has great customer service very prompt email replies once I was able to get her. She addressed all my concerns and assured me that we would be greeted by a representative of Lomas travel the day before our tour to get the where and when. She also provided me with addresses and timings which I was able to Google and research as I am not familiar with the area. Note that they do not pick up at smaller independent hotels you need to make your way to the Plaza Playa and wait beside Starbucks coffee shop where the van will pick you up.Although in the Mayan Riviera the culture may not move at the break neck North American pace we need to remember that \u201cManana\u201d applies to most everything and we don\u2019t go there to move fast we go to slow down so start at home when you\u2019re getting ready to go. Its hard to disengage from our go, go corporate lifestyle but they live in at the pace we seek as soon as we touch down.All in all very friendly they just need so have the basic details people are looking for in a booking like time to be ready for pick up common addresses in playa they pick up, where to be for pick-up, who will be picking you up, who to contact if something should go wrong and you don\u2019t link up with their tour rep. We look forward to the tour in April from all the great reviews it should not be dissapointing."

Then we did quad biking, which was excellent. We rode through the jungle then along the beach. Last but not least we did jet skis, I was apprehensive bout this because of my phobia but I absolutely loved it, the speed and adrenaline is unreal, I enjoyed it that much I fid again twice in our resort.

We told the operator that we had never done this before, and he assured us it was safe and fun.  When we arrived at the marina, we were taken to the ATV's with a group of about 12 people, given a less than three minute talk on how to operate them, and then told to just follow the guide. Despite telling the guide that we never rode one before, we were not offered any additional help. The guide took off, and unless we went fast, we couldn't keep up with him. He kept going, and only looked back occasionally to see if the group was together. There were several times we reached a place where we had to turn in the jungle,, but could only guess which way the group had gone. There was no one behind us, and the only person who knew the area was long gone.At one point the person directly in front stopped short, and we very nearly ran into a tree in order to avoid hitting him. The guide just kept on going. I have never been so terrified in my life.Perhaps if you are an experienced ATV driver you might enjoy this tour, but everyone else beware!"

Our cost was about $75.00 US, which included the bus transportation, 3 hour catamaran and snorkelling, including soft drinks and water, plus an open bar lunch back at the beach.  The Catamaran was in good shape, and was clean and in good repair. The men who were our tour guides, Ramon and Alex, were very friendly and helpful. ****Note: they did a very offensive (to me) tip gathering at the end of the tour. Way too high pressure.  The snorkeling was good, although I was a little disappointed in the amount of food thrown about to lure the fish. It drew lots of fish who looked and acted a lot like Blue Jays at a bird feeder. We saw other kinds of fish, but were often swarmed by the others. It's a little off-putting to some people to be in the middle of a fish feeding frenzy. Otherwise, the snorkeling was clear, and the coral was interesting and varied, and there were lots of fish to see. The catamaran ride was uninspiring, because we only got the small front sail out for a few minutes. Otherwise, we were under motor. I think this is because there is just not enough room between shore and the reef to let the main sail out. There was a lot of wind, and it would be foolhardy to be under sail in such tight quarters. Also, there was too much wind for the spinnaker adventure, which sounded fun, but was unavailable. On a calmer day, I think the experience of the catamaran, the snorkelling, and the spinnaker fling would be much more fun. The dinner back at shore was surprisingly excellent. We had the choice to be served either in a huge palm-roofed hut, or outside at tables on a sandy area. We chose outside. Being from Canada, I love that there are no bugs! The dinner was tasty, although there were not a lot of choices, and it was well prepared. I have a touchy stomach, and all I tasted was YUM! Service was kind and attentive.  On shore, they have a gift shop, with underwater cameras, sunscreen, etc. plus a nice variety of made in Mexico crafts and curios. There are very clean washrooms, showers, changerooms,etc. A very nice, very authentic onshore experience. The bus transportation was in good shape, although I will never get used to the Mexico driving. It picked us up when it was scheduled for both there and back.  So, overall, it was worth the money, a great day out on the water, with sun, fun, and fish, and ended with a fine meal and pina colados on the beach. What more could one ask for?"

Dave ( Shrek ) was great with him ( and a couple other people ), instructing him about the machine and keeping an eye on him untill he was comfortable driving it ( didn't take long ). The ride through the jungle and mangroves is just a gas. After playing in there for a while it's off to the beach trail. This is a winding narrow trail that is so much fun!!! Tight, winding, and then...alongside the Ocean. GREAT! So much fun.Short break...wave runners. What to say? Hot from the 4-wheelers, hot sun, bright blue sea, the water felt so good flyng across at speed. Excellent! Always a rush on a waverunner. The beauty of the area adds so much to the experience.There is a restaurant on site and the food is very good and inexpensive. A great find and surprise...if you like Ceviche, I found it to be amongst the very best during our trip. My oldest son cosidered it the best. Great place...excellent people.

I reeled in 2 good sized fish which they used as bait and another guy then reeled a 50 inch Baracuda (very inpressive) which they killed getting in and then wasted as they said you can't eat it (your catch can be cooked for you back on the beach for free).Lots of other tours on offer here and the place looks stunning.

Overall, it was a little confusing at times. We were doing multiple tours there, so we weren't sure about timing and everything. But we got it figured out. We started with ATV/speedboat tour. The ATVs were fun; went through some jungle type areas and then through some beach sand dunes. Everyone follows in a line down the path behind the instructor, so hope that you don't get behind some really slow people! lol 45 min was plenty though. I wouldn't recommend doing an entire 90 min of it. We opted to do the speedboats for the other part. They were fun too...mostly just because the water is so freakin gorgeous. Again, you follow in a line behind the instructor. And wear your swimsuit, cause we walked out into the water to get to the boats! That went on a little long I thought, but it was enjoyable! The best part by far though, was the parasailing. Never been before and wasn't really nervous...until we got WAY up in the air. Wow. Way higher than I thought we would! We went first, so it was a litlte nerve wracking not knowing what exactly to do or expect but it all worked out fine. We had the perfect amount of time up there in the air. It was so peaceful, once I got over the anxiety and felt secure! Another girl on the boat didn't have the best time up there... I don't recommend it if you get seasick!I also recommend you take advantage of the free chips/beans snack...delicious!!"

What a great day out, I had been on ATVs before, but this was something else, we went through the jungle and onto beach terrain, we had some great supervision on the use of ATVs before the tour started, the only down side was another rider came round a blind bend and hit me at 20 miles an hour as we had all come to a stop, the people at marina maroma were really helpful and asked if I was ok and needed a medic.We also did speedboating, which was great fun, really fast boats you go on a convoy and have to follow a tour guide, we were out for about 35 minutes which flew in, the only slight thing I have to say is I would have liked a break in the middle so we could swap drivers and we could both have driven, other than that was a great day"

Did not stay at the hotel but spent the day at the beach club as it is open to the public for a fee.It was so worth it as the beach is almost virgin so the sand is very soft, the water is very clear and clean. There are plenty of beach chairs as well as huts on pillars over the water with beach chairs, tables and nice views of the little marina.The food was very decent price wise, we thought for sure it would be more but it was cheaper than many places in PDC.Very friendly staff.Very peacefulLots of jet skisIf you like to walk it is very worth it to take a long walk on the beautiful beach especially if you walk towards the left of the hotel.Only thing.... I had no choice but to buy a lip balm because of the strong sun and because i forgot mine and the store charged 75 pesos which is absolutely ridiculous when it costs about 10 in the city. I did not get a receipt so who knows if this was even the real price"

All of the staff were extremely helpful and friendly, even helping one of the ladies on the boat who was pretty hesitant to try the snorkeling - she ended up loving it. Although the weather didn't cooperate (it started storming and pouring before the second snorkeling site was reached), we had a great time. The guide in the water with us fed the fish around us, so they came really close, brought up a sting ray and starfish for closer observation, and made sure we saw everything. The facilities were also excellent. I would definitely recommend this excursion."

We went through the safety dive and off to our dive location. Once we arrived, the crew again did a great job getting us down and situated. However, HUGE disappointment in the area. Very little to see, very few fish and what fish we did see were only a few species. Disappointment is a mild word."

My tips are: sneakers, rent a locker, bring towels, prepare to tip.The best part were the ATVs. There are two trails, one that involves a little mud so be sure to wear SNEAKERS. There were a few people that had on flip flops and they complained about how dirty their feet got. So be prepared and bring closed shoes. The second trail is more dense vegetation, sharper turns with hills. This area is really HOT. The guide stops for a few minutes to allow you to take pictures and all we could think of was \"Let's go man!! its hot out here.\" Your clothes will get dirty, so you might want to bring a change of clothing. We hated walking into a restaurant later with muddy shorts. You than get a 10 min brake to change into your bathing suits. After that you meet the guide for the speed boat introduction and you are assigned a boat. This part goes pretty fast, the boat only has a steering wheel and a lever which can either make the boat go fast or faster. The only advice I can give is to keep up with your group. The slower your boat goes the choppier you will find the waters. There is someone on a separate boat taking pictures of the ride, these pictures were $13.00 USD. and worth the money since they are nice shots of you barreling on a speed boat. The staff was very pleasant and attentive. Please do not forget to tip them. I can say that the only part that was tedious was waiting for the rest of the people that makes up your group. They come from different hotels in different vans. We were the first group to arrive and had to wait about 45 mins to start the ATV tour."

However, I was disappointed in the quality of the reef ( just a few colorful corals-- far between) and the quantity & variety of the fish to be seen ( some Sergeant Majors, a wrasse, & a parrot fish. What really ruined this trip for me , however, was the constant shouting amongst the crew. They were either yelling at each other or yelling at the tour group in the water. It was not a fun, relaxing trip at all. Although they said you could snorkel at your own pace and swim in a general area near the boat, the guide in the water was always yelling for everyone to stay together. It spoiled the peaceful, nature experience that I was looking forward to. At the end of the tour , they held us captive (not docking) until they got their tips."

We had a short wait for all the other people going on the same trip. That gave us time to put on lotion and have some drinks before we set sail. We had a short briefing about the area and boat. There were about 40 people on the boat. We had plenty of room for all of us. We untied the boat and headed northeast towards the reef, had a great guide that spoke loud and clear about the light house and the reef. We drifted along the reef until we found a sandy place to set anchor. The water was around 10-12 feet deep. We put on our gear and jumped over board. The water was refreshing but not cold. As soon as we put our faces under water there were fish greeting us. There were so many fish and sea urchins. we climbed back aboard and moved down the reef and set anchor. The coral in the second area was really nice with lots of small beautiful fish. After 45 minutes snorkeling we needed a break. Took a rest for about 15 minutes and then they ask if anyone would like to fly on the spinnaker sail. This was a first for me and my group. We could have just done this all day and been happy. Everyone on the boat loved watching and cheering for each person. Now it lunch time and we are ready for some food. We all unload and most of the people on the boat leave to go back to there hotels. We have a private lunch under a palapa on the beach. The lobster and steak was wonderful and the wine was a nice touch to our great day. We now have about 45 minutes to relax in the shade before our next adventure. Now its time for parasailing on the power boat. The diesel powered boat was smooth and splash free. They put the harness on us and up we went. 400 feet above the reef was breath taking, completely quiet and romantic. It was a fun filled day with a great crew. Have fun :)"

We had three small children in our group and they were great at helping with the kids, getting the correct masks, life vests and fins. even let the youngest hold onto a life ring the entire time. Awesome horseback riding guides. Horses were great. One of the guides took the youngest in front of him on the horse. Nice two hour ride thru the mangroves, saw some nice wildlife. Got to ride a trail along the beach as well.Cons: Tour was booked thru the hotel as a free excursion to the time share owners. Snorkel was free and we paid extra to ride. The bus to pick us up from the hotel was 45 minutes late. Talked to others on the bus, and it was late for all of them. Got to the beach and were rushed onto the boat since we were so late. Didnt have much time after the snorkel trip before we were headed out to ride. Only had about 20 minutes. Went to the bathroom, only to find out that the water was not working. No running water when we got there. Riding started at 12 noon which was also the time they were going to start serving lunch. Lunch was suppossed to be included. Headed out for riding. I recommend grabbing a bottle of water before heading out on any excursion since we were not provided with any. After the ride was over, our guides had a hard time getting us transportation back from the stables, they finally had to chase down one of the vans. Once we returned to the beach, we were only going to have a few minutes before having to leave again. At this point we complained and were informed by a manager that we could stay longer, they would provide us with private transporation back to the hotel, since the bus we came in on would be leaving. After a while, we finally got some lunch, service was terrible. After lunch we then find out that they held up the entire bus and had people waiting over an hour. Finally the bus arrives to bus everyone back, with no AC and only two windows to open. Overall the place is beautiful, the tours were great, but the management and organization is terrible."

The entree was 94 pesos and the beers were around 30 pesos, totaling around 124 pesos. When we were finally able to pay (waited forever) the waiter gave us am amount in pesos verbally. They had computer systems, so why didn't we get a check? We asked in USD. He told us $30. I don't think so! We started converting the money between us as he stood there (which was rare) and he kept interrupting us with questions like where we were from, for how long, etc. to get us not to pay attention to what we were figuring. I'm not sure why but we ended up just paying him. I doubt he even rang in the beers at all. Our tab should have been around $18 or $19 USD. He obviously gave himself a very generous tip. We did not leave him a tip since we knew he had scammed us. Next time we will definitely go back to the puerto morelos snorkeling that we did the year prior. At least we weren't ripped of there."

A part of the trip was a chance to ride in the spinnaker, which is like parasailing but a little different. Sadly, the wind was too strong to use the spinnaker, so if you are interested in trying it, check the weather forecasts first. Since we were not able to use it, we got more time to snorkel. I do have to say though, if you do go snorkeling, please make sure that you are aware of other people around you. I had so many kids and adults just swimming as they please that they would run right into other people. I had my mask accidentally pulled off my face by someone a couple of times. That was the only big downside to the trip. Besides that, it was a fun afternoon of swimming around the second biggest coral reef in the world."

The Ocean Safari excursion is a waverunner / snorkeling excursion. After an extensive talk from William, our guide, about safety, we proceeded into the water on the waverunners. FIVE MINTUES into the excursion, William - our GUIDE - ran into our waverunner, seriously injuring my wife's right leg. She was taken in to the beach to be checked and eventually taken to the \"hospital\" in Playa del Carmen. A few X-rays, some medication, and an hour trip back to the resort and my wife's trip was OVER. She could do little else for the remaining three and a half days. She is currently undergoing physical therapy back in the US to avoid blood clots and calcification of the blood in her thigh. It is a miracle she did not break her leg. It seemed that the people helping us the day of the accident (Cicilia and ??) were genuinely shaken by it and sorry it happened. For their part, Marina Maroma paid our medical bills in Mexico, gave us a refund on the excursion and some additional money (in PESOS) to cover \"additional costs.\" The \"extra money\" was pretty much gone with the first visit to the Ortho doc, the PT folks, and her US prescriptions. However, they did not seem to recognize that their own guide's negligence ruined half of our trip. To make matters worse, today I found out that they wouldn't even give us our group's photos! At this point, I would strongly advise AGAINST excursions at Marina Maroma."

Each place is different, and I really appreciated the experience in Cancun at Marina Maroma.Pickup from Iberostar Paraiso Beach was ontime, and a very short trip to the Marina. Quick process to get us on board and were underway 15 minutes early. Had a short cruise, saw our hotel from the water, then back to the dive spot (35 mins).First dive was almost 55 minutes, water was around 15 feet, saw a lot of fish and some nice varieties. My son's first dive, he was a bit overwhelmed by all the fish, but quickly settled in. Coral is average, not as colourful as Great Barrier. Guide's fed the fish, to keep us in the middle of the action. Second dive was around 35 minutes, much shallower, and closer to the fish and coral, but current was stronger so was pretty tired afterwards. It was hard work for some of the newer divers I saw. Then got the chance to get flown from a swing hanging off the spinnaker. They warned us this was for strong swimmers only, and some were not strong enough, current is strong, you cannot use snorkel and flippers, so be aware. I loved it, great fun !!No alcohol or food on board, but heaps of soda/water for everyones needs.Only downsides ... there's a lot of sun out there, and not much shade, wear and reapply suntan lotion, we both got pretty burnt. The tour was actually more than hour longer than we expected, and that was great, but did mess up our plans to get back to the hotel at the originally planned time. We would have been back at around 2:30, not the original 12:45 we were told.$55 all inclusive with transfers, drinks, and corn chips afterwards. Not cheap, but easy, and everything they promised."

You will definitely not experience that with Maroma Paradise, they are professional, very affordable and do it all with a smile. They picked us up beach side on the beach and then we sailed out into the middle of the ocean, a nice ride out, taking pictures the whole way, then they secure you in a holster kimd of like if you were rock climbing and me and my husband went up, up, up, up and away, we went so high, I don't think I've ever been that high in the sky and I LOVE HEIGHTS! And the trip wasn't cut short either, it seemed like we were up there for an hour, taking in all the scenery, on our way back down, they dipped us in the water, still taking pictures of every moment.

Not only did they remember us but they treated us even better than the first time. We only had one other couple join us on the jet skiing tour this time around and they were a lil scared to go fast so the other tour guide took my boyfriend and I on our own tour alone and showed us some great tricks and went rely fast and caught some serious air. It was amazing and they even kept us out longer than we expected. I would recommend this place to any and everyone! We will be returning for the same tours and to try some of the many other tours they offer! Thanks again for showing a great time! Money well spent and the prices are great too. We booked with best day and paid 95 bux per person for 45 mins of atv and 30 mins of jet skiing. That was the price for each of us to have our own machine it is cheaper if u double up on the atv and jet ski. Plus you get soft drinks water and chips and dip included in that price.

They have improved this excursion since we were there 5 years ago. Very professional staff, organized, and quite an extreme adventure. Our group of 5 all enjoyed it. Pick up and drop off at your resort is included. Soft drinks, water, salsa, chips and beans for a snack are included, but we did order lunch at the restaurant. It was excellent, the waiter was so gracious, food was traditional Mexican and very good. We bought pictures, very reasonalbe, 4 for $30, good quality also. Lovely, clean beach. No complaints at all from us!"

We went on March 1st with our two kids aged 12 and 8 to Marina Maroma for a half day activity planned with and ATV and Waverunner tour booked through Cancun Discounts. Transportation was included. The activities were well organized. The equipment was in good condition and even if I never rode an ATV nor a jetski before on my own, I felt comfortable enough to do the 45 minute ride for each activity. The guides were helpful. The beach was simply breathtaking. The only downside for this activity was that the staff, including the driver of the bus which brought to the site, was constantly reminding us to tip them (before and after each activity)."

The tour consists of two 45 minute stops for snorkelling in the most amazing turquoise waters you will ever see. It is stunningly beautiful with many varieties of fish and sea life that are not afraid to swim alongside you for the ride. A crew member accompanies you in the water to ensure that you do not miss anything amongst the coral. You will not want to leave the water as there is so much to see. The staff are know their stuff and the equipment is well maintained and very safe.There are plenty of free soft drinks available onboard.Once you have sailed back to shore you are taken to a restaurant overlooking the water and offered free soft drinks and beers, nachos and dips. Then to top it all you are entertained at your table by a mariachi band (which was a nice surprise).This trip lasts for a full afternoon with local pick-up and drop-off from your hotel. I felt that the trip was excellent value for money at only $55 USD as the crew make every attempt to ensure that your trip is very special. A special thankyou to Albert, Nacho and Captain Jack for making this a trip to remember.One thing that is available (for free) at the end of the snorkelling, before you return to shore, is a ride on a spinnaker sail (kind of like a parasail but only using natural wind to pull you along). However, we were not able to do it because the day was so calm and beautiful that we had barely enough wind to sail the boat to the reef.Would highly recommend this trip."

We had the best time ever! We have done this in other countries but Cancun had the best routes and guides imagineable. During the ATV ride, we got to drive through a jungle and see croccodiles and go through tiny spaces that only an ATV can go. We got muddy because it had rained the night before but we did not care because going thorough the water made it alot more fun. After the ATV, we went jet skiing. We were fortunate enough to be the only two people with the guide so we got the personal tour. He taught us some manevours and the guide allowed my husband to show off with him. It was a lot of fun. My jetskii could not keep up not matter how much I pressed the trottle. After the activities, we were able to have lunch in their restuarant. We ordered the Mexican plate that is for 2 people and it included beef and chicken fajitias, tostados and taquillos (sp), It was delicious! To do both the ATV and the Jet ski was $100 per person because we had seperate vehicles. However it is still cheaper than getting it from a cruise company, they will charge you double! Go check them out! It will be worth the visit."

The staff and guides were very friendly and informative. The first half of the ATV trip was a lot of fun, but the second half was unbelieveable! We went theough banked turns in the sand dunes and trees at a pretty fast speed. My wife was on the back, and was having so much fun, I didn't think she would ever quit laughing. The speedboats were great and my wife was the driver on this one. Needless to say, they go fast enough that you are completely airborne several times, but yet feel safe enough to do it. The guide was great and kept us all in a line. These little boats sometimes slam down pretty hard, so if you are expecting a smooth casual boat ride, this may not be for you. After we finished, we had complimentary drinks and chips in the restaurant. There was a Mariachi band playing in the restaurant and we had the pleasure of doing the Mexican version of the \"Chicken Dance\". We had a really fun day, and I would highly recommend this."

We booked this half day snorkeling trip through the Funjet tour desk at our hotel and were looking for an alternative to Xel-Ha which we had been to twice before. The catamaran cruises that operate out of the Maroma Marina offer two 45 minute snorkeling stops as well as some time sailing and a fun finish on the spinnaker sail. More on that later. When you first arrive at Maroma Marina, it is a little underwhelming, as there seems to be some major construction going on at the resort and there are several different activities taking place out of the same area. Don't let the lack of curb appeal fool you though, the fun is out on the water, not at the entrance.We were fortunate to have a beautiful and calm day for snorkeling so conditions were perfect. The captain (Pepe) and his crew were outstanding and even stopped the boat to retrieve our son's dive mask and snorkel when it fell overboard. Pepe and crew to the rescue! As one other reviewer noted, this is not a booze cruise so if you're looking to get wasted at sea, this is not the cruise for you. Sodas and water are the only refreshments on the boat.The snorkeling was very good and we got to see a lot of great fish and coral reef areas. Pepe and his #2, Nacho, lead the 2 snorkeling excursions and at the end of the trip, they also offer a chance to ride the spinnaker sail. In the interest of brevity, it's sort of a like a swing attached to a sail at the back of the boat, and you finish your ride by jumping off into the ocean. Totally fun and definitely find the courage to go for a ride. If you're looking for a leisurely day on a great boat with some fun snorkeling and some excitement on the spinnaker thrown in for fun, try this tour out."

We paid a bit under $100 usd for the atv and jet ski excursion. It was well worth the and we had so much fun! Everyone was so friendly and the instructions that were given were simple and easy. No experience is needed. We never had a problem with language barriers as everyone spoke very good English here. The tour started with an atv excursion through parks and jungles, some good scenery there. The only misfortune was that this other couple's atv started smoking up almost at the end of the excursion. Next, we jet-skied which was major fun! The tour then ends with free soft drinks and a lunch tortilla chips. We even had these two gentlemen singing to us a mexican song at our table, a nice touch. You get the chance to buy a cd of about 100 photos for $45 usd, which accounts to less than 50 cents per photo. This is a good price to me since I've seen other places charge much more money for one or two pictures. I've never felt pushed or obligated to buy it, I bought it because it was memories at a good price.Overall, I had so much fun with these guys and would definitely recommend them!"

Most of the facility is nice - beautiful beach, a bar, restaurant, bathrooms, etc. Other portions are being rebuilt after a fire from blown fireworks. We were told that the horseback riding tour was on the beach. They explained to us that the horses couldn't go into the water for ecological reasons, which made sense to me, but that we would still ride on the beach. We rode on sand for no more than 5 minutes of the tour. We could see the ocean for no more than 10 minutes. The ride from where we started was at least 45 minutes up a man made path surrounded by shrubbery. We took the same 45 minute route back to the \"stables.\" The description of the tour should be more accurate to indicate the true landscape of the ride.If you decide to go on this tour, bring a sweatshirt to sit on. The \"saddles\" are really saddles at all. They're rock hard and very uncomfortable. So uncomfortable that my mother had to get off halfway through and was left with bruises for the remainder of the trip.The guides were nice though they didn't say a lot. The horses were gentle. I would recommend other activities at this site."

The crew of the boat were extremely friendly and helpful in teaching us how to reel in a big one! We caught a Wahoo (63 in), a Sailfish (86 in), 2 red snapper, and one other fish we don't remember what the name was. Cost was $120 plus what we tipped the crew on the boat and had to pay $5/person for transportation.

We booked our trip on the beach at El Dorado Royale for a same day excursion. Amazing jungle and beach runs on our own ATV's and Wave Runners. First you rip through trails in the mangroves and various pools - one had a crocodile out of the water and 5 ft away from us as we rode by - on an ATV. Very cool. After the jungle we took trails along the beach in the sand for plenty of photo opps. We then moved on to Wave Runners. The guide took us out to the open water and let us rip! These machines are always so much fun! After much racing with the wife at full throtle we followed the guide back via a slalom course for more photo opps! Once back at the clubhouse we had snacks and drinks while waiting for our bus back to the El Dorado Royale which was a 20-min ride each way. Service and experience was great! All the guides and staff were very nice and fun. They really want you to have a great time.Tips:Bug Spray - Bring bug spray if you go into the jungle for an excursion. You will get bitten.Buy the photos - They take lots of action shots and the photos are good. Well worth the money for the memories.Ride Solo - Some couples were sharing a machine for a \"nice\" bonding experience. My wife and I each had our own. If your spouse/partner is in the habit of \"commenting on your driving skills\" or if that is your role in the relationship you can save yourself much grief and have more fun by just getting your own damn ride. It really is worth it and you won't get blamed if she \"gets thrown\" on a tight turn in the water. Clearly, I speak from past experience. Lesson learned."

We met the driver at the PlayaCar shopping center, a few minutes walk from our hotel. The van was ok, it had good A/C and it wasn't full. The drive to Maroma took about 30-35 mins. As soon as we got off the van, we were herded towards an area where we had to pay a reef tax then we walked to an area where we were divided according to the activities we signed up for. We did the ATV and Jet Ski tour. The ATV tour through the \"jungle\" was just ok. I've never been on an ATV and this was a fairly decent jaunt in the Cancun forest. Of course, the photographers were there taking pictures and our guide allowed us to stop once to help each of us get a picture - for free. After about 25 minutes, we passed the horseback riders and I could not help but think that the horseback riding looked super boring. I mean we had to stay in one long line but at least the guide would go fast here and there. Just when we thought we were done, he took us to an area closer to the beach where there was a lot of sand and we went even faster - this was the exciting part of the ATV tour - I had a great time here. We also had to wear helmets which I was ok with. The jetskiing tour was next, again, the photographers were in the water with us and the guide asked that we stay in a single file - good for beginners but not for hotdoggers. We were having a great time and then we suddenly realized, that we were starting to jump through some good sized waves. Finally we caught a big enough wave that caused us to flip and dumped both of us in the water - we were riding double. I'm not a particularly strong swimmer but the tour guide came back, assisted me out of the water into his jetski and then assisted my partner back on our jetski then he assisted me in getting back to our jetski so we can ride double again. During this process, we lost my partners' prescription sunglasses, again completely our fault for not using something to prevent it from getting lost. It was a pretty scary ride for us both on the way back to where we started since she couldn't see but we made it. Kudos to the tour guide for helping us both after we spilled. Of course, tips were appreciated and they did ask for it which in this case, we were ok in providing. Facilities were ok, changing rooms and flush toilets. The best part was the scheduling, we were picked up on time and dropped off on time back to our hotel. We didnt have to wait very long at all and the driver we had on the way back to our hotel was much more talkative than the driver we had going to Maroma which we liked a lot."

I ended up at the emergency room having it checked out.The doctor asked me if I had been on any tour boat, and what the seat material was made of... that was his first question after examining me, so I am assuming that they see this sort of occurrence on a common basis, but they do not want to scare tourist off by telling you, that the rash is caught on these boats... But it all makes sense, I never saw them sanitizing any of the equipment before or after you use it....Anyways, the beach is heavenly, and the service is friendly and welcome. Definitely a place to visit in your lifetime... One of those places that you need to visit and cross out in your bucket list."

The day started out at 7 am at our resort the Grande Bahia Akumal when they picked us up to bring us to the marina. We got to the marina and got all checked in and were ready to go. I think we left about 15-20 mins late but not a big deal at all. Our 3 mexican friends were a great deal of help on the boat. They served us beer and got the bait fish caught so we could get the bigger fish. The waves were probably 15-20 feet that day so as we got past the reef it was quite an experience. We ended up catching a large Tuna and a sailfish which the captain was nice enough to manhandle into the boat so we could get our pictures with the fish. Overall I felt the experience to be very positive. The worst part of the trip was the beer, it was NOT good at all, but honestly, it was 9 in the morning... we only had a few on the boat!! When we got back to the dock, the manager was there to greet us and asked us how the trip was and asked if there were any suggestions as to what could have been better. This is the best fishing trip I've been on in a tropical location and I would highly suggest it. As some other reviews say, be careful about getting them to mount the fish and send it to you. This is very expensive and in the heat of the moment you may figure you want to pay the money. Other than that, a great trip!!!!"

They said yes,finally they rigged two rods for bottom fishing which i thought all five should have been rigged but soon had a fish on it was a 45 pound amber jack they gave me a belt and away i went reeling in this fish while being told trophy, trophy , after landing it all they kept saying was are you going to mount it for a trophy? after about another hour watched the two fish bottom without any words being said again,finally they pulled up and we moved to another spot, they set up two rods with large plugs and bait on the end again i thought they should have rrigged all five , after about 20 mins the fun started bang a large fish took the bait, again the crew were yelling trophy trophy who wants it? finally the belt was strapped to one of the men who were on the trip and he pulled in a 91 inch sailfish, he had to make a decision before they would bring it in the boat trophy trophy do you want to mount it? finally he said yes, so all were happy, there was a big sailfish sitting in our boat, pretty exciting i must admit ,so after this was done the crew asks me if i want to try for a trophy mount? so being leary i asked him how much american dollars it would be for that 91 inch mount he proceeded to say 1,000 american dollars for a mount that big, which i thought was pretty decent so i said yes for sure, now all of a sudden 5 lines were in the water, and in 15 minutes we had two other sailfish were on the line and even a third one that got away, was absolutely amazing having two of us at the same time and even three for a short time fighting 91 inch sailfish after landing his first they kept asking keep for trophy, keep for trophy? he said no so they quickly released it , then focused on my fish which was quite the thrill i must admit so when it was up to the boat they asked trophy,trophy? i said 1,000 american dollars including shipping right? they said yes yes , right away i said yes keep it,well our time was up so we headed in 3 sailfish 1 released and one large amberjack, so we get back and the crew proceeds to show me a mounting fee of 1428.00 for a 91 inch fish, hmmmm where did the other 428.00 come from so i asked him if this was for shipping and handling to canada he proceeds to tell me yes all the while telling me to sign, which i thought 1428.00 wasnt a crazy amount so i signed, so he wants 750.00 roughly half for a down deposit, which i did not have on me, so he had the captain travel to my hotel for me to pay for the deposit which wasnt a big deal, so i gave him 200.00 for the deposit in cash and not a credit card and got the receipt which was all agreed upon,until i read the receipt when i got to canada 1428.00 does not include the shipping and crating fee? what a bunch of crap. So nowi am in the process of trying to cancel and get my two hundred back, good luck on that one, one heck of a fishing experience turned sour from poor guides trying to make a buck, P.S while taking pictures with my camera there were lots of people around watching us and of course i had my room key and ten bucks stolen from my camera bag while being distracted .So beware luckily my wife told me not to bring my credit cards or a large amount of money which would have been gone. I hope the managers of these people get my money back for me and teach these guides to guide for the experience of the customer and not for the amount of money they can get off of you!!!!! totally unproffesional ,i expect a response or an email and my money back."

We went on the ATV's in the morning to allow the day to warm up a little more before going on the catamaran/snorkel tour. Both of the tours were great. There are many other attractions here and would recommend the Marina Maroma Paradise Tours to anyone that wants to spend a full day or half day of fun. Just make sure you get all the details from the tour company you choose before setting out. We used Lomas tours located right at our resort and were somewhat disappointed. Ask alot of questions to be sure of what the tour(s) includes."

The bus arrived on time and when we arrived we were greeted by our hosts. We embarked on our 5 hour adventure with Baloo as the Captain along with his crew Chilly and Willy. We began to catch our bait for the day and away we went into the sea. Not too long after we had our first hit. Reeling those babies in was certainly a workout. Those of us that did fish were sucessful in catching 12 Amberjack and one Grouper. Amberjack are not a recommended fish as the larger they get the more prone they are to parasites. At the end of the day, those fish were delivered to local families. A great trip, lots of excitement, and found it amusing that all the other vessels were following us, however without the same success factor.Great trip, Thanks Baloo, Chilly and Willy."

Our guests are still talking about it! It was a short Bus ride from our resort. We were greeted with a brief orientation and a blue cocktail! Yummy!From there, to our surprise, our wedding group was escorted to our private catamaran and crew. After a few pictures with a pirate, we boarded to lively music to get the party started!We sailed for about 30mn and enjoyed beer, soda & water. Then we snorkeled at two different reef locations for about 45mn each. The water was beautiful and we saw many fish! Some guests saw a turtle, squid, sting ray, & an eel. One crew member brought a large starfish on board for us to see and touch. You do not have to be a strong swimmer to enjoy this excursion. Life jackets are provided. The crew makes sure you have a good time. If you are lucky and the winds are good, you can have a ride on the spinnaker! So much fun!! After our sail & more pictures, we headed back for chips, beans, and salsa at the outdoor marina restaurant. The facilities are very good, clean, & outside under palm trees. Overall, our trip lasted 5 hours and was excellent!"

It was just it, snorkeling. They picked us up at near by hotel, we arrived at Maroma Beach waited for remaining people that were going to go in tour. We stopped at two areas where we snorkeled about 45 minutes in each area. We saw A LOT of fishes, starfish and eel. Fishes swam I sometimes would feel them rub on me. It was a great snorkleing trip. We didn't expect much either. Just make sure you eat before you go since it's a lot of swimming and no snacks are included. Tourguide was great. Informative and he even added Spinnaker! Which was scary awesome! Not sure how much they charge for this tour in average. But it's a basic snorkeling tour with a lot of life. They have showers you can use after the tour so you can go prepared to change."

Today we went deep sea fishing just a few minutes by van from the Grand Mayan Riviera Maya in Playa del Carmen where we stayed. Now I've been on several Carribean deep sea fishing tours in my time and this one was by far the best in many ways. We fished with a couple of really nice guys from Canada. First, the boat was very clean everywhere, and sea-worthy, unlike some others I reserved in advance before. Secondly, the crew of two for 3-1/2 fisherman (my wife didn't last too long before getting sea sick) was very knowledgeable about every aspect of the trip. They were simply outstanding, and very friendly which helps to make the trip even more pleasurable than just being with people you know. And thirdly, we caught some fish! Bonita, tuna, several 20 - 25 lb. barracudas, AND a 90lb. sailfish! THAT was exciting. We took the 4 hour trip which was plenty of time to fish, and leave enough time for the rest of the day for relaxing by the pool talking \"fish tales\", only slightly further exaggerated of course :o) !"

Tour- Check in was easy and efficent. We rented BCDs and Weights which were included in the tour price and were in good working order. We went out with a group of 3 other divers(5 total). Our dive Master was Fidel, he spoke very good english and gave us an excellent predive breifing including reviewing hand signals and basic safety procedures. We went on 2 very nice dives appropriate for the level of divers in our group. We saw a good variety of marine life including turtles, rays, eels and lots of fish.

I was very disappointed that they didn't advise us and allow us to reschedule. The weather was cloudy with black skies. A storm was brewing off the coast. I did ask at one point, while still on the boat on the way out if it was going to be a good day for snorkeling and was dismissed. Once we arrived at our snorkel destination, the winds were so high, the water was nearly whitecapping. The current was so strong pushing you toward the coast line, it was all you could do to be able to swim away from the boat. If you wanted to come up and rest you still had to keep your mask on and snorkel in your mouth because the waves were so high they would go over your head. It was a miserable experience. There are two different snorkeling sites, I was so exhausted by the time we go to the second, I didn't even get off the boat. There were only 3 that did, everyone else stayed on. I am scuba certified and have snorkeled many times, this by far was the worse. I WILL say, if the weather was better I think it would have been good. While I understand weather is not the fault of the company, I think they should have advised of what was to come and allowed us the opportunity to reschedule."

Let me start off by saying I absolutely HATE writing negative things but hd I been forwarned about what a waste of a day this was with a review I may have taken heed. That being said we went on a trip to the Riu Palace last February and I'm just getting around to writing the reviews now. We have been on many catamaran day sail snorkel trips so had thoughts as to what to expect. This never even came close.First off let me say we were grossly mislead by the guy at the Riu Palace that hawked the trip. We were a large group traveling together on a trip that was a gift from my husband's boss. Very nice. One of the guys in our group spoke with the tour people at the Riu and set this up. He was told that the marina was about a 30 minute bus ride from the hotel. FALSE. It was a long miserable hour. We were also told that there would be drinks and snacks onboard. False again. There was water and soda but nothing else. The boat literally went around in a circle for a couple of hours in front of the marina to some less than average snorkeling spots. Honestly my husband and I kept waiting for it to end.We were told we would get drinks and snacks at the end back at the restaurant. We got a plate of refried beans and I can't remember the drink. One of the guys in our group ordered some drink tht he had to pay for. We honestly thought that was a ploy to get us to stay and pay to eat and drink.The worst part of all of it was we were ready to go and there must have been at least 30 people waiting for transportation back to their respective hotels and we waited and waited and every now and again a bus or taxi would come by and people would flock in droves trying to get on leaving those left behind frustrated and angry.We got back and were so ticked off that we had completely wasted a day in such a beautiful place. We woud have been much happier hd we just stayed by the pool.Bottom line, been on WAY better snorkel/catamaran trips. Don't waste your time or money here."

The water and coral were both great, but we were herded around like cattle and it was a little disappointing when I was there for relaxation.This excursion was wayyy better than I expected. Pepe not only put us on some great reefs, but he's a great guy and his personality and willingness to make sure everyone was satisfied with the dives and kept in festive spirit really made the trip. He was very knowledgeble of the reefs, always there to point out the hot spots, and though I may sound repetitive, he seemed to really want people to enjoy themselves. Well, it worked.The water and the coral reefs were also incredible. Though I'm far from an expert, I have snorkeled the Bahamas and Cozumel as well, and this was my favorite. We did a shallow dive first (6-10 ft) then a little deeper dive (10-20 ft), both were excellent with a large variety of fish and coral.The next time my wife and I go down there, we will definitely take this excursion again!Hasta luego Pepe!"

The catamaran was a nice size and we all sat at the front of it, as the people on the boat catered to us with drinks. We headed north along the coast for about half an hour and then headed back. Again, they took lots of romantic pictures of us. This part of the excursion was more relaxing - people were mingling and it was quite a peaceful ride.We returned to the marina and dinner table were set up. We were seated at our own private table, lit by a torch in the sand, on the ocean front. The dinner was phenominal. My fiance had steak and lobster, I had the chicken. Both our meals were outstanding. There was wine included in the meal, as well as a saxaphone player who came to each table. Couples got up and danced...and it was just simply romantic! And, of course, they took lots of pictures.Pictures were available for purchase for $30. We bought them, although you actually only see one of the 30 pictures they took! The pictures were ok - there is some really nice ones in there that made it worth the money.I would recommend this adventure not only for a wonderfully romantic getaway - but also for the most amazing food and service!"

This is a review of the Horse back riding tour offered by the Marina Maroma Paradise toursOur first experience with this tour operator was their poor customer service during pick up. We were supposed to be picked up in the afternoon. A van from this place arrived and we assumed it was our ride. It was from the same company and going to the same place as we. However, the driver explained that he was not there to pick us up. Just to pick a different tour. So he left. We had to get the bell boy to call a different van.It arrived a few minutes later. The driver was the worse driver I encountered during my stay in Playa. A little training on how to deal with tourist would have helped a lot.Then we arrived at their welcome center. We were promptly escorted to the side of the building, right next to a construction site. There were a few cowboys waiting for us. It was close to 105F or at least it felt that way. The horses were in a makeshift barn covered by a thin roof. Their saddles were made of home made products, which were put on top of a piece of foam. I think with the money they collect they surely can afford a decent stable and real saddles.Some of the horses had cuts in their feet. I felt really bad for them to the point were I wanted to cancel the tour. My son had been wanting to do this for a while, so i didn't.We rode 200 feet along side of the beach, but we had been told that we would ride on the beach. Once there they told us it was not possible.The cowboys were excellent. I was worried about my son and wife since they have no experience riding horses, but upon request they gave them horses that were easy to ride. They kept an eye on them the whole time. They were great.We continued on a construction road. We passed the construction site for their new hotel, literally going over construction rubble and sand. We were lucky the horses did not get injured. As we continued on our trip on this road, a couple of times we encountered construction trucks that were using the same road. Just so that you get an idea, the road was barely big enough for a single car. Much less for trucks and horses. In summary, the tours are expensive, dangerous, they really do not take care of their animals and on top of it all, most of it is on a construction road which you share with construction worker and truck. In short, a disaster. One is left to wonder why people in the hotels would risk ruining their reputations pushing these tours ($$$?). As the name implies, they have created a marina, which in my opinion destroyed what once was the \"best beach in the world\". A marina so that people can come to see the beach which they destroyed.They offer many other tours one of those diving and snorkeling tours. I would be so hesitant to go diving with them, as if they keep their diving equipment as badly as they keep the horses, it can go from inconvenient to extremely dangerous."

Everyone was very nice there. My only complaint is that we bought a CD of our sail with video and still photos. We paid $30 for it and only got a partial video. I recommend viewing your CD before leaving. I hope it was an honest mistake. I have emailed them. We will see if they make good on either sending photos or a refund."

The ATV we did in the rain which made it more fun. The beginning part is a bit mundane, but it ends with a fun track. It was a bit disappointing on the speed boat when we went to take off and the boat would only go about 5 mph. They took us back to shore and the guide took us to talk to the manager since the tour had left without us. The manager let us go out on the next tour. The next tour was with a bunch of drunk guys on a bachelor trip. We went out on the water for about 15 of 45 minutes and they made us turn around and go back because the drunk guys were driving out of line and all over the place. The guide that helped us the first time told just me and my brother to stay in the boat and he came over and apologized and said he was going to take us out on our own personal tour. He ended up taking us out for about an additional 45 minutes (which he did not have to do). It was an awesome time and actually ended up being my favorite thing I did my entire stay in Mexico."

The ATV part was fun but you don't go off on your own at all. The speedboats were really fun and you do a lot of wake jumping, I wish we could have stayed an extra hour or two at the beach since it looked so nice but they had to take us back. It was a major pain to get the unlimited free water and drinks. They want you to sit down so the waiter can bring them to you and get a tip. Everyone her during the three or four hous wanted a tip-the driver there, the ATV guys, the speed boat guys, the waiter who brings you the free drinks and the second driver who drives you home. I would go there again however. I think next time I will do the jet ski/snorkel tour."

            "review": "Tourist Trap -- Avoid. Booked a snorkelling/jetski combo through travel agency that we booked our all-inclusive. Offered a good price of $65 USD per person, but we were highly disappointed. Plan to lose a whole day of your vacation to get there and back [we were in Cancun, took about 45 minutes to get there by bus, then another 40 minutes for the group to assemble]. The jet-skiing sucked. I've rode jet-skis my whole life, and have never seen anything as boring as this. Everyone had to drive in a single-file line. No freestyling, no waves, nothing. I almost felt like a 3 year-old on one of those guided choo-choo miniature trains through a city park. Totally boring. The snorkelling was half-decent, and many species of fish are present on the healthy reef. However, the water is at most at a depth of 8-10 feet, and there's not much to do if you're a half-experienced snorkeler or scuba diver. Pretty much this tour caters to older couples or really young children who have never done neither activity in their lives. Finally, the worst part is that the staff, while genuinely nice during the trip, did not waste any moments to shove down your throat the notion that they should be tipped. Yes, I get it. You depend on the tips for added income, and I can't shun you for that. But let ME decide whether I though the service was exceptional. By making it so loud that you expect a tip, you almost bully me into feeling like a cheapskate if I don't. Furthermore, even after the whole tipping spiel, we had to wait an hour and a half for the \"next\" busride out. That sucks. The Maroma staff know everyone's at all-inclusives. Why in God's name would I spend ANY money at your restaurant or bar, when I've got that provided for back at my home resort? They obviously know this, and clearly stagger the bus schedule to try and get you to spend money at their local vendors. Finally, to cap it all off, the obnoxiousness extended to the final speech before we got on the bus about how we should go and review them and how amazing they are. Here. I've reviewed you on Trip Advisor. :)"

            "review": "So Glad We Booked This Excursion.... We booked this Sunset Cruise and dinner on the beach excursion from our hotel (Secrets Capri), I believe it was through American Express Tours. Van picked us up on time, and we rode with another older couple, (well, older than us). After about a 15 minute ride, we arrived to flowing champaign and live Mariachis. We waited about 15 minutes to board the catamaran and within minutes were floating away from the dock with a pretty full load of about 20 people. The captain came to the front of the boat and began his presentation about the area, the other crew members, and the fact that tips are appreciated. While sitting on the deck of the boat, our drink orders were taken, and a few short minutes later, we had our drinks in hand and were about to round the point, and enjoy the beautiful view of Maroma. New resorts all along the shoreline, and although we didn't get very near them, we could see just how nice these places were.  The water was absolutely flat as glass and clear enough to see the bottom. Everyone was partying and having a great time, except the nice lady that rode in the van with us. She was so nervous and even though you could barely tell the boat was moving, she asked for a lifejacket. Once she had one next to her, she began to loosen up, and started drinking. More on her later.  About an hour or so of drinks and cruising, and we were back on the beach for dinner. We were taken to our private makeshift cabana; nothing more than a sheet on three sides, wrapped around some poles. Effective for privacy. Tiki torches at each cabana. very romantic. A well dressed man was walking up and down the beach in front of the cabanas playing his clarinet to recorded music. We called him Mexican Kenny G. He was actually quite good. A nice touch. Someone came by and offered us some bug repelent, which we gladly accepted. I'll never understand the complaints on TA about mosquitos and other bugs in Mexico's resorts. We're in the freakin' JUNGLE!! Anyway, about the meal.... AWESOME!  Service was excellent. Every course perfectly timed. We were not rushed, nor did we wait for anything. We were treated like royalty. First course: The salad was the biggest shrimp (prawn) I had ever seen (whiskers about 5\" long), wrapped in a small crunchy tortilla, with pico de gallo, and sweet whipped cream. Incredible! I had to take a picture. Now about the lady; she got sick before they could have eaten their salad, and we watched her husband lead her to the bathrooms. They did not return until after dessert had been served. Quite an expensive meal to pay for, then miss out on. On the ride back, she moaned and groaned at every bump in the road. Felt bad for her, but we joked about it between ourselves a few times. Drinks: We drank enough alcohol on the boat, so can't comment on the dinner drinks. Iced tea was fine. Second course: The best sweet corn chowder ever. Not picture worthy, but memorable just the same. Main course: I had the Surf & Turf, and my wife had the lobster. They brought me a thick, delicious filet accompanied by a nice size lobster, both perfectly prepared. The wife's lobster was huge. Both dinners came with I think it was a bed of creamed spinach, and mashed potatoes. My wife couldn't eat all her lobster, and I was getting full after polishing off the lobster and just starting on my steak, so I was faced with a delima. Do we leave steak behind, or lobster? Well, lobster is my favorite, so the steak lost that battle.  Dessert: I have no clue about dessert. We were both so stuffed, and we did not have it brought to our table.  Everything about this trip was great! I would recommend the cruise and dinner for adults. The beach is very wide, and although the resort part looks to still be under development, it is still a peaceful paradise. Sand and palm trees... it doesn't get much better. Cost: $200.00 US plus tips."

We went on some deep waving part to the point that we were airborne doing 4-5 ft jumps in the waves it was amazing and most of all fun.The ATV's were great. First was through the Jungle and then through very tight narrow dune trails. Easy to ride even with 2 peopleI don't know why people complain it is great. the people that complain are the ones that already have a bad day or in a bad mood. It's what you make of it. The ATV we were speeding most the time in straight a ways as fast it would go and trust me it was fast. I have to agree with the Coconuts must have. $2 national Park fee and Pictures are $30 but they are worth it. The only downside was waiting to get picked up which is understandable and not a big deal. They do that to give people time and not rush."

Our goal was to do a few excursions that would be fun, but would not take up an entire day. We left our hotel at 8:40am, drove maybe 20 minutes to get to Maroma. In a matter of 30 minutes we were in the resort and on a boat getting ready to snorkel. The staff was extremely friendly and funny! The leader of our tour was Pepe--ask for him if you can! He was very clear with his instructions, so even beginners felt comfortable snorkeling! He took us to a beautiful reef where we saw tropical fish, a sea turtle, a baracuda, and a sting ray. He made us laugh a lot too! The equipment was sturdy, safe, and clean. Before we came back to shore, Pepe and the crew invited us to swing on a spinacker. I was not brave enough to do it, but my friends were and they loved it! After our trip we were invited back to the restaurant where we could enjoy complimentary chips and salsa. It was a great day, and we were back at our hotel by 2:30pm. I felt like we accomplished a lot, had fun, and were still able to enjoy our hotel pool! What had the greatest impression on me was the pride the crew took in what they do. Pepe sincerely wanted us to have a good time, and to enjoy Mexico. It was obvious he and his friends were proud of what his country had to offer! I can totally understand why!"

It advertised a Cancun tour through the jungle and along the beautiful Caribbean on an ATV for 45 minutes followed by a 45 minute ride on Jet ski\"s. First of all they picked us up at our hotel and proceeded on a 1hr trip to the resort. We thought the tour was in Cancun and were the only one's in the van so we got concerned and started asking questions after the first 20 minutes. We know a little spanish but the driver acted like he couldn't understand us and just kept driving. It took an hour to get there. Ok, whatever. After we got there we had to wait another hour for everyone else from every other hotel to arrive. Whatever. We finally headed to the ATV's. I checked my watch and off we went. First of all, Jungle? We were in a parking lot half the time and an orchard the rest. You couldn't pass or freestyle in any way. You just had to follow the rider in front of you, who never went more than 7mph. We looped around the same algae hole a couple of times and were then apparently headed to the \"oceanside\" part of the trip. Ha! We went 5mph around in circles and at one point you could look out between two trees and see water. Seemingly, that had fulfilled the \"oceanside\" part of the ATV excursion. We headed back to the parking lot and it had only been 30 min of an advertised 45 min trip. So I asked the guide and he said it had been 45min. I said it hadn't because I specifically looked at my watch and he shrugged his shoulders as if to say \"too bad\". Ok, that was the lamest ATV tour ever AND they shorted us 15 minutes? Now go wait another 30 minutes before the Jet-ski portion. The jet-ski part was fun, but again, you had to stay single file and follow the leader. You're better off renting them at your hotel and riding wherever you want. And once again, the advertised 45 minutes was only 30 minutes. So at the end of the day we spent 6 hours wrapped up in a tour that lasted a total of one hour. Then they had the nerve to hold out their tip jar every chance they got. I've got a tip for you, give us what we paid for! I would not do this trip again."

            "review": "An OK horseriding experience. We were on our honeymoon and paid $67 each for the horseback riding tour.First, the biggest issue I have is that we were promised that we'd be able to ride the horses in the water and get some awesome pictures and were told by the guide this was NO LONGER ALLOWED BY THE GOVERNMENT. He said that the horses contaminate the water (yea, OK). I have seen reviews from other people that indicate they were able to ride in the water, I guess either we got screwed or the new regulations prevent this from happening anymore. In any case, don't plan on it.That being said, the rest of the tour was fairly average. We have done horseback riding other places before so to spend 6 hours of our Cancun stay driving from Playa Mujeras, horseback riding, and driving back was not the best choice for us... I'd have preferred an extra day at the pool. That being said, we did get some pretty cool pictures, some of them were from our camera which is FREE, even the guide took pictures for us on our camera, which is a bit surprising since this eats into their profit from selling the photos on DVD, but I guess that works for them. They do sell the DVD for $30, which would have been way more worth it if we'd had pictures of us riding in the ocean, but oh well. The tour wasn't really on the \"beach\" or in the \"jungle\". Somewhere in the middle I would say. Don't get your hopes up for the dramatic picture of yourself riding in the ocean or really next to it, the beach section of the tour must have been 100 yards or more from the water. For two parts of the tour, you are given the option to gallop with your horse for a while. That is a highlight of the tour for many folks.After the tour, you are given free chips and dip. They also have a full menu if you are interested in purchasing lunch. All in all, I wouldn't do this again, nor would I recommend doing this when you are in Cancun unless you really want to do some mediocre horseback riding. Unless you are staying at Maroma and you can skip the whole 2-3 hour commute round trip. Save the horseback riding for a weekend in the states."

My little girl rode with me and my son rode on his own horse, but they had another guide tether and guide his horse as they went along (thank God !).It was a long ride (2hrs). But, not much to see as it was dirt roads the whole way. I enjoyed the fact that my kids enjoyed it. Had it been two adults, I can't say it would have been that exciting. The kids were completely taken with the fact that they were riding for such a long time. It was very special for them.It was also enjoyable that the guides were so fun. My kids were giggling and talking the whole time.It was also a very big plus that we only spent about half a day. So many tours require a full day committment and with two small people (in the blazing sun!) it just doesn't work well. But, this was good timing for my kiddos.Note to all: Please tip the guides well. If you were spending a full day in the blazing sun with stinky animals and having to entertain... you'd hope for a nice tip at the end of the day."

A Dive Master accompanied the group in the water & attracted large numbers of fish by providing food. He also brought up examples of sealife, such as starfish, for closer inspection & handling.We purchased the lunch option which was a Mexican buffet. It offered a nice variety and included unlimited drinks.We were a little disappointed to not have enough time to enjoy the beach facilities because we had to catch the return bus at 2 pm.

They throw on life vests and take you down to the beach to give you a lesson on how to operate a jet ski and how to snorkel, and then you set out on a ~2 hour adventure! You spend a good bit of time just zipping around the area on your jet skis (following a guide, of course), until you come to a spot they have for snorkelling. The reefs were really neat, and we saw some very cool fish/coral. However, I didn't think the snorkelling itself was all that amazing or anything to write home about (but maybe I'm spoiled since I was on the Great Barrier Reef in Australia last summer?). You load back up onto the jet skis and head for a second location, which is actually nothing more than an underground cenote, with not much else to look at- pretty neat if you're willing to dive down into the opening, but I was not since I popped my ear drum scuba diving last summer in Australia. Then you loaded back onto the jet skis and zipped around on the water and back to the marina! Even though the snorkelling wasn't the best I've ever had, for the price and the excitement of adding in the jet-skis, this was an AWESOME excursion and I would definitely recommend it to people! They did \"get me\" on the price of an underwater camera- $22- but I was willing to pay it because I wanted pictures of the snorkelling adventure and had left my waterproof pouch at home in Ohio. My biggest negative from this place is that they have you for quite a few hours, over lunch time, and when your excursion is over, the next set of buses didn't leave for over an hour. They funnel you into a cafe and give you free soft drinks and chips/beans, which is nice, but they are clearly trying to get you to buy food. We ended up ordering a pizza, thinking we would be safe eating a pizza off the resort, but both my wife and I got sick shortly after our excursion here. We can't be for certain it was something we ate at this location, but she was sick immediately when we got back to the resort, and I have had a stomach virus non-stop for a WEEK now (even after I've been home 3 days!)... :-( Going to have to go to see my doctor tomorrow to find out what's wrong. Like I said, not completely positive that it is from what we ate here, but we are very suspicious of it since everything else had been on the resort to this point."

For $242 total we were both able to go snorkeling for 2 hours and parasailing for 15 minutes (plus the boat ride). The snorkeling was lead by a man whose name now escapes me. He was funny and went through all the safety steps necessary. We were in a group with several children and despite their bratty behavior on the boat they were not drowned during the snorkeling stops. There were always two people (like lifeguards) out in the water with us. This was important to me because I have never snorkeled before. We went to two different sites and then after, because of the wonderful breeze, they used the spinnaker - a sort of kite/sail that lifted people out over the water. You could bring your own equipment or they provided it for you. You had to wear a life vest out in the water. In between sites they served soft drinks to people. Afterwards we had a free buffet lunch back on land. It was ok. Enough to take the edge off but nothing to write about.After lunch we went parasailing. My fianc\u00e9 and I were able to go up together. I am afraid of heights but it wasn\u2019t awful at all. I felt secure and trusted the workers in what they were doing. It was so peaceful and calm. They dipped us a bit in the water. We went on the boat with a family (mom, dad and 3 kids). They took the parents and the youngest child up all at once. They did not beg for or demand tips but they did point out on both boats that they had a place for tips. That was very cool. They do take photos of you as you get on the snorkeling boat (with a lizard and a \u201cpirate\u201d) and while you are parasailing. I was suckered into buying all 40 photos for $40. You don\u2019t have to and you can bring your own camera on the boats. If I thought I wouldn\u2019t have dropped it I would have brought my camera up parasailing with me. If you have a neck strap for your camera you could take photos up there."

Since the snorkeling at the resort was not the greatest, my husband and I decided to book a morning snorkeling trip. Our concierge at the hotel recommended this snorkeling tour. We opted to go on a 1/2 catamaran snorkeling tour with no lunch for $55.00 With lunch I believe it was an extra $15-$20. The tour picked us up at the hotel at 8:45 am. There were already people on the bus, so they must have stopped at a few resorts first so we were the last pick up. We went down the road about 20 minutes at arrived at Paradise Maroma. Immediately I noticed how soft the sand was there. As soon as I saw the beach there I was SHOCKED!!!! It was crystal blue waters and super calm...absolutely breathtaking!!!! They have a neat little bar area with swings hanging to chill out on until your boat was ready to leave. After a few minute wait they herded us through a line where we paid $2.00 additional national park fee and had us sign a waiver. Within a short amount of time we were outfitted with our mandatory life vest, on the catamaran and heading out to sea. The guys ont he catamaran were a lot of fun! The music was lively and I just really enjoyed being on the ocean. But when we got into the water....WOW!!!! Beautiful, bright fish. Bright yellow, blue, purple, everywhere. They took us to a blooming reef and the sea life was tremendous. I felt comfortable and not scared at all. Our guide fed the fish and swarms were all around us. I didn't LOVE that part....because I like simply floating along watching all the wildlife dart in and out of their ocean homes. It was really beautiful. We swam there about an hour and headed to another area of the reef. It was just as beautiful...but unnecessary as it looked pretty much the same. I would have rathered simply stay longer in the beautiful area we were first in. After snorkeling they put up the HUGE spinnaker sail that had a rope swing. Anyone who wanted could get on the swing and swing out over the ocean. Fun but tooooo scary for me!! On board they gave us water and soda and kept us well hydrated. The snorkeling, swing, catamaran and atmosphere were simply a BLAST!!! When we got back they escorted us to the restaurant. If you paid for lunch you were brought to one area and if not you were brought to another area and given chips and salsa, soda and water (free)and an ala carte menu if you wanted to pay for something. My husband and I ordered 1 order of fajitas and shared them. They were $6 dollars and were PLENTY!!! We each had a beer and our total bill was $11.00. When I talked to those that paid the extra charge for lunch, they got salad, an entree, and dessert...but paid a lot of money. I don't know about you, but after being all day in the sun....I didn't want that much plus I planned to eat when I got back to the all inclusive. The bus picked us up at 2:00 and we were back at the resort by 2:30. It was such a great time. I would HIGHLY recommend this trip to anyone. It was soooo worth the money!!!!! The only thing that was a little annoying was the mentioning of tips. They did want tipped and made it apparent. My husband and I are big tippers especially when people are working their butts off in the blazing sun to be sure I have the time of my life. I am so surprised at those that don't tip!! So....if you have as good of time as we did....TIP A LOT!!!!"

Then, it took about another hour to fill out some paperwork and, what I was assuming, was waiting for everyone else that booked the trip. As we were waiting for someone to finally take us on the boat, I noticed small children and old people that were definitely NOT cut out for a booze cruise. We visited two separate reefs, but on the first snorkeling trip a bunch of us ended up getting really sick & did not go on the other reef. This got me really mad because I have never gotten sea sick before, let alone while I was swimming in the water. To add to my frustration, the only \"drinks\" we were served were soda and water!!! There was no dancing and definitely no drinking. And the \"parasailing\" was something they called a spineker? It was a sail with a rope attached to it that you sat in. I was so mad when I saw this. They called it \"Mexican Parasailing.\" To add to all this, we were told a sad( more like pathetic) story from the crew about how they make less than $10 a day and that they need tips. Yea OK! The only thing I wanted to do was to get off that boat! When we got off, finally, we had some chips with bean dip and ,you guessed it, more soda. It took two hours for our bus to come and the best part to the end of our trip was to come to find out that we were stuck with 20 other people, not even staying at our resort, in a bus with NO AIR CONDITIONING!!! I will never do a trip with Greyline again! They just ask for money and there is always a catch!"

We were the only guests so it was a nice, private tour. Our guides were Ramon, Raul and Martin. They were great. The water was crystal clear and there were loads of fish and beautiful coral everywhere. Remember your biodegradable sunscreen and money for a tip. Please, please have your kids wear their life vests even when traveling to and from the snorkeling locations. Would definitly recommend The Dreamer."

We were told the cost of the CD for a couple was $30.00 USD. I used my credit card and was charged 390 pesos instead of the correct amount of 345 pesos. I questioned this charge immediately and was told the exchange rate had just changed (which was not true). I asked for a refund so that I could pay the amount in cash but was told that was impossible. The amount is small but the idea that they are not honest is what is important. In general, there was a long wait for para sailing and wave runners. They pretty much treated people like cattle. I would advise others to avoid this group for their excursions."

Marina Maroma is located in one end of Maroma Beach and has a big area of palapas where you can relax, without the crowded feel of other beach clubs in the area. They also offer a wide variety of activities from scuba diving to jungle tours. All the activities are offered in a central area near the entrance so once you are settled in your palapa, you dont have to deal with people offering services. Overall, Marina Maroma is a great place to spend a day relaxing at the beach."

My biggest complaint was that the tour company did not inform us how many other activities were offered here... their loss I guess because I could have spent the day there! For the horseback riding we were dropped off at the entrance. There were about 10 other people in our group. Most of us had never been on a horse before but nobody seemed to have any problems. If one of the horses started to stray or lag too far behind one of the guides would move it along. The guides did a great job of making us feel comfortable on the horses. The tour was mostly through jungle trails but we did get to go on the beach as well. They don't take the horses in the water anymore which is okay with me! It was probably about a 1.5-2 hour ride overall. I would highly recommed wearing longer shorts/jeans and sneakers. Bring your camera, not only did we get great pics ourselves, our guide took some pics of us together while we were riding. There is a photographer that takes some pics at the end. It was about $30 USD for a CD of 30 pics of both of us. Once our tour was over we were offered non alcoholic beverages and chips & salsa until our transportation was ready to take us back. I would definitely return to do some of the other activities that were here!"

The tour guide did an amazing job, he was so personal, humorous, and kind. He was very concerned about making sure that we were enjoying our time on the horses. This was our first time riding on a horse, and he made it so easy to understand and to catch on to. He was also so very informative about the land, horses, and the people. I thought we would be sore from riding, but it really wasn't too bad the next day, just a little tender. Please consider this resort on your trip, there's also ATV rides, camel rides, jet skis, and boats. It was very secluded and beautiful."

I am sure you can get the guide to slow down but that was not for us so be prepared for an exciting workout. :-) Just a warning to bring a change of clothes and a towel for the ride back. We were cold the whole way back to our hotel which was the only bad part the whole trip.

We rested or rode ATVs. After 2 hrs docked, we headed back out to sea for more. Note: Book quick! This cruise is only once a week. You will be happy and tired when it's over.

Since we met, nearly 8 years ago, he has dreamed of going deep sea fishing and being able to say, 'I got me a marlin\". The Delta representative booked our excursion to Marina Maroma. We were scheduled to parasail at 10:30am and deep sea fish at 1:00pm. Perfect. Parasailing was incredible. I am afraid of heights and thought it was going to be very scary...but it was not the least bit scary. We did the double sail and it was amazing!!! So much fun and absolutely worth the fee. We hit the gift store for some dramimine and waited for our turn to board. We shared the boat with two other newlywed couples - and we were all from the midwest...so, that was kinda cool. The first 2 hours out on the deep waters were un-eventful as far as fishing is concerned. It was looking as if it was just going to be an expensive boat ride. The captain and crew were persistant in calling for the fish...\"here fishies...come on out fishies\"!! They did their best to entertain us and keep our hopes alive. And then we heard it...\"Pecos! Pecos! Pecos!\" The shipmate came running up top \"Who wants a trophy fish?\" and my husband jumped to his feet. It seemed as if it took forever for him to reel in his prize (I helped for maybe 5 minutes). When it was all said and done...Dean had landed a 98\" Sailfish!!!!! The other two men on board, who weren't sure whether they \"really\" wanted a trophy fish on their wall, changed their minds as soon as they saw Dean's fish. The crew baited the hooks again and within 10 minutes we had hooked onto a second trophy fish...an 85\" white marlin. Two down, one to go. The hooks were baited again and with just 25 minutes left of our 4 hour booking - we hooked onto another big one...a 91\" sailfish. The captain and crew could hardlyl contain their excitement. And neither could we!!! We could help but gloat a little as we stood on the docks with our three trophy fish, as the other boats looked in amazement at our three little fishies!!!! It was a once in a lifetime experience for all of us...a first time voyage and it was better than any dreams my husband had!!!"

We only wanted to go for calmer water to swim in and possibly to snorkle a bit but not to go out on the boat to get to snorkle area. We were told we could swim out to snorkle. Unfortunately we picked the worse day to go. It was extremely windy but the sun eventually came out. We got picked up at 9:00 for the ride there from our hotel. Our travel agent had us down for 3 people even though we had 4 people. Not sure why this was the case, something about a credit we were owed, but whatever it was, it was enough to make us feel like criminals when we showed up with that slip of paper and four people. They had to go and check to make sure it was legit. The first thing we saw was a round bar with a ring of big wooden swings on yellow ropes. That seemed rather odd. We went to change in the very clean locker room and went to find a place to hang out on the beach. The beach is very deep and the chairs must be about 100 feet away from the water and they don't have any umbrellas. Behind the long row of lounge chairs are plastic tables for four with plastic chairs covered by the straw shade things but there was a sign saying they could only be used while eating. So if you burn easily this is not a good place to be.Then all we see are these seado boats and other boats along two docks and these wooden structures that had a couple of plastic chairs in them. They just take up space where people could swim. There isn't a good place to swim at all. There are these big things, not sure if they are bolders or something with tarps covering them and they are about 30 feet from shore in a long row and they are spooky. To the far left as you look to the ocean there was an area that appeared to be more suited for swiming but it had a sign about federal land so we didn't know if we could go or not. To the right is the El Derado resort but there is a sign saying for hotel guests only so we didn't think we could go swimming there. In the mean time during all of this disappointment the wind was blowing the fine white sand in our eyes. Even with a visor and sunglasses it was getting into my contact lenses and felt like someone was cutting my eyeballs with a knive. Our girls, ages 16 and 17, got massages because we came all that way and they were bored. They said the massage was good and it was around 40 US dollars for 40 minutes. We had lunch and tipped five bucks to the guys with the guitars and big hats for one song. My husband is a good tipper. The food was good but a guy told us to come in there and have free chips and soda. We didn't receive any chips or free sodas and never bothered to ask about it. I felt like all this place is interested in doing is making money. No one bothered to explain to us about where we could swim. They knew we came to swim and were not going to pay 50 bucks for an ATV or anything like that. They need a better area for swimmers and need to bring those lounge chairs closer to the water and provide shelter from the sun for people like me who burn easily. They say they were voted most beautiful beach in the world by the Travel Channel. I really need to check that out because from what I saw it was not that beautiful. From now on when in Cancun I'm staying at the resort that I am paying for. The grass is not greener on the other side. Thankfully we got back to the hotel around 3:00 and hadn't wasted the entire day."

            "review": "Maroma Romantic Sunset Cruise. Well I will begin with saying that this April was the second time we have done the Maroma Sunset Cruise and romantic dinner, the first time was in April of 2009. During that visit, we went on the catameran boat , had drinks while listening to romantic music and watching the sunset. When the boat came back into the marina, we disembarked and were greeted with champayne and moonbags (candles in bags) placed on the sand shaped like a heart, we were then escorted to the little forest of palm trees that are just beside the beach and there were many intimate tables set for dinner, there was drapery wrapped around the palm trees in order to make each table private and intimate. While we had dinner, a very talented sax player played some Kenny G type music it was very lovely and romantic. After the fabulous surf and turf dinner, and after the sax player was done, there was another attraction for our entertainment, and then as the evening winded down, we were escorted back to our transportation and taken back to our respective resorts. My husband and I agreed that it was the all time best excursion we had ever done in the Mayan Riviera, and the price of $100 per person was absolutely worth every penny. So fast forward now to April 2011, we are anxious to not only return to this excursion but, we decide we are going to send our daughter and her new husband as part of their wedding gift. I talked about what it would be like, and off they went, Well when they returned, they were very underwhelmed by the whole experience, and thought the dinner was good, but, it wasnt really very private and romantic, and I thought they were just being persnikity and ungrateful. So we booked ourselves for the excursion. We were taken there in a passenger van with 3 other couples, and enjoyed our ride north to Maroma Beach, when we arrived we were given champayne which we enjoyed as we waited and waited and waited for the last people to arrive. Finally we boarded the boat and had a wonderful cruise and a beautiful sunset. We were served drinks, and appies, but whoever was in charge of the music, was kinda not really paying attention to the type of music. Anyway, finally we got docked back at the Marina, and I was looking for the moon bags which weren't there this time.. we were led to some little booth type rooms that were on the beach each contained a table and there was a cloth wrapped around to give a bit of privacy although you could see through anyway, we gave our name, and we were told to wait, finally we were led to our table.. it was a table for 2 out in the middle of the beach with an umbrella over it. It was so windy out that evening that the wine glasses on the table had blown over, We noticed that there were 2 other couples that were sitting at this kind of table just on the beach, and then there was also another couple in a privacy shield further from us. A waiter finally came back and gave us water and bread and then left and we did not see him again for about a half hour. At that time, they brought our appitizer to us, and we asked if we could please order a drink. We had noticed that the tables behind us were already eating their main courses . We finally got wine, and then our dinner, but by the time we got our main course, pretty much every one was already done. So in otherwards we got forgotten. It was so windy that evening, that the sand was blowing in our eyes, Our table was placed next to some beach chairs and we were watching the security guys chatting away and having a smoke within 20 ft of our table. After we finished dinner, the picture guy came to sell us the pictures they had taken, and then we were told that our ride was ready to go, so we got up and hurried to the bus. We didn't even have time to leave a tip. I might add that they did have a sax player during dinner, but he was mediocre at best,Now I could see why my daughter had been disappointed, we were really disappointed, although the dinner was still very good, the whole experience was so watered down to what it had previously been, what a huge disappointment!! I really think they need to revisit how the experience had been before, and perhaps not have so many people booked each night, so that each couple has the privacy of a booth."

            "review": "If it's windy, skip the snorkeling. We booked the ocean safari thru Lomas Travel. Two singles one for me one for my son. When we arrived we were told he's too young to ride single. The age minimum is 17 and he is 14. Our overpayment was refunded but I guess I should've clarified the situation before we booked. Anyway, the waverunners were fun but you are playing follow the leader and couldn't go off on your own. The entire week in Cancun was windy with large waves and closed beaches. Thinking the snorkeling would be in a calmer reef area was another mistake. The two areas you go snorkeling at are pretty much in the open ocean. waves were lifting everyone up and down. One minute twenty feet above the reef the next three feet above the reef. My son cut his leg on the reef not bad but deep enough to cause bleeding. I think that if they were responsible and not thinking about collecting money, snorkeling should have been cancelled. When we left they did try to keep you around longer than necessary to shop and eat at the restaurant. We didn't want to do that since we were staying at an all inclusive hotel. So we snuck onto a transport bus back to my hotel."

            "review": "Great choice for day trip. We booked a day trip to Marina Maroma Paradise while staying about an hour away at Excellence Resort in Playa Mujeres. We had a blast and highly recommend this to anyone. We did some snorkeling and saw lots of fish- Pepe was our boat guy and he was great. The other guides were great about getting out there and feeding the fish while we were snorkeling so there were plenty to swim around with... we didn't see a whole lot more wild life, but that's not anybody's fault and could be the time of year. I did not research. We also got up in the Spinnaker Swing and that was fun! It was a bit scary at times for me because I am afraid of heights, but we were honeymooning so I figured what the heck?! It was fun. The food was not great at lunch time, but we weren't there for the food and it wasn't bad. We were just used to eating amazing food at our resort and so this just wasn't comparable is all. The ATV rides that followed lunch were a BLAST. Also, it should be noted that the CD of pictures taken throughout the day are an absolute bargain. $30 for some 30+ images that we will treasure forever and they are gorgeous. The staff even includes some professional, high resolution sunset and arial marina shots of the water as a bonus for making \"the big purchase.\" We were expecting a rip off price and very pleasantly surprised. The gift shop was also not over-priced, nor were the lockers to rent while you go on your adventures. All of these were pleasant surprises.Thanks, Maroma!"

            "review": "4 tours with the Marina, all 4 were AWESOME!. My husband and I celebrated our 3rd year anniversary in Mexico last year. One of the reasons we chose El Dorado Maroma Resort was how close it was to the Marina Maroma Paradise Tours. We did a total of 4 tours with the marina and we were very satisfied with all of them. On our first day at the resort we went for horse back riding. It was my first time ever riding a horse. I explained that to the staff and they gave me a horse that was easy to manage and wouldn\u2019t run too wild. His name was Bandido. The horse and I were the perfect match! He would go by a slow pace and occasionally stop to eat some grass which I of coarse didn\u2019t mind. On certain occasions he would go fast and it kinda made me laugh because I wasn\u2019t really doing anything for him to go faster but he would only do it for a couple of seconds and then he would just go really slow. My husband and I found him a little funny but the horse was so adorable and beautiful.The tour was really cool. We went around the beach, the forest, and we even passed by a pond with a tiny crocodile. There was a part in the tour where we were surrounded by mosquitoes and the tour guides were kind enough to spray repellant on all of us. I would still suggest you bring some of your own since there are lots of mosquitoes around there. The whole tour lasted about 2 hours I believe and I had a great time. It was just wonderful to spend time with such beautiful animals and appreciate the nature and beauty of the maroma beach. Our second tour with the Marina was the parasail. I am nervous when it comes to heights so I wasn\u2019t too excited about this tour and I will set the record straight- I did it just to please my husband who was dyeing to see me nervous! Lol when we arrived at the boat the 2 gentlemen that were in charge of the activity greeted us and explained that I had nothing to be afraid of. I told them to please make sure I landed as slow as possible so I wouldn\u2019t feel it in my stomach and they did just that. The day was a little windy so I did feel a little nervous while I was up there; but the beauty of this activity is how wonderful everything looks from \u201cup\u201d there. I believe the whole ride lasted at least 15 mins it seemed a little longer for me but I can say it was pleasant. We had clear skies and a great sunny day which was a plus and that added to our view . We made our way down nice and slow as the tour guides promised. The only thing I wish we would have had in this activity was our pictures \uf04c For some reason the media department could not find them but it was ok since we still took our own pictures. The cool thing about pictures with the tour company is that it\u2019s done with a much better camera than ours. Our third tour was the ocean safari tour where you get to ride on the water motor/bikes and snorkel to an under water cenote. Overall this activity was a lot of fun. We got to see plenty of fish and we appreciated when our tour guide swam deep into the cenote and taped a video clip while holding his breath for a couple of mins. That was really nice of him. I wish I could remember his name. He also went under some rock in the ocean and gave me a baby star fish so I can hold for a while. We got to see lots of coral too. No sharks \uf04a Our water bike was a little defective and we had to return for another one. The tour guide made sure we got one that worked and we resumed our tour. Sometimes he would go a little too fast and we had some trouble keeping up with him which kind of annoyed my husband since we really didn\u2019t want to be left behind in the middle of nowhere. But overall this was one of the most fun activities we did that day. It was my first time snorkeling and I can say it was a great experience! This is all even better if you have a digital water camera. Our 4th tour with the marina was the couple\u2019s dinner. Since my husband and I were celebrating our 3rd year anniversary we wanted to make sure this was a night we wouldn\u2019t forget. Many resorts have couple\u2019s dinner on the beach but what I liked about the marina is the fact that you get to sail on a boat and catch the sunset and then have dinner on the beach. The boat ride was great! The boat was not luxurious but just perfect to catch the sunset and some great pictures. When we arrived they took pictures of all the couples and gave everyone a glass of champagne. The boat had romantic music which added to the lovey dovey environment. As soon as the sun set the photographer on board started catching pictures of every couple. I suggest you purchase those pictures because they do come out really nice. We thought they were worth it. When we got back to the beach we had our own table. I loved the setting; there were fire torches and a saxophone player. The whole thing was like a dream. The food was ok, the dessert was awesome! It was just amazing to have dinner at the beach and especially with your own saxophone player and the sound of the waves. If you\u2019re celebrating an anniversary, engagement, honeymoon, I would highly recommend this activity. Overall my husband and I were very satisfied with the activities and service. The Marina Maroma made our anniversary a very special event, one that we won\u2019t ever forget!"

            "review": "Guess we're lucky. I read a lot of negative reviews of the deep sea fishing from Maroma Paradise. I felt I should write as our experience was a bit different. We had booked a deep sea fishing trip originally with Captain Ivan in Playa. The day we were to go out there were small craft advisories and smaller boats(20-25ft) were not allowed out. We decided to talk to Lomus and Maroma Paradise about thier boats. They were slightly bigger(30-35ft) and were able to go out and fish, so we paid a little more and went out. Our original plan was to have a private boat because of the stories of handing the fish off to other people who were willing to pay for the mount. Plus, if you fish at all, you know that it is called \"fishing\", not catching, so you are not guaranteed a fish on any day. So to increase our chances of catching and pulling in a fish, we booked a private trip.We went out, the deckhands put out 5 poles and within 20 minutes we had hooked into a 50inch Wahoo. I pulled that fish in and we kept going, within 20 more minutes we had another fish on but lost it before we could see what it was. We trolled for another hour or more with no luck. We decided that we would like to catch some fish to eat so we changed from trolling to fishing the bottom. We caught another 8-10 fish of various species, some were what they called parasite fish, not good eating. But we did catch a Queen Trigger and another grey triggerfish for supper. We were hassled about mounting the fish but thats part of the game there, just say no. The seas were rough and my girlfriend wasn't able to pull anything in due to her condition(what a trooper!, she stayed out despite being green) but we both had an excellent time. I enjoyed drinking beer and talking(or attempting) to the deckhands and Captain about fishing the waters there. The beer was cold, the sun was out, it was warm, so to me, it was better than being at home. I fish lakes in Minnesota so this was a real treat just for the experience.Bottom line: There are no guarantees with fishing. If you want to increase your likelihood of catching something, more poles and less people. Pay a little more for a private boat and stop complaining if they don't bite...enjoy the boat ride, the beautiful blue water, the warm sunny weather, and the experience."

The ATV ride was a tremendous amount of fun too! The ATV and horse ride pictures were put on one disc and cost $30.00.

            "review": "Royally dissapointed with horseback riding 'adventure.'. After reading positive reviews of Bonanza Ranch horseback riding, we approached our hotel tour reps and requested he book a visit for us. He told us that despite the different name (and location for all we knew) the Maroma Paradise company was the same group. Still not sure if that's the case, but it's irrelevent. In a nutshell, this tour was bland, boring, and no more fun than a kiddie petting zoo. After waiting around 45 minutes for the rest of the group to arrive, we mounted our hot and sweaty steeds and proceeded to walk -- and walk, and walk, and walk -- past the same shrubbery for nearly two hours. Our guides said exactly ZERO words the entire time. If this qualifies as a jungle, than my backyard in Cleveland is the Amazon. In reality, it is a working contruction zone, with laborers building new hotels on the site. Twice we sauntered past the same fetid swamp, no more a sparkling lake than my toilet bowl. We walked on the beach for a total of five minute - far from the water's edge - and there were none of the promised horse-and-water photos. As for \"You will be thrilled by the wildlife:\" The only wildlife around are the feral dogs that follow along for the ride. I'd say the trip would be ideal for youngish child, but it's probably too long. So, I don't know who might like this trip. Certainly not experienced riders, who are forbidden to so much as trot ahead of the pack.Afterwards, riders are \"treated to\" a basket of chips, a puddle of refried beans, and the right to be pestered by a mariachi band. Photos are sold by the disc for $30."

First we asked to be booked on a trip to the Isles of Menjures. We were picked up at our hotel, stood around at the beach for over half an hour, then loaded onto catarman boat, no seats, no quick speech about life jackets, bathrooms etc... Started to head out and within the hour we realized we were NOT going to the Isles it was a sunset cruise! Hour and a half later we ware taken back to the beach and they had tables set up on the beach for dinner. We stood in line for 20 mins and then they came to seat us.......and NO table for the four of us! Another 20min and they set a table up for us. They then bring us the first part of our dinner, a shrimp salad( it was ok) asked 4 times for coffee as it was now dark and windy and we were cold. Second part of dinner comes some kind of liquid in a cup and buns ( horrible) Finally coffee and our lobster arrives ( good) We waited and waited for our steak, by this time alot of the other people were leaving to get on their bus back to the hotels. Our waiter clears our table and brings dessert , had to argue with three different employees that we hadn't recieved our steaks! FINALLY we recieve them ( good) We had to skip dessert now as the buses were arriving for everyone. We went and lined up for our transportation back to our resort and waited, waited, waited and a hour and 10 min later we were finally picked up! The whole day was very disorganized and a huge dissapointment for us!!!!!"

It was very fun the beach is beautiful ! And the sights of the beach from parasailing are beautiful ! Lots of stingrays in the water that you can see from the air. They were a great company usually when companies take photos of you they charge 100 and over they took about 200 photos of us and for 30 bucks we got all of them. The food at the restaurant is mediocre we got fajita plate and the burger plate. They have no change rooms so it was gross having to change in the bathroom. The best activity we did was the speed boats they are so fast and crazy ! Parasailing was relaxing and fun your in the air for 12 mins which seems little but its pretty fun with a water crash landing. Atving was crazy but a lot of the peoples atv's stalled or stopped working lol. The jet skiing was fun but it was a controlled group tour so everyone had to stay in a line if not your getting kicked out of the group and sent back to shore. Apprently they do this because of reserving the coral reefs around this beach. The water is actually turqiouse ! Its beautiful wish we got to do the snorkel but it was freezing that day. They banter for tips at the end but they make minimum wage so tips goes far for them. Our transportation from the riu lupita was on time and air conditioned. I would go threw this company again but not for jet skiing you can rent them on any beach and free to do and go where you want instead of following a instructor. This place is great and the price is perfect ! Went to xel ha and charged 200 dollars for photos for the dolphin swim ! I would recommend this company our ages 19 and 20 both girls. Made our first trip to riviera maya a exciting fun one !"

It was our last day in the Cancun area and wanted to spend the day just relaxing at our resort, but decided to check out this snorkeling excursion since I thought we would be back shortly after lunch. Snorkeling was ok...still hard to top first experience in Hawaii. Couldn't do their version of parasailing as the wind wasn't strong enough. Got done about noon and they brought us in for our snack. They then said the vans don't come until 2 pm!! When we got done eating around 12:45, I asked the man who seemed to be in charge of the transporation if we could get a van early. He said he would see what we could do...which was NOTHING! We were the first ones waiting to leave and were about the last ones to actually get a van...excpet when they FINALLY assigned us to a vehicle, it was a big bus!! They had to bring that in because they must have been short on vans. So, we get thrown on that with people from 2 other resorts! I despise being on busses that have to go from resort to resort as it takes forever!! Plus, the driver didn't know where he was going. He tried dropping two people off in the employee area of one of the resorts as he first missed the main entrance. After about 15 minutes of waisted effort he turned around and left the resort. After a couple of miles down the road, he decides to turn back. Then he goes by the resort AGAIN!! Goes a another couple of miles down the road and turns back again. We finally got those two dropped off and then made it to the next resort. Finally, 1.5 hours later and 2 hrs and 45 mintues after we were done eating, we got back to our resort to enjoy the last little bit of sunshine on our last day in Mexico. Oh, and did I mention it only took us 15 minutes to get there in our private van! Sucky way to end a wonderful trip!!! I would avoid this stop unless you have time to kill.

We both love SeaDoo's and were advised that the best place to go would be Maroma Paradise in Playa del Carmen. It cost us $75 each for our tour. The tour began with transportation from our resort near Tulum to the Marina. Once there we placed our belongings into a locker and were escorted to the 'Ocean Safari' area and given masks, flippers, and life vests to try on. We had three other individuals doing the tour with us so it seemed like a very exclusive experience. We hopped on a SeaDoo and followed a guide on a 50 minute tour of the coast area. We then stopped at a designated location along the coral reef and jumped in the water. There were TONS of fish in the area and we swam for approximately 30 minutes. We then got back on the SeaDoo's and went to another designated point on the reef with an underwater cenote (sink hole). We stayed here for another 30 minutes and then headed back to the Marina where our photos were taken and available for purchase afterwards.Overall, I would recommend this business as I found it was very well organized with food and drink facilities on site. There are also signs posted all over that state that the beach area was rated #1 by the Travel Channel. I must admit, the beach area was very large and the sand was amazing."

Our instructor was real nice, constantly was smiling, and was slapping high fives which seemed to reflect his genuine enjoyment of his job. We then did the speedboats which lasted for 50-60 mins and also was fun, although after a while it kinda got repetitive. They provided chips and salsa at the restaurant afterward and soda, we also purchased some beers and then they showed us the pictures the photographer was taking during the trip which was about 70 pictures that we purchased from them for about $30. There was a van there to take us back to the hotel right on time and we were able to get to the beach by about 1 PM as planned. Next time we would probably do the Sea-Doos instead of the speedboats. I think they also offered a fishing trip and massages."

First off your not really riding the camel, you just sit on it while the guide walks you down the road. After you pass the scenic construction site, get passed by workers on bikes, and several vehicles, you get to the beach, which may be this tours saving grace. The beach was gorgeous. The animals were great, but much could be done to improve the \"trail\". The Ocean Safari on the other hand was great. After a nice jet ski up and down the coastline, we got to our snorkeling destination. It was a little chilly the day we went, but we still got to see some great sea life: a turtle, octopus, sea ray, and several different kinds of fish. Next we got to go see a big hole (only way I could think to describe it. think of an under ocean cenote). It was 23 feet down and very interesting.If you want to go on a great snorkel trip I recommend Ocean Safari. If you want a good animal backed tour, I don't recommend Camel Safari, at least not until they change their trail. Try Rancho Baaxal for an amazing horseback tour!"

Unfortunately the tour company didn\u2019t have a record of my booking so they had to contact Viator for all the details. This was eventually sorted out. The pickup information provided was incorrect and when I was at the correct location the transport was 20 mins late. The transport took 45 mins to get to Marina Maroma with a driver who didn\u2019t say anything the whole way not even to the customers who spoke Spanish.I\u2019m not sure what the times on the Viator website mean as I booked their 1pm tour but the pickup was at 1.30pm and the afternoon activities didn\u2019t start until 3pm and then the only time you can get the transport back is at 5pm.The ATV\u2019s were not automatic as advertised on the website. The total time on the ATV was 45 mins and you just go around a track on the hotel property and then back down a road that has cars and mini busses on it. You DO NOT go for a ride on the ATV\u2019s to a beach, have a swim then get back on the ATV\u2019s and return.Marina Maroma has a very nice beach but you can\u2019t really go swimming there as the Jet Ski\u2019s and boats go in and out from this area. You can spend the day there and do several activities but you tend to feel that you are just herded around.At the end of the day 4.30pm they open up a restaurant area and you can get free soft drinks and chips. However, throughout the rest of the day you have to pay."

            "review": "Better to spend your time and money elsewhere.. We did the ATV and speedboat tour at Maroma, which we booked through our American Express / Travel Impressions representative. We were on our honeymoon and had not done either activity in the past.The ATVs were OK, we were in a group of about 12 - 15 ATVs and followed our tour guide through the jungle (trails through the bush). We were near the front of the pack, about 2 behind the leader, but never were able to fully push the ATVs to its max speed (my wife even wanted me to go faster). The tour did take some good pictures along the way, but overall it was a bit too leisurely for what we expected. Maybe it would be good for a first-timer who don't mind playing follow the leader, but someone more experienced would probably be bored.Next, we had about a 15 minute break and did the speedboats. There were a couple issues with the speedboats which made it less enjoyable. It was the same basic method as the ATVs, follow the leader in a group of 10 - 12 boats. The water was very choppy and the speedboats kind of just bounced around a lot in the water. We were told to follow in the wake of whoever was in front of us, but we did not find that it changed the choppiness that greatly. Also, the big problem was that the person in front of us was not able to keep up with the guide and speedboats in front so while people were doing donuts ahead of us, we were simply trying to catch up to them. The guides never tried to adjust the groupings of people or to make sure that everyone enjoyed the same type of ride, which made the activity relatively boring. We did not mind when it was over. We would recommend waverunners over these if available.Finally, we were to have chips and dip and a drink included. We got these at the restaurant at the location, but it seemed when we were not going to be ordering lunch there that they were not very interested in engaging us further.Overall, we think that there are better activities out there (see our edventures review), but if you really want to try out a few new activities, they do have options here."

I had booked beforehand to go elsewhere but it was cancelled due to horse illness, so I didn't get a chance to research this company. I have to say I wasn't impressed from the minute we got there. We were taken to a small bar, which was a mess, the whole place looked a mess to be honest. Anyway, were just told where the toilets were and that the guy would be back a a while. About 15 minutes later he came back and took us to where the horses were. Now the way I had been descibed this trip, we would be riding along the beach, not in the sea, but along the beach, so I had visions of walking along the sand, anyway, were walked along a track alongside the beach, turned around and went back to the stable area, walked past that then waked through the mangroves and along a track for 2 whole hours. We were not allowed to trot or canter, just walk.. It was nice as I love horses, but it was boring and my poor knees were killing after about an hour. Plus my poor husband just go bitten to death by mosquitos, not the companies fault admitidly. Also I was told that we would be swimming in a Cenote, do had brought towels, change of clothes, well that was a waste of time as it didn't happen. At the end we were asked for a tip and then sent back unescorted to the area where we arrived to view our photo's and have drink and 'chips'. Well when we were spotted we were shown where we could buy the pictures, but nobody showed us where our drinks and 'chips' were. The guys doing the tour were nice enough, but I wouldn't recommend this company and I wouldn't use them again for any of their tours as it just looks run down there."

            "review": "Won't use them again for deep sea fishing. We booked a last minute deep sea fishing trip with Maroma Paradise because the boat we had chartered through another company had engine problems and we couldn't go. The price was $120 per person for a 4 hour trip, with 6 people on board the boat besides the crew. Transportation from our resort in Puerto Morelos was $5 each round trip. Our trip was from 1-5. We set out at 1 and it was a quick 20 minute boat ride to where the fishing was. The crew was nice and joked around with us and we were all having fun. Until a couple hours went by with no fish. The crew was obviously getting frustrated, but they started taking it out on us, getting snappy and rude. When we finally started catching fish, my fiance was reeling in a large one and they kept yelling at him that he was doing it wrong. He fishes at home weekly (we live on the ocean), and we've gone deep sea fishing off the coast of Puerto Morelos before and he was NOT doing it wrong. Last time we went he caught a 6 foot sailfish without the help of the crew. It's hard reeling in a big fish and especially hard when you've got a Mexican in your face yelling at you. One of our friends caught a fish and they explained if anyone wanted their fish stuffed and mounted to inquire. So she did and they told her they'd give her the price when we got back to the dock.When we got back to the dock it was the worst. We got to the dock 30 minutes before the trip was supposed to end. First they asked for tips. Which we planned on giving, but lowered what we gave after they asked. Then they wanted us to sit in this specific place near the beach and serve us drinks, which we didn't want. When we declined because we wanted to go wait for the shuttle, they got upset and refused to tell my friend how much to get her fish mounted and shipped home.It could have been a great experience had the crew not been so rude towards the end and we weren't happy they shorted us by 30 minutes, especially since we didn't catch many fish. We'll go again, but will use a different company."

We paid $100 per person, and we are happy to tell you it was worth it. They picked us up from the hotel, and bring you to the beach where you are greeted with champagne. Then they take you to the catamaran. You sail for about 45 mins, over looking a beautiful sunset, while being served any drinks you like and delicious appetizers by a very courteous staff. They you go back to the beach, where they have set up beautiful, romantic, mostly private tables. There is a sax player who plays at each table during dinner. We were served a unique and delicious mango and shrimp salad, followed by a corn soup. Then, the best part happens; the biggest, most tasty lobster tail we've ever seen! It was bigger than the plate. It was about the size of 5 or 6 regular tails I would get at a restaurant back home. It was amazing! It came with some mashed potatoes and some mixed vegetables. Then they served a really good white chocolate mousse dessert. Everything was really delicious! They were average/large sized portions of everything; we were very full at the end!They do have a photographer that takes your pictures several times. It was a little annoying that they kept asking to take our pictures. We brought our own camera, took several pictures, and had no intention of purchasing any pictures from them. However, when we saw how great the pictures that the photographer took, we just had to buy the cd. We decided being interrupted a few times to take pictures was worth it! He had a really nice camera that took some great shots. Plus the cd includes some pictures of the location, such as the beach and different angles and views. The cd was $30, which we didn't think was too bad, and looking back now, we probably could have talked them down a little too:)The only thing I could complain about was that while the food was warm when they brought it to the table, but the wind on the beach did make it get cold faster than I would have thought. I don't think it could be helped. The food was so good, it really didn't matter! Also, while I'm sure tipping is greatly appreciated, they didn't even ask or even mention tipping; they simply ask that you fill out a comment card so they know what kind of improvements or changes need to be made.We definitely recommend this place, and we will do it again when we visit Playa del Carmen next time! We also did para sailing with Maroma, which we thought was really fun. We got to see amazing views from up in the sky, and again, the photos were awesome! The boat and equipment were very standard and good. It was nice because we were able to go with just one other couple on the boat, so we spent plenty of time up in the air! Was a blast!"

All in all the snorkeling was ok it was pretty typical, the guides used bait to get more fish around us, but there wasn't much variety. First they drove us near maroma beach which was apparently called the most beautiful beach in the world by the travel channel. Then we basically turned around and went snorkeling directly across from the marina we sailed out of. The reef itself is said to be the largest in the world but we didn't get very close to it as it is dangerous. We did see another tour group very close and they seemed ok. Here's the bogus part after returning to shore they tell you appetizers are available and they kinda dump you into this restaurant which we had no interest in. We went to see if the van was back and they told us another hour and twenty minutes! When the van finally came we were packed in with other travelers going to 4 different hotels. Then we actually were swapped out into another van and went to just 1 other hotel to drop guests. Instead of being back at 2:30 as we were told we got back at 3:30. If you are a patient person I reccomend it but personally I would try something different next time."

On the snorkeling trip, the 2nd 45 minute session, the in water crew left a group of us to drift with the currents up to 1/4 mile from the boat before they summoned us in using a Conch shell. The swim back was a challenge and very difficult, even for experienced swimmers. All 15 or so of us drifters made it back after considerable effort, with absolutely no help from the crew, who were all aboard the catamaran.But that's not the worst. I opted to do the spinnaker swing activity. It looked harmless enough, while I watched others. Unfortunately for me, the crew decided to get the big sail whipping violently back and forth left to right, repeatedly. I eventually lost my grip, plunged 10 ft to 15 ft to the water's surface, landed on my side and the side of my head. I bruised my entire chest and seriously ruptured my eardrum. I may need surgery to get all my hearing back, all because the crew decided to have a little fun with me on their swing."

It's supposed to be 4 hours of deep sea fishing, our first 1/2 hour was spent inside the reef going in circles with two linse out and the 1st and 2nd mate jerking the line in and out. I finally asked one of the other payees if he knew what the heck we doing. \"Oh we're catching our bait\" ahhhh say what... I would've thought they would do that before we went out. Again I thought I was paying for deep sea fishing, not bait fishing. Anyway after 30 minutes of catching nothing inside the reef we headed just outside the reef and continued to fish for bait for at least another 30 minutes and finally started to catch some small fish. when they decided we had enough bait, not only for ourselves it turns out, but for the afternoon 4 hour fishing trip we finally went out a little further and tried to catch some bigger fish. There were only four of us on the boat thankfully not 5 like the other two boats, because they only ever put out 2-3 lines and only the first mate was kind enough to let us take turns fishing one line when we where mooching. The 2nd mate never once offered his rod to anyone and never to spoke to any of us. He spent the entire trip fishing instead of letting those of us who paid $125.00 USD the opportunity to fish. The did try everything they could to catch some fish mooching, trolling etc. but to no avail. We eventually ended up back in just outside then reef fishing for small ones again. My wife and I did not enjoy this at all, I was expecting so much more as the brochure the tour companies put out advertise that these boats have all the latest technology with fish finders and the likes. Then to add insult to injury the first mate as he was helping my wife off the boat sarcastically said \"Thanks for the tip\" in reference to the lack of tip he got from us. Big fish, big tips is what he said as we were leaving port so stands to reason no fish, no tips. If i had felt we received what we paid for in spite of the fact that the fishing wasn't good I would have tipped, but I tip on service, quality and professionalism and that was lacking here. Oh and did I mention that the boat got hooked up on one the other boats lines coming in. By the time they unhooked it and got us in we walked up to the pickup point to find out we missed our ride back to the resort by 10 minutes. Then the crew tried to say they were in 15 minutes earlier than we were. I would not recommend this to anyone. If you are staying in Playa go out on one of the 25' Panga's next to the Gran Porto Real. They were bringing in 25 to 30 pound Amber Jacks every day for less money."

It seems they wanted to collect $1300 to get the fish mounted and I was told I needed to make my decsion right now. I wasn't willing to make the commitment since I hadn't seem the fish yet. Another person on the boat said they would get it mounted so they kicked me out of the seat and let that person reel the fish in. Felt more than a little ripped off, that I paid $125 and because I would spend another $1300 they wouldn't let me land the big one. so the 2 cokes I drank cost me $125.. Absolutely avoid this tour, it was arranged by Lomas Travel at the Ocean Coral and Turquesa Hotel."

I booked this tour as a perk from Palace Resorts, which included snorkeling for 1 hour and the option to pay for one of the other activities available at Maroma paradise. We chose the horseback riding because of the great description of the walm and ride in the ocean.First thing, the snorkeling trip was pretty good. Its a very short ride on a catamaran to get to the snorkeling spot, 10 minutes and get ready to jump into the water. 3 guides keep the crowd of snorkelers safe, marking the boundaries and feeding the fish to keep them around us. Saw lots of fish, lots of coral, lots of marine life. It was pretty good comparing it to some other snorkeling trips I have been on. No partying on the boat, just get there and get back.Second part, the horseback riding. Got to the stable by a short walk from the pier, everyone was matched to a horse by their abilities, instructions on riding were given. Then the crawl begins. You follow the crowd lazily walking the horses the entire ride thru a path thru the trees, and behind the hotel exhaust system. As soon a horse starts to move a bit quicker the guides slow them down. 45 minutes of walking on a horse with just about no scenery, extremely boring. They get back to the stable, you dismount your horse, then a long walk to the beachfront, where they hurriedly run everone thru a quick ride in the ocean on another horse, just to get your picture basically. One plus, the pictures are beautiful, good photographer. As horseback riding goes, this trip left alot to be desired. The parasailing looked much better."

The driver of this van did not speak english as promised, got lost half a dozen times, the van did not have air conditioning and my girlfriend and I had to sit on opposite sides because it was packed. We were also the last stop on the shuttle which took an hour and forty minutes for a fifty five minute ride. I called to complain and ask for a refund and still have not heard back from them. A week later the ride back was in fact a private transport but the driver was forty minutes late arriving at our hotel. Unfortunately we used PLAYA DEL CARMEN TOURS for all our activities. For the Tulum/Xel-Ha experience we had to taxi to a jewelry store in the middle of nowhere that was closed and wait for them to hopefully arrive to transport us. They would not pick you up from your resort. It was not safe and I would not recommend this tour company to anyone wishing to have a positive experience.

Instead of rideing along the beach, you ride behing seveal hotels (not too scenic). When you arrive back at the beach you get off your horses. There is no galloping - even if you will pay more or are experienced. The swim with the horse is cool- you spend a few minutes in the ocean bareback on a horse and they take your picture.

We didnt catch anything but we might have had we stopped and tryed bottom fishing for a while, i was the only one who thought we should. I just wanted to catch something. Next thing we did was snorkling, i thought it was great. Good crew there also. After that you get a chance to ride a Spinnaker off the back of the boat. I was the first one to go. All and all it was a fun day, like i said that was our first time so we made the most of it. The property was also in good shape and very clean. Also about the food, as you'll read in another review here, i didnt think it was that bad. I dont remember the pricem but i dont think it was much. They had a mariachi band entertain us, it was a good break after coming back from fishing. They also have lockers to throw your stuff in while you run off and play. I cant say id come back for sure when i go back down there, i might i guess if i bring my kids with us. The only reason i say that is because i might try to go fishing on a smaller boat and i kinda wanna go try to swim with some sharks next time. If you have kids with you id say you made a good choice."

My uncle was experienced, however my son and I were not. The guide selected horses based on our experience level. He gave clear instructions. I would recommend this any first time riders to get an experience. The terrain in the area is cut through the jungle, so much of the trail is straight path. However it starts with a great view of the ocean along the resort area. We had 3 guides along for about 9 riders. The Horses are well trained and follow commands well. The second part of the ride into the ocena is optional, and you use different horses. There is time to remove anything you don't want wet, but no actual changing room on hte beach. So wear a swimsuit or clothes you can wet, under your riding clothes. I was comfortable riding in shorts. The horse you ride into the ocean is bareback. Again an excellent experience to say you have ridden a bareback horse. The guide assists you on mounting, so don't worry. There is chance of falling off in the ocean (As I did), The beach area is fantastic with calm water, so it was a very relaxing swim a few feet to the sandy beach. The other 8 riders had no problem staying on. They take 2 beautify pictures of the saddled ride and the Ocean ride, and offered them for $ 10.00 each. We bought the one of my son coming out of the ocean on a horse, something that you cant do everywhere. We had an excellent experience. They provide a snack of chips, and beverages"

There were four guides total - 2 in the water and 2 on the boat. One of the guides on the boat distracted my aunt and I while the other stayed in the cabin. We didn't think anything of it until two members of our group had money missing after returning to the shore. Their bags were located on each side of the cabin where the guide was haning out. About $70 total was stolen. It was really hard to believe because the guides were all very nice.After the snorkel dives, you can go on the spinnerker (sp?). It is a mini parasail experience. The wind lifts you up on a swing like rope and you sail in the air - then you jump all the way down. It was actually pretty fun!The boat did not originally include beer but we asked our Lomas reps to arrange it for us. They did not bring much beer as we ran them dry before the trip was over. Before heading back to shore the guides requested us to put money in their tip jar. Everyone tipped them as this was before we realized they took money from people's bags. I couldn't believe they had the guts to ask for money after that - but it may be that there is one bad seed in the tour guide group. Supposedly, the guides only make $10 per day.They took us back to shore - where you get soda, water, and chips with bean dip. They have you wait another hour before you get picked up by a bus. Then you have another hour drive back to the hotel. The trip in total was 6 hours. If you are in Cancun I would not recommend this because it was a long trip with the bus rides and unnecessary waiting. Also, make sure to watch your bags and do not place them near the cabin. Unfortunately, your things are not safe while you are in the water."

We had a great time with MY TULUM TOUR! We loved the self guided tour at the Mayan ruins and our kids loved zip lining and cliff jumping at the Mayan Village! We also added the underground cenotes and it was the best decision to add snorkeling in a unique cave filled with crystal clear water!!! Best $ spent on our Mexican Vacation!!! Thank you Rod, Kat and Claire for the lovely day! Strongly recommended!!!"

We received an amazing private tour with our own air conditioned van, a private driver and our own tour guide. Claire was our guide and she was great! Super friendly and knowledgeable! We chose to do the Coba ruins tour and it was spectacular.They picked us up at 6:30am so that we could get to the ruins early. While this is really early, especially on vacation, I cannot stress enough how much better it was. We were the first to arrive at the Coba ruins and we had the entire place to ourselves! It was amazing, especially being able to climb the pyramid with no one else around. It really added to the authenticity of the experience. By the time we returned to the parking lot, the large tour groups and buses were coming in. Too bad for them!When we returned to our private van, refreshments and food was waiting for us inside. Claire also brought her own camera and took a lot of really great photos which they emailed to me right after the tour, no extra charge, which was great! I can't recommend them enough, and I can't wait to use them again when we return to Playa! Thanks so much!"

            "review": "HANDS DOWN BEST PRIVATE TOUR FOR HONEYMOON - TULUM/DOS OJOS CENOTE/AKUMAL BAY. We were recommended to splurge a little more money for a private tour during our honeymoon opposed to doing one of the popular mainstream group tours. We aren\u2019t huge fans of large groups and did not want to waste time shuttling a big group of strangers around and did not want to have to deal with a crowd. We really liked the idea of a personalized tour with just us and the tour guide. So I originally contacted another private tour guide company to do a Tulum/Cenote/Akumal Bay tour during our honeymoon. Unfortunately that tour guide was on holiday during that time, but FORTUNATELY he highly recommended The Custom Tour through Rod Ratner. I am SO happy with went with this recommendation and booked with TCT. Rod was very responsive through his emails and after figuring out exactly what kind of tour we wanted and where we wanted to go, we booked with TCT. He was very accommodating to give us the best tour possible and see all we wanted to see. Shortly after we started communicating via WHATSAPP which was very helpful. Rod was very friendly and accommodating. He let us know who our tour guide would be as well as the van driver a few days before the tour. We went on our tour 9/14/16 with Juan Carlos as our guide and George our driver. Both men were SOOOOOOO nice and fun and pleasant to talk to! So knowledgeable and friendly! We can\u2019t say enough good things about these men! Juan hit it off with us right away as we told him we are from Chicago and we found out he loves the Chicago Bears football team and was even nick named little bear by his family growing up. Super endearing story. It was very comfortable to \u201chang out\u201d with Juan and George. Like being old friends. Juan is so well-informed on a huge array of topics from history to politics to nature to sports to pop culture to travel and you name it, he has some wealth of knowledge on a little bit of everything and was able to bounce back and forth with us on all kinds of topics of conversation. Loved that! We started with Tulum Ruins and got there early to beat the crowds and the heat. It was perfect. Barely anyone there and just enough breeze and sun was not in full blast. Juan gladly took photos of us on both our camera as well as his and took photos of various things and creatures and sites along the way. He really knows his facts and we love that he could give us the quick and to the point information and did not bore us with excessive history and details. We appreciate history and ruins and such but we aren\u2019t crazy to know every detail so we appreciated his \u201ccliff\u2019s notes\u201d version of the tour. After leaving Tulum, we drove to Dos Ojos Cenotes. Such a tranquil but fun experience. We enjoyed this choice in cenote to snorkel in and it was a cool experience we never did before. It was awesome to use our Go Pro under the water in the caves and we were amazed at the above and beyond service of Juan to dive deep under the water in the cenote and take underwater photos of us. He was always careful with us and all about our safety. I had told him I was not the best swimmer and he made sure to keep a close eye on me. That is what is great about having a private personal tour guide, he can focus on the two of us instead of 10-20 different people. After snorkeling the cenotes and seeing the bat cave, we dried off and drove to Akumal Bay/Turtle bay and snorkeled with the sea turtles and sting rays. Again, Juan was very informative about the environment and protection of the water and the sea turtles. He even made sure to stop some other snorkeler from hurting himself or the sea turtle by trying to grab the sea turtle who was coming up for air. He made sure to seek out the sea turtles and sting rays to alert us so we could swim over and see them. We got some awesome photos and videos from underwater. After Akumal Bay, we cleaned up a little and they took us for an authentic Mexican lunch not too far from the bay and it was delicious. Then they shuttled us back to our resort. It was an excellent experience and we are so happy we experienced it all and chose TCT and had Juan Carlos and George to be there with us! We were even more delighted to receive an email that same night from Rod thanking us for our business and sent us all the wonderful edited photos Juan had taken of us on his camera. THANK YOU all! We highly recommend The Custom Tour to ANYONE. And if we come back to Mexico (Cancun/Riviera area) we will surely contact them again for future tours!"

Elliott (our private tour guide) and the driver picked us up early morning and took us to Coba before the droves of tourists arrived. We had the pyramid to ourselves! Elliot then took us zip lining and to a mayan lunch -- which was delicious. Do not fear - this was not a touristy location as you see along the highway. It was a beautiful location with a large cent that we had to ourselves, followed by and gorgeous lunch. I would highly recommend to anyone that would like a memorable day, led by a fantastic guide/gentleman. Thanks Rod and Elliott!"

They listened to what we wanted to do and catered the tour to that. There were not a lot of tour companies that would do a private tour with just two people but Rod was willing and excited to help us plan our dream tour. We decided on a tour that visited Coba, Tulum and cenotes. They planned the tour perfectly so our trip to Coba was before the crowds where we were able to have the place to ourselves which made for some incredible pictures. Some might feel like the prices for these tours are higher then other places but that is because EVERYTHING is included and they do not nickel and dime you like other companies. Our tour guide brought her camera and GoPro and took pictures of us during the entire trip. Within two hours of returning from our tour, we had already been emailed a link to all of the pictures at no additional charge! Also, on the way home from our tour I was getting hungry and really wanted tacos al pastor. I asked where a good place that the locals would get tacos al pastor and our tour guide took us to a place that she frequents. The food was so good and again this was not scheduled in our tour but they were happy to take us. I cannot say enough good things about this tour company. You will not regret booking with them!"

I had researched them before departing home, but just didn't think we could fit in a tour on a 3 day trip. They accepted our tour literally at 11pm the night before, and called in team to cover it. Kat and our driver were amazing -- fun, personable, full of information. She took time to understand what we wanted out of the day and tailored it to us. We did the Tulum ruins with a private tour guide, and then on to snorkel in a cenote. There are literally hundreds of cenotes, and I really loved that Kat had a special little spot off the beaten path for us. We arrived at the cenote and there wasn't another soul in sight. Swimming in that pristine water and through caves was one of the coolest things we've ever done as a family. My 11 year old was oohing and ahhhing all the rest of the trip. They have healthy (and guilty) snacks & ice cold water on hand in the van, and maybe coolest of all -- Kat is a really great photographer and she snaps away all day, sending you the album after the fact. I suggest this tour we took (Express Tulum). You're going to have to get up early but oh my goodness was it worth it. Why go with a swarm when you can have a personalized and fun experience with Rod & Kat and team?"

Pato was very knowledgeable, personable and fluent in English and even indulged my attempts to practice my minimal Spanish skills . Beto was very attentive and a safe driver and could not have been better. They made stops for bathrooms shopping and ATMs and did not seem bothered at all. The Coba ruins were amazing and our group was the first at the site and to climb the pyramid and Pato made the climb with us and took photos of every spot along the way. We then traveled to the Mayan village for zip lining and canoeing and then cliff jumping and a CENOTE swim which was also amazing.Then we had the Mayan prepared lunch which was one of the best we had during the first part of our stay We brought along school supplies some clothes and a few toys for the Mayan children in the village and it was a blessing to share these few items with the kids and they were very exited and gracious enough to show us their houses and even offer to give us gifts as well. If you go to this area remember even small gestures of generosity go along way. We were sad to say goodbye to Beto and Pato and if we are able to return we will use Rod for our private tours and try to request our friends Pato and Beto One last suggestion if you want an enjoyable, memorable experience and to get a small glimpse of the local cultures wherever you travel make an effort to sign up for a private tour.In our limited travel experience (Mexico and Negril Jamaica) they have been well worth the little extra money.

I had been to the Maya Riviera several times before, but never during whale shark season, so it had been on my bucketlist for a long time. Rod made it happen! We did the semi private tour which was great because we only shared the tour with a family of 4, who turned out to be great company. It was great to avoid the mass tourism!Rod and Kat took great care of everyone getting the right equipment, and off on the boat we went. The boat was actually a very clean, modern and spacious speedboat, very comfortable. After a nice boatride through the beautiful colored waters of the Maya Riviera we finally got the news that the whale sharks were spotted. There were so many of them!!! We had a blast snorkling, there were so many of them that we would take turns in the water and resting up a few minutes in the boat in between. We could go back in the water as many times as we wanted, which would not have been possible on a big boat full of tourists where they let you swim twice and then you sit on the boat the rest of the time to watch others swim with the whale sharks.Snacks, water and juices were provided in the van and on the boat, and after the whale shark snorkling they provided sandwiches and beers too.On the way back, we made a stop at a beach at Isla Mujeres where we were served lunch on a floating table in crystal clear waters. It was amazing! (I'd almost say i would book a tour again just for that experience )Overall this was a great experience, from the quick email replies from Rod to the way everything was taken care of on the day itself. I would definitely go again!BOOK WITH THESE GUYS, YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!!!"

Seeing so many Whale Sharks and having the opportunity to swim with them in their natural environment was exciting, breathtaking and humbling. For anyone thinking of doing this trip it is a must! Rod was the perfect host, guide and friend for the day. The preparatory information about we needed to bring was clear and the pick up arrangements and transport easy and comfortable. Rod also considered that guests may be nervous about swimming with such large animals. He gave us a thorough briefing about the Whale Sharks, the art of snorkelling, and was very calming and gave plenty of reassurance. We are a family of four. Our two teenagers (18 and 16) were initially cautious but once they went into the water and saw the sharks up close they couldn't get enough of the experience. The boat trip out to and back from the Whale sharks' feeding area took some time but the boat was comfortable and fast. Seeing dolphins also made the trip special. Finishing the trip with the shrimp ceviche lunch on the boat moored by a beautiful beach was a lovely end to the day. You must do this trip."

            "review": "Amazing Custom Tour!! It was Fabulous!!. My husband and our two children did a wonderful private tour last week with Pato (Patrick) our tour guide and his driver, Agustin. They picked us up right on time waiting in our Lobby! The van was air conditioned, clean and stocked with plenty of snacks, water and clean snorkeling gear! At first we thought 7 am was early but it turned out to be a great idea as we toured Tulum ourselves and left in perfect timing as all of the crowds were heading in! On this tour we visited Tulum, swam with sea turtles and all kinds of fish, snorkeled in open and closed cenotes, zip-lining, canoeing, cliff jumping and had an authentic Mexican lunch in the Mayan Village! Patrick was friendly, extremely knowledgable about the history and just overall excellent ensuring we enjoyed all aspects of tour. He took all of the pictures which came out great and we never had to worry about cameras while swimming. This is money well spent! I highly recommend using Custom Tours and would absolutely go back and book a tour with them!!Thank you for the wonderful tour, all four of us had the best time!!"

            "review": "Could not ask for more!. Rod and everyone at The Custom Tour provided our large group of 29 people one of the greatest most intimate tour we could have asked for. My friend was getting married in Playa Del Carmen and I wanted to see as much as I could while I was down there. I had heard about Rod from another friend of mine. I worked with Rod prior to heading to Mexico trying to create a unique memorable tour for me and my friends and I got exactly that! We were picked up at our hotel and taken the Coba ruins and were able to climb it before any other groups were there, we had the place to ourselves! We then went to visit a true Mayan village where we did a zip line course, canoed, swam in a beautiful open air cenote, and then the people for the village made us a beautiful authentic Mayan meal. We then headed to private cenotes that were amazing! Even though it was raining it did not stop us from having the best time! Everything that The Custom Tour did for us went above and beyond anything I could have hoped for. They were punctual, the vans were clean and comfortable, they had snacks and drinks for us throughout the entire trip, the drivers were safe and attentive not only to the road but also the passengers! I truly have nothing negative to say about these people! They are AMAZING!!!!! If you are planning to do anything in the Cancun/Playa Del Carmen area check with these guys first! They will create a tour for you that is unique to your wants and needs, you will not be disappointed!"

We have been on many dives, but so far this has topped them all, not just because of the magnificent Whale Sharks, but because Rod and the Custom tour team worked so hard to make the day perfect. We are already planning to go back to Mexico next year and my first call will be to Rod and Custom Tour, I would highly recommend you do the same."

I loved every minute of this private tour! We were the only ones in one of the most popular cenotes in the area as we got there right as it opened. Exploring the cenote without other tourists or swimmers was absolutely amazing as the water was so calm and absolutely gorgeous! Then even after the cenote the other activities we did were not crowded which gave it a special charm. Our guide Pato (Patricio) was amazing, so friendly and fun to talk with and so laid back letting us take our time with whatever we wanted, so easy to get along with! And our driver Augustin was also very friendly and a safe driver! I definitely recommend this tour to anyone thinking about touring a cenote or just wanting to see parts of Tulum in a relaxed way!"

We found the company via Google and then looked at the positive reviews on Trip Advisor.Rod, the owner, returned our emails extremely promptly and was accommodating to our requests. Kat, our guide and Augustine, our driver were on time for our pick up and welcomed us warmly.Kat was attentive and knowledgable, and had a great sense of humor which is important to a couple of Australians! The guide Louis at Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 was wonderful. The entire day far, far, far exceeded our expectations. The Maya civilization is fascinating and completely blew our minds.Rod followed up after the tour to see how it went.We can not recommend this company enough. We're off to Tulum on another tour with TCT today.Thanks Rod and team for making our trip to Mexico a memorable one."

While we enjoyed every minute at our resort, the highlight of our trip was definitely the custom tour by Rod Ratner given by the most amazing, brave, and adventurous in so many ways, Kat! She was an amazing tour guide! She was very personable, knowledgeable, and made the day special in so many ways. She took amazing photos that allowed us to be in the moment. The photos were in my inbox before I got home from vacation. Her photos were better than anything I could have ever taken. We had our 10 and 6 year old with us and it was all of our first time doing most of the activities. She was encouraging and made us feel brave too. We loved every bit, but swimming with the sea turtles wasWe also used Rod to book our airport transfer. We had the same driver to and from the airport as well as on the tour. It was a very clean van and the driver, Augustin, was very professional and friendly. We ended the day with dinner on the beach at the most perfect resturant. I wish Rod did custom tours in every country!"

We were picked up at our hotel and on the ride Rod gave us a run down of what to expect and we were at the dock in no time. Once out in the ocean, we swam with 10+Whale Sharks and it was so fun. After seeing Whale Sharks we got to enjoy fresh Ceviche and Beer in the water of Isla Mujeres. If you want a fun tour for your family, friends, with your significant other or by yourself do this tour or a tour with Rod. Rod is such a great tour guy and person. I would highly recommend Rod for any tour that you would take while in Mexico!"

            "review": "Perfect in everyway from start to finish A+. I contacted Rod months before our trip to Mexico my youngest child is autistic so normal tour groups are not really a possibility for us but we all still want to experience things so I started to look around for a suitable, sensible, patient tour guide who was able to understand our unique needs and not get stressed or annoyed when things didn't go to plan, anyone who has been on holiday or just even spent a couple of hours with an autistic knows that things never normally go to plan. So I sent out feelers to different tour guides, Rod was the first one to reply back to me and he was so proactive with ideas for us to experience all we could as a family and still have wriggle room for any unexpected sensory overloads or autistic meltdowns. Right from the start he was quick with answering queries and questions and always came back with solutions for us. When we got to Mexico and contacted Rod we were still unsure of how my son would react to the days out. I needn't have worried at all Rod had it all in hand right from word go, we were picked up on time from our hotel and Rod introduced his team, Augustine our driver and the lovely laid back Van who was able to convince my son to do not just one but 2 Cenote cliff jumps, thank you Van he still talks of you. The tour was amazing we did the snorkelling and though it was an early start we were spot on for timing, we had the beach virtually to ourselves and the turtles were amazing, Rod and Van were brilliant at making sure we saw everything and that we were all safe and still enjoyed ourselves. The photos from that tour were brilliant Rod took some of the most amazing photos of us snorkelling with the turtles. Then we were off zip line at the Mayan village again my son adored it and again Van was brilliant at ensuring that he felt safe and secure and was fully aware of all that was happening. During this Rod took photos of us zip lining across the Cenote and of kayaking in the Cenote once again it was the laid back Van that had my son in the Kayak with him and who was able to make such an impression on my son and create so much trust that he was more than happy to be separated from myself and my husband, no mean feat for an autistic child. Rod took more fantastic photos of us, then it was swimming and cliff jumping into the Cenote, thanks to Van my son did 2 cliff jumps and was so brave and amazed that he had done it, we had bought a few gifts for the children at the village so my son had a complete ball meeting the children and handing out the items we had bought with us. Lunch was super tasty and the day went so fast we had a complete blast. My son had made a friend in Van and he adored Augustine the driver, he talks often of him. So did we enjoy the day god yes, the timing that Rod manages to so effortlessly keep to without making you feel like you are rushed. We were ahead of the crowds all the time , each time we were leaving an area we would see the first bus load of tours arrive and disgorge a plethora of people, we had the Cenote to ourselves the lunch to ourselves and generally there was no rush at all. We were always ahead of the crowds so were able to really enjoy the scenery and the space. I had booked 2 tours with Rod, the second tour was to Chichen Itza and again it was just perfect we go there early we had a tour guide waiting for us and man did he know his stuff, he was so interesting and so engaging and the place in itself is pretty amazing. There is nothing that Rod won't do for you to make your visit and your tour better, we stopped off on the way back to buy gifts, and again Rod was spot on he had suggested that we avoid the sellers at Chichen Itza as the prices were higher and we would get better prices and better quality items down the road from the tour sites and he was so right, we stopped off a little place down the road from Chichen Itza and they had the most amazing stuff which was half the price of the items we had seen. Score another one for Rod and his team, we then stopped off for another Cenote Swim and food and again it was perfect we were well ahead of the crowds who were just starting to turn up and queue up for the buffet as we were leaving. We had enjoyed it all so much that we decided to book another tour with Rod, one that wasn't on his books but he arranged it for us and it was again perfect, this time no Van which my son was really sad about but we still had the lovely Augustine. The tour was a complete success for hubby less so for me and my son who both managed to throw up all over the boat, but as Rod is so fantastic at organising things he was able to get the captain to turn the boat round off load the 2 sick puppies on to dry land and take hubby back out again, Rod was so organised he and Augustine stayed with us back at the Marina and hubby went back out. In fact that tour for him was one of the best not sure if it had anything to do with off loading me and the son. So was it all worth the money we paid for a private tour compared to a bog standard tour, for us god yes the experience was well worth it. Was the tour company good, again Yes Yes Yes, they were all excellent everyone made us feel safe and secure was able to give us realistic and sensible advice. Was it perfect for what we wanted, again a big fat Yes they were able to deal with my sons vagaries without any problems at all. A+ all around for Rod, Van and Augustine, and then of course there is the added bonus of the most fantastic photos that Rod took all the time through out our tours which he gifted to us at the end, no charge for the photos. In conclusion if you want a private tour that is built around your needs no matter how diverse or difficult they are, autism and travel isn't always an easy fit, then please book Rod and his people because you wont' regret it."

            "review": "Swimming with Whalesharks made by The Custom Tour. First of all I need to say that I lived in Playa del Carmen for some years and know the Riviera Maya quite well. I am very familiar with the Whaleshark tour as I have guided this excursion myself many many times. My expectations joining Rod and his team on this trip were therefore high and - to foreclose this - they were all fullfilled!The pick-ups in the morning were smooth and comfortable as we had just two stops in Playa del Carmen before going on the highway to Cancun. This gave Rod and Patrick (Pato) the time to give us an intense briefing on the day, the activity and - for sure - on the Whalesharks and their feeding process. The Custom Tour is known to be a privat experience, however the Whaleshark tour can only be private by paying for the entire boat. However, Rod was trying to keep the group small, so besides myself there were only five other guests joining this day, which was extremely nice and comfortable.Rod and Pato were bringing in wetsuits for almost everyone, so there was no need to rent some at the port for all of us. You need to wear either a wetsuit or a life jacket while swimming with the Whalesharks. If you are a good swimmer, I highly recommend to go in with a wetsuit as this will maximize your experience. If you don't have your own wetsuit and/or one of Rod's doesn't fit you, you can rent them for a fair deal uf USD10 at the port. By the way, Rod and his team are not making any money out of this. Besides wetsuites, they bring in rash guards to protect yourself from the sun in order to avoid sun tan lotion, which is deeply affecting the Whalesharks and their feeding area. And, not to miss, lots of food and drinks to energize you through this sporting day!We were not the luckiest one this day, as the Whalesharks were hard to find and we spent some hours on the boat searching for them. However, this is not an aquarium and it makes you aware of us humans not being able to control everything. Rod, Pato and the entire crew on board were making the searching for the sharks diverting though and we even jumped in the water trying to swim with a scuol of Bottlenosed Dolphins that were surrounding our boat. Swimming with Whalesharks is an amazing experience and even after guiding this tour for many years, it still makes me shiver to be in the water with those incredible animals! Rod, Pato and Raul, the marinero, were all in the water with us, guiding and taking pictures and videos, which are by the way given to everyone for free at the end of the day. No one got us in a hurry - we stayed to be the final boat in the Whaleshark zone, which gave us the chance to swim with one Whaleshark all by ourselves at the end. I really enjoyed this day and had a great time with everyone! Thanks at this point to Rod, Pato, Raul and the entire crew, as well as to Jacob and Jenny and Andrew and his sons - you all were lovely to spend the day with!I can highly recommend Rod and The Custom Tour for an excursion experience along the Riviera Maya! I did not join them on any other trip, but I am sure they will give same service and perfection thoughout all their tours! As Rod in the meantime is not able to guide all the tours himself, I don't want to miss saying that he has chosen some excellent guides to work with him - Pato was incredible and I couldn't imagine a better guide for this day! Don't miss the chance while being around the Riviera Maya in between May and September to join on this special tour!"

Our family of four; mom, dad, 20 y.o. daughter, and 16 y.o. son had so much fun with Kat, our phenomenal guide, and Alberto, our awesome driver!Kat and Alberto picked us up at Petit Lafitte at 6:00 a.m. That is early when you are on vacation, but totally worth it to arrive at Chichen Itza before the crowds!Kat offered a coffee stop before heading out of town, but we were ready to hit the road. The van was impeccably clean and comfortable, and Kat and Alberto had a basket of snacks and a cooler with more than enough juices and water on ice for our family. Alberto took the fastest route to Chichen Itza to maximize our time at the ruins. When we arrived, the parking lot was empty and our tour guide, Fernando, was ready and waiting. Throughout our tour Kat acted as our personal paparazzi! The photos were uploaded and sent to us via email. Kat did a great job getting pics of our family including those of us who are a bit camera-shy. After our tour of Chichen Itza we were met by Alberto with a cool air-conditioned van and refreshing wet wipes that had been chilled in the cooler. Then we headed to Valladolid for a delicious lunch before heading to Coba. Every step of our day was perfectly planned and seamlessly executed. If you are looking for a fantastic day with individual attention book with The Custom Tour with Rod Ratner. We will definitely tour with them on our next trip to Playa Del Carmen!"

I enjoyed the fact that we were not with a bunch of other people. Our tour guides, Kat and Juan, were so great. It was like hanging out with friends that knew the area. We liked our tour so much that we booked another for two days later while we were driving back to the hotel. Our second tour was the best. We went snorkeling and saw sea turtles, then went to a Mayan village that had zip lining and we got to jump off a cliff into a beautiful cenote. The whole experience was wonderful from beginning to end. I am only sorry that we live so far away and can't do it more often! Another aspect of the tour is that they take pictures for you and send them to you to save via email at no extra cost. Such a great idea and it was nice to just enjoy the experience without having to take pictures all the time."

We were greeted first thing that morning with bright smiles from Kat & Guillermo. We went and toured the Coba ruins and climbed to the top of the pyramid. The view from up there is beautiful. We then went to a local school to drop off some toys we had brought to the children. After that we stopped at a local market and got to look at a ton of hand crafted goods. The market was very friendly and very reasonably priced. Then we went snorkeling with Sea Turtles and ended the tour with a nice lunch at wonderful restaurant on the beach. I can not say enough about our guide Kat. She was super friendly, very knowledgeable, speaks 4 languages, followed us up the pyramid, swam with us and the sea turtles and took wonderful pictures of us during the tour which that alone is worth the price of the tour. All in all the tour was the highlight of our trip. If you go please make sure you ask for KAT!!! We also loved Guillermo. Our vehicle was never far away and he always made sure it was cooled down for us and that we never had to get into a hot vehicle. Next time we come to Mexico we will be sure and do another tour with The Custom Tour group. And we will make sure and ask for KAT. Thank you again for making the trip special for us!"

We toured with last year with Rod and came back this year for another tour. We have plans to tour again on our next vacation in November.Our tour to Tulum and Turtle Bay was last week on May 31st. Rod and his fellow tour guide, Juan, are very knowledgeable of the area. Even though we have been to the Riviera Maya area over a dozen times, it is great to pick up new fun facts of the region. My husband is 65 and I am 59. We are fairly active, but I cannot tolerate too much sun and heat. What is nice about touring with The Custom Tour is that it truly is a custom tour. We do things at our own pace and knowing there is a clean air conditioned van waiting for us when we are ready to head to the next location. Over the years we have taken many big bus or big group tours and The Custom Tour is much more relaxing and enjoyable. The rates are comparable and I wish we would have found Rod and his team sooner.We were picked up at our hotel at 7:00am in a nice air-conditioned van. Alberto was our driver. He is friendly and helpful when getting in and out of the van. I also appreciated that he is a safe driver. At no time did I feel that we were unsafe on the roads. Rod and Juan were our tour guides and as I mentioned above both were very knowledgeable about the region, the plants, and the wildlife.There was an ice chest in the van with plenty water and snacks. The van was clean and well maintained.We arrived at Tulum archeological site shortly after they opened at 8:00am. Rod had our tickets and also had the tickets for my 2 cameras. There is a small fee per camera at Tulum. We also requested tickets for the tram to ride back to the parking area. Rod had those taken care for us too. The walk from the parking and the entrance is not too far, but it was great after walking around the grounds to have a ride back.We had visited the Tulum site over 10 years ago with a guide. This time we opted not to have a guide. (Federal guides only at the Tulum site.) My plan was to take photos and video. I also took a time-lapse. Rod helped me on where would be the best vantage point. Thanks Rod!! I\u2019ll share some of the video/time-lapse on The Custom Tour Facebook page later. Rod also suggested which entrance to use with the best view of the site. He had a large map of the site and went over the special buildings. Lots of info and much appreciated! Rod also had umbrellas for us to use in the van, but I had brought my own small one. Nice touch that they think of the little things.After Tulum we headed to Akumal to swim with the turtles. Turtle bay is a beautiful area! My husband went snorkeling with Juan. All items needed for snorkeling were included. Rod supplies flippers, masks, and lifejackets. While they were snorkeling, Rod took me to a location on Turtle Bay for the best vantage point to shoot time-lapse. Like he did on last year\u2019s tour, he carried my backpack. So very nice since my bag with camera gear does get heavy for me after a while. I had mentioned earlier in the van that I would like to get a T-shirt from Akumal. Rod and I walked to a short distance to a shop. It is so nice that I was with someone that knew exactly where to go and I wasn\u2019t wondering around in the heat.Next up was lunch in Puerto Aventuras at a marina. We had the option of going to lunch on the bay like we did last year, but I was happy to go somewhere new. The food was incredible! My husband had a huge burger with fries. I had the shrimp tacos. We were served a giant portion of wonderful guacamole. It was very tasty, but we could not possibly eat the whole thing! Last year the same as this year I wasn\u2019t expecting too much for lunch, but I was impressed with the quality of the food which is included in the tour! The marina would have been a nice location to shoot time-lapse, but I just wanted to relax.We arrived back to the hotel around 2:00pm as per the estimate Rod have given us on our itinerary. It is amazing that he knows about how long the tours will take and driving time. At no time did we feel rushed on the tour. It was a leisurely pace and that is what we like to have on vacation. I was hot at Tulum, but very tolerable and did not feel overheated on the tours.I\u2019ve added a few photos to Tripadvisor below. When I process the video in the next few weeks I will share those on The Custom Tour\u2019s Facebook page. Rod and Juan took photos of us on the tour. The underwater shots were awesome. Thanks Rod for the gift of photos!Last year we went to the Mayan Village for ziplines, canoeing, and cenotes, Yal Ku Lagoon, and Akumal for lunch on Half Moon Bay. The video of the tour is on my Vimeo page and the video file is 135687399. Mexico Slices 3 \u2013 Nature. You can also check out my review from last year on Tripadvisor.We highly recommend The Custom Tour for all ages and activity levels! We cannot wait to tour with Rod & his team in November."

            "review": "Awesome tour!!. My wife and I did the \"My Favorite Tour\" last week with Pato (Patrick) and Agustin. On this tour we visited 3 cenotes (closed, partially closed, open) and a Mayan village which included ziplining, canoeing, and swimming / cliff jumping in a fourth cenote. We also added an authentic Mexican lunch.We have done a number of adventure tours in various locations, and this was one of the best! It's a private tour, which means you go at your own pace and can be tailored to exactly what you want to do. The cost was very reasonable and well worth it. We enjoyed learning about the history of the cenotes and the Mayan village from Pato who was extremely knowledgeable. Swimming in the open and closed cenotes, we couldn't believe how clear the water was. It was so cool to see the sunbeams streaking through the water in the early morning light. Pato took amazing pictures throughout the tour and sent them to us afterward for no additional charge. For the Mexican lunch we were steps from the beach, listening to the waves and watching turtles swim in the clear blue water. The food was great - I recommend the ceviche and lamb burger!Look forward to returning to PDC and more tours with Rod Ratner!"

            "review": "Awesome trip!. Hey Folks!So my husband and I went on an Amazing personal custom tour which involved Coba ruins (I suggest biking it's really fun) zip lining, canoeing, cliff jump (not too high) , swimming in a cenote, and then finishing off the day with some late lunch on the beach at a nice restaurant. It was a very great tour. Out personal tour guide PATO was very friendly and knowledgeable, and the driver George was great. They provided us with lots of snacks so we weren't starving. We got picked up at our resort lobby at 6:30am which was great because we were the only ones at the ruins in the morning. Pato took photos of us while we just enjoyed the tour and emailed them to us after so we didn't have to stop and ask someone to take our photo all the time and a lot of the photos turned out great! We finished off our excursion with lunch at a nice restaurant (food included) and there happen to be a 2 for 1 drink deal which was a nice treat. We got back to our resort (3:30) with enough time to rest and get ready for our evening plans. It was a really fun tour and I'd do it again in a heart beat!"

We had Kat as our guide who was approachable from the start and answered all our questions. Augustin was our driver who was lovely sorted shoes towels etc for us every time we left the bus. We swan with turtles which was so amazing something I will never forget! Went onto some cenotes which are stunning to swim in along with the natural lagoon where fresh water meets salt water. Finishing with lunch on possibly the most beautiful beach which we couldn't see anyone else on. Special from start to finish a day I will always remember and will encourage everybody I talk with to try it! Water juices and snacks are a nice little extra and the photos Kat took are well.... WOW!!"

We could have booked through our holiday company to do all the trips that we did with Custom tours but we are so glad that we found Rod and his team (through trip advisor) and book with them as it was so, so much better (as you are not with a big group) and we as a family had the most amazing 2 days. You get a very personal experience, from first booking with him, communication before hand was amazing no question to small or too big. Kat our tour guide was just brilliant, helpful, chatty and knowledgeable she is pretty awesome.We didn't want 2 days together as we thought this would be exhausting but Rod put together and itinerary so we could do our first day have a days rest and then do our second day. It was so nice to have Kat at the Turtle swim as she wasn't loud like other tour guides, she took us away from the crowds and I believe we had a better experience. It was just so nice to be in our own little group, just the 5 of us.With Custom Tours we did, Tulum, Mayan village and the Turtle swim on the first day and Chichen Itza and Coba on the 2nd day both trips well worth it, Coba was an amazing experience and when we did get to the top we were the 'bum shuffle family' as this is how we got down to the bottom on our bums haha!Worth every penny so please book, you will not be disappointed.Thank you Kat, Rod, coach drivers and team...............happy day's they were."

We climbed to the top of Coba ruin and could see for miles.Our Mayan taxi ride (bicycles for 2 driven by Mayan locals) was very unique and fun.We learned a great deal about the Mayan culture and Pato took photos that were then provided to us at the end online so we could just enjoy the day. We then went to a wonderful place in the heart of the jungle to zipline and jump off a small cliff into a cenote. The fresh water was exhilarating. It was very safe and my 9 and 10 year old wanted to stay forever. So did I for that matter. Thank you to Rod Ratner for providing such an amzing day. Pato is a keeper! Everyone visiting this area should plan a day with Rods Tour Company. He really came through for us."

As we were walking out of Tulum we passed someone from our hotel that left on one of the bigger commercial bus tours a half hour before we left the hotel and they were just getting to Tulum as we were leaving. It is great to get there before the crowds because it gets crowded and hot. After Tulum we headed to the cenote were we did zip lines, canoeing and swimming. It all was great because we beat the crowds of people and had our own tour guide that took picture of us the whole time. After the cenote we went over to the \u201creal\u201d Mayan village and had a great lunch provided by the Mayans, it was delicious. Overall this tour is great because you have a private tour guide who tells you about the local area and takes pictures of you and email you them when you\u2019re done. The tour is more personal than the big commercial tours. Even though it might be a little more expensive than the bigger commercial tours it is well worth it because you get to do more, your time is managed better and you beat the crowds of people"

            "review": "Great personalized tour!. What a tremendous day we had with Kat! She offered drinks and snacks and we chatted on the way to Tulum. Our Tulum guide, Jorge, was hilarious and knowledgeable. This oceanfront site was so beautiful and the tour short and sweet per our request. As we left, there were hordes of people exiting trams and tour buses for the site, meanwhile Kat had taken great shots of us without people in the background messing them up. NOTE: Do not try to pet the Coati (raccoon/monkey looking animal). One of us did and got bit (lightly, but still!). Kat was kind enough to douse my finger in hydrogen peroxide and give me a bandaid.Next we headed to the Mayan village for ziplining, canoeing, swimming, cliff jumping and lunch. We had so much fun ziplining and the men helping us were courteous and kind. The canoeing was quite peaceful even though we ran into someone, a rather nice Canadian. At the cenote the water was the clearest we\u2019d ever seen and so refreshing. Kat continued to snap pics and had also brought noodles and snorkeling gear. If we sat still on the steps into the cenote we were able to get one of those fish pedicures. The cliff jump was great, only about twelve feet but high enough!We walked around the Mayan village and were invited into a hut where a family lived. The woman was friendly and welcoming and the baby adorable. It was interesting to see how they lived. Lunch was delicious and here we ate the best guacamole of our trip. The hibiscus water was heavenly. For lunch they also served rice and beans, pork, fall-off-the-bone chicken, handmade tortillas and fruit.After leaving the village we headed to Chikin-Ha to swim in the underground cenote. This park was especially pretty with lots of foliage and unique places for pictures. The larger cenote was busy but lovely and the underground one really cool to swim in\u2014the darkness gives it a completely different feel. Spooky but in a good way. There are little fish (and ones that look like aquarium catfish with whiskers) in the water. They are all small and likely indicate a healthy water environment.We were dropped off at our hotel and were sorry to say goodbye to Kat\u2014she was warm, experienced, fun to be around, and made our day extra special. Agustin, our driver, was also very nice. We hope to return and will request Kat for another fun adventure!Wear bug spray, especially in the Mayan village. If you\u2019re considering a private tour but aren\u2019t sure about dropping the cash for it, we say do it\u2014we were perfectly catered to and couldn\u2019t have had a more stress-free experience. From driving to timing we didn\u2019t worry about a thing. Also, the pictures provided are a real bonus and we enjoyed the day more knowing we didn\u2019t have to capture moments\u2026instead we got to live them.Thank you Kat and TCT!"

We three myself fianc\u00e9 and 16 year old son went on a private tour 2016.03.16, this was the best excursion ever!! I had no prior knowledge of this awesome company, found it on trip advisor, sent emails and signed up. I am so thankful as every single thing was perfect. Katy with driver Jorge picked us up at Barcelo, we were off .... I had discussions regarding my weight issues, we just went a bit slower and wasn't problematic. I did have s laugh walking up to tulum as I was tired before we started. It was fine sent my boys ahead to explore as I had been there 25 years ago. We were one of the first people in-brilliant! Neat place, for us no guide totally worked. We all liked the iguanas too. We went to the Mayan village after tulum, Rolo and Curtis zip lined. Katy got me a canoe to go down to the dock and meet them -perfect! This cenote wa beautiful, we saw turtles. Boys had fun, Rolo's first time! Canoed back and went to the next cenote, the children's swimming pool. I found my paradise! I was surprised I left as I was 100% happy! We swam and all of us... Even me jumped off the cliff! Walked into the village, humbling, gave our children stuff to two little kids then off to another cool cenote! The best part Katy was telling us all about the cenotes, rivers, history of area-we loved this! Next up great snorkeling where ocean comes into a cenote! Curtis is a fish, Richelle a mermaid, Rolo needed a little help had a noodle, worked great. Katy took us all around the cenote! Off to a great lunch, we had fish tacos, the view was brilliant. Next we went to two more cenotes by our hotel first one was great, love the plant life. The second was so cool with the cave stalitites so cool to snorkel there. Almost didn't want to because the top was so neat. We went back to our hotel exhilarated and exhausted. We all had a great day knowing we could never have gotten this in on a big tour, we would be stuck to others schedules and pace, we beat the crowds everywhere we went!! We laughed about myself reading we could walk to the cenote-no! The best part was Katy, she was sweet, kind, knowledgable and a great guide. Jorge was a great driver too! We had treats, water drinks and air conditioning. Fine tuned so perfect for our little family (with my extra needs) having a little cry remenising right now. Loved this highly highly recommend this tour!!! Oops almost forgot the best part the pictures !!!! Unbelievable pictures of my family on our family moon! Katy took them all they are awesome my one regret we didn't get a picture with her! I would highly recommend this Rod Ratner tour!"

From the beginning Rod was extremely helpful and coordinated every aspect of the trip. He gave constant status updates and was very honest and prompt in answering our questions. When it was finally time to go, Katy, Helio, and Pat (our tour guides) were fantastic. Out of the 5 excursions we did with different companies that week, they were by far the best at anticipating what our group needed and helping us make it happen. The Maya Koba excursion definitely helped us end our trip on a high note. Everything we did was better than anticipated, especially the cenote swimming. Also, when things we needed them to buy for us ended up costing less than originally quoted, they refunded our money! Would highly recommend this company and their group :)"

We were at Coba early and beat the crowds which was nice when your climbing the main temple. The snacks and drinks that they provided were greatly appreciated after touring Coba. Our favorite part of the tour was having a personal guide at Dos Ojos instead being part of the big groups trying to snorkel together (what a mess). The lunch was good and relaxing at the beachside restaurant and once again no big crowds to deal with. Patrick took pictures throughout the day and even underwater photos at the cenotes. He emailed to us many photos which really makes this tour stand out because we could just enjoy the day and not worry about taking pictures."

My fiance and I just returned from the Mexican Mayan Riviera, and the highlight of the trip was our second private tour with Rod and his Custom Tour. We discovered him last year and this years tour was equally as amazing as last year. A big thank you to Rod for taking time to join us this year, even though he was preparing for other commitments. His friend and co tour guide Patrick was superb and made our trip truly spectacular. The Highlight of the trip was stopping at a Mayan School, where we donated school supplies and gifts to the children ranging in ages from 3 to 12. As we are both educators, the chance to see these students in there natural environment was truly incredible. We visited with the children while we handed out gifts, toys, and supplies for the classroom. They were so appreciative that we actually came \"to see them and visit with them\". Rod and Patrick loved to see the expressions of happiness from everyone. They said to us that they wish more people would do things like this for the locals. We loved giving back and just truly experiencing a great day with everyone should make a priority to do in their life. We went snorkeling and hiking in and around several cenotes, and also the natural aquarium, a gorgeous lagoon entering the Caribbean Sea, where we snorkeled with tropical fish you see on the travel channel. Rod once again took pictures of us all day, giving us an amazing photo album that he emailed to us immediately after the tour was over. The fact that's included in the tour is a wonderful added benefit, not needing to take photos ourselves. THE PHOTOS ARE ABSOLUTELY STUNNING!!!!!!We finished the day with a private three course lunch on the beach, also included in the tour.Anyone traveling to the Riviera Maya should schedule a tour with Rod. I guarantee you will be glad you did!!! THANK YOU ROD AND PATRICK.!!!!!!!Matt and Tracy"

            "review": "A fantastic day out at Chichen Itza and Coba. There was no way we were going to Cancun without seeing Chichen Itza. A few years back we went on a Nile Cruise and due to \u201cthe troubles\u201d there were pretty much no tourists so we had \u201calmost\" private tours of some of the wonders of the world. So when we were thinking of tours, we definitely had it in our minds that we wanted to have that kind of experience again without being on coaches doing multiple hotel pickups and crowds. We stumbled across Rod Ratners' \"The Custom Tour\u201d on TripAdvisor and was intrigued by the consistent five stars & enthusiastic reviews even though the price was at a premium. I looked at the options on the website, did a bit of research and looked at a map of the area and decided that along with Chichen Itza, Coba would be a great contrast and it would come with the drop in for lunch Valladolid. Rod and I had a number of email exchanges and agreed the tour and settled on a date. Right from the outset I explained that I wanted to be at Chichen Itza for opening and why, and this was never a problem. Once we arrived in Mexico, we confirmed our arrival and room number to Rod and he arranged for us to have a 06:00 pickup at our hotel by Helio (our Portugese guide) and George (the driver). Immediately we were put at our ease and were shown where the snacks were and juices/water that we could take at any time (pretty useful as we had been up too early for breakfast). We then chatted pretty much non-stop all the way to Chichen Itza. Helio is a dive instructor and has been all over the world and has a passion for nature which was great as I also dive and we shared experiences, compared different ancient civilisations and pyramids as well as the indigenous species. If we\u2019d wanted to just curl up and sleep, that would have been fine, but the endless jungle across the drive to Chichen Itza was somehow compelling along with our great company. When we got to Chichen Itza, we were met by Fernando, a local Mayan guide who then took us around Chichen Itza. The Pyramid is awesome but it\u2019s about way more than that and there are lots of other temples with a \u201cfootball\u201d field. The acoustic echoes and also mind-blowing. Whilst we were being guided by Fernando, Helio was taking pictures of the Pyramid etc. as well as us whilst we were being guided. This was really cool as it would have been so easy to have had stock library pictures, but what we actually got was pictures of our day with our light. So even if it wasn\u2019t pictures of us, you could really see that it was exactly the same day we were there (by the way - you get all of these pictures to download for free). Helio also interjected on occasion with his passion for the place. After the\u201dofficial\u201d tour, we also had some \"free time\u201d strolling around with Helio who took us to see some of his favourite areas. then off for a 30 minute drive to the main square of Valladolid and into a restaurant which was full of locals. As we are vegetarians, Helio ensured we got some great omelettes and salad. He also astutely arranged for some super guacamole and chips to be sent to our table which will turn out to be expensive as we can no longer eat shop bought guacamole and will have to make it from scratch from now on. It was stunning and really chunky as opposed to the normal \u201cblended\u201d paste you encounter. After lunch, we went for a walk around the square and when I spotted the grand church I asked if we could go in and Helio was fine with that. I\u2019m an atheist but love (proper old) churches and this one was really nice so worth a 5 minute look in. Then off for a 45 minute drive to Coba which is a very different experience to Chichen Itza. Some of Chichen Itza has been (tastefully) restored but Coba is pretty much how it was found a few years back but with the jungle cleared away. Coba is spread over quite a large area so we had mountain bikes and toured all around with Helio. Coba is also the highest pyramid in the area and you can still climb it which affords a great view of the seemingly endless jungle. We also stopped off to see a cenote and see some of the birds as well as the vultures on one of the temples Again, loads of photos were taken (we took our own camera but ended up leaving it in the bus as we just didn\u2019t need it knowing that we were going to get all of Helio\u2019s photos). Then off back to the hotel. It was a long day with us getting back at about 16:00 but well worth the early rise to get to Chichen Itza as it opened and was practically empty (it was starting to fill as we left). The cost in one way does seem expensive but when you consider we saved the money of going on 2 different tours to see both Chichen Itza and Coba in one day, which also gave us a \u201cday back\u201d of our holiday and the dedicated local insights and stop at Valladolid had a real authenticity to it. Rod is also passionate about supporting local tourism hence the use of a local Mayan guide and eating in a \u201clocals\u201d restaurant which is a really nice touch. We enjoyed the experience so much that we almost immediately booked another trip with The Custom Tour (see my other review)."

We booked our tour with Rod based on the perfect Trip Advisor reviews. My husband was hesitant only due to the cost but after the tour he agreed it was worth every penny and now he only wants to do private tours. With two kids in tow it was perfect not to be on a tour bus with 50 other people. We were able to spread out in the in the van and the kids were able to sleep, watch Ipads and play with toys on the hour and a half drive to Coba. They also provided us with snacks and cold water....the snacks were great since we didn't get breakfast! We also didn't get coffee at the hotel in the morning so they stopped to get us some. It was worth waking up and leaving at 6:30AM to beat the rush of the large tour buses......we had Coba COMPLETLY TO OURSELVES! Not a single person was climbing and at top when we were.....AMAZING and PEACEFUL!! I can't even imagine that climb 200 other people.....what a different experience it would have been! Kat was so friendly and informative....our kids LOVED her! We had an amazing private guide at the ruins, I don't recall his name but he was so informative, a true Mayan descendant. You have to have a guide at the ruins otherwise you would not understand and appreciate what you are looking at. Our son did get a little bored while the guide was talking and Kat was amazing, she took him so my husband and I could both listen, I was so impressed and appreciated that so much! Next we went to the Mayan Village. The locals knew Kat and were happy to see her and were very welcoming to us. The food at the Village was great! Lots of activities at the Village and no lines. My son loved the ziplines (perfect for younger ones as they are not very long and high). We had a cenote to ourselves almost the entire time we swam.....AMAZING! I had mentioned to Rod we wanted our kids to get a chance to snorkel for the first time and Kat had all the equipment with her and out kids got to have that experience in a quiet private setting. Kat also took tons of pictures of us and were able to download them when we returned home. I can't recommend this tour group enough! Every part of the day was perfect and everyone had a great time!! Another good part about getting up early is we got back to the resort early so we still had time to swim and relax that day! We will certainly book another tour with Rod and his team the next time we are in the area!"

Family Day of fun/tours - 3 adults, 2 year old, 16 and 15 year oldWe decided to book a private tour with Rod Ratner based on other online reviews and we are so happy that we did. We have a wide age-range of kids and wanted to spend a family day (if possible) with everyone together. Rod can customize the tour to what you want to do, what will work best with your ages, etc.. The flexibility is amazing. Booking process: - I explained our ages to Rod and asked point-blank about a little person tagging along; he was honest, straightforward and I trusted his response- gave the basic outline of what we would like to see/do and they pieced together the day for us - in other words, it was amazing not to have to fit into a pre-canned tour. - Great communication - we knew what to expect, what we needed that day (for payment), etc..Tour: We did the Tulum ruins first - worth the early wake-up to be in before the crowdsGuide/Driver: August(ine) as our driver. Our teens were so impressed with our driver - safe, watched out for the iguanas (!!!) and no one was carsick which can happen on the backroads. My husband and I felt comfortable having everyone we love most driven around - the vehicle was clean and in great shape - snacks and water provided. Patricio was our guide. He was informative, friendly and so much fun - great with our teens and little one. He gently encouraged one of the adults to try snorkeling and that person loved it (total positive experience for this person compared to other tries at snorkeling). He kept everyone safe but also let our group get enough \"adventure\" in - we didn't feel constrained by what he wanted us to do or what he thought we should do. Booking with Rod Ratner was worth it - they are clearly experts in the best way to structure a day to avoid the crowds, safety is at the forefront of their operation and respect for the natural surroundings and the local people. And, it was FUN and laid back. Exactly the type of day we wanted."

Claire was right by my mom's side for all the snorkeling activities until she felt comfortable, which really helped my siblings and I enjoy the tour ourselves. The kids (of all ages) loved the underground river, zip lining, cliff jumping and swimming in the cenotes. Best of all we got to every activity early and never had to wait, or be among crowds; that alone was worth the price of the tour. The lunch was wonderful and again, empty of crowds. I go back to area regularly so will likely book with them again and will definitely recommend them to my friends. Hoping to go snorkeling with whale sharks some day, and will definitely call Rod Ratner for that!"

Because of great recommendations on Trip Adviser, I booked a custom tour with Rod for the very busy Spring Break week. We couldn't have asked for a more patient, kind, knowledgeable and friendly guide than Patrick. Our boys 8 and 6 loved him and he did everything possible to make sure they were comfortable zip lining, cliff jumping, and snorkeling-- even when the little one had some trouble in the ocean, Patrick was calm and ever so helpful. We were leaving each site as hoards of buses showed up-- having most places to ourselves at the height of Spring Break week. Fabulous and worth every cent and we have great pictures to prove it!"

Rod, a huge shout out to you for your fantastic communication from before I even booked with you back home in Wisconsin, all the way through our excursion! And thank you for sending Patricio to us, he was so incredibly informative and fun! I will be recommending you to every single friend of mine!! I know they will be in great hands!

            "review": "Outstanding!. My friend and I (we are two girls in our late twenties) chose The Custom Tour based on the Trip Advisor reviews and it did not disappoint!!! We did the My Tulum Tour. It was totally worth paying a little extra for the private guide (compared to other group tours) as we were able to avoid all hassle and time wasted waiting around for other people. Rod picked us up at the front of our resort right on time (at 7am), and was ready for us right away- the van was spectacularly clean, had plenty of cold water, snacks, and info. We pre-ordered the eco-friendly organic sun screen and bug repellant, and those were fantastic. They were very light but effective. I am very conscious of being environmentally friendly so this was great. I highly encourage this, and if you choose to bring your own from your country, buy the organic/ eco-friendly ones to help keep the cenotes beautiful. The Tulum Ruins is a self- guided tour, takes approx 45-60 min or so. It gets hot so bring a hat and sunglasses. Incredible place, and great pictures. There are a lot of uneven surfaces and large steps so bring good active sandals. We both wore our Teva Sandals and we were glad we had them. Rod then took us to the underground cenote before the place got crowded. We were the first ones there and the experience of snorkeling in the cavern was nothing we had experienced before (and we have done quite a lot of adventurous activities). Parts of the cave was pitch dark but Rod guided us with his flashlight so it was perfectly safe. The other side of the cave was more bright, and on a sunny day the sun shines through the clear blue water- it was magical. Rod has all the snorkeling gear and they were extremely clean. *Rod takes pictures (overground and underground), and sends you electronic copies- all included in the price (which makes the rate totally worth it). The Mayan village experience was wonderful- zipline, canoe, and cliff jump- all very safe and relatively easy for kids to do as well. The village is owned by local Mayan families, and maintained very well- clean and serene, and all of the staff are friendly. Lunch was provided by the local Mayan families- handmade tortillas, tacos, fresh fruit, and salads. All very delicious. We returned to our resort by 2pm, and still had the rest of the day to relax at the pool and beach. I have absolutely NO complaints for Rod and his company- I give him 5 stars, and have referred several of my friends to him. I would also go with the Custom Tour again when I come back to the area."

Everything was we'll explained and they had the best attitude - their #1 goal was for everyone to have a great time. On another note, I left my shoes on the bus we used on our excursion. I called Rod, the owner, when I realized this (after 7pm). He personally answered the phone, and personally found and delivered my shoes to our hotel that evening as we were leaving early the next morning. That is above and beyond any expectations and so very appreciated. Highly, highly recommend this excursion operation."

They picked us up early at our hotel in Playa del Carmen, and we drove over the quicker toll road to Chichen Itza, arriving just as it opened, before the bus crowds arrived. Rod hired a native Mayan guide to show us arround the ruins, which were amazing. Then, after a typical Mayan lunch in Valladolid, we traveled to the lesser known, but very impressive ruins of Ek Balam, where a native Mayan guide showed us around. Katy, an accomplished photographer, walked around with us, allowing us to enjoy the experience while she documented our trip. The photos were later shared with us by email, and make for an amazing memory of our vacation. They truly tailored the trip to our needs. Their experience and positive attitude made our trip a wonderful day. They are the best.Jim, Diana, and Allison"

Initially I had reached out to a different highly rated private tour group, sending three separate messages with no response. I then found The Custom Tour and Rod responded within an hour. He answered all of my questions and provided a breakdown of all costs and fees for the day along with detailed info on what to expect. We booked a tour to tulum and turtle bay. From the moment we started our day, everything far exceeded our expectations. The van was spacious, clean, cool and packed with water and snacks. Along the way, we decided we wanted to check out some cenotes, and Rod without hesitation said of course! He, and his colleague Claire, went above and beyond accommodating our every need. They truly do make you feel like a VIP client allowing you to dictate the whole pace of your day. It was so relaxing and fun! On top of having personal tour guides, the photos were such an added bonus. They made sure to document the day for us and took all the photos we wanted which allowed us to just enjoy our time. We will be referring Rod to all of our friends and already have our tour ideas ready for next year! Do yourself a favor and treat yourself to the VIP experience The Custom Tour provides. They are extremely reasonably priced and are guaranteed to exceed expectations."

The Custom Tour by Rod Ratner is one of the best! We have to admit, we were skeptical when reading all of Rod\u2019s 5 star reviews, but once we contacted him thru email and received his quick responses to our many questions, we knew he was legit. We were able to customize our itinerary and Rod was flexible in taking us exactly where we wanted to go. Rod and his crew, Helio and driver Augustin, were right on time to pick us up (at 6:30am!!) with a clean, roomy van with great air conditioning, cold beverages, and lots of snacks. First stop, Chichen Itza. It was so early that there were hardly any other tourists, great for us because we got several pictures in front of the ruins with no one else around. Rod hooked us up with our guide, Luis, who did an excellent job giving us great insight to the ruins. We also had plenty of time to explore Chichen Itza on our own, which was our main reason for taking this tour. We had mentioned to Rod before the tour that we really wanted to see the Balankanche Cave that not too many people visit. The cave was nearby, but we had a full day tour planned so we hadn\u2019t planned to go. Unbeknownst to us, while we were touring Chichen Itza, Rod drove to the cave and made arrangements for us to have a private tour of this cave. What other tour company would do that?? Another highlight of our day. We then had lunch at a local restaurant in the colonial town of Valladolid. Rod made recommendations and we were not disappointed with our chicken and pork entrees. Local at it\u2019s best!Then we were off to the ruins of Ek Balam, smaller than Chichen Itza and less crowded. We really loved these ruins. Our guide, Francisco, did a great job explaining Ek Balam. Here you can still climb all the ruins where in Chichen Itza you cannot. The main structure is called the El Torre (the Tower) and we climbed straight up the 106 uneven steps to the top for a fabulous view of Ek Balam and the surrounding Yucatan jungle. Another highlight of the day. Helio was with us every step of the way carrying my small backpack and taking pictures of us everywhere we went. As a matter of fact, Helio ran (yes RAN!) down the steep steps of El Torre so he could get a picture of us climbing down the steep steps. All the pictures were posted in a link to a photo album page for us the very next day!We just cannot say enough good things about The Custom Tour, Rod and his crew. He\u2019s knowledgeable, funny and took really good care of us. This tour exceeded our expectations. Rod and Helio, we'll see you again the next time we're in Playa!"

Next stop was to the Mayan village to zip line, canoe, cliff jump, swim and have lunch. I must say this village was the most peaceful place not commercialized at all. It was so serene and calm. The kids absolutely loved it. The food was made by people who live in the village true authentic organic food! Rod and Kaitlin were so professional and top notch at making your trip hassle free. Truly, their goal is for you to relax and enjoy the day. The girls were in heaven and so were my husband and myself. I found Custom Tours off of the reviews of Yelp and trip advisor. I was a little nervous however, after today I had to write a review. If you are visiting and wanting to have a safe and wonderful experience you must book a tour. You will not regret. I rarely write reviews but I absolutely had to for this trip."

We actually had found Rod through trip adviser before we even booked our resort! We had planned to do Coba and snorkeling in Turtle Bay. Little to my knowledge, my then boyfriend and Rod had been planning our engagement for two months before our trip. Rod was the most personable individual. The minute you get picked up you feel comfortable, welcome and know that this is only the start of a soon to be amazing day. We got to Coba before any other tourist, which was fantastic. We got the the pyramid first to climb before anyone else arrived. Rod did an awesome job at keeping me distracted as we climbed while Evan got ready at the top. Rod even provided Evan with some rose petals to scatter at the top! Once I met Evan up there I was absolutely blown away. Rose petals everywhere, the most amazing view from over 150ft in the air and the man I love standing in front of me with the biggest smile on his face. When he asked me to marry him I'm pretty sure my response was \"absolutely!\"Rod continued to deliver through the rest of the day with the most beautiful snorkeling at turtle bay! He made this experience leisurely and easy to follow, we never felt rushed the entire day.He then took us to a delicious restaurant nestled on the beach outside of the resort district, the views were amazing, the service spectacular and the food decadent. Prior to our drive back to the resort he surprised us with some champagne to celebrate. I truly couldn't have imagined a better day. Rod exceeded any and all expectations with flying colors. I cannot wait until we get to return and go on another trip with him. Everyone I know has heard all about him and his tours and I can pretty much guarantee he is going to be seeing more excited individuals from Michigan over the years.Thank you so much Rod!"

I proposed to my now-fianc\u00e9e during our custom tour with Rod, and he helped plan and ensure that it all went perfectly! He went above-and-beyond to make it the most special day possible for us! Rod and I emailed back-and-forth many times over a few months planning our tour, and he was so helpful with sorting out all the details. We did the Coba tour then went snorkeling in Turtle Bay, and I proposed at the top of the tall pyramid in Coba. I was hoping to get there early so it would be a bit more private, so he asked a few local guides to arrive before the park opened for the day so we could get there before anyone else. And sure enough, we were not only the first there that day, we had about 30 minutes at the pyramid completely by ourselves!!! Rod took lots of fantastic photos during the proposal for us, which was so great to be able to share with our families when we got home. And we had our own personal guide at the ruins (every other tour group we saw at the ruins had 20 or more people in them, which would have been very impersonal and difficult to ask questions).After Coba we went snorkeling which was incredible! So many sea turtles swimming up near us, as well as lots of other sea creatures! I had never snorkeled before, but Rod gave very clear and easy tips which made the experience so much fun!!Afterwards, Rod had arranged lunch for us at a small nearby beachfront restaurant (La Lunita) tucked away from all the hustle and bustle of the resort district. The food was incredible and the atmosphere was second to none. Could not have asked for a better location to have a beautiful meal with my beautiful fianc\u00e9e :)And on our drive home, Rod surprised us with a bottle of champagne!! It was a perfect end to a perfect day for us :) And it would not have been possible without Rod. I doubt any other tour companies would do half as much as he did to make our day so memorable. He truly went above-and-beyond my wildest expectations, and I cannot thank him enough. If you are looking to have a truly wonderful day touring all that Riviera Maya has to offer customized exactly how you want it for you and your fellow travelers all at a very reasonable price (or propose to the love of your life like me :) or all of the above!!) then look no further. Rod has you covered!!!"

I was not ready to believe ... but Rod made me to realise how come he was getting all 5*s only.His genuine friendliness/ knowledge/ patience/ helpful nature/ flexibility/ Attention to detail.. the list goes on but I stop here.We were with our 2.5years old daughter. He actively was in a conversation with her too. He even was carrying our bags.. All I can see is genuine passion for customer service & he thoroughly enjoys what he is doing. His service is so natural & real as how one breathes effortlessly.All the tour activities were fantastic & I was even tempted to book another one before we leave. The trip to Mayan ruins, zip lining, Lunch at Mayan's village(AWESOME), Snorkeling, Canoes were all amazing. What I really liked was the timing. We left & reached the hotel before the traffic hit the roads. Another kudos to you ,Rod. Special thanks to you for your help in getting a good deal on souvenir & being a translator at the local pharmacy.If we happen to visit this part of the world again... we will look forward for a similar experience with you.All the Best & Many Thanks. Keep up the great customer service"

            "review": "Great Experience and Tour. To be honest I was a little skeptical when I saw all of the 5 star ratings and no other lower ratings on TripAdvisor. Now I know why they were all 5 star reviews including my own review. The Snorkel Tour led by Pato and our driver Jorge was top notch in all areas. They were prompt on pick up, friendly and very informative as we spent most of the day snorkeling in three different types of ecosystems. Rod and his team have obviously created great relationships with each of the venues we visited as we were whisked to the front of the lines and were in the water at each stop with minimal delays. It was our first time snorkeling and could not have been in better hands than with Pato. Jorge transported us in the van very safely to and from each of the spots. Lunch in Akumal that was included in our tour was excellent and at a very scenic spot right on the ocean. When we were back at the resort we compared notes with others that had gone on snorkeling tours with larger companies and our experience came out on top hands down. If we ever visit again and we plan on doing so, our first call will be to Rod for another tour."

Originally we only booked \"My Favorite Tour\" which includes Underground Cenotes & the Mayan Village experience! After a great day out with Pato and Katy we decided to book a second custom trip with Rod and his wonderful tour guides! On the second day we had Helio and Van, they were so much fun! We went to Coba and added The Natural Aquarium! Booking our Custom Tours with Rod was by far the best decision we made in our vacation! We would highly recommend this tour company to all our friends and family!Thank you for the great photos! What a nice bonus!!!"

Rod was very flexible and allowed us to add in a swim at the Ik Kil Cenote, snorkeling in underwater cenotes, and snorkeling at Turtle Bay! Not only was Rod very accommodating on our tours, he was very responsive in communication before our trip. He is very thorough and knowledgeable. The tour guide Rod provided for Chichen Itza was a local Mayan guide who blew our minds with his knowledge and explanation of the Mayan culture!On our snorkeling trip to Turtle Bay we saw 12 sea turtles, squid, and many fish at a nearby coral reef. This \"extra\" was definitely worth it. We are glad we added it to that day's main tour.We wouldn't hesitate in using Rod again. Some other members of our group used the \"big tours\" offered at the hotel, and their experience was nothing compared to ours (in fact, one of our friends on the \"big tour\" got on the wrong boat while snorkeling)! Rod provides personalized service that is fantastic! You won't be disappointed."

Perhaps this story:We stopped to buy some local handicrafts after the Coba ruins (amazing, Rod has you there before the crowds). The store we were shopping at was having trouble with their credit card reader, and we hadn't bought enough cash with us. Without blinking, Rod pays for our goods out of his own wallet, and tells us to pay him back when we get back to our resort.This is typical of the tour, with Rod treating us like old friends he wanted to show around his favourite parts of Playa del Carmen and surrounds, rather than customers. I couldn't recommend his company more!(He's also great at impromptu Spanish lessons)."

My husband and I took the Beach and Jungle option tour because we wanted a mix of Maya architecture and natural wonders. We were toured by Rod himself and this is one of the best tours I have ever taken, anywhere around the world.Site selection and timing was perfect. We were picked up at 0645 and the early start was 100% worth it. We arrived at the Tulum ruins as they opened, and I have about 50 photos of the ruins with not a single other person in shot. Next Rod took us to the cenote site Dos Ojos. Again only a handful of people here and there, and we were able to enjoy the cenote (and the bats!!!) as long as we wanted. I was just working out how to dive to underwater with the snorkel and Rod let us play in the water like a pair of otters until we were content to leave. Dos Ojos is an incredible site and our visit is one I will remember for life. We've been snorkeling before, and caving before, but never done one inside the other - what an experience. We finished up at the \"natural aquarium\" for another snorkel surrounded by colourful fish.Equipment provision is totally spot on. To protect the fragile ecosystem, you can't wear most mosquito repellents in the cenote but, at his offer, we organised ahead of time to buy organic repellent from Rod on the day. In the very comfortable van we had a cooler at our feet filled with ice-cold water and soft drinks and a basket of snacks we could graze through as and when we wanted. For lunch Rod called ahead to a small local restaurant so our food was ready as soon as we arrived. He knows everything about the places he takes clients so was able to recite menus and reassure us about safety (filter water for ice-cubes etc). The lunch on this tour was one of the best meals I had on the trip. Rod also provided clean, good condition snorkeling gear and advised us exactly which shoes we should wear for every leg of the day so we always felt as comfortable as we could possibly be. After the cenote we had to take a short walk on pebbles so Rod checked if we had tough feet (I really don't) and immediately went and brought our sandals down to us. Rod must be one of the most thoughtful tour guides I have ever met.A final wonderful perk was the dozens of photos Rod took, including very beautiful underwater shots, of our time on the tour. He took fabulous photos of us - many both stunning and so candid that they outshine anything we have in our years of travel albums. He also included photos of the scenery and wildlife we came across. All of this is included in the price (!) and provides a wonderful precious memory of the day.Long review, but there is just so much to praise. This will be the highlight of your time in Playa del Carmen!"

The personal service was far beyond what we expected. Our first day we went to the Tulum Ruins and then snorkelling with our guide Pato and driver Augustine. They get you to the ruins early so we were basically the only people in there. As we were leaving, the bus loads of people were coming in. Snorkelling was AMAZING! So much to see and the scenery is breathtaking. I should also note that the lunch we had on the tour was hands down the best meal I had in Mexico. Our second day we went to Chichen Itza and the Ik Kil cenote with Katarina and our driver Jorge. Again, we got there early to avoid the crowds. In Chichen Itza, we had our own private licensed guide Fernando. As we watched large groups of people following around guides waving clipboards in the air, we had a one on one conversation with the incredibly knowledgable Fernando on a bench in the shade. We also had lunch and swam in the cenote before heading back to our hotel. If your looking to book a tour, I highly recommend Rod's services. We had done group tours before but never again! Want to stop for a coffee? Need to go to the bathroom? No problem, it's just you and they want you to be happy. The value is exceptional for what they offer and I would do it again in a heartbeat. Thanks Rod!!"

Excellent private tour to the Cenotes and Mayan village with Rod, Pato and our driver George.We started the day at 7:00 and went directly to the Cenotes. It was great Rod and Pato were extremely knowledgeable about the areas history, mayan culture and every question our group had. Since we started early we had the Cenotes and the zip lines at Mayan village to ourselves which was a highlight. Did not have to worry about bringing cameras or phones to each spot as we had our very own Paparazzi (Rod) snapping pictures, which were given to our group quickly and free, what a great bonus!Next time we go back I will be booking a Talum ruins tour and having Rod help me setup a deep sea fishing trip.This tour just added to the excellent trip we had, have a will recommend to friends.Thank you Rod and Pato!

But Rod Ratner's service stands out among the best. From the minute I emailed him with my questions regarding options, pricing, availability, concerns to the moment they promptly delivered our photos of our excursion via email, Rod and his team never failed to let my family down. My husband and I were traveling to Playa del Carmen for the first time...and we were traveling with a very inquisitive 5 yo, an infant, and lots of stuff. These are the things that stand out: Rod took a lot of time via emails and a personal phone call to answer our questions and make suggestions for our excursion based on our family's needs and interests. Al, our guide, and Augustine, our driver, were prompt and had an immaculate comfortable van for us [with water and snacks]. Al was informative with all aspects of information related to history, culture, and activities. He was also soooo unbelievably patient with my son. When they dropped us at our hotel at the end of the day, we felt as though we'd had a memorable unique experience with a friend. And a few hours later they emailed us all the photos they'd been taking throughout our day. [An exceptionality nice touch so you don't have to worry about bringing your camera and accidentally dropping it in the cenote!] I cannot recommend Rod's team enough especially if you're traveling with kids. They get you to the ruins before the mass of buses [we saw them walking in just as we were walking out]. They know of local restaurants and cenotes that aren't trampled on by hundreds of tourists. It's a first rate way to experience the region. Thank you, Rod, Al, and Augustine!"

We headed to Tulum ruins, then we ziplined, canoed, swan in a cenote, visited a Mayan village and had a delicious home made lunch. Following lunch we were off to Turtle Bay to swim/snorkel with the sea turtles! It was the best adventure ever! No one in the group had a lot of experience with some of the activities but Pado made our day so enjoyable and relaxing we all did quite well!

Before the tour day we were dreading the early start, but the guys were fine with us stopping for must needed coffee before the journey out. The early start was well worth it though. We got to Chichen Itza and there were only a few vehicles there. Once on the grounds and seeing the main pyramid through the trees for the first time, we were done. It was so amazing to see, and with almost no one on the grounds. We got plenty of great pics of just the ruins with no one else in the pics. Our guide was very friendly, smiley and so knowledgeable about every aspect of the culture and ruins, as he was Mayan as well as an archaeologist. Once we began to leave we saw the sudden influx of hundreds of people. We beat the rush. This also followed through to Ik Kil and Ek Balam as well. No crowds and plenty of time to enjoy the tours and scenery. And the view from the top of Ek Balam was Amazing! The guys were very helpful and we all found that we were all diver's so, the long drives between sites and Playa Del Carmen were filled with dive stories and suggestions from them to us and vice versa. We will definitely get in touch with Rod as soon as we know next time we are heading to Yucatan. And should anyone else lol There are so many options available and Rod and his crew are really good company to hang out with. Thanks guys for the fantastic time."

After an express tour with Rod to Chichen Itza, and shopping with local vendors, we were quick to book Rod for a trip to Tulum then snorkeling in the amazing cenotes of Playa Del Carmen. There was never a dull moment on the drive to and from each attraction. Rod was more than ready to answer our questions from history to local culture, and amenable in any other way to give us the personalized experience we were looking for. The transportation to, and from, each destination was top-notch, and the driver couldn't have been more kind. Rod has the logistics of each attraction down pat. No waiting in lines. No wasting valuable vacation time in traffic. We couldn't have been in better hands. And to top it off, we had a wonderful album of pictures Rod took of us on each excursion - complimentary - waiting for us that evening! We quickly shared these images with family and friends and reminisced about the wonderful memories created on our custom tours. Thanks to Rod, Fernando, Martin and Augustav!

Rod, Helio and Augustine (or driver for the day) arrived at our condo 5 minutes early to start one of the most enjoyable days I have ever had on vacation. I can't say enough nice things about Rod, Helio and Augustine - three great guys dedicated to making our day outstanding, and they did!I scheduled the \"My Favorite Tour\" for our pre-Christmas holiday in Playa del Carmen; 6 adults. We added the Turtle swim option to our tour. Rod led the tour assisted by Helio; warm, welcoming, sincere and full of knowledge about everything on our tour. Their secret is to arrive early to beat the crowds, calmly but efficiently see the sights and press on to the next activity. We never felt rushed as Rod and the team make the whole day fun. They also take photos along the way, included in the tour price, so any photos you bother to take are gravy.The Turtle swim was great; we saw quite a few turtles and Helio said it was a light day. From there we went to the Myan village, an amazing place where we did the zip line, cenote canoe, cenote swim and Mayan lunch. A beautiful place hosted by warm locals; we never imagined doing all of the activities in private with absolutely no one else in the park. Rod has a personal relationship with the villagers, helping them develop their village into a first class destination. Lunch was amazing.We went to another cenote that offered a slightly different environment with some different swimming areas/features and had even more fun with Rod and Helio.By the end of the day we had scheduled the Chechen Itza tour for the following day. Same great service provided by Helio and George with an excellent lunch in Valladodid. We missed Rod, but another great day.You will not regret touring with Rod - not inexpensive, but the tours are a tremendous value. Have fun and tell Rod and Helio \"Hi\"."

Morning of the tour, Helio and our driver for the day, were outside the front gate of the resort right on schedule. After about a 45 minute ride to Akumal beach...the adventure began.We snorkeled with the turtles for almost 90 minutes. It was the best turtle experience I've ever had. You really don't need a guide to see the turtles...but Helio, who snorkels with you, greatly added to the experience by spotting turtles and other sea creatures, as well as, taking great photos of the experience. This stop was without a doubt the highlight of the tour. And because the tour starts so early, when you get to Akumal...you basically have the beach, and the turtles, to yourselves. It was an adventure that I will never forget.The rest of the day included 2 more stops. 3 cenotes and a tropical snorkeling aquarium. Both very nice, but pretty much standard snorkeling stuff. Lunch at the end of the tour by the beach was very nice. Delicious food and you couldn't beat the scenery.In case you haven't figured it out yet...this is a private tour. Just your group, a driver, and a guide. It was just me and my friend. And the 4 of us had a great time thanks to the friendliness and informativeness of Helio.It's adamantly clear that he loves his work. He's got much too say without being overbearing. Most of what he talks about is interesting and informative. We learned a lot about Mexico and it's customs in just 8-9 hours. Helio was made for this type of business. He loves being in the water, has a great personality, and is a terrific photographer to boot. He's the whole package if you're looking for someone for a private tour.The next time I'm in or near Playa Del Carmen...Rod's Custom Tour will be my first phone call."

He arrived to our hotel at 7:30 a.m. with a driver. From the first moment we met Helio, he was a gentlemen with a plan of what we were in store for. We started at Turtle bay and immediately he found about 5 turtles and many fish in the bay. 2 of the turtles had sharks on there backs. Helio told us the sharks were friends of the turtles and not harmful to us. We then drove to the first set of Cenotes which had 3 zip lines over them. We ended up swimming and snorkeling the Cenotes, then got into a canoe and viewed the area. We then drove to another set of Cenotes and swam and snorkeled. This set had some underground and above ground, which were unbelievably beautiful. We then had lunch at a restaurant on the beach, the food was very good. We then ended the day at a Cenote where weddings were performed. Helio and the driver then drove us back to our hotel and we arrived around 4:00 p.m. My wife and I had a great time, not once were we rushed to stop what we were doing. We brought our hotel towels and a set of flip flops, the rest was provided. Oh, one thing I forgot to mention, Helio had a underwater camera and took lots of pictures of everything including us in the water. We can't wait to see them. Helio is knowledgeable about the wildlife, plants customs etc. We want to thank Rod, Helio and our driver (sorry I wish I remembered his name) for such a wonderful day."

It was great to know that he was getting pictures of us experiencing the tour and going further off to get different angles than what I was getting.

However, with Rod and Custom Tours, it is an entirely new and different experience. Rod makes you feel welcome and a V.I.P. from the very start of the tour. My wife and I went on tours to Akumal to see the turtles, swim and explore the local cenotes, and took us to a local school/library to donate clothes and toys. As soon as we entered the Custom Tour's van, we were told exactly what was going to happen throughout the day right down to the menu we were going to have for lunch. The only surprises were in the beautiful places he and the driver took us including the restaurant. Rod, as a self proclaimed \"Foody\" took us to a great restaurant where we also had one of the best meals of our entire trip. There is no rush with Custom Tours: You can go at your own pace and take a break when you need it. You can also progress to the next adventure when you are ready. This you do not get with many other tours. With Custom Tours, we always felt safe and the driver was careful and not in a hurry.Rod and his staff were very knowledgeable of the entire area and very concerned about the environment, natural resources, and the wildlife. Custom Tours also took many pictures and were able to get shots we could not with our own camera. Rod would dive down and get the great angle; shots you can only get with a custom tour.So much fun, we plan to bring our children with us next time to enjoy what we were able to with Custom Tours. You will not want the tour to end when it does and Rod and his staff will want you coming back for more. Great Job Rod and staff!!"

My husband and I have been coming to this area of Mexico for over 20 years, so I was looking for \u201csomething\u201d a little different than the typical tourist sights\u2026I found that in Custom Tours.Rod Ratner was meticulous in planning an itinerary that catered to all our interests. All tour information, payment details, and other arrangements were finalized prior to traveling day. Our hotel helped us contact Rod upon our arrival and plans were confirmed for our excursion day.On the day of our tour, we found Rod to be extremely professional, knowledgeable, and customer service oriented. The day far exceeded our already high expectations. I was shocked that Rod was able to pack our day with full of activities: Akumal Bay, Yal-Ku Tropical Aquarium, 2 centoes, cliff jumping, zip lining, visiting a Mayan Village, and a fabulous lunch. He was vigilant with safety and took take of the smallest of details, all the while providing customer service that was genuinely from the heart. We had an unparalleled experience to anything we have experienced in Playa del Carmen and we won\u2019t hesitate to plan future adventures with Custom Tours. Thanks Rod for a fantastic adventure!"

            "review": "Fantastic tour! Fantastic guide!. After reading other reviews on TripAdvisor, my husband and I booked a custom tour with Rod during our recent trip to Playa Del Carmen. We chose Rod's \"My Favorite Tour\" which features a trip to a Mayan Village where you can explore cenotes, cliff dive and zip-line; a trip to another secluded cenote; and lunch at a great little restaurant on the beach. We first touched base with Rod via e-mail and he was very prompt on responding back to us and was extremely easy to work with on making our arrangements. Most people book trips with him prior to their vacation but we were fortunate enough to book a trip after we had already arrived in Mexico. On the morning Rod picked us up in a private van, it was POURING rain! Since our activities consisted of mostly being wet, we didn't care one bit! We first stopped to explore a few cenotes and had the place all to ourselves! It was so peaceful snorkeling in the crystal clear water (a little chilly at first but your body adjusts quickly!) watching all the unique fish swim around you. I brought a waterproof camera but didn't have to worry about taking pictures because Rod takes them for you with his camera; therefore, I was able to just enjoy the moment! Our second stop was a Mayan Village, where a large Mayan family live and work. At the Mayan Village, we explored an open-air cenote where we had the opportunity to plunge about 15 feet into the cenote from a cliff up above! We also harnessed up and rode the zip-lines and finished up with a brief canoe ride. For lunch, we traveled down the road to a little restaurant on the beach where we enjoyed a great view and some delicious ceviche! The margaritas were pretty tasty too! During our tour, Rod was extremely informative about the cenotes, the beautiful ecosystem, the Mayan people and the area in general. He has such a great personality and made the whole experience FUN! It wasn't like having a typical tour guide with you but rather a really awesome best-friend who is having just as much fun as you are! We will definitely book another tour with Rod on our next trip to Playa Del Carmen!"

We chose the cenote,ziplining, and cliff jumping tour [and lunch is amazing, beachfront restaurant to yourselves! ] Just me and her and rod and let me tell you it was amazing. We had all our activities to just us! But trust us it is worth waking up a little early for. We could not have asked for a better guide. Rod was outstanding!!! He explains everything to you so you have nothing to worry about. Private clean van with drinks and snacks and they pick you up and drop you off at your hotel/resort. You are 100% safe on this tour so for people that are skeptical leaving your resorts you have nothing to worry about, do it!!!! You will be missing out on all the beauty of mexico if you don't do this. We plan on going back next year to do rod's whale shark expedition that's how awesome his tours are! ROD WAS AMAZING AND THE CENOTES ARE AMAZING EVERYTHING ON THE TOUR WAS AMAZING!! please take a tour with him and you\"ll see for your self how amazing it is!!!!!"

            "review": "A weeks worth of fun . My boyfriend and I recently travelled to Cancun and were put onto Rod by one of my friends who could not stop telling us how great he was. I have to admit, he went above and beyond my expectations. From my initial first contact with Rod via email, he was always very prompt and informative. He kept in contact with me up until the day we landed in Mexico. On our Custom Tour, Rod came with his colleague Jorge ( who's very nice as well) and picked us up in a clean van right on time. He took us out to do numerous fun activities such as, snorkeling, diving and exploring cenotes, zip lining etc. Imagine my surprise that when he took us to each and every one of these different places that it was completely empty! ! How incredible is it cliff diving into a fresh cenote with peace and quiet? Rod also takes pictures of the beautiful memories you have , and includes them into your package. I can appreciate that he doesnt take the cheesy route of selling them to you at the end of your tour. My favorite part of the tour? Rod's patience. He displayed an overwhelming amount of patience during the tour. As I dont really know how to swim well, but was still willing to try, so was Rod. He was with me every step of the way encouraging and helping when necessary. Not once did I feel rushed or that Rod was annoyed with me. That is a hard quality to find nowadays.If you want a knowledgeable, professional tour guide who'll give you every penny's worth of an already affordably price private tour, Rod is your guy."

            "review": "Amazing Day-MUST DO . We spent Friday Oct 9 with Rod on a customized tour tailored specifically to our requests. We were picked up promptly on time at our resort where Rod and his driver were waiting for us with snacks water and juice. We started at the Tulum Ruins and Rod had us walking through the gates one minute after they opened. We had our own free time to self explore and were not bound by a large group or tour guide. Because we practically had the place to ourselves our photos are magnificent and aren't filled with tourist mobs. As we were leaving we saw the hoards of crowds being shuttled in and the heat was rising. Very happy to have done this first. From there we went to Akumal Bay to snorkel with turtles. It was fantastic. The bay/beach alone is beautiful let alone the reef that you can swim to right from the shore. We were able to get within ams reach of a few turtles thanks to excellent coaching from Rod on how to behave and move without spooking the turtles. We saw other large groups come stampeding through the bay splashing around and I doubt they were as lucky as us. There were gigantic and colorful fish everywhere. Next was a stop at a beautiful private restaurant in Half Moon Bay called La Lunita. This was, without exaggeration, the freshest ceviche and tastiest tempura fish tacos I've ever had. Truly authentic. The Mole Enchiladas were also fantastic. After lunch Rod took us to an eco park to swim in two types of cenotes. One open air and another cavern underground that was breathtaking. Again, the explanation on how these were formed and the effect they have on the region was highly interesting. Throughout the day Rod proved to be extremely knowledgable and more importantly grounded and friendly. He answered all of our questions. He has been around the world, is very educated in the \"school as life\" as he so accurately described it, and it shows. I am positive we will be booking future trips with him on our return to Mexico. World class."

This was really one of the highlights of our entire trip to Mexico. Following that, we went to the Mayan village, where we were able to zipline and canoe across a beautiful lake, and snorkel in a cenote. It all felt very private and comfortable, and a few days later we received professional and amazing pictures from Rod, which we were extremely excited about and happy to have.

            "review": "Great, relaxing tour seeing Tulum & a Mayan village. We booked a custom tour for two to Tulum and the Mayan village through Rod this September. I initially contact him via email from his website. He answered my emails quickly and we were able to set up a tour. I really appreciated that the website was easy to navigate with good descriptions. Some of the tour group websites have really funky colors and layouts or very little description which makes it difficult to understand what you'll be doing.The tour itself was great. Rod picked us up at our resort at the agreed upon time and chatted with us about Mexico and Tulum on the way there. We got to Tulum right as the park opened so there was only 6 or so other visitors while we were there. There were a lot of mosquitos but the site was beautiful. We were able to walk around at our leisure to see all the ruins, sights and wildlife/fauna. I really dislike being stuck in large tour groups and shuttled around from crowded site to crowded site so this worked out really well for us. We saw quite a few tour buses pull in as we were leaving so it was great that we beat the crowds. Next we stopped by the Mayan Village to zip-line, canoe and (my personal fave) swim in the cenote. Again, we were 3 of the 6 visitors to the village so it was quite nice and peaceful. My partner really enjoyed the zip-lining over the large open air cenote. Although we brought a camera, Rod did take pictures with his camera for us as well. That was a nice perk since we normally travel with just the two of us so we can't get many pictures with both of us. My favorite was the cenote. The freshwater was a bit cool when we first went it but we got used to it pretty quickly. The cenote is about 15 ft deep max. The water was crystal clear and you could clearly see a variety of fish swimming about. There's two caves on either end the pool that was pretty cool to look at. We snorkeled a bit and relaxed in the pool. It was really beautiful and relaxing environment; a great way to wrap up the trip. Afterwards, we took a nice walk through the village and jungle. On our way out, we passed a large tour bus headed into the village. We capped off our visit with lunch at a lovely little place called La Lunita at Half Moon Bay north of Akumal (see separate review). Rod called ahead and placed our orders as we were driving before we arrived so the food was ready shortly after we got there. We had a great lunch on the beach with delicious (and pretty strong) margaritas. An iguana sunned itself on the ledge next to our table which was exactly what I wanted to do after wonderful morning plus a great lunch and drinks. Overall, the tour was great. I loved the fact that we managed to stay ahead of the crowds and enjoyed being able to relax and really take in the sights. Throughout the time, Rod chatted with us a bit about Mexico and the sights but also random other things. It felt much more like a conversation rather than a tour guide reciting a book, which was really nice. I went to Chichen Itza and Ik Kil cenote with a large tour group a few years ago and while this was a bit more expensive it was WAY preferable. Definitely book a tour with Rod!"

Rod took quality pictures for us and sent the file to us later, so that we wouldn't have to lug around a camera. I highly recommend The Custom Tour by Rod Ratner.

Our tour with Rod was a highlight of our trip and he truly set the bar high so that all other activities got compared to him.After several emails back and forth, we booked a trip with Rod. If I knew now how great it would be, we would have booked a Chichen Itza trip with him as well before his days and our days were all filled up!My adult son and I took My Coba Tour and added on Akumal Bay and a Cenote. This was lot to pack into one day but it worked. Rod picked us up early so that we could beat the crowds at Coba. He did it too! We were the first to arrive and were able to climb the pyramid and descend before anybody else arrived. As we biked and walked the site, the local guide Rod contracted with and Rod provided us with lots of interesting information.After Coba, we went to Akumal Bay to swim with turtles. We had taken our own snorkeling equipment and rash guards. You do need to wear a life vest - trust Rod when he says to go smaller than you think. Again, they timed it so that we would be in between crowds. For lunch we stopped at La Lunita, Rod went over our options with us before we arrived (you are on your own for alcohol), made sure we had no trouble ordering, and we enjoyed lunch on the beach. After lunch, we stopped at Chicken Ha Cenote. We swam in two cenotes with Rod and then he took us to a third cenote which is still actively used for ceremonial purposes. As we were leaving, crowds started arriving. He definitely hast the timing down! After that, it was back to our hotel.I think Rod reads people very well. His style worked well with me and with my son. There were no language/translation issues - I believe he is tri-lingual. He is committed to what he is doing and making your experience with him and in Mexico the best it can be. We wanted to go scuba diving, he made a recommendation and then made calls from the road to help us get it all set up. Throughout the day, Rod took pictures with his GO Pro and then just a few days later he sent us an edited set of pictures to remember our day. Along the way, we had plenty of water, snacks, juices, bathroom breaks, never felt rushed, and truly felt pampered. We were uncertain about the tips for our Coba guide and wait staff at lunch - Rod skillfully asked us what we were thinking and then let us know that it was not expected but would be greatly appreciated. I had left my sun hat on the van with Ocean Tours the day before. Since Rod knew our tour guide socially, he offered to follow up with him and see if it could get returned. The hotel said my hat had been returned and offered me a very large sombrero - funny guys - you made me smile. When I return to Playa del Carmen, I'll gladly tour with Rod again. In the meantime, I'll recommend him as widely as I can. As a note, you'll be making a deposit via paypal and then paying your balance in cash. Rod was careful to make sure that we knew which ATMs were safest to use (at Scotiabank bank - never the freestanding ATM on Quinta). Rod recommended the Acanto Hotel and Suites and Elia of Freelance Scuba Service. We highly recommend both."

            "review": "Honest Review of Rod Ratner's Tour - Pros & Cons!. Let me first start off stating that I'm a lover of reading reviews, but don't like posting them. That being said, because I found Rod's services beyond excellent, I found that I absolutely had to tell everyone about them. We are a family of four with 2 kids - boy 14, girl 11. We don't like crowds and my husband gets grumpier as it gets hotter (can anyone relate?). Thus, picking Rod's private tour was worth the cost if you're looking for low stress, relaxation, no crowds, customized for YOUR family, and just perfect in all ways.We had picked the Mayan tour and added the turtle snorkel which includes a visit to Tulum, canoeing, zip lining, cenote swim, visit to Mayan families, lunch, and snorkeling. Lots of variety in activities. Rod was there promptly to pick us up at around 7am from our resort and got to Tulum before all the crowds -- in fact, we were the very first ones into the ruins. Along the ride, Rod gave us a history lesson and showed us the best path to take and what to look for. An hour or so was all we needed in Tulum before we were off to the Mayan village. There, we did all the activities of zip lining, canoeing, and the best part was meeting the Mayan children and donating them with school supplies we had brought ahead of time. My kids were touched by meeting other kids from other parts of the world. After that was lunch at this Yucatan restaurant that Rod had arranged that was freshly made and amazing! Then the turtle swim of course was great! Rod swam with us and we followed him around to locate fish and turtles. Pros: - First, attention to details. Rod was prompt, organized, and everything was arranged ahead of time. Tickets were bought ahead, lunch was preordered as we were driving, snacks and drinks were in the car, snorkels and fins of multiple sizes were provided, the van was cleaned every time we stepped out of the car, the van was air-conditioned as we were walking toward it so it was COOL by the time we walked inside of it, our wet towels were dried out in-between activities so we could reuse them, etc. I could go on and on. It's these details that make everything so easy and so enjoyable. - Second, Rod himself was personable and kind and really just a wonderful tour guide that made everyone feel at ease - Third, Rod takes pictures and sends you digital photo album as part of the tour price. Our family could enjoy the tour and know that Rod was going to capture every moment of it. We LOVED looking at our album afterwards and they really were great pictures of high quality. This definitely was a highlight of our Riviera Maya trip!Considerations: - A private tour is more costly than not. BUT, in Riviera Maya -- not by too much. It's really hard to do a perfect side by side price comparison, but I'd say that I paid maybe $40 per person more on Rod's tour than a public tour. Was the extra money worth it? Absolutely! - The balance for Rod's tour is dealt in cash. Not a big deal, but it was something we had to plan for."

I truly was blown away by how amazing this day was. Rod and Patrick picked us up nice and early from our resort so we can beat the crowds. They gave us facts on Tulum the entire way to the Ruins which was awesome. They brought us snacks and beverages which came in handy. We were one of the first groups at Tulum and we toured the ruins with not many people around. After we went to Tankah Village and we zip lined across the water then canoed which both was so much fun. Even my 80 year old grandfather participated!!! Then we cliff jumped into a Cenote which was by far the most beautiful refreshing water i have even swam in. I could have spend hours and hours in that water. it was WONDERFUL. We then were served a fantastic lunch by the Mayan locals. After lunch we went to visit with the Mayan Children which was extremely eye opening. My entire family brought a few bag fulls of clothing and toys to give to the kids. It was AMAZING, we got to play football and soccer with them and take pictures. To see the excitement on these kids faces was priceless. It made me appreciate my life what i am fortunate to have a little bit more. I cannot say one thing bad about this day. I am so grateful to have had this opportunity and cannot thank Rod and Patrick enough for making sure we had a great day. They both were friendly, funny and overall just great people. I would HIGHLY suggest this tour for anyone who is interested. A day my family will never ever forget."

We greatly appreciated his passion for the beauty and splendor of the people and nature of Mexico. Prepared and professional, balancing our time and experience, keeping us informed and safe, Rod could not have provided a more perfect day. We explored Tulum before the crowds, zip-lined and canoed, swam in a crystal clear cenote, played futball with delightful Mayan children, snorkeled with sea turtles and enjoyed the most delicious lunch at La Lunita . Custom activities and personal attention made for an exceptional experience we will never forget. And all of the great photos, a priceless bonus, had us smiling and laughing all over again, wishing to be back. So we are planning for 2016 and a swim with Rod and the whale sharks!"

Rod and his assistant were waiting in the lobby for us on the day of our tour. It was an early start to the day, but after seeing the crowds as we were leaving the park we knew why Rod suggested an early departure. Rod was able to keep our 14 and 10 year old engaged and learning the whole way to the ruins (we chose to go to Coba). Rod had maps, tons of local knowledge and great sense of humor. We filled our time driving with lots of questions which they were able to answer for us. We also went swimming in a cenote, zip lining, and to the Mayan Village. When we go back to Mexico, we will absolutely be calling Rod again for a new adventure. Not having to go from hotel to hotel picking up and dropping off other folks was icing on a delicious cake!!! P.S. We didn't wait in one line all day - perfect!!!!!"

Don't waste your time with the resort tours. Get in touch with Rod before you go and tell him what you are looking for. My husband and I went with our 7 grandchildren (ages 12-22) plus their parents. 14 of us all together. We had the best day. Rod and his partner Juan were so nice and accommodating. It was a little bit of everything for everyone. I cant say enough about this company and Rod Ratner. My grandchildren had a great time as did the adults. If you are looking for a tour definitely get in touch with this man."

When we got home from vacation our boys stated that that our day with Rod was the best day of their vacation. We started with Tulum first thing in the morning and I can say that this is the only way to see these ruins. We were there before the crowd and left before we got too hot. Rod was ready for us as soon as we walked out. Then we headed to the Mayan village where we zip lines, cliff jumped and canoed. He was very attentive too our children and they had a blast. We next went snorkeling with the turtles and headed to lunch. He kept the day moving at a great pace and was very informative on our drive in the van. We had plenty of snacks for the kids too. Lunch was very cool by the beach and we were happy to get away from our resort. We finished the day with snorkeling in a lagoon and the kids loved it. It was very relaxing and a great way to end the day. The van was very clean and always cool and ready for us with a driver. We were treated very well and it was nice to have cold drinks offered to us and a towel when we got back to the van. Our boys absolutely loved Rod and so did we. He provided a fantastic family experience for us on our vacation and I would without hesitation do it again! Well done Rod!"

He does customize your tour, based on what YOU want to do. We were picked up in a fully air conditioned van. Our first stop was swimming with turtles in Turtle Bay. Rod made sure to get us there early so we beat the crowds. We were the only ones there!! After that we made our way to a Mayan village. We had made arrangements ahead of time to bring toys and supplies to the children. What an amazing experience. We will never forget that! We had lunch at the Mayan Village. Again, we were the only ones there. We watched the women make tortillas over the open fire, and then we gorged on tons of food....rice, beans, chicken, pork, fruit.We also visited several cenotes during the day, and again at most of the we were the only ones there! Rod is a wonderful person who we have the pleasure of calling friend. We will see him again next year for yet another adventure. Don't miss an experience of a lifetime!"

They arrived early and were waiting in our lobby when we got down and were ready to go. They had some granola bars and waters and juice. Rod explained so much about Mexico as a whole and modern history on our ride to Chichen Itza. He was funny and fun and easy to get along with. His English was great. He was more than willing to do whatever we wanted but also gave us fantastic recommendations. Included in the price we got a historical local Mayan tour guide at Chichen Itza. Julio, our guide recommended by Rod, was superb!! We couldn't have been happier. Julio knew so much about the ruins, the history, the dates, the theology, the archaeology - it was amazing! He knew how to convey all of the information in an interesting and understandable way. He even drew us a diagram at one point to explain why a particular structure was built a certain way. He knew all of the influences that caused certain decisions. Rod was with us and took a ton of pictures the whole time which was very helpful so we could focus on Julio and the sites and not see the whole thing through a lens. After we completed the tour, we left to go to the Cenote only 5 minutes away. We got there early (see below on Rod's amazing timing) and were able to go down and swim in the Cenote for a while. What an amazing beautiful place! Rod also took pictures of us from above for this too! Rod's timing was great. If you want to really enjoy yourselves and not be overwhelmed by crowds, follow his lead. He left early and we go to Chichen Itza when very minimal people were around. We got to have a great tour and see everything and ask all of our questions. At no point did we feel rushed. But with that, we got to leave there and get to the Cenote also before all the crowds. Rod knew the timing well - he advised us to swim for 15-20 minutes or so and we would beat the crowds for the lunch buffet (also included). He wasn't forcing us at all - we could swim how we liked - just his advice. We took his advice and we were the first for food. While we ate we saw 3 bus loads come in and were very happy we took Rod's advice. The food at the buffet was awesome!! We couldn't have been happier with it. Rod made sure we had tortillas and chips to make tacos out of the buffet bar. It was all very good. We just got back, but Rod said he will have the pictures within a week or so which is great! Can't wait to see them all!"

We were able to go to Tulum early in the morning before all the big crowds got there. Since it was just us, we were able to leave early and get on with our day without having to wait for the rest of a large group. The Mayan Village was the highlight of our trip!! Cliff diving, zip lining, canoeing... It was wonderful. The water we swam in there was out of this world amazing, it was so clear. We also loved bringing the children toys and visiting the homes of the people who lived in the village. I really loved it. The icing on the cake was the fantastic pictures Rod emailed us a few days later. He really captured our fun and exciting day, and they are pictures that will always be treasured. Thank you, Rod!!! I look forward to booking another excursion with you again one day!!"

            "review": "Once in a lifetime experience!. \"The Custom Tour by Rod Ratner\" is not your average tour company. Our family enjoyed a once in a lifetime experience full of memories we will treasure forever. My interaction with Rod began with the reservation emails. Rod was courteous, professional and immediately responsive. When he says custom he means it. Our family consists of 5 children and 4 adults ranging from 9 years of age to mid 40\u2019s. We have various interests and levels of fitness. Our wish list included something active, beach time, interaction with the local community, delicious food, snorkeling with sea turtles/stingrays. Rod and his team took care of us all!Pick up was right on time in our hotel lobby. We met Rod and his colleague Katy. They escorted us to a spotless Mercedes van and met our great driver Augustin. They provided a light breakfast (fruit, granola bars, and juice) and snacks for munching throughout the day (chips, cookies, water). We enjoyed fun conversation and Rod shared history and answered questions as we headed to Tulum to tour the Mayan Ruins. We arrived early enough to enjoy the ruins virtually alone. We were free to explore and take pictures unencumbered. My only two suggestions would be to bring ample mosquito spray if it has stormed recently and a camera!You only needed a camera for Tulum because Rod and Katy took OVER 150 wonderful photographs which they shared with us as part of the tour package. They even got underwater shots! They are top notch! Simply Amazing!After Tulum we were off to zipline canoe, and then cool off in a beautiful, crystal clear cenote. The older kids also got to cliff dive! ( Note: several of us had never ziplined before. After thorough instructions, we all participated and had a wonderful time.) Next we got to share gifts we brought from the US with some of the local guides for their families followed by the privilege of being invited into a Mayan home where we got to personally hand out a few treats to children. Rod was so thoughtful he arranged for my husband and I to take the remaining school supplies and clothes to a local children's library.We took a short walk to the van and drove to Akumal where we had lunch at a beach side restaurant (all included except drinks and gratuity). It satisfied our wide\u2013ranging palettes (caviar to chicken nuggets) The ceviche and strawberry Mojito were the best I had ever had! The kids had fried calamari rings, spaghetti, and tostados. The adults had grilled fish and various tacos. Then we all enjoyed delicious desserts. After a leisurely lunch, we headed off to swim with sea turtles!I cannot say enough about our sea turtle experience. The beach seemed crowded, but Rod and Katy led us to areas in pairs where we were able to observe these beautiful sea creatures alone. I would be remiss if I did not share how patient and caring Rod was with our 12 year old. He sent most of the party off with Katy and he and my husband stayed with her. She is a tentative swimmer and had a number of problems with her snorkeling mask staying in place due to her thick, unruly hair. The concept of breathing through her mouthpiece was also foreign to her. Rod was determined to give her a memorable and positive experience. It took a great deal of time to get her acclimated and snorkeling. It culminated in what she said was one of her life\u2019s best moments, holding hands with her dad as they gazed down at a sea turtle\u2014Rod captured it on film.When we returned to shore, Augustin was faithfully watching all of our belongings as he had all day and had even organized our flip flops for us. He was awesome! After Akumal we went to visit more cenotes, some of which were in caves. The underwater rock formations we saw were awe-inspiring. My brother who is a seasoned scuba diver remarked he had never seen anything like them. We swam for a little while and headed back to the hotel. What a day\u2026history, adventure, beach, sea creatures, philanthropy, food, fun, perfection!"

Here is the skinny:- He takes professional looking pictures so you dont have to worry about taking them. Just enjoy your time.- He plans for the best times to be at the sites. We left Chitzen Itza when the crowds were coming in, we swam in the cenote during the lunch rush, we had the Mayan Village all to ourselves (my girlfriend said she felt like a rock star), we were the second group inside Tulum.- Fees for entrance and meals are included in the price so there is much less to worry about and you really see the value of your money.- We were the only ones on the tour so it was private, exclusive and we could make our own decisions about what we wanted to do and how long we wanted to take.Simply put, it was MORE than worth it."

After reading all of the reviews of Rod Ratner and his custom tour, we decided it was exactly what we were looking for. We booked the \"Beach and Jungle\" Tour and added the underground Cenotes.Let me start by stating that we have done many \"Excursions\" in the past, some good and some bad. But this was nothing like any we have done before. This was your own private day with friends doing what you wanted and seeing some amazing sites like no other. Rod showed up early with a nice clean private van with snacks and drinks for the day. As we drove to Talum, he explained what he had planned for the day and educated us on the land and sites we would be seeing. From that point on, it was one amazing site after another. Each site we visited, it was like we were the only ones there. We never had to wait on other tourist, or deal with any crowds. It was just our own perfect, private, tour. I only wish that there was a Rod Ratner in each our vacation destinations so we could get this type of service each year. We also very much enjoyed all of the awesome pictures you took and shared with us.Thanks for an amazing day Rod!"

I have done a decent amount of travelling (mostly small group and personalized excursions) and this was the best private/personal guided tour I've experienced. Our guide was incredibly knowledgeable, kind and easy to talk to. One of my sons was afraid to go into the fresh water pools, it could have ruined the day because he could have been bored or felt excluded. Instead, our guide picked up on my son's interest in the wildlife and made him feel a part of our day regardless of his inability to go into the cenotes. Our guide's knowledge and personal interest in the ruins, Mayan culture, history, wildlife and plants was more than impressive. He was a fantastic educator, which is so much better than a preacher or someone who recites facts. We enjoyed every minute of our day including a fantastic authentic Mexican lunch by the beach (ok, maybe the fries my kids wanted weren't so Mexican...). At lunch we met Rod and he actually made the French fry order, again, great thinking!!! It was wonderful to meet Rod, he is overflowing with positive energy and pride in his work. It was immediately apparent that his goal is to provide the best experience for his clients, and he certainly accomplished that on our full day excursion. KUDOS!!"

Guiper is so much fun, very friendly with a wealth of knowledge. We started the day early and headed to Tulum to see the archeological site of the Mayans, we got there early and beat the crowd. Mosquitos were biting, so I recommend using repellant. Guiper told us everything we wanted to know about the Mayans and their culture. It was a good start to the day. Then he took us to what seemed to be a secret place, a slice of paradise tucked away in the Jungle. The land was operated by a group of Mayan families and included a Mayan village, so cool! There we zip lined, even our youngest (4.5) zip lined over the Cenote! So much fun! Then we canoed the cenote, it was so peaceful and beautiful. The water was so clear, we saw lots of turtles - the kids loved it. Then we swam in another cenote and even jumped off a cliff into one, our oldest son (7) even jumped off. It was just an amazing experience because we were the only ones there. That was because Guiper got us there early, and I cannot say how happy we were. It was a family experience that none of us will ever forget. After that we went for lunch in Akumal, which was just beautiful. The food was good, but the view of the bay was even better. It was not on the agenda, but my wife and I jumped into the water for a little snorkeling while Guiper watched the kids. The day was just perfect. We wish we did this tour towards the beginning of our trip, because we would have done it again on another day, it's that good! We hope to be back to Mexico soon, and will definitely do this tour again!"

            "review": "Awesome Tour Day! Mayan Village & Yal-Ku Lagoon. My husband and I vacationed in the Riviera Maya region the last week of May 2015. The best part of our trip was our tour with Rod Ratner. We have been to the region many times before and went on a few big bus tours. This time we wanted a more personal tour at our own pace. After much researching, I found Rod Ratner Custom Tours on TripAdvisor.I emailed Rod with a few things we wanted to do and see. He offered suggestions and gave us a custom tour day.My husband is 64 and I am 58. We are both in good health, but the heat is hard for me to tolerate. With that in mind, Rod organized our trip to stay cool. I never felt overheated during the tour.Rod and his driver Guiper picked us up at our resort at the appointed time of 7:45 in a clean air-conditioned van. Rod had a cooler with water and snacks. We drove to the Tulum area to visit a private Eco park with a Mayan village.The park has two open air cenotes. One is the largest in the area. It was a short walk from the parking lot to the cenote on a gravel path. The canopy from the jungle gave plenty of shade and there was a cool breeze.First up was the zip line. The first line was short at 75 yards. I have never zip lined before, but felt at ease with the safety procedures in place and Rod\u2019s instructions. The platform was an easy walk up a small hill with a set of steps. We did the short zip line over the cenote a few times.There is a pavilion with shelves to place your bag and towels. The pavilion has benches to sit and water dispensers. We only took a few GoPro accessories and towels in our backpack. We left our other camera and money in another backpack locked in the van. The platform for the short zip line is the same for the long zip line. The long zip line is 150 yards and you zip from one end of the cenote to the other end. Very exhilarating! Having never zip lined before I felt perfectly safe and at ease.We then hopped into canoes. Rod was in his own canoe and stayed with us explaining the features of the cenote, pointing out wildlife, and showing us the routes through the channels. One takes you to an area with a cave. Breathtaking views and relaxing! We made our way back to the dock by the pavilion. It was an easy canoe paddle touring the cenote.We then rested in hammocks and enjoyed the views. There are concrete block out houses that are very clean and well maintained. There is also a smoking area next to the pavilion. After a short walk on a gravel path, we went to a smaller cenote for swimming. There is a pavilion at this cenote too with water dispensers and shelves for your bags. The cenote has a dock with steps into the water. Life jackets are available. There is a cliff at one end of the cenote for cliff jumping. My husband jumped twice!When we finished swimming, we went for another short walk on a gravel path to see the Mayan Village. We brought color pencil sets and coloring books for the young children. The Mayan families are very friendly and we enjoyed touring their village.From the village it was a short walk back to the van. Rod was very informative of the area and we learned a lot. We never felt rushed during our tour of the Eco park and the tour was at a nice relaxing pace. We were the only visitors at the Eco park since we arrived early. As we were leaving in the van, a bus pulled into the park. We are very happy we arrived early around 9:00 A.M. We traveled next to Yal-Ku lagoon in Akumal. There are restrooms, an outdoor shower, changing rooms, and a snack bar with seating. The short walk to the lagoon features beautiful sculptures. My husband snorkeled with Rod. I took a dip on the steps into the water and then shot time-lapse photos on a rock outcropping. Rod supplied the snorkel gear. Eco friendly sunscreen is required at the lagoon and at the cenotes. We purchased a bottle from Rod. It applied like regular sunscreen and not like the usual reef safe chalky sunscreen. Rod offers the sunscreen at a very reasonable price.After snorkeling, we changed into dry clothes and drove to lunch. The lunch was on the beach at a restaurant attached to a boutique hotel on Half Moon Bay in Akumal. I was expecting an average lunch, but was pleasantly surprised by the \u201cfine dining\u201d meal. The meal was included in our tour! We were only responsible for drinks and tip.Rod and Guiper are very knowledgeable of the area and we learned a lot on our tour. They are both helpful and respectful. Rod took photos all day and it is his gift to his clients. I asked him to shoot underwater video snorkeling with my GoPro. He did a great job with the photos and video. The tour was relaxing and I did not feel overheated at any time.We have been to the Riviera Maya many times before and wish we had toured with Rod. I can\u2019t wait until our next vacation and we will definitely book a tour with Rod! His rates are comparable to the bus tours.Check out his FB page. I will share video later."

First, a snorkel swim with turtles in the morning, involving a gentle walk into the water, and a slow swim with views of turtles feeding on the bottom. The slow pace was great for the first-timer snorkelers in our group. The turtle swim was followed by a leisurely, informative trek through an actual living Mayan village, with zip line, cliff jumping, canoeing, and swimming in a gorgeous cenote. Rod finished the day up for us by arranging with the villagers to prepare us a delicious outdoor lunch. On the van rides to the destinations, Rod gave us background on each of the places we would see; he did this narration very professionally and unobtrusively (as I am one who likes to take in every bit of scenery I can during road trips in new places, while listening to the guides). Also, he and his crew were always patient and helpful with any equipment and supplies we needed. For a day excursion for water and jungle activities, I can enthusiastically recommend Rod Ratner's tour company."

We had an absolutely amazing day due to this amazing team of individuals. Rod and his team went so far above what we could ever have expected or hope for to make sure this was one of the most memorable day of our entire trip. From the moment they picked us up it was very clear that this was nothing like those ordinary over crowded tour packages. The attention to detail and extras that you would never expect were so surprising and made this tour one of the best parts of our family trip that we will never forget. Originally I was just looking for any tour and activity that would allow us to include my 4 year old grandson but I got so much more when I connected with Rod and booked our family tour with him. There really is so many great things about our day with Rod and the team that I could never mention them all here and do the team justice. All I can really say is if you are looking for a truly amazing tour and team than Rod Ratner tours is the only one who can and will deliver a day you and your family will never forget. He has an amazing team, great customizable tour packages full of amazing adventures and a true taste of Mexico and their home that they share so generously that no other tour company could ever provide. I am amazed at the value for all that my family received and let me stress that this is truly a private tour that you work with Rod to create especially for you and your family and then he and his team set out to make it the most unique and amazing day that you will have. My grandson has repeatedly asked about his new friend Rod in the green shirt every day and it is so cute. The memories that he alone has taken away from our day with the team is priceless. As I said this review cannot do Rod and his team justice for ALL that they did for our family on our day just so many little and big things we never expected, right down to having a car seat for our little guy even though they never even knew that the airport had lost his car seat and we were worried about that but when we got to the van we realized that Rod had literally thought of everything when we seen a car seat waiting for our little guy. If you do one thing if going to Playa de Carmen, contact Rod and schedule your own special day and I promise that you will not be disappointed and will be so glad that you did. Our family certainly was. Thank you too Rod for the amazing pictures and how wonderful you and the team was with our little guy and our whole family we had an amazing time and you guys are incredible!"

This tour was organized by our friends as a wedding gift and I could not have asked for a more memorable gift!We did the Turtle Snorkel and Mayan Village tour. We started out with the turtles and saw amazing things! So many turtles and rays and we saw such beautiful coral. Rod and his crew did a great job with staying and guiding the group. They even got my mom comfortable enough to snorkel, something she was TERRIFIED to do. After we headed to the Mayan Village for some zip lining, kayaking and swimming. Amazing! The lunch at the end was superb and delicious! I would do another tour with Rod in a heartbeat. It was well organized, professional, educational and above all FUN!!! Plus, Rod took pictures of the whole trip so the memories will be there forever."

Was easy to organise and rod allowed us flexibility in customising our trip so we could squeeze all we wanted to do in one day! Picked us up early so we could be the first into tulum which was amazing! Bought snacks and took pictures all day which was great as normally there is always one of us taking the picture so someone is usually missing. We then went cliff jumping and zip lining which was great fun! My friend cut her foot quite badly (she is v clumsy) and rod and his team were straight there helping her and dealing with the cut. We also went canoeing and swimming in the cenote which was amazing. A lunch was then arranged for us in a local village which was delicious. The whole day couldn't be faulted rod and his team were so friendly and flexible we were never in crowds and it really felt like a personalised individual experience! My only regret is we didn't find him sooner in our stay so we could book more trips!"

They were very organized and on top of every detail of our excursion. We opted for the Mayan Village Adventure with the Turtle Sanctuary add on. Rod took us to the Turtle Sanctuary first to avoid the crowds and it was awesome. They pointed out so many things during the snorkel. We are mostly all certified scuba divers however we had a couple of people who were not comfortable in the water however Rod and his crew took total care of them. I was not sure what to expect with the Mayan Village Adventure however it was alot of fun! The lunch we were served was authentic and amazing. Rod sent us a whole photo album after our excursion with awesome photos of everyone. This was a gift from us to the wedding couple and everyone raved about it. Thanks Rod for a great time! I want to come back and see the whale sharks.....I highly recommend Rod Ratner and his crew to anyone you will not be disappointed. I found him on Trip Advisor!!"

It was absolutely amazing and the highlight of our vacation to playa delcarmen and the Mayan riviera. He picked us up right on time with drinks and snacks ready to go at 650am. We visited the Tulum Ruins before the crowds and got breathtaking photos. From there he guided us to some great shopping and then off to the Mayan village for the most memorable part of gynecologist trip. While there, we zip lined, canoed and swam in a private cenote, including a cliff jump. After that we visited with Mayan villagers and handed out numerous toys and clothes we brought for the children. It was truly amazing to see them in their element and three families invited us into their homes. Some of the villagers were in the process of building a church. That visit was the bets part of the whole day. From there we went snorkeling with sea turtles and sting rays getting so close to a half dozen of them. We headed off to a authentic Mexican lunch on the beach and finished the day with snorkeling with tropical fish in a local lagoon. Rod was so informational about the area and truly did everything to give us the best tour possible. We feel like we made a good friend in a single say with him. He took amazing pictures of all us all day long and that was included for in the tour. I promise you, you wiill never go wrong hiring Rod. He will cater a tour to whatever your needs are. This all day tour was the most memorable and truly sensational thing we could have ever asked for. thank you Rod and we will suggest you to everyone we know coming to Mexico.We look forward to another trip tops radish and seeing you for another tour.Matt and Tracy"

Rod came highly recommended from a friend and the tour was all that we hoped for! We were greeted at our hotel by a Rod's smiling face and enjoyed a comfortable van ride with Guillermo, fully stocked with beverages and snacks, to our destinations. We were able to begin our day at Tulum before bus loads of people took over. Every aspect of our day was so well planned. The Mayan Village was a great family experience of zip lining, cliff jumping and swimming in the crystal clear Cenotes. With Rod's recommendation my children brought along clothing and coloring books for the Mayan children. There were smiles on all faces! We had a delicious Mexican lunch at a beautiful beach restaurant. Our highlight of the day was snorkeling with sea turtles. My family was able to experience so much that Mexico has to offer with Rod's knowledge of the land and people. Rod documented our day with photos and now we have everlasting memories of our day in paradise. I wouldn't tour Mexico without Rod! Thank you Rod for a day we will never forget!"

I had gotten on Trip Advisor a few months ago to plan an excursion for our stay in Playa, and all of the big companies were close to the top. I just happened upon reviews for Rod's company, and they sold me! He gives you SUCH a personal experience. He makes sure you arrive at your destination a good hour before the huge tour companies get there, and you end up having the places all to yourselves! He is also a WEALTH of information about what you are exploring for the day, and about the area in general. We were also blessed to have his driver, Guiper, with us on our tour, and he is super charming as well. He's also a very safe driver which seems hard to find in Mexico! :D The bottom line is that you can NOT go wrong using Rod as your tour guide, and I can't recommend him ENOUGH for your family's vacation. You will get more personal service than you would EVER get from one of the big companies, and you will see things you would never get to see with them either. Feel free to contact me with questions! Don't let your travel agent or airport transport service talk you into one of their big tours!!! Go for PERSONAL!!!"

            "review": "Rod is amazing and so are his tours!. Our family of 5 just returned from a week long vacation in Playa del Carmen (4/6/15-4/13/15) with another family of 4. My friend found Rod Ratner's website online during our trip planning phase. After seeing the website and all of the fabulous pictures/reviews we decided to book the cenote/mayan village/Coba/turtle bay trip. It was one of the best vacation decisions I have ever made.From the initial e-mail communications with Rod, I could tell that he is a stand-up/can-do guy. He is very responsive, friendly, accommodating, flexible and FUN! Booking the trip was smooth and easy through Paypal. He was patient and positive with some last minute changes we had to make to the trip. Rod and Elio (the other guide) picked us up right on time at our respective hotels in a private Mercedes van which was air conditioned, roomy and comfortable for our party of 9. Bananas, granola bars and a cooler of beverages awaited us as we set off for Coba. An hour of lively conversation led me to book another excursion with Rod before we even got out of the van.Upon arrival at Coba, Rod and Elio told us to leave our cameras behind since they would take all of the pictures. And they DID! Fabulous ones! Like our own personal paparazzi! Trust them and just enjoy the day and experience and leave the picture taking to the two of them. We have some of the BEST vacation pictures EVER from this trip.Rod is masterful at staying on schedule without making you feel that you are being rushed through all of the wonderful places you visit on this tour. We beat all of the crowds since we started our day early. After having our breath taken away at Coba, we moved on to the Mayan village where we zip lined over a gorgeous cenote, swam/dived into yet another amazing cenote then had a delicious lunch cooked by the Mayan villagers. We met a mayan family and their children who graciously allowed us into their home where my friend gave them art supplies and a toy she brought from home. Our whirlwind day next took us to Akumal (\"turtle bay\") where Rod and Elio handled getting all of the snorkeling equipment and managed all of our gear for us. They were both fantastic with all of the kids and keeping up with everybody in our group so that we could mindfully enjoy seeing all of the sea turtles (and a spotted eagle ray!) without having to constantly be distracted with trying to keep our eyes on the kids every second. Both Rod and Elio are fantastic with children and are able to pay attention to everyone in the group and recognize when one of the kids needed to rest or if somebody was too cold and needed to get out of the water for a break. We ended our day at the cenote park with more swimming. Rod and Elio are very knowledgeable about the flora and fauna of the area and pointed out some beautiful birds in the park. By the end of the day several of the kids were clamoring for ice cream. This was NOT part of the scheduled itinerary but Rod had the van stop at a fabulous gelato shop once we returned to Playa. He gave us plenty of time to enjoy some really amazing gelato (better than I had in Italy! AND they deliver! Talk to Rod if you are interested).I was completely blown away with what an amazing day and tour this was. Rod and Elio spent over 12 hours with us and gave us their undivided attention and personalized service. They handled all of the details, gear, photography while making sure everybody was comfortable and having a great time. My children keep saying \"We miss Rod. Are we going to see Elio again?\" Of course we are!Book ANY tour with Rod; you will be so glad that you did. He is passionate about what he does and it shows. He is concerned about conservation and animal welfare and is excellent at sharing this beautiful place with those who are lucky enough to find him on the web. AND he gives GREAT restaurant recommendations. Thank you, Rod and Elio, for an amazing, unforgettable day. We will be seeing you again for future trips.Danielle Suykerbuyk"

We had an interest in seeing the real Mexico and not be part of a large group or deal with all the people. We opened it up to Rod's experience with a family of small children, he recommended Tulum and the Mayan Village. We got to Tulum early before all the people and got to see most of it that our children could tolerate, Rod said take how much time you wish, half hour, hour, hour and a half, clearly he has had the experience with children before:) From Tulum we went to the Mayan village for Zip lining, canoeing, swimming in the cenote and the village experience. The zip lining was the biggest hit the kids had on our whole trip. The visit to the village itself was mine best experience, probably my wife\u2019s as well. The lunch we had at the village was by far the best food we had in Mexico. After lunch we wandered the village and meet the kids and gave they some gifts we brought, even got invited into one of their homes, an experience we will never forget. Luckily we did this excursion early in our vacation, and as we had such a great time we talked w/ Rod and he had some availability for another day we were there so we booked a second trip. Our second trip we did Coba, again we beat all the crowds there and got our own Mayan guide. The kids enjoyed the bike ride and climbing the pyramid, my wife and I enjoyed that as well as having the guide to explain all that we saw and I\u2019m sure things that most, without a guide, did not see. After that we had a great lunch at a small restaurant on the beach and then off to Yal-Ku for snorkeling. Rod was like a guide/babysitter in one, he was great with the kids, very patient from bathroom stops at a super market to 20 mask changes while snorkeling. Again, I can\u2019t say enough good things, if we come back to Mexico we will be giving Rod a call for another adventure."

We visited Coba where we saw Mayan ruins and climbed the pyramid. We zip lined and swam in the most beautiful jungle and cenote. We visited a Mayan village and had delicious local food and brought gifts to the children. We snorkeled with sea turtles and even saw a stingray. We ended the day at Chaak-tun Cenotes where we swam in an open cenote and through a closed cave cenote and saw the sacred space of the Mayan worship. Rod and Elio were so patient with our group of nine, five of which were young children. I felt that they were well-attended to and safe, even when swimming in deep water. The knowledge of Rod and Elio was amazing, and they continually pointed out things to us that we might have missed. At the request of the kids, we even stopped for some fantastic gelato when we were a the end of our trip. The day was absolutely perfect and we will never forget all of the wonderful things we did. If you think the price is a bit steep, let me tell you it is NOT. It is worth it!!! You will have an unforgettable day AND Rod takes pictures the entire time so it is like your whole experience is being documented. It was SO NICE to not worry about missing a photo, because Rod was making sure nothing was missed!!! We ended up with 300+ pictures and I will treasure this for along time.Don't hesitate booking a tour with Rod. You will LOVE it! As for us, we can't wait to come back and do another tour with Rod."

            "review": "Amazing Experience with Great Guides. We booked a large group with Rob and his great crew to explore some of Playa del Carmen many attractions. There are three things that set Rob's tour apart from others:1) The personalities and knowledge of the guides on the tour. Rob, L, and Guillerme(sp?) taught us so much about the history, people, flora, fauna, and animals of Riviera Maya. Not only are all expert divers and very knowledgeable about the area but they also have very engaging and fun personalities that will sure to make everyone feel very comfortable.The guides were able to soothe and reassure a few in our group who were a little hesitant to some activities. I can tell you that they are sure glad they did. It was a once in a lifetime experience.2) The sites that they chose to take us to were absolutely beautiful. The day was a day that everyone will remember for a long time . We all zip lined, snorkeled in Cenotes, swam in caves, canoed and cliff jumped in some of the most beautiful and refreshing water you could ever be in. We topped it all off with a traditional Mayan lunch served by villagers. This was the best meal we had all week. It was so fresh and delicious.3) NO LINESOn our way back we passed a couple of the more popular parks and the lines were ridiculously long. WE DID NOT WAIT IN 1 LINE. We maybe saw 4 other tourists the whole day and this was Easter week ( very busy). It was just us and the villagers. I really can not say enough about Rod and his crew and the experiences they showed all of us. It really was a once in a lifetime day. When we go back to Mexico I will be booking a spear fishing adventure. I know I cant wrong with Rob and neither can you."

I had high expectations, having read such favourable reviews, and they were met. I asked Rod if we could manage to do both Ek-Balam and Akumal Bay in one day and he made it happen. He picked us up early from the Iberostar Lindo and took us via the time-saving toll road to Ek-Balam. We had a fantastic tour of the ruins and I now treasure the photos that I didn't know Rod was taking at the time! Afterwards, we headed to the coast where we had lunch at a wonderful, quiet restaurant with an ocean view. We then spent the afternoon swimming with turtles. Rod guided us in the water, pointed out turtles and rays and took more photos underwater. Rod was excellent with our two children (ages 11 and 8), helped me bargain for souvenirs and imparted his love of this wonderful area throughout the day. Given all that we did I feel his price was very reasonable. I would happily tour with him again someday if I am lucky enough to return to the Mayan Riviera."

I can't say enough about how knowledgeable he is about the marine life in the cenotes and how environmentally friendly he is. We were not looking for a swim with the dolphins excursion that would be packed with tourists. If you want to see Tulum, swim in the cenotes, go to a lagoon and snorkel in a place you would never find on your own you have to hire Rod. He made our vacation. He is a professional diver and was able to tell us the names of all the fish we saw plus take underwater photos. Me, my partner and seven year old son went to the cenotes, went to a Mayan village, canoed and zip lined there and were then taken to Half Moon Bay for the most amazing snorkeling experience I have ever had. We were never surrounded by tourists and felt that we had these amazingly special places to ourselves. Thanks for a great trip."

            "review": "Not to be missed day trip with Rod!!!. Our day trip with Rod was easily the highlight of our trip to Cancun. We booked him to take our family of four (includes 16 and 11 year old boys) to Tulum, a Mayan ruins site which is a popular tourist destination for visitors to Mexico\u2019s Yucatan peninsula. He wisely suggested that we go early as the crowds start to build pretty rapidly by mid-morning, and, as importantly, it starts to get very hot by 9-10 AM. Rod and his associate Guiper picked us up at 6:30 and provided us with some snacks and water for the 90 minute drive. The Mayan ruins at Tulum are very impressive and our self-guided tour was made more enjoyable as we initially had the place essentially to ourselves. Bring your camera or borrow Rod\u2019s camera (as we did). Tulum is located on a cliff overlooking the ocean and there are tons of high-quality photo ops.  After leaving Tulum, we went to Tanke Pueblo, a Mayan village 15 minutes (by car) from Tulum. We went zip lining over a small lake and Rod made sure to photograph all of us in-flight. After zip lining, and some canoeing, we walked to the nearby cenote (according to Rod, the largest open-air cenote in the Yucatan). We did some cliff jumping (about 15-20 feet) into the cenote and Rod hopped in the water and, using his Go-pro camera photographed us jumping off the cliff and landing in the water. We then put on snorkels and life jackets and spent about an hour swimming in the cenote. The water in the cenote was absolutely crystal clear and you could easily see fish that were swimming 20 feet below you. Again, Rod was in the water taking photos of us, this time below water, and we are anxious to see how the pictures turned out. I told my wife that snorkeling in the cenote made the trip, and it is something that visitors should definitely do. After swimming, we walked over to where our lunch was provided. It was authentic Mayan cusine; rice and beans, guacamole, chicken, pork, and tortillas. All made from scratch. The meal was delicious. After eating, we waddled back to the car for the trip back to the hotel. We got back about 2:15. Throughout the day, Rod could not have been more attentive, respectful or informative. He checked in continually throughout the day to ask if we needed anything or if we were doing ok. Guiper was also very nice and was particularly knowledgeable about all things Mayan. The cost of the trip covers a great deal. It includes the cost of entry fees to Tulum as well as the cost of ziplining and canoeing. He also does not take you to one of the more \u201cpopular\u201d cenotes which are going to be overrun with tourists. When we first arrived at the cenote that Rod took us to, we were the only people there. The tour also included a driver (Guiper) which allowed Rod to concentrate his full attention on telling us about the Yucatan, Myan culture, etc. Rod\u2019s tour also includes the cost of the wonderful Mayan lunch. Another plus was the fact that Rod also essentially served as our photographer for all of our post-Tulum activities. That was very nice as it freed all of us up to concentrate on just enjoying the day. Finally, Rod\u2019s price was competitive with much larger tours which do not offer any of the personal touches that Rod provided to our family. I thought to myself throughout the day that here is a guy (i.e., Rod) who knows how to run and grow a tour business. He wants to satisfy his clients, he wants your business and he wants you to refer him to those friends and family members who intend to visit the Cancun area. Do yourself a favor, please contact Rod and arrange a tour with him before you come (he also does tours to Chitzen Itzi, snorkeling tours, etc.). You\u2019ll be very glad you did."

Rod created a perfect day trip for us. We left early in the morning to climb the Coba Pyramid, and had a great time touring the ruins on bicycle. Both were AWESOME! Then we headed to a small Myan village Eco-Park to zip line, canoe in a crystal clear cenote, and have lunch. Again, all were great. Our daughter and her friends loved the active day out. Mom and dad loved the Mayan lunch!! The door to door shuttle, personal service, and desire to deliver a great experience were great. We have traveled all over the world, and Rod is truly - WORLD CLASS!! Rod even brought along a friend to take even more pictures for us, and those were included in the price. It is REALLY nice to have pictures that someone else took all day long so that the whole family is included in each picture (instead of one of us being behind the lens)!! If you are looking for a unique experience, a great price, and great memories - Call Rod!! PS: we liked it SO much, we booked Rod again for the next week with our older son!! I'll include some additional pics and review that trip too."

            "review": "Easy Trip with Children. Rod was the only tour guide we could find who was willing to take on a group with small children (three children under 4). He found us car seats and made sure we had lots of child friendly snacks and drinks in the van. He planned a trip for us to Tulum and an ecopark that worked for all six adults, as well as the three children. The self-guided tour of Tulum was amazing because Rod made sure we got there early enough that there were only two other small groups there. We were pretty much the only people there, which was spectacular. He made sure we knew which entrance to go into to see the site (the second one) to get the wow-factor view when we first walked in, and even had bug spray waiting for us when we came out all bitten up! Rod knows all the history of the area, past and present, and is easy and fun to talk to throughout the rides and experiences. The next stop on our trip was a private ecopark where we were basically the only tourists. It's a Mayan village, so people still live there, and they do not allow large tours. Our whole family went ziplining, INCLUDING ONE THREE-YEAR-OLD AND TWO TWO-YEAR-OLDS! I never thought my son would be able to do something like that so young, but he absolutely loved it and begged me to do it again! Rod had spoken to the people at the park before we ever arrived to ask if the kids would be able to join in on the experience, something we had not even asked him about, so we were shocked they could go as we had just assumed someone would have to wait on the ground with them. It was a wonderful thing to share with our kids and we couldn't be more thankful to Rod for setting it up. Swimming in a cenote was next, and yes, we were the only people there. My husband and I (with some encouragement) jumped into the cenote from the cliff above, and the kids, again, were able to join us (NOT in the cliff jumping...I'm not a terrible parent). The women who live in the village prepared a meal for us, which was absolutely delicious, and the downpour that drenched us afterwards was just another fun thing about the day! Before dropping us at the hotel, Rod asked if we needed anything from town, and took us to a local pharmacy to get diapers. Tanya, his assistant, was warm and AMAZING with the kids (she has a young son so she knew what she was doing), and together, they were knowledgeable, friendly, and really fun. This was such an easy way to spend what could have been a difficult day with our kids, but having the right tour guide made all the difference. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Rod and his team to anyone traveling in the area, especially those with children!"

Rod was amazing from the moment I emailed him! He and Tanya, his great assistant, arrived at our hotel early in a van that was comfortable, clean, and filled with snacks, water, juices, beer. He even supplied us with 3 car seats! After walking through Tulum we were taken to a small, isolated Mayan village where we were able to zip line, canoe, swim in a Cenote...our babies zip lined with us! We never imagined we could do these more physical adventures with babies! We walked for 5 minutes to a meal, prepared by the local Mayan people, that was great...amazing guacamole, fresh made tortillas, chicken, salad, authentic! Rod and Tanya treated us like family! We had an amazing day that was fun, safe, and informative! Rod was the only guide who responded to my requests for a day that included the babies! Thank you Rod and Tanya...we look forward to more tours with you!"

It was refreshing to be the first ones there and have the ruins all to ourselves. Riding bicycles in the ruins may have been my favorite part. Our adventures continued at a Maya village where we zip lined, canoed, swam, snorkeled, and cliff jumped in a pristine cenote. (again all to our own!). Lunch here at the village was some of the best food we ate on our entire vacation. Delicious! To top off our incredible day we snorkeled off the beach in Akumal to see the turtles. Amazing experiences that we would not have had otherwise, and certainly not been able to do all in one day. We never felt rushed and were able to do and see so much! And, to top it all off, we've got terrific photos taken by Rod that capture our experiences and great shots of this beautiful area."

            "review": "Amazing Tour. Rod did an amazing job with the full day tour! He picked us (4) up early because he wanted to make sure to beat the crowds and did we EVER! We were basically completely private all day long. The super clean, very safe van provided plenty of snacks and drinks for the entire day. The van was licensed, safe and our driver (Guiper) was courteous and funny (and he even let me wear his personal flippers to snorkel in).Rod was extremely knowledgeable of the area and spoke excellent English to make everyone easily understand all the subtleties of the area and the tour. He also, wisely, took us to the farthest away site and then worked our way back towards Playa to account for our energy fading in the middle of the day.We did the Mayan Ruins and were instructed (by Rod) which vendor to \"not miss\" for our special coconut juice or orange juice (amazing). Rod was great at getting us a local guide at the ruins who was knowledgeable and familiar with the site and features.Our trip next focused on Zip Lining, Canoeing, Snorkeling in a crystal clear water cenote, and Cliff Diving. Each of those things were wonderful and as a first time snorkeler, he was patient and helpful in making me feel comfortable - I considered the snorkeling the highlight of the day.Next it was to a TRUE Mayan village for lunch. This authentic lunch was just that - AUTHENTIC. I have never had a meal so delicious. The villagers spoke no English and Rod's presence and knowledge of the village made this a once in a lifetime experience. Take Rod's advise, however: the hot salsa is HOT - don't try it, not even a little - you are warned! Chicken, Pork, local fair - they even grilled our coconut (from the drink we got at the ruins) We had an impromptu chance to see some little children and a family from the village that was totally unscripted and remarkable.The afternoon was started by swimming with the turtles. Again, as a new snorkeler, this was unnerving, but Rod helped put me at ease. I was also the \"lucky dog\" who got to visit with one of these mammoths \"up close and personal\" - one surfaced about 18 inches from my face. To top that, Rod got a picture of that occurrence! (He spent the entire day taking pictures to free our group of having to lug around a camera - he e-mailed the pictures to us within 12 hours!)Finally, it was trip to a couple more cenotes for snorkeling and a visit to a sacred Mayan area. The cenotes were underground caves that had filled with the clearest, crystalline water you can imagine. The last cenotes had crevices and huge boulders that extended downward beyond our sight and were almost indescribable in there magnitude. Rod was also very helpful in \"evaluating\" the price of souvenirs (and pointing us towards authentic, not mass-produced goods) and serving as a go-between for one of our party after she had overpaid for something (in his opinion). His efforts ultimately saved her about $50 or more.Our ride back to Playa was quick (thanks to the good planning on Rod's part) and we were home. The entire trip was nearly 12 hours! There is just no better value for a tour guide than this! He is absolutely, whole hearted endorsed and one's trip will be more fulfilling with a tour by Rod Ratner!"

Rod had the van loaded with lots of water and other drinks as well as healthy and not so healthy snacks :)Off to the Miyan village for zip lining, canoeing and cenote swimming and a lunch that was so authentic that we will never forget!Snorkelling with the turtles and Rod knew just where to find them. Visited three more cenotes and the views and snorkelling were breathtaking. What a day - thanks Geeper and Rod. My sons and I had a fantastic day with memories (and Rod's pictures) to last a lifetime!For those travelling, avoid the cookie cutter tours and make sure you leave the hotel to see the sites and contact Rod for a day you won't forget!!"

An example of what a great guy Rod is while on we were on the first tour we had stopped at market and I was looking for a specific item and he took me thru several shops to help me find it. While we did not find it it was not for lack of trying. On the second day Rod showed up with the item I was looking for. He had to pick it up after he had dropped us off with the day before on his own time( thanks Rod). I had not asked he had just taken it a pawn himself to do this and it was greatly appreciated. Just a small gesture but a genuine indication of how good he is at his job."

We wanted more! So, he planned a wonderful custom tour of Playa for me and my girl. We took our resort's shuttle into town and met him at the drop-off location. We had a really great time shopping on 5th avenue in some amazing new shops, such as Biuriful and La Troupe Tienda (my lady loved it). Next we headed to one of his favorite bars for some mezcal tasting and grass hoppers (interestingly good local cuisine). Then headed to an off-the-beaten-path restaurant that was a-m-a-z-i-n-g, known for their ceviche. Nothing like some good food, conversation and la cervezas! Of course we didn't leave without finding a primo bottle of mezcal to take home. The perfect evening with the awesomest of company!The best part of 'custom' tours by Rod is he really gets a sense of what you want to do and see, makes you feel safe in a foreign country, and makes magic happens! We highly recommend this \"new\" part of his tours. So take a break from your resort, head into town, and enjoy everything Playa has to offer!!!"

This was by far one of the best days we've ever had as a couple. We were referred to Rod by a good friend who had booked a tour with him a year ago and we are now full fledged #fansofrodratner! From the start to finish of this custom tour, he picked us up in a nice, new, clean van...Filled with a cooler rocking some water, fresh fruit and most importantly granola bars. His insight and knowledge of every inch of Mexico was wonderful. As we drove a short way to Tulum, we learned about the rich history of the Yucatan Peninsula. Rod's knows the inside secrets on all the tourist spots! We got to Tulum before all the \"annoying\" crowds of people showed up. Pretty much had the place to ourselves, and as we were leaving, bus loads started pouring in... From Tulum we went to a Mayan Village just down the road. We kicked up our feet and enjoyed the beautiful weather and the view...it was breathtaking! ZipLining was a blast. It was the first time for both of us. Tons of fun! Next up was swimming in our own private Cenote, learning how to snorkel, and jumping off the cliff into the crystal clear water. Wow, a memory that will be with us forever! Lunch was served by the Mayan people, and it was one of the best meals ever. Watching the women make the tortillas was fascinating and we are still dreaming about the guacamole and chicken...(OMG). On our way back to the van, we walked through the village and found some of the Mayan kids. Rod had given us a heads-up before our trip, that if we wanted to bring some coloring books and/or clothing for the kids, we could. Their faces lite up as we gave them a stack of clothing. Wish we could have given more, but they were so grateful they invited us in to their home. Such a wonderful gesture. Rod is not just a tour guide... He's making a difference in these people's lives.Our trip didn't end there. We headed to Turtle Bay to swim with sea turtles! The beach was beautiful, with white sand and blue water. It was paradise! With our snorkel gear on we headed out for about an hour, swimming and viewing all of the sea animals in the natural coral reefs. Sea turtles, stingrays, sea snails and so much more. Oh my! Such a blast, and a great way to conclude our day. We started off as strangers and now consider him a friend. Rod is an amazing person you can trust. We are going to literally tell everyone in (snowy & cold) Buffalo, NY about his tours! We are planning another trip next year, and hanging out with Rod is the reason we are going back. We wanted to see the real Mexico and he shared that with us. Our gratitude is beyond words. Simply put, it was the best day ever. If I could rewind, I would have booked 2 days with him. Next time for sure. Skip the corporate tour companies! Spend a little more on a custom, private tour. It will be the time of your life!!!Muchos gracias Rod."

He is a kind and funny guy who knows a lot about the area.First we went to the Tulum ruins, where we were stunned by the beautiful views at the turquoise sea.It was great that he took us there early in the morning by the way, because it wasn't crowded at all yet and that made it all the more a better experience. Great planning! I also found it very helpful that Rod had told us all about the Mayans who used to live there, their rituals and lifestyle, because it gave us a better overall picture of the place.After that we went snorkeling in Akumal, to see the sea turtles. I don't have much experience in snorkeling but Rod gave me advices where needed and made me feel at ease. It was so wonderful to swim between those big turtles! And then to think I had been to the Maya Riviera once before but I didn't even know about this hidden treasure there in Akumal.For the last part of the day Rod brought us to a park with an old Mayan village where we went canoeing and swimming in the marvelous blue cenotes. The nature there is gorgeous! For thrills we went ziplining from a high point to the other side of the water, luckily for me it was no problem that I was wearing a dress instead of shorts hahaha! Out of my whole week at the Maya Riviera, this was definitely the best day of all! I hear Rod does great whale shark tours as well, but unfortunately it wasn't the season for whale sharks when I was there. Maybe I should return sometime soon...... :)"

He planned a perfect day for my husband and I to really see a lot and feel like we experienced both some of the major attractions outside of Tulum as well as some of the local spice of life. Rod picked us on time in the morning and came prepared with waters and snacks, as well as a private driver for the tour bus van which nicely cooled from the A/C. He took us to the ruins first to avoid the lines and then to the cenotes / lagoons for some afternoon swimming. Visiting the school was really special because I had brought some supplies down from Boston to donate to the children. It was so great to be able to give them the stuff in person and see their smiling reactions. The lunch was very delicious too, with an amazing view right on the beach. Also, he coordinated all the entry fees to the various sites and lunch was included in the daily fee too. Overall Rod is a fantastic tour guide who is very passionate about his job and making all who visit know just how special the area is and what it has to offer. I would definitely recommend Rod and look forward to returning to Mexico and going on another tour. Gracias Rod por todo! Come visit us in Boston soon. Mi casa es su casa!"

BEST TOUR EVER...BEST TOUR GUIDES EVER!!! *****Rod Ratner, a veteran tour guide was beyond the best choice for my cousin and I to book a custom private tour with! Rod, who has extensive knowledge within the Yucatan peninsula gave my cousin ( Erin Meyers\ufeff) and I a brief history of every site we visited. Our tour started with Rod and his crew, Kay, another veteran tour guide and Guiper, both driver and pure entertainment, picking us up promptly at our hotel. Our first stop was the ruins at Tulum. We arrived as soon as it opened as to beat the massive crowds and blistering sun. A wise move only a veteran would know to do. After Tulum we then headed into the jungle where we arrived at our next stop, a Mayan Village. This still functioning village was run by their native people and couldn't be more accommodating. We started off soaring through the air zip lining, then off to the canoes to get a paddle tour around the lake. After a quick change, then headed to the Cenotes for a little cliff jumping and my personal favorite, snorkeling!The one of many bonuses of having a private custom tour is, if you take 15 extra minutes swimming around a crystal clear Cenotes because you can't imagine getting out...you can! Once I finally agreed to get out, we then walked right into the heart of the Mayan Village. Rod, effortlessly explaining the history and answering the 100 questions I probably had along the way.To then be completed with a homemade traditional Mayan lunch prepared by the locals.I can't say enough wonderful things about Rod, his fellow guides and this tour he planned out for Erin and I. Rod, whose passion and knowledge of the sites, just left me thirsting for more. Kay, also incredibly knowledgeable and gracious to the point he almost insisted on holding our bags. Guiper, who never hesitated to help out when asked, also acted as the comic relief. Each guy broughtsomething else to table and together really seemed to be the \"dream team\" of guides. These guys not only provided the base knowledge, but also engaged in the activities with us, making it that much more enjoyable and memorable.I HIGHLY recommend booking Rob Ratner, your tour will be an incredible memory if you do!FIVE STARS"

The tour guy who was also Mayan talked about Mayan language. You can buy a print in Mayan language with birthday or anniversary date and your name. Our guide on site was very knowledgeable as well. The structures were build 3 000 bc! The property now is owned by government. There should not be any more vendors, but people are still trading. Our guide discouraged us to buy anything from them. Instead we stopped by gift shop away from site which was extremely expensive, I wished I bought something from vendors. On the way back we stopped by large cenote to have lunch at cafe. Unfortunately our trip did not include the swim, but you can still take pictures, it was magnificent. The lunch was good, but we all had stomach problems later on."

She was able to find us the best price and made sure that since it was just my boyfriend and I that we were put on a smaller shuttle. We were picked up at our hotel promptly at 8am. Although the shuttle was a bit tight, there were only 8 of us and we got to sit up front with our tour guide, Felix \"Feliz\".Mind you, this excursion is a LONG day with lots of driving, but Felix was absolutely incredible and at the end of the trip we were like family. Felix was extremely outgoing, friendly, smart, and was able to teach us so much about Mexico and the Mayan culture. He is such a hard worker and it was very evident that he liked his job and genuinely enjoyed the conversations that he shared with his customers. Felix made this trip so much more amazing and he really allowed us the time we needed to soak up EVERYTHING! I wish I knew the name of his company so we could call his boss personally to let them know that he was an absolute pleasure.Our first stop was to take a break at a Mayan gift shop. We were pleasantly surprised at how clean and beautiful the bathrooms were. We got to shop around and spent about 15 minutes here to stretch our legs. When we got to ChiChen Itza Felix got our tickets for the tour where we met up with Diego. Diego was extremely knowledgeable and engaging during the tour. We really enjoyed our time with Diego as his love for his heritage and job really showed. The history at ChiChen Itza was mind blowing-- no wonder why its the NEW wonder of the world. We recommend that if you go to ChiChen Itza that you make sure to get a guide or else you'll miss out on all of the history and stories of the site. Our last stop was at Ik Kil Cenote for lunch and swimming. It was about 10 minutes down the street from the ruins. The lunch buffet was ok but by the time we had lunch the group was so hungry and HOT! Once we refueled we were able to explore the cenote. If you google \"Ik Kil\" the pictures are incredible, but seeing this cenote in person was breathtaking. Luckily, the cenote wasn't too crowded, although there was a bunch of people by the time we left. We still got to jump off the top of the \"cliff\" into the water which was so much fun! Finally, on our way back to the hotel, we were all tired, but Felix kept us entertained with more engaging and interesting conversation. On the way back to the hotel, he took us through a town where many conquistadores lived called Valladolid. Felix gave us a history lesson of the town and buildings which was awesome! We ended up not getting out and exploring, but driving through was just as fun.We got back to the hotel around 6pm. Thank you FELIX for an unforgettable day!!!!!!!"

I have seen many of the wonders of the world, but Chichen Itza is hard to describe. It is beautiful, awe inspiring, soaked in history! The main pyramid is in excellent condition. While you are no longer allowed to climb the pyramid, just looking is enough! There are several other pieces of Mayan history surrounding the main pyramid. It is a history lovers dream. And of course, there is a huge market of locals selling their wares in the surrounding area. If you are en route to Mexico and seeking a bit of history - don't miss Chichen Itza. But...do be ready for the heat and the open sun...this is a very wide open space!"

            "review": "So much fun!. My husband booked the Chichen Itza, Ik Kil, and Coba tour. The trip was 12 hours long, starting promptly with a pickup at 6 in the morning and ending at 6 in the evening. We were given complimentary snacks (bananas, fruit boxes, and cookies, plenty of water and soda). Our group consisted of couples ranging in age - young adults to young-at-heart adults. We were the only English speaking couple in a group of 4 couples. The van was very clean and well air-conditioned. Jorge was our driver, and Jesus was our fantastic tour guide, super friendly and very knowledgeable. He made sure we felt included since the rest were Spanish speakers. We learned a lot about Mayan architecture and history! It was really fascinating, and I hadn't expected the tour to be so educational. We got to Chichen Itza earlier in the day, before all the crowds and just as vendors were setting up, which was great because I hate crowds and people yelling at me to buy stuff. And it was HOT! Had it not been for the breeze, it might have been unbearable. Make sure you have a hat, lots of sunscreen, and light, breathable clothing. And bug spray. We walked through the site with Jesus and he gave us his tour, then he let us roam for about an hour, which we did not do because it was just too dang hot. Thankfully our next stop was the cenote, which was very cool, and such a relief. You can rent life vests (didn't need one, so not sure how much they were to rent), towels (30 pesos to rent plus a 70 peso deposit) and lockers (I think around 30 pesos), but you can just leave your bags and chanclas right by the cenote once you get down there. Down at the bottom there is a stairway to a platform so you can do a little diving, I think the highest you can jump from is about 20 ft. No thanks. We jumped from less than halfway lol. There are also a few places where you can sit along the cenote's edge or hang onto a rope if you don't want to tread the whole time. I think I accidentally sat on a fish. We floated around for maybe 15-20 minutes. The buffet was free, and it was decent. Drinks were not included. Coba was really cool because we got to climb the pyramid, which got my heart pounding (I'm not a huge fan of heights, and holy crap - it was a lot of stairs). The view from the top is nice. Going down not so much. We went from top to bottom almost entirely on our butts, practically sliding down; the rocks are that slippery. I'm pretty sure trying to descend while standing upright would have resulted in a skull being cracked open. But it was exciting! I got a little adrenaline rush. Overall the whole day was a lot of fun - the pacing was perfect - spent a satisfactory amount of time at each place, got a couple of solid naps in the car, learned a lot, got a good amount of exercise in. A great experience - I really recommend it if you've never tried it."

Slight mix up as they thought we were spanish speaking (rest of our tour group was) but we speak english. Our guide Jesus was able to adjust on the fly though and actually did BOTH spanish and english to accomodate everyone! Jesus was very knowledgable and told us so much about every location we visited. He was also very friendly and easy to talk to.Chichen Itza was amazing and we got there early before the crowd so it was even better! We walked pretty much the entire grounds and he told us a lot about everything and what certain things meant. After the walk around we had another 30-40 minutes to ourselves to just walk around the area and take pictures and shop for souveneirs. Ik Kil was close by and was super fun! It's basically a large freshwater sinkhole you can swim in. Water was cold but not too bad. This came with a buffet lunch as well. Food was good and needed after the walk and swim. Only thing is to make sure to bring some cash if you want to buy water/beer/drinks at the buffet.Our last stop was Coba. Coba was probably my favorite part of the tour. We actually got to climb one of the pyramids! Be careful as it's very very slippery. Getting up was easy but we played it safe and went down on our butts lol. We walked around the rest of the Coba grounds and Jesus told us about the history of the people and location.All in all, it was around a 12 hour trip. Our guide was amazing and I would highly recommend this service! Oh, the cost is very appropriate for the excursion as well. The best deal that I could find from all of the sites."

Luckily we arrived just after the Chichen Itza opened, and avoided the large crowds and heat of midday. After Victor walked us around and gave us his tour, we had over an hour to wander around ourselves before heading to Ik-kil. There we swam and had lunch for 90 minutes. At Coba, Victor gave us another walking tour and another hour to climb and walk around before our drive back to the hotel. We enjoyed our day very much and wouldn't hesitate to book again in the future!Victor was very knowledgable and answered our questions all day. They supplied water and soft drinks in the van, and we could leave our backpack while we toured the sites."

The shuttle was punctual even when it was pouring. We had a semi private tour and yes at a higher price than other operators but we got to Chichen earlier than most visitors, allowing us to enjoy the place avoiding crowds. Then we went to the Ik Kil cenote which is basically a natural pool. Chichen was wonderful, you can search online for the history of the city but definitely a must see if you're around in Playa del Carmen or Cancun. Ik Kil wasn't so impressive and I would recommend arranging for somewhere different to have lunch. We were expecting real mexican food but got a very bad international version of mexican food. We then got to Coba, which I would say skip and spend more time in Chichen. However, our guides were wonderful, friendly, helpful and punctual. We had a great time thanks to them and returned safe and sound to our hotel at the time agreed."

We did two trips with this company after obsessively researching local tour companies: Chichen Itza/Ik Kil/Ek Balam (5/5); Sian Ka'an (3/5). I found this company to be more value for money compared to excursions ran by Nexus or Lomas and we were not disappointed on our Chichen Itza trip with our very knowledgeable, friendly and professional tour guide Hugo. He tiredlessly guided us throughout the whole day and since it was a shared group, our family of 4 joined another 2 girls from Barcelona (hi hi!). He would first explained things to them in Spanish while letting us go around to take pictures and then reverse the process and explained things to us in English while they go off to take pictures. He is a very hard working person and a wealth of information; my parents were very impressed by him and cannot stop commenting on how much they enjoyed the trip. This was my second time to Chichen Itza (the first for my parents and bf) and he still managed to show me new areas of the site and explained a lot of the history and culture in great details!I've booked a private tour to Sian Ka'an two days after the Chichen Itza trip with this same company but then the pick up time was changed last minute (communicated to us through Whatsapp) and we were picked up in a shared van with other people, which was fine. We were then moved to a \"registration centre\" with the Price Tour brand, which i'm not sure if it's the same company or did they outsource it to someone else. We didn't really have a private tour as originally promised by Raul (I think he's no longer with the company? Francisco took over communications in the new year). Although our guide Marco was friendly, this trip was not to the same level of professionalism as the Chichen Itza trip. Our \"group\" now consisted of 12 - 15 people divided into 3 jeeps, we were in the car that Marco drove while other tourists drove behind us (?!) for 1.5 hr of very very very bumpy dirt road. We didn't mind it so much on our way to the boat but it was gruelling on our way back since there was nothing to see on the road and it's so bumpy that it's concussion inducing (I have a bruise on my spine from when my bathing suit knot got smashed into my repeatedly and another bruise on my neck from the seat belt cutting into me). the speedboat ride was refreshing and less bumpy than the 4x4 trek! I think our trip was saved by our Photographer Nico(?) who was the only staff on the boat with us other than the boat captain (Marco was on another boat). Nico pointed out all the birds, dolphins, sea turtles to show us and helped me get really good pictures! the photo CD was a bit pricey at $400 pesos but we bought it from him mostly because of his service. Someone else drove our jeep back to the registration center at the end of the trip so I wouldn't really qualify the Sian Ka'an trip was a guided tour. My boyfriend and I want to do the Sian Ka'an trip again but we probably would look else where, we think that having a boat ride for the full journey would be the best.On the other hand, totally recommend the Chichen Itza trip with Hugo! In fact, we want to see if he would do an evening tour so that we can do some star gazing at Chichen Itza!"

We were picked up in an air conditioned van from our hotel by the driver/second tour guide Rael and our tour guide Mario. We started off at the Mayan Ruins. We had a great tour guide, Ulysses. We were there just enough time that we were able to enjoy it and learn about the site but we didn't stay there long enough to get bored. We then went snorkeling in a cenote. The cenote was wonderful (much better than the one we saw on another tour). It was open and well lit, we were the only group in the cenote, and we had plenty of time to snorkel and enjoy the beauty of the cave. My husband and I had some trouble with our snorkel gear and Rael was extremely helpful and made sure it was a fun experience for us! On the grounds of the cenote we were able to see some wildlife which was a nice bonus. We then went to Acumal beach (beautiful, clean, clear blue waters) to snorkel. The water was beautiful, we were able to see giant sea turtles (several), beautiful fish and coral, as well as a few sting rays! Our tour guide did a wonderful job of keeping the group relatively together/safe and we all communicated when we found something cool to look at (turtle or stingray). Overall this was a truly wonderful day. The activities and excursions were really fun and so enjoyable but our tour guides were what really went above and beyond in making this excursion so enjoyable and fun. We felt very safe the entire time. We would absolutely recommend this excursion to anyone looking for a perfect day in Riviera Maya!"

The ocean was rough and we did not get to see any animals because the salt and fresh water mixing together made it very foggy. The tulum extreme was beautiful. The mayan ruins were on an amazing beach that we went to after our tour. They will assign you a tour guide when you get there that is not with their company because they have to, but do not use the tour guide unless you really love history. We did a self tour and it was perfect for us. Then we went to more cenotes. Both of those are well worth the money. The tour guides we had were amazing too.

Ziplining was a fear of mine, but my husband wanted to do it, so i did too...and loved it!! Our guide was so supportive and made everyone feel at ease. We also did snorkeling in some caves, had a bbq lunch (included), and then went to snorkel in the ocean to observe sea turtles and coral. That was incredible. My husband was having issues with his mask and was having a hard time enjoying the snorkle at first, until our guide (Juan) noticed and fixed the problem for him. Juan was pleasant, helpful, personable, and entertaining. Wonderful experience!"
