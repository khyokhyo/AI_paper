We had the chance and pleasure to meet the owner of this place and listen to him passionately talking about how this little museum was born, learn about the rugs and the story behind them..it was our favourite place to visit in Marrakech, really. The selection of pieces exposed is excellent, their display very creative..anyway the house itself is stunning and the rooftop garden is one of the most beautiful we've seen."

The time riding camels was just enough without being too much. The dinner in the desert was very good and the accommodation was simple but clean and great for one night. The tour was well worth it to get into the desert and see the incredible views best stargazing there is. The Atlas Mountains are very beautiful and the Ouarzazate visit was great for getting a feel for the culture of the area. Great tour!"

The museum is a bit hard to find even with a map but certainly worth a visit if only for the building, a well conserved old two story house with an atrium and roof terrace hidden away in the middle of Medina. Boucharouite is a hand woven rug tied of different pieces of fabric, which form abstract patterns. They were originally made by illeterate women in the High Atlas on an upright loom in their modest house from scraps of their old clothing. Now it is of course more of an industry, maybe still home based and the fabrics used are leftovers from making garments. There are too primitive abstract needlepoint pieces sewn also with fabric threads on a base of discarded blue polyester sacks, which used to contain grains. I bought my first boucharouite last year and it made me so happy during the long dark Finnish winter that I purchased another, bigger one from the same shopkeepeer in the Souk de Babouches, where the prices are reasonable."

It`s also very good and helpful if you want to learn new interesting things about Moroccan culture. The combination between the design and the informative side really makes visiting this museum a one of a kind experience. The building is not very big, and one the great part about it, is the fact that it`s usually quiet, and not as crowded as other places. To sum it up, going to the Museum of Moroccan Arts is, in my perspective, a learning and spiritual visit."

After you visit the Medina, take the Judge's Street (Derb al Cadi) and visit this characteristic upper-class mansion, the home of a judge. You will find a most peculiar and interesting museum; Boucharouite art, decorative panels made of colorful cloth rags by berber mountain women during the winter months. The designs are not just appealing, they are... modern, amazingly so. Ask Patrick, the museum director, to explain you the details, take a cup of coffee or tea afterwards, with homemade sweets or tidbits."

It is easy to find if you follow signs and ask friendly shopkeepers, Be warned local kids will charge for their help. Set in small riad the Boucharouite rugs each have a unique artistic value and are imbibed with symbolism and expression you would expect at the Tate modern.Patrick is a passionate collector and was happy to take me on a personal tour and discuss the art work with me. I really valued his insight. The world could do with more galleries and musees like this, with its support of local culture and artists. My only disappointment is that circumstances prevented me from going back a second time, to hang out and absorb the work properly. I visited here at the beginning of my first stay in Marrakech and Morrocco. it really helped me understand and contextualise the Berber culture and the craft souks during the rest of my visit"

It is in half of a riad, the half that still looks like it is rented out to tourists. Yes, there are boucherite rugs here and there and there is a tiny bit of info about them but.....this is not a museum, at least not in my understanding of the term. I went mainly because it was raining and it was near by but I would not recommend this place unless you like looking at renovated riads."

It is essentially a collection of rugs made by Berber ladies from the rural villages, this may not sound that interesting but it is very well presented and if the owner is around he will give you the full story behind each rug.The house itself is also nice to explore and drinks are served on the roof if you need a break.Ticket costs 40dh which is a bit pricey but you can return with the same ticket another day which you may want to do to relax on the sunny roof terrace.If you are a fan of arts and crafts then you will enjoy this."

Definitely changes your perception of art and it's abstract meanings. One thing he said stuck with me, artists can be artists without them knowing the meaning of art, without education and without any knowledge that they are creating a piece of art. Each of the rugs in this museum is a abstract connotation of a piece of their family history, be it pain, love, joy or death."

All of the rugs on display were originally meant as functional pieces, not works of art, but in this place, they have been elevated from the floor to eye level, allowing you to see the intricate detail that goes into each one. The museum is housed in a converted riad and retains much of the original structure, including a relaxing roof terrace where you can while away an hour or two with a pot of mint tea and light snacks to recharge for another venture out into the hustle and bustle of the M\u00e9dina. The staff is friendly and will happily engage you in conversation, explaining in detail the history of the museum itself, or offer up interesting facts about the rugs, or just idle chit-chat. As I was leaving, a staff member flagged me down and told me that I could hang on to my admission ticket and come back again for free if I felt like coming back and spending some more time. Honestly, I regret not taking him up on the offer - it was a splendid visit, and I definitely recommend it.Nothing is easy to find in Marrakech, but searching out this hidden gem is well worth it. Like a lot of other tourist sites, local kids like to hang out nearby and offer to guide you to the museum for a fee, but it's easy to find if you just follow the signs or use an offline maps app on your smartphone. At 40dhs, and free for those under 16, it's a really cheap and informative way to spend an extra couple of hours in Marrakech."

Everything about this house is beautiful, I was truly moved by the experience of meeting Patrick and listening to his stories about each Boucharouite. A visual feast of colour & texture, even seeing and smelling the plants will leave you feeling lucky to be alive. Don't let the men on the streets outside put you off visiting by telling you that the museum is closed as it won't be, they simply want money to guide you there."

Of course, several young men insisted it was closed because of Ramadan (it wasn't!) so we felt very fortunate to arrive at this oasis. It is definitely one of the best curated and displayed museums in Marrakesh. Though we did not get the private tour by Patrick, we enjoyed seeing the artwork and rugs and reading about them. They reminded me of the quilts from the American midwest--same sort of \"pioneer spirit\" of women making art from nothing. We enjoyed this glimpse into a \"hidden side of Morocco.\""

However, when the owner, Patrick, opened up the museum 30mins early for us, it was clear, just how passionate Patrick was about his stunning rug collection. Patrick gave us a private tour and truly inspired my dad and I with the fascinating stories behind the rugs. Despite being pressured for time to arrive at our next hotel, we decided to spend 3 hours at the museum! There is a rather small fee to pay to visit, on the other hand, once you have paid the fee, you are able to visit the museum as often as you like during the rest of your trip! Another highlight for me is that from the money raised by the museum, 10% is given to an organisation that helps Moroccan girls to extend their education (compulsory education is till 12 years old), so that they can reach their dream profession. I also very much liked that the Riat was furnished traditionally, hence, one could admire the rugs in their true environment and not in a bare, white, clinical gallery space. So if you would like a personalised insight into the true Moroccan culture, then visit the Boucharouite Museum!"

There is a beautiful, quiet rooftop terrace where you can chill out and also a footbath in the courtyard, very relaxing. When you buy a ticket once, you can reuse it, so would recommend going at the start of your trip so you can escape to the terrace whenever you need a break from the bustle of the zouks! 10/10 would recommend."

We wandered around and found the Riad off the beaten tracks, it was quiet but has only opened recently. The museum is dedicated to the art form of rug making by the poorer class of tribeswomen who live in the hills I understand (hopefully) and the rugs are made from scraps of material from clothing they have owned. The base of the rug is from nylon sacking found in markets to carry farm produce. The clothing scraps maybe from their own personal family items and have memories of those family members such as fathers robe or babies first outfit etc. The patterns weaved are what makes it an art form rather than a basic rug. The displays are interesting to see but we were fortunate to meet with the owner of the Riad whose passion for Marrakesh has turned the house first into a guest house and now into a museum. Now obviously we were lucky to meet and have a good chat with him and through him learn more of the art form hidden within the displays. Personally I am not a very arty person and struggled to appreciate some of the displays but I did enjoy the house and its history. My partner Pennie was much better at appreciating the rugs for their art. There is a terrace which will serve drinks and nibbles."

The place is laid out perfectly. It was a real treat to see the rooms and terrace staged as they were. Yes, it is a relaxing place from the hassles outside."

The space has been reappropriated as a museum for the Boucharouite, which are essentially the rag rugs made by women too poor to afford wools or looms. Very interesting experience, since in general learning about women's experiences and stories in Morocco is rare. When we went it was self-guided, but it also seemed like it might be a showroom? Also if there are groups of small children telling you the museum is closed, don't listen to them, this is true in general in Morocco."

            "review": "Beautiful Boucharouite!. This week, whilst walking in the north of the Marrakech souk, I discovered a new museum. Musee Boucharouite, owned by Patrick de Maillard is dedicated to the art of Moroccan rag rugs. I do not use the word \"art\" lightly, as these rugs made by Berber ladies in the Atlas Mountains would not be out of place in a contemporary art gallery.Patricks's enthusiasm for this craft, or art work is contagious! From entering the peaceful courtyard, I was immediately lost to this surprising Moroccan art form. This museum was once a Maison d'h\u00f4tel or guest house. However, Patrick's passion for boucharouite took over, and you may now share it with him.With each rug that you see, it is difficult not to compare them to works of artists or designers such as Matisse; Rothko, Delaunay or Kandinsky!You may linger with a mint tea and Moroccan pastries in the courtyard, or take advantage of the gorgeous roof terrace. If you are lucky, Patrick will be there in person to share with you the symbolism and history of the carpets on display.Do make the effort to visit. It is well sign posted from the local vegetable market situated directly between the Rahba Kedima Square and the Marrakech Museum."

Tensions were running high as the museum of Marrakech is not nearly as easy to find as the sign by our riad would have us believe. As a result we spent what felt like forever travelling in circles and being accosted by salesmen who took notice of how we were traveling in circles. Eventually we latched on to a series of signs leading to a \"museo\" and followed them to salvation.The museum is highly specific in it's subject matter, covering primarily boucharouite - carpets made from the tattered remains of old clothes. The subject has surprising depth and emotional resonance. The museum itself is a centuries old home in incredible condition, and all about it are positioned myriad carpets of every color and design. Patrick is outspoken, insightful and immensely generous with his time and knowledge. We must have spoken to him for an hour, during which we covered everything from the making of the carpets and the history of the house, to places to eat nearby and methodologies for effectively negotiating in the souks. Suffice to say we the museum and its staff are gems. If you take the time to pay the the work, the home and the people the attention they deserve, you will find the experience immensely fulfilling."

Persevere and you eventually find some discreetly placed signs. The owner kindly provides a map to enable safe navigation on the way out! It has only recently opened and focuses on female Berber folk art, namely two styles of rug, Boucharouite and Zindeh. It is housed in a converted Riad and the owner and champion of this art form is there as an enthusiastic guide. Do not forget to take some leisurely refreshment at modest prices on the balconey -- a real haven of repose from the bustle outside."

We thought we would give it a go. The peace and quite inside this converted riad was such a welcome relief. As we stood in the courtyard I heard someone calling from the landing above us. He was waving & smiling. I assumed it must be to someone who was stood behind me, but there was no one there. He then came down to welcome us to the museum. The man was Patrick de Maillart, the founder, owner & curator of this collection of rugs from Moroccan Berber women. Patrick has taken some time to build a collection of rugs which he considers to be great art. He spoke to us at length with great passion and enthusiasm, describing how & why it all came about. He wants the world to see this art and he wants to promote the women's work so they can benefit from it.The first thing Patrick did was suggest we took off our shoes, relax & dip our feet in the cool water of the pool in the middle of the courtyard. After that he let us loose to view the rugs and paintings. He told us to take our time, so we did. We had drinks on the terrace at the top of the riad and then made our way back down again. As we did we met Patrick again for a chat about what we had seen. We agreed that the works had great merit. Well worth a visit, this museum is perhaps best suited to adults. I visited with my wife & 21 year old daughter."

Down a back street off Derb Sidi Ishak (Azbzt) in a fine historical Riad is one of the strangest and most beautiful little museums I have visited in Marrakech. I was priviledged to be given a tour by the founder Patrick (of Maison de la Photographie fame) and it was a real eye-opener. It's a great and somewhat quirky addition to the thriving alternative attraction scene in Marrakech and if you can grab Patrick's attention then do - he is passionate about the carpets and has real insight into their interpretation."

All the rugs are woven by women using an array of fabrics and woven into artful pieces. The curator renovated the riad several years ago to be used as a guest house but he has now turned it into a museum to feature this work. Patrick was extremely kind and he very much enjoyed discussing the history of Berber rugs. He was very enthusiastic about sharing this space with visitors and even more enthusiastic about sharing his love for this collection and his wish to preserve the workmanship and artistry for future generations. The museum is definitely worth a visit. http://lacollectionberbere.com/en/collections/boucharouite"

There's every chance you'll be the only tourists there and it really is worth the effort: Highly recommended."

Coffee and homemade cakes sat underneath a canopy of drapes to shelter from the hot sun was wonderful. We wish Patrick luck with this new venture.
