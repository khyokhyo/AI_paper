You'll probably be crossing this bridge a lot from Buda to Pest and back. It's greatly lit up at night, and very pretty to stroll alongside.

It's located very near to the House of Parliament, Shoes by the Danube, Margaret bridge and Margaret island. While walking across the bridge, which is very safe,you can enjoy the surroundings and all the majestic buildings and monuments.It's impressive during the night because it is lit up with hundreds of lights. The Chain bridge is guarded by two large stone lions on each side of the bridge.Watch out for cruise ships and other boats crossing the danube and sail underneath the bridge."

This Chain Bridge, designed by Englishman William Clark was the first permanent bridge connecting the two former cities of Buda and Pest together and was opened in 1849. The bridge spans the River Danube and is about 375 metres in length making it an ideal distance to cross on foot and admire the design. It is a great bridge and so historic for the city of Budapest and something everyone should see, but there are a number of other bridges which are impressive and one other which I like more. The Pest side of the bridge runs from Roosevelt Square and outside the Gresham Palace across to the Buda Hill Funicular on the western side of the Danube. Its great seen from all angles including Castle Hill, Fisherman's Bastion and probably most impressively from a river boat on the Danube."

Although it was not a spectacular tour but she did gave some interesting info as we walk along. The lions guarding both sides of the bridge gives it an imperial feel to it from a far, up close its still well preserved. The bridge only has a short span (compared to the Brooklyn bridge), which makes it manageable to cross. The bridge walkway is a bit tight so there is really not much time to linger. I like that the traffic exits on both sides is less crowded and landscaped. The beauty of the bridge is viewing it from a distance and at night which gives it a romantic and old world feel. Enjoy the transition from sunset to nighttime as the bridge is finally lighted ...just lovely."

Much like London Bridge it is very busy with cars and people with a narrow foot path, whilst in Budapest you have to say you have walked over it but the history of it being the first bridge to join Buda to Pest is more interesting. If you have a padlock you can lock it to the bridge and throw the key in the river."

The bridge itself is a larger scale version of a bridge that spans the River Thames at Marlow in the UK. It connects Buda and a Pest ( the East and West sides of the town) and was financed by a Greek gentleman who had business and land holdings in the area. Views from both sides of this bridge are excellent, but none more so as you look towards the Parliament building, which takes centre stage. Interestingly the bridge can be seen featured in the Katy Perry music video Firework."

You can admire Danube or details of the bridge, from lions on each side to the details of the lamps. Third, most effective visit is during the night. Pathways are well lit so it is not dangerous (some beggars exist). Fourth, very interesting way of the visit is trip on boat under the bridge. It is special and not difficult for your legs at all. I propose you three ways. Skip bus or car. You can, of course, admire the bridge from the top of the castle hill, too."

All the action is in Pest except for a few major attractions--citadel, castle, Fisherman's Bastion, etc.--but whether or not you go to see those, it is fun to walk across the bridge. There are several points along the bridge at the major supports where you can stop to take in the views. The bridge itself is a work of art, rivets and all. Traffic noise is not bad. On a hot day, it's breezy. Lots of people stopping for photos. On the Buda side, there is a cute little cafe and Clark Adam ter (park) before you hit the series of switchbacks that take you up the mountain--a fun walk up and not too steep a climb if you decide to do it. There's a zen garden cafe halfway up the hillside on the way to the castle--who would have expected that?"

It is also very nice in the daytime for walking as it provides convenient access between Pest and Buda. This review is from a pedestrian perspective, although I expect boats provide excellent views also. I am very fond of bridges and whenever possible like to walk across them. For a bridge lover, Budapest stands out for how pedestrian friendly its bridges are, the glorious lighting of bridges and buildings, and also the way the Danube is its heart.To get on the bridge from Pest, decide which side of the bridge you want to walk on and if necessary use the underpass to get to the desired side (from the embankment take the stairs up). I recommend the north side looking at Parliament and Margaret Island, but south looking at the National Gallery and Elizabeth Bridge is also nice. Access from Buda is via crosswalks around the traffic circle leading into the tunnel (near the Buda Castle Funicular).When we visited in July the bridge was lit at 9PM, about 15 minutes after sunset, but with sunset color still in the sky. The chains were lit first, followed by the towers, which at first had a greenish glow, followed by the more conventional yellow light (see photos). We were able to see it with sunset colors initially followed by full darkness, making a nice contrast (the view from south of the bridge on the Pest side is best for sunset color)."

This chain bridge is one of several bridges across the Danube, but is probably the most beautiful - -and is absolutely spectacular when lit up at night. We were on a Viking River Cruise and at night our boat made a scenic cruise to view the lights -- this bridge was gorgeous.We were surprised to see a number of younger people walking ON the bridge. There are no rails so if it's wet from rain looks to be hazardous. We thought they were nuts to be honest, because that walk is at your own risk. There is plenty of sidewalk space and there are times the bridge is actually closed to vehicle traffic. In any event, the views of the Danube are lovely and the views of the bridge FROM the river are also something to see. We also viewed it from the top of Castle Hill on the Buda side and it stood out.The Danube separates Buda from Pest and a busy River. We were surprised how busy it was at night! But why not -- the views of the lit up Parliament Building, Castle and other sites are something you'll never forget."

You can have a good view of the parliament from the bridge. In addition to the main road on the bridge, there is a pedestrian way allowing you to walk freely across the bridge. However be wary of skateboarders. If you need to go to the other lane of the bridge use the underpasses located at ends of the bridge. There is no conspicuous pedestrian crossing close to the bridge. DON'T try jay walking as there is a good traffic on the bridge.P.S. For photography enthusiasts, do bring a tripod if you're coming at night. You'll have beautiful shots of parliament and Buda castle district from the bridge and vicinity."

There were many people in the streets and no one bothered us( that's more than I can say about my own home town). So yes, go out at night and see the bridge and the lights of the city."

The Sz\u00e9chenyi Chain Bridge kind of reminds me of the Brooklyn Bridge but it is much shorter. Of British design, it was the first permanent bridge over the river in Budapest, and it opened in 1849. It's a quick and easy walk across. I didn't time it but I'd guess around 10 minutes? Just be careful since bikers zip by the pedestrians. The Chain Bridge is stunning at twilight and at night, making for excellent photo opportunities. Don't miss this bridge!"

For me the bridge was slightly underwhelming from a distance, except at night when it came into its own illuminated by all the lights of the city. Close up,however, and when walking across it, the splendour of the architecture and the achievement of the engineers became apparent. The bridge was a wonderful place to snap photos of the many sensational buildings that grace the banks of the Danube, the boats moored, sailing or speeding along the river, and lovely Margaret Island in the distance.Ultimately, strolling over the bridge became our favourite way to cross from Buda to Pest and vice versa."

            "review": "An architectural tour de force and a symbol of a great city. The Chain Bridge was the first bridge to link Buda to Pest, opening economic, social and touristic opportunities for both sides. It was built in 1849 by English engineer William Clark, Tyhe bridge was buiilt at the instigation of the great Hungarian patriot, Istvan Szechenyi (also responsible for the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, the Budapest Opera House and other important civic contributions). While the bridge is named after him, locals refer to it a s the Chain Bridge, based on its design. This beautiful bridge starts at the Roosevelt square, in front of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in Pest and ends at the bottom of Castle Hill, by the entrance to the funicular. Two stone lions guard the entrance to the bridge on both ends. The retreating German Wehrmacht blew up the bridge (along with all other bridges in the city) in January 1945, but it was rebuilt in 1949. It is one of the busiest crossings over the Danube in Budapest and provides a beautiful site from all angles. If you walk to the middle of the Bridge, on the South side you will have a great view of Gellert Hill, the Taban and a good part of Castle Hill, the Erzsebet and Freedom bridges and central Pest. If you stand on the Northern side, you will have an incomparable view of the Academy of Sciences, the Parliament, Margaret Island, Obuda (or Old Buda), and Castle Hill, with the Fisherman's Bastion and Matyas church at the top."

It is only a short walk to cross the bridge but worth getting the information from the guides as it has quite some history. It took the Germans a short while to blow it up in WW2 as with all the bridges in Budapest. But it is a very simple construction that is very efficient at supporting the bridge surface."

It us my pleasure to witness such a successful landmark to serve the habitants of the integrated cities and humanity from all over the planet. The bridge and its nearby cousins plus all those hundreds of classics buildings deserve to be preserved to serve the new and future generations to come."

Separated off pathways from the road so well protected, leads to the rail that goes up to the Castle and Buda old town. Also near several private and public spa / Mineral baths.Good gauge to see where you are in the city if lost."

So to say, The Chain Bridge (Sz\u00e9chenyi l\u00e1nch\u00edd) over the Danube is one of the most famous images of Budapest, not to say an icon of Hungary. This bridge between Pest and Buda offers the spectacular view of the city. On the Pest side, the pointed towers of the Parliament Building cut the Danube, while the Buda Castle stands on the other side.The suspension of the bridge is quite impressive, especially at night when the heavy chains sparkle with thousands of lights. It was completed in 1849 and the first bridge to connect the cities of Buda and Pest. At the time, it was an extraordinary architectural masterpiece (and still is in my opinion), 375 meters long, one of the longest suspension bridges in Europe. Large stone lions guarding the bridge on both sides, and the impressive pillars bearing the coat of arms of Hungary with the crown and a wreath of leaves. The imposing lions have been carved by sculptor J\u00e1nos Marschalk\u00f3. Luckily it survived the destruction of World War II. Still about the lions, there is a legend in Budapest that the lions don\u2019t have tongues. From below, it\u2019s true, you can\u2019t see it, but people say that the lions have tongues, however, the tongues can only be seen from above. Well, I didn\u2019t notice that until I was told, and the fact is, I could not see the tongues."

No 16 bus goes over it and stops on the Buda side plus goes up to the mattais church. Looks like a new bar is being built next to the bridge on the pest side. Can get busy with traffic at rush hour time. There are several Danube cruising boats moored near the bridge. My photo doesn't show it off at its best."

I recommend walking it during day light and also once at night time when it is lit up.

If you do visit spare some change for the musicians/ performers that perform there and add to the atmosphere's charm."

The iron chains, on which the road-bed hangs, are held by two 48-meter river piers in classicist style. At the time of its construction, the Chain Bridge was the suspension bridge with the second-largest span in the world. Retreating German troops blew up the Chain Bridge on 18 January 1945 and it was reconstructed in 1949 with expanding the original pillars.It is a beautiful bridge which is illuminated at night. There is pedestrian traffic on the bridge too and the views up and down the river are fabulous. No admission so it is another must see place!"

The bridge links Buda to Pest spanning the mighty River Danube. Building was completed in 1849 with the construction supervised by Scottish engineer Adam Clark.In 1944 during ww2 the eastern span was destroyed by an explosion .I love the look of the bridge both of a day or night and it offers great photographic opportunities. It's a great bridge to walk across or with B.K.K. public transport ticket you can grab one of the frequent ferry boats for some great unique views of the bridge. A wonderful landmark and well worth checking out."

It was the closest to our hotel and easily linked us from the Buda side to the Pest side each day of our visit.The Chain Bridge is the bridge at the bottom of Buda Castle on the Buda side and empties out near the Gresham Hotel on the Pest side. The bridge is amazing to walk across and get great views of the Danube River, boats passing by and each side of the city. The lions are powerful and unique, and the traffic is always on the bridge, reminding you that you are in one of the EU's largest cities.Public transportation in Budapest is great, but it's even better to walk because you get to take in nature and see and hear the sights and sounds of one of Europe's great cities."

This is the way to see and experience it best. From the people who spend their lives on the street, to investigating the structure of the bridge. They don't do it like this anymore. Have a look, take some interesting phots. Listen to the thrumming of the bridge when a heavy vehicle passes by.On our trip the water level was very low and the morning misty. Quite different photos to the usual. Witht he market so close by - and the riverboats moorings - there is quite a bit to see here in the heart of Budapest. Across the bridge you can walk up to the statue on the hill. Or go into one of the swimming baths (to the left as you cross the bridge from the market."

Standing above the mouth of the tunnel which leads from Buda under the castle district and sets one up for one of the most picturesque views along the riverside, I had explaining to do. And it wasn't as to why Clark Adam, or Adam Clark, was the name given to the square /roundabout just before the bridge. In the presence of two young children I was presented with the difficulty of finding ice cream. Gladly it's not a problem in the summer months what with the vendors sitting just below the funicular up to the castle quarter, but come winter I was pressed for answers. That it was cold just wasn't sufficient, but being that the Chain Bridge sits comfortably in the vicinity of Batthy\u00e1ny t\u00e9r with its old market building a little further north up the river Buda-side and the immediacy of what is the more vibrant Pest just across the river, I wasn't phased. I know this city enough to know when I'm truly entitled to panic. What did slightly upset me was the need to leave just when I'd set myself up for the growing evening lights. Sitting above the tunnel looking Pest -side is certainly one of the least spoken wonders of the world, perhaps because everybody wants to keep it, selfishly, for themselves... Understandable, of course!"

Funny thing is travel guides like to make jokes about it, that the Bridge has the same length as the tunnel on the Buda side, so when it rains they push the bridge into the tunnel. Silly, but funny things. :D Don't believe them! There's loads of other stories around the bridge. One is on both sides there's a chamber for the chains and in war time the enemy wanted to explode the chamber of the chains. So they filled it up with gunpowder. Then locals were pouring the water of the Danube onto the gunpowder to stop the enemy. :) And try to find out if the lions really have their tongue. The other anecdote is that the architect who made the lion sculptures said that these lions are perfect replicas of a real lion. Then someone stood up next to them and said, well, these guys don't have their tongues. So the architect jumped off the bridge. (Who knows what's true? At least check the tongue.) :D"

The Chain Bridge with it's giant lion statues connect the two across the beautiful Danube river. It is the natural and best way to cross from visiting one to visiting the other.

The massive lions at each end of the bridge are also a great indication of an architectural masterpiece.Even though some say it's just a bridge, it has an interesting legend behind it (don't be tricked, it's fake) where at the time of its construction, the bridge was considered to be one of the wonders of the world. Chief engineer Adam Clark, a master builder from Scotland, completed it in 1849 and legend has it that he was so proud of his masterpiece he would challenge anyone to find any fault with his work. When it was discovered that the lions at either ends of the bridge didn't have tongues, he was so ashamed that he committed suicide. Another important note is that during World War II, the bridge was damaged and its rebuilding was completed in 1949."

During my first visit to Budapest however, I was quite disappointed that many of the iconic views of the bridge are often obscured by the many tour boats, particularly the gigantic Viking Cruise ships. The crime of it is that the people taking the cruise are mostly not taking advantage of the view since they are off touring the town, while the ship being parked there for days just prevents others from enjoying it. If the tour boats are not there, good shots can be gotten from various locations north and south of the bridge on the Pest side. You might want to ride the 2 tram and scout out the various locations. On my first visit to Budapest, I had to go quite far to the north to get a photo without a cruise boat in the foreground. During a visit in March, the tour boats were not around so the views were much better and more more enjoyable for the pedestrians. You can also get good shots however from Castle Hill from several locations and from atop the tunnel. However, In December 2015, the landscaping in the center of the traffic circle on the Buda side of the bridge was all torn up, as were the roads and sidewalks on that side of the bridge so good photos were not available from atop the tunnel at that time. Walking across the bridge is pretty fast and easy, sometimes just as fast as taking the bus if the traffic is heavy. Plus you can stop to take in the views of the Danube and the Parliament building along the way.The waterfront in Budapest in a UNESCO World Heritage site so is quite beautiful. All the Budapest bridges are lit at night and are gorgeous. The lights go on just a little bit after sunset."

The walkway is separated from the busy traffic over the bridge and it is a shame that the graffiti artists have left their mark on the lamp posts and the lights shades are protected with padlocks. There is currently construction on the Bud side that causes crossing the road a bit of a problem. Be careful which side you cross the road on the way back because there is no way to cross the main road close by.

I've been crossing it so many times over the years that I don't pay so much attention to the small details, but if you're crossing it for the first time you should reserve time enough to enjoy the architectural details. Why not make a break at the middle of the bridge and watch the river boats passing By under the bridge. However, I think the sight of bridge is best enjoyed from uphill or during the night when its lighted."

Naturally it is hard to see it all at once or to get a concise picture from one area. Standing on the chain bridge, looking down the Danube with Pest on my right and Buda on the left - I couldn't quite make my mind up which city I was looking at. Personally, there were overtones of Istanbul meeting Florence (a strange combination I know). However, with Budapest's rich tapestry of history and influences; this could be quite an accurate synopsis. The bridge itself is really quite beautiful especially on a bright summers day or equally charming of a sultry moon lit evening. The walkway is quite narrow so be aware of people randomly stopping to have their picture taken, collisions could be fatal. Definitely worth a meander across irrespective of which side you go from."

It was a very beautiful walk with great views of Parliament but more importantly, I enjoyed seeing the bridge and the lion statues guarding the bridge close up. There were many great picture opportunities on this beautiful suspension bridge. If you are thinking of skipping this walk due to concerns that it is too physically exerting, reconsider - the walk took no longer than 13 minutes (that's including time to stop to take pictures). To give you a comparison, it felt like it was only 1/5 of the distance of the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco."

Having just come from Prague and experiencing their iconic Charles bridge, I was very much pleasantly surprised to see how majestic looking the Chain bridge is. Both during the daylight hours and especially at night. Seems to me that the Charles bridge gets more attention but I was more captivated by the Chain bridge. They are very different bridges. The Charles in Prague a strictly foot bridge for pedestrians only with people just hanging out and kiosks from one end to the other. At times, you can hardly move. At night, dimly lit but very romantic. The Chain bridge is both a foot bridge for pedestrians as well as a bridge for automobiles. This bridge connects Buda to Pests. At the Buda end of the bridge is the funicular that takes tou up to the Prague castle. I think it is so much grander in part due to the views of the surrounding sights. It teminds me very much of the Brooklyn bridge in New York, only nicer. The Pests side is illuminated with the parliament building being the main focal point. It really is captivating and photographers are in their glory with so many photo ops including the Chain bridge. If you get the chance to visit, do not pass it up."

We really loved the lovely piece we got of the City when we were there last week. It looks beautiful from the river too, but if you take the time to walk across you\u2019ll see what I\u2019m talking about. The bridge was built based on what Sz\u00e9chenyi Istv\u00e1n imagined and I have to say, he had a really wonderful fantasy. The bridge in the evening lights looks like made of hundreds of stars. And here comes the other thing what makes this masterpiece extremly unique and special. The lions. As the guardians of these stars, made of stone, laying at the bridgeheads. The harmony of the lights and the lions make Budapest oldest and most famous bridge a really complete piece of art. Visit it when your in town!"

Even better is to walk across and you can see right down the Danube and see the Parliament buildings etc. lit up. Go across to the Pest side and there are a few good bars just as you come off it. Live music most nights and they are pretty banging!"

Like so many structures around the world, it was designed by a Scottish engineer and built by an English contractor, but we keep these things quiet as most engineers are very modest people. For example did you know the Sydney Opera House was built by an English engineering company. The Danish Architect had the idea but could not put his ideas into physical reality, it took an English engineering company to build it. The chain bridge is not built of chain but I guess that is the best description for a none technical person to understand. It was closed to traffic at the weekend and in my opinion should remain closed at all times to allow people to walk along the middle of the bridge and take in all its engineering features and beauty."

One of the most iconic landmark of Budapest is the Chain Bridge, It is an impressive bridge joining the Buda side and Pest side over the Danube River. I would venture that any tourist visiting Budapest would have crossed this bridge on foot to go from the Pest side to the Buda side several times It is a major thoroughfare in Budapest and from the Pest side one can see the Buda Castle and Royal Palaces, St, Matthias Church, and the Fisherman Bastion. From the Buda side, the impressive Hungarian Parliament building would capture your sight. The Danube traffic under the bridge is fairly busy as well with all kinds of marine vessels and cruise boats criss-crossing the Danube. All you need is the urge to walk to the bridge and cross it . No fees, but you do need a pair of good walking shoes and physical stamina. One of the never to miss attraction while in Budapest."

It was constructed in ten years between 1839 and 1849. This bridge is historically significant because it was the first permanent bridge which connected Buda and Pest. Before that temporary wooden bridges were constructed which were dismantled each winter because the snow damaged them. It is a stone bridge guarded with huge lion bridgeheads. There is an interesting anecdote about this. The sculptor Janos Marschalko committed suicide by jumping into the river when he realized that he forgot to give these lions any tongues."

The link between bustling Pest and the luxurious hotels overlooking the Danube and Castle Hill, overlooking the city, lighting up the night, reminding locals and visitors of Hungary's significance in European history. Walking across the bridge offers the perspective of the old and the new regimes--the Castle, Matyas Templom, and Fisherman's Bastion on the Buda Side and the impressive domed Parliament building constructedright on the river for the millenial celebration in 1896 on the Pest side. Heading to the Castle over the bridge you will likely meet lots of people from around the world, taking photos, riding bicycles, enjoying the view up or down river. On the Buda side, be careful as you head to the stairs up the hillside or the funicular to the Castle level. A very busy traffic circle (or roundabout) is located at the foot of the bridge, and crossing the feeder roads going into the traffic circle requires one's full attention. Only crosswalks provide a way to the other side, and it can be treacherous at certain times of the day. If you choose to ride the funicular up the hill, prepare yourself for a photo/video opportunity as you rise up higher above the bridge and the river, until you get to the top and can get the popular shots of the bridge from above and the nearby Parliament across the river. At times on weekends, the Chain Bridge is closed to vehicular traffic so that folk dancing, music and food festivals can take place there. It is a central feature of the city, and a walk across is a must. If you spend time in the city, take an afternoon one weekday to sit on a bench near the bridge to just watch the people of the city -- tourists, locals, commuters--as they cross the bridge, ride by on the tram, or just play by the river."

We could not see their tongue. There is a legend about them not having tongue. The view of river Danube, all the beautiful buildings like Parliament, Castle Hill, Royal Palace and other bridges were all looked very nice and took lots of photos. At the evening, we came back again when it was dark. We went to Royal Palace area and took beautiful illuminated snaps of Chain bridge with the reflection shimmering in the moonlight."

The bridge itself stands out against the skyline and is one of many bridges serving the community. You do however get a great view of the parliament building on one side, the castle at the top of the hill on the Buda side and upriver, Margaret Island. It's a free activity doesn't take long and you can catch a bus back to the centre of Pest.On the subject of busses...it's probably worth mentioning that if your visit is longer than three days you could consider a weekly ticket on metro bus and tram. Although it doesn't give concessional entry to museums it beats hoofing it if the feet have \" had it\"!"

It was the first permanent bridge to be built over the Danube in Budapest and was rebuilt after it was blown up by the Germans during WW2. The two large, majestic stone lions guarding its entry are, according to local legend, without tongues. I did not get close enough to inspect them! It is a busy bridge, carrying heavy city traffic so don' t expect to be able to amble along the centre as on Charles Bridge in Prague. There is, however, a pedestrian walkway at the side.

First, its a beautiful bridge that connects the two hottest tourist (and for locals too) areas of Budapest. Always busy with tourists talking a walk accross the bridge and water carriers under the bridge. If you are in Budapest, you will have to cross this bridge, unless you make a concerted effort not to do so. It is the main artery that connects the two parts of the city and if I were to guess probably the first bridge. The bridge offers tons of photo ops of both the city landscape and people. I did not cross the Bridge at night but I can bet it would be a whole different experience."

We stayed in Budapest with my wife in an excellent hotel near the Danube (the Prima Fashion Hotel) and decided to cross the Danube by foot at the Chain Bridge. It is a very old bridge that ends where starts the Buda Castle funicular. The view of the Danube from here is astonishing as well as the view of both sides of the Danube. On top of that, when you are done, you can take the funicular up to the Castle which is valuable to be given a visit."

Whether seen on a stroll along the river's edge, or from one of the city's vantage spots, It's quite difficult not to be drawn to this beautiful landmark. Located just south of the equally iconic Parliament Building, it's one of several bridges spanning the Danube and linking the Buda and Pest halves of the city. Designed as a hybrid suspension bridge, its stone towers project a sense of sturdiness while its late-19th century design exudes a sense of confident elegance. At each end of the bridge are a pair of guardian stone lions. The bridge is a good spot to get a panoramic view of both halves of Budapest and the river traffic along the Danube. It's also a good idea to revisit the bridge at night when it's brightly lit all along its length."

Quite a nice bridge, but nothing special. Walkways too narrow for any meaningful entertainment, stalls etc. Went across a number of times both in the day time and at night time and didn't stop once to admire anything. All I can suggest is that, if you want to cross the river, walk down to the chain bridge and cross it there. Then you'll tick two boxes in one go, you'll get where you want to go and you will have seen an attraction."

A tip: take a walk in the evening from the Buda side to the Pest side and watch the mysterious Gresham palace (now a five star hotel) at the end of the bridge. Take the cogwheel train on the Buda side to see the chain bridge from a distance. Try to sit in the first cabin for the best view. Good picture taking opportunity from the Buda side. A lot of cables from the tram line on the Pest side. This bridge was the first to be built over the Danube in the 19th century and the first to be rebuilt after WWII. Enjoy!"

Many bridges over major European rivers were destroyed toward the end of World War 2, either by retreating German troops or by Allied bombing. The Chain Bridge was severely damaged during the Siege of Budapest which involved Hungarian, German, Soviet and Romanian forces and rebuilt in 1949. So what a tourist sees today is a beautifully restored suspension bridge designed by Englishman William Tierney Clark in 1832, built by Scotsman Adam Clark (no relation) and opened in 1849.The Chain Bridge links all of the central tourist sites of Buda and Pest.While the narrow bridge has a footpath on both sides, each is rather narrow and skirts around the massive stone piers. Pedestrians and cyclists meet at these blind corners."

The Chain Bridge is a fine bridge in terms of its artistic and architectural flourishes and it is also incredibly practical, as it connects 2 significant parts of Budapest. Pedestrian and vehicle traffic are always pretty heavy, but walking out onto the bridge and stopping to stare up and down the Danube is a wonderful experience. This beauty, however, is best admired from a distance and in the dark. I advise walking to the Buda side and up into the hills were the Buda Palace is located and enjoying a nice dinner in one of those neighborhoods. When you are done and the sun has faded, you'll be treated to a truly splendid sight--the bridge all lit up and the majestic lion statues partially shrouded in ominous shadow. The Chain Bridge is lovely at night and fantastic as the light fades behind the Buda Hills."

He proposed it to the council and the construction began in 1840, funded by the Greek merchant Georgios Sinas. Designer was an English engineer William Tierney Clark. The construction lasted up to 1849, supervised by the Scottish engineer Adam Clark. At that time it was the 2nd largest bridge in the world. Named after the Count - Sz\u00e9chenyi Bridge - it's 375 m long and made out of wrought iron and stone. The Buda Castle Tunnel has exactly the same length and there is an anecdote saying that when it rains the Hungarians put the Chain Bridge into the tunnel for protection! In 1914 the bridge was strengthened. In 1945, at the end of WWII it was blown up. It reopened in 1949 again. It's usually called Chain Bridge due to the iron chains held by 48 m. river piers. The guardian lions at each of the abutments are sculpted by J\u00e1nos Marschalk\u00f3. They look like the Trafalgar Square ones, but they are smaller and were installed earlier (1852).The legend says that during the opening ceremony a little boy noticed loudly that the lions had no tongues, something that made the sculptor so upset that he jumped into the river Danube!!! Even today people don't see any tongues although the authorities insist that they do exist but can only be seen from above!!!! Anyway the bridge is really beautiful especially during the night, illuminated, and surrounded by Buda's and Pesta's impressive buildings, also illuminated. Magic panorama."

Really busy at rush hour and currently it's got road works at Adam Clark's Tunnel which holds up traffic a little.

It doesn't have chains, but people thought it looked like it did, hence the name. Guarded by two lions at each end, none of which have tongues; no-one seems to know why. More attractive at night when it is lit up, then it is really quite an attractive thing. We noticed, in Hungary, that they do \"lighting\" very well, and rarely do you find any bulbs that don't work. The bridge runs from Greshams Palace (Four Seasons) on the Pest side to the foot of the funicular railway up to Castle Hill on the Budapest side. Not long in European terms, with pedestrian walkways on either side, and steps and underpasses at each end so you don't have to deal with crossing Hungarian traffic - this is a REALLY good thing as Budapest drivers are not slow! Whilst most people take photos from a distance, particularly at night, there are opportunities for good close ups of the lions, or architectural bits. But, at the end of the day, it is just a bridge."

My partner and I visited Budapest recently on a short city break and walked all over this stunning city crossing this and the other bridges on our days out. Whilst walking over the Chain Bridge I noticed there were padlocks on it which people had written their initials on....you know the type of thing. So, we wanted to place a 'love lock' ourselves and made it our mission to buy a padlock and a permanent marker. Well, the padlock was fairly easy, just find a Mister Minit (shoe repairers) of which there are at least 2, possibly more. The permanent marker was quite another matter and it took us hours.....literally hours to find a shop that sold one. So, my top tip if you're going to Budapest as a couple?...TAKE A PADLOCK AND A PERMANENT MARKER WITH YOU!! (Alternatively, if you live in Budapest and are looking for a business venture? Set up a stall at either end of the bridge selling locks and pens....a little gold mine! ;-) )"

That is in and of itself not that hard as it is visible from many parts of the city. What is worth noting in particular is that approaching it from the east at sunset lends itself to especially beautiful views. With the sun setting behind the castle across the river on the other side of the bridge, you can get beautiful shades of yellow, orange, and purple mixed in with the blue and white of the sky. The silhouette of the lions, the bridge and the castle makes for an especially gorgeous sight. Of course, all this will depend somewhat on weather conditions, but it's worth a try since the bridge is in the middle of the city and you can easily work it into any itinerary."

The best view of The Hungarian capital - Budapest. - in my opinion , is the landscape of the Danube River, crossed by it's bridges , linking the two parts of the city - Buda end Pest.The Chain Bridge is the most impressive and beautiful . It has been planed and built by two engineers named Clark, with no connections to each other. The first, William Clark , an English man, planned the bridge in 1839 and the other - Adam Clark, a Scottish man, build it 10 years after (1849). The bridge has been bombed by the Germans, at the end of the 2nd W.W. and rebuild 100 years after it's inauguration in 1949.One can admire its neoclassic pillars forming two nice arches and the impressive metal constructions, the huge chains,on which , the bridge itself is suspended. The two pairs of lions, which are guarding the bridge at the both ends are also very impressive, but familiar figures, at the same time, on similar constructions.The view seen from the bridge on the both banks of the river is simply charming - the Hill of Buda, with the Royal Palace, the Matyas Church, The Fishermen's Bastions and The Gellert Hill - on the south bank and The famous House of Parliament, build in the architectonic sprite of The British Westminster, in a neogothic stile and many other impressive classic buildings, along the north bank of the Danube on the side of Pest. This spot has an even greater splendor by night, when all those sites and the bridge are illuminated . Sometimes , one May have the the chance, as well as I hade once to be there in a full moon night, while all this splendor has been reflected in the river by the moon light. It was a view , You never forget"

The bridge is a little long so if you don't like to walk or don't have good walking shoes, you will not enjoy the walk. A little tip, if you want to walk on one side going and the other side coming back, then the way to 'cross' the bridge at the end, is to get off the bridge on your side cross UNDER the bridge - there is a walk way - and then get on to the bridge again on the other side.

My thoughts upon crossing the bridge was the history of the river beneath (how many lives were thrown into that river) and such an inspiration for a song.The walk also brings the promise of the beauty of what is Buda and the view of the Pest side."

Both sides are amazing, especially at sunset in the summer. The bridge is a historic monument beautifully restored, still carrying the characteristics of an era long passed. It's nicely lit at night and there are lions at both bridgeheads, guarding the bridge. As a kid, I loved them. :) But really, a city-centre walk including the Chain Bridge is kind of the first thing to do at Budapest. Don't miss out on it."

Budapest is known for its beautiful bridges over the Danube and this one is a great work of art from the 19th century. It was severely damaged during World War Two and rebuild in the years after.An interesting thing is an existing urban legend which was told to us by our tour guide through Budapest. The Chain Bridge is \"guarded\" by four lions. At the inauguration, the sculptor was so proud of his work that he said that the animals are done with so much attention to details that they appear to be real. But seen from below, the lions look like they lack tongues. So a person from the crowd told the artist that he made some \"tongueless lions\". He was so ashamed that he threw himself in the river.Anyway it is a great spot for admiring the city views and the Danube."

According to our guide, during the unveiling, someone pointed out that the lions did not have any tongues and Janos was so distraught that he threw himself in the river (but he was saved).

That's because it's nearly an enlarged version of the Thames-traversing Marlowe Bridge in Marlowe, England, which is also, coincidentally, a Clark construct. The lions that guard the bridge also appear suspiciously like miniatures of the bronze lions found in London's Trafalgar Square. No matter! The Budapest structure is quite lovely AND quite convenient! An excellent addition to your walking-tour of banks of the Danube. Here's an idea: Start in Pest, viewing the Shoes on the Danube Memorial, just 100 yards or so upstream from the Chain Bridge. Then walk across the bridge, take the funicular up the incline, and spend an afternoon in Buda at the Presidential Palace, Matthias Church and Fisherman's Bastion. Take the funicular down, cross the Chain Bridge, and grab a light meal at Pepper's in the Budapest Marriott. The hubby and I did this and had an excellent excursion."

This bridge provides a pleasant means of walking from Pest to Buda or the reverse as well as some interesting views and photo opportunities. It cuts the Pest side in half with the left side mostly government related buildings and the right side the center of commercial Pest. It is especially beautiful at night when the bridge and some of the major buildings on both sides are illuminated. A stroll along the Pest Promenade gives the viewer some wonderful sights."

If you have small children, you'll have to hold their hands as the rails have large gaps in them and my wife kept saying to not get close. In addition, there are some places where the iron plate has rusted completely through on the bottom in some corners so it is clear that Hungary is going to have to come up with some maintenance money to preserve this beautiful bridge. Hopefully they will not let it go too long before they get it fully repaired. The lights on the Chain Bridge are a must see from the river banks."

Take the cog rail up to the castle, and continue the walk.

For us the lasting image of Budapest has to be the spectacular chain bridge.You have to walk across the bridge from either side to soak it all in - and it also affords some of the most amazing views of the Danube and the parliament building.On the Pest side Tram line 2 stops right next to the bridge and can be used to get to it - in case you didn't want to walk too much.The bridge was almost completely destroyed during the 2nd world war and since then has been painstakingly restored to its original glory.Some of the best photos of the bridge are from the Castle Hill and Gelert Hill on Buda side.The bridge almost acquires a different look during the night time with all the lights on - its simply put majestic."

Originally it was built for the Pest (the Eastern part of the city) citizens could cross the Danube more easily to go to the Castle and the Castle area. So both the circumstances in which it was built, both the bridge itself are a part of history. It looks very nice from both sides of the Danube, even from other bridges. If you would like to make a nice picture of Budapest, include the Chain Bridge, and you will get the likes on your social media site. :-)"

It was the first permanent stone bridge linking Buda to Pest and was opened in 1849. The whole thing was designed and built in England by William Tierney Clark then shipped over. At the time it was the longest suspension bridge in the world. The chains allow the bridge to flew a little and have been replaced a couple of times. You will notice it wobble when you try to take photos from it. There are magnificent stone lions at each end. At night it is beautifully lit up and provides great views of Parliament just up river. You will cross this bridge a lot if you visit attractions on Castle Hill."

No coinage seems to be expected, unlike the buskers. They are doing it for exposure. We heard two really interesting electronica bands. There was also a drinks tent set up.

It was named after Hungarian Minister of transport Istvan Szechenyi, who supported the project more than anyone else. This bridge became the beginning of uniting two cities Buda and Pest into one Budapest.Besides the historical importance of this bridge that is possible to see in film like \"The Bridgeman\" (2002, dir. Geza Beremenyi), we (a couple) would not call this bridge as the best in Budapest. At first, it is not possible to sit there and enjoy the views as it is in Liberty (Green) bridge. Second, there are sometimes so many tourists together with souvenir/water sellers, so you are afraid that it can break because of the big crowd. There are also no trams on it that could bring additional atmosphere.In addition to historical importance, the government of the city updates the fame of the bridge via national celebrations by installing fireworks near it during St. Stephen's Day (20th of August) or letting pilots fly under it during 1st of May."

Also the road is very busy and the air quality is not that great !"

It was built in the 19th century, but destroyed in the WWII. They retrieved it from the Danube and restored it. It is one of the city's landmarks, and for good reason. It is big, central, offers a spectacular view of the Danube and the City and it has a history.There is a story behind the 4 lions gatekeeping the bridge (2 on each side). Rumor has it that the architect was very proud of his work (as h should be), boasting that the bridge was perfect. He woved to jump into the Danube should anyone find a flaw with it. Then a little girl (some say it was his own daughter) noticed that the 4 lions don't have tongues in their open mouth. The architect admitted it was a mistake and was very distraught. He was about to surrender himself to the river, when Mr. Szecheny (who was a major benefactor) said that the lions would grow tongues when a Hungarian woman crosses the bridge, who has never cheated on her husband. Some 150 years later, they are still tongueless."

Chain Bridge (Szechenyi Lanchid) is an historically important bridge crossing the Danube River in Budapest that is well worth viewing and perhaps walking during trips to the city. Designed by William Clark and opening in 1849, this was the first permanent bridge linking Buda to Pest. At the time, Chain Bridge was considered one of the most stunning bridges in the world, along with the Brooklyn Bridge in NYC (USA). It remains beautiful to this day. You can see the 202 metre long suspension bridge well from both sides of the river and there are some very attractive vantage points from upon Castle Hill, allowing you to take photos of the bridge with Pest in the background. It is very much worth walking the bridge between Buda and Pest as well. In addition to the decorative cast iron and two pillar arches you pass, the end of the bridge features lions resting upon the abutments. These were carved by sculptor Janos Marscholko in 1852 and add a majestic touch to this attraction. At night, the bridge arches are lit, making it very nice to see Chain Bridge after the sun goes down as well. Overall, we very much liked the Chain Bridge, finding this to be our second favourite behind Art Nouveau style - Liberty Bridge. It is a nice landmark to see and also enjoyable to cross during trips to Budapest."

From Pest walk across the bridge and take the funicular up to the castle area - walk to Fishermans Bastion and just take in the view. If you are staying at the Buda Hilton, then do the reverse ! Either way this is how you get to see both of the best views in Budapest. Incidentally anyone who has been to Marlow and feels a bit of deja vu, thats because it was designed by the same chap !"

It is a reconstructed bridge so it s a modern suspension bridge. The Main advantage is that the bridge leads directly to the castle hill area and is hence the most convenient bridge. Other than that, it s Ning spectacular. Use it as a infrastructure but not as a tourist attraction."

Though you can hop on the #16 bus quite inexpensively which takes you across and up to the major sights in Buda it is a beautiful walk and gives amazing views and photo ops. Try it on a sunny day as well as a clear night if possible. The only negative I felt was that the guard rail was more aesthetic than functional. Under the rail, rather than bars or grating there was only open \"x's\" of sculpted iron. Perfectly safe for adults, though it looks much more open than one might expect, but it could be very dangerous with small kids. Mine thankfully have a healthy respect for heights so it was no trouble keeping them away from the edge, but it is something to be aware of if you are walking with toddlers."

This specially architected bridge of the nineteeth century has been fully resotred and was a major function of traffic during the communist era in Budapest. The respect shown by the communists and now the liberalists to be sure to maintain this high traffic structure has become a hallmark of the river scenes in Budapest, especially at night when the CHAIN BRIDGE is lit up with multicolored lights. Do not miss taking a great picture and also (maybe)( walking across the bridge and gaining very interesting and different view of Budapest during the day and the evening."

I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true but it is a nice story. One can walk on the bridge, get great pictures of the Danube, of the bridge with its lions and of the castle hill but has to be careful because there are a lot of cyclist so don\u2019t get so absorbed by the view and get in their way.

It's a great walk and only the second bridge to begin to span the Danube. The first permanent bridge over the Danube from Buda to Pest was bombed by the retreating Germans and rebuilt after WWII, only the classic pillars survived. It re-opened to the public on the bridges 100th birthday in 1949. 100,000 bolts hold it together a fact I learned on the Hop on Hop Off Green Bus tour which I also highly recommend. I love it day or night. This busy bridge has such an old world glamorous air about it, especially all lit up. For a little something different prior to sunset head down to the bridge, perhaps to have dinner on the top deck of a nearby floating restaurant. Keep your eye on the bridge as the lights (initially installed in 1937 to welcome an Italian king and Austrian chancellor) come on they are initially green, turning white as they warm up. It is definitely an Hungarian icon worth preserving and one of the most recognized bridges in the world."

Watch out for cyclists.On the Buda side next to Parliament- you can find the shoe exhibit.Near the end of World War II, thousands of Hungarian-Jews were shot and thrown into the river by their fellow citizens. Our guide said that Jews were tied together with a long rope and every 4th person was shot and the rest pushed into the Danube to drown.The idea to place a monument on the river embankment to the victims belongs to a Hungarian sculptor Gyula Pauer. The monument has 60 pairs of iron shoes, forming a row of 40 metres. It is dedicated to the victims of the Hungarian fascist Arrow Cross party who shot the people and pushed them into the river, sparing themselves the hard work of burials. The victims had to take their shoes off, since shoes were valuable at the time. You can walk to Parliament which is under construction now- and hard to access."

The tour buses are not allowed across it so it worth getting off and walking across from the Pest side to the Buda side. You can see the funicular railway in the hillside and this will take you up to the Castle district from where you can pick up your tour bus again and have an ice cream at the same time."

Ok, so it is just a bridge, but it is very special bridge, aesthetically, culturally, economically, for the sheer audacity involved in its design and construction, and of course, for its location at the heart of a particularly fetching vista.It may not at first seem that impressive, so when you walk across it, and you 'must' walk, take the time to appreciate just how ground breaking its design was in the middle of the 19th century. Marvel at how the road, the traffic, the pavements... everything, is quite literally hanging from those outsized bicycle chains. If you're still not impressed, then perhaps you should consider how Tierney Clarkes design, completed only 10 years after Stephensons Rocket won the Rainhill trials and led to the worlds first railway, called for the whole bridge was transported from Britain in bits. This bridge is a marvel, maybe not as technically impressive as the combined suspension and bascules of London's Tower Bridge, or as imposing as the Sydney Harbour Bridge, but you must consider that it predates Tower Bridge by 40 years, and Sydney's bridge by almost 90 years. Given the speed of developments of the industrial revolution, it's a different era, the gap between them as distinct in technological advancement as that between the Sony Walkman and the iPod.It's a work of art, an engineering marvel, and a useful transport link, and what's more there's never a queue to see it and it's free. What more can you ask for?"

Walking across it, taking the night cruise the pass underneath, walking the boulevard of Danube river to catch a glimpse or admire it from above at the Fishermen's Bastion. The story why this bridge was built is great as well ( a count who was in Pest when his father died in Buda. He couldn't reach his father, since the Danube was frozen and ferries weren't crossing. He decided it was time for a bridge).A typical image of this beautiful city, so don't miss it."

Chain Bridge (Sz\u00e9chenyi L\u00e1nch\u00edd) is one of Budapest's most recognizable symbols, and also the first permanent bridge between Buda and Pest. Specifically, the two main parts of today's Hungarian city for centuries been associated only pontoon bridge.The story of the origin of the idea for the construction of the Chain Bridge is a bit unusual. Conceived the idea, and will later show and one that is spent in work, Count Istv\u00e1n Sz\u00e9chenyi, he learned that his father had died in Vienna. Given that this happened in December, the winter was severe and the bridge was closed. It is a protracted departure for whole week and the count has promised to build a permanent bridge, no matter the cost.The works were started 22 years later, 1842nd, and lasted for seven years. The bridge is in some way contributed Buda and Pest, to which he finally came 1873rd year. He also was a symbol of the strengthening of the city, its growth, both in size and power. Budapest has entered its second golden age - the age of the cultural, economic and intellectual prosperity! The bridge is especially beautiful at night when the lights shine down the entire length of it, and the Danube becomes large mirror in which to see the outline of one of the most beautiful European bridges!"

Tip - if possible take a seat at the front of the1st carriage as there are amazing views looking down at Chain Bridge with St. Stephen's Basilica in the background. Make sure that when you get to the top that you go left into the grounds of the Royal Palace. From here you will have the best views of Budapest. Save this trip for a clear fine day as it will be one of your best!

The walkways were narrow and very awkward for both pedestrians and cyclers (quite many in Budapest, thumbs up for the locals!), and the motor cars and buses whizzing by felt somewhat incongrous. Too bad they don't make it pedestrian-only. Like Charles Bridge in Prague, for instance. Or build two fancy footbridges on its sides."

The bridge is to Budapest what the Brooklyn Bridge is to New York City, both for its beauty and for the achievement its construction represented. On the Pest side sits the Gresham Palace Hotel, and on the other side of the Danube Buda Castle Hill. A perfect self-guided Budapest tour would take the reader from the Basilica, down to Gresham Palace, across the Danube on the Szechenyi, and up the funicular to Castle Hill.

(Alcohol is forbidden in KSA, yet everyone there has it!!) We walked from our hotel each morning, and would do three to five mile excursions, up to about lunch time. The walk to Chain Bridge took us through the town square and across the river Danube. The bridge is a work of art and an architectural marvel. This is one of the very unique things about Budapest. Each bridge across the river has a story and was monumental for its time.Well preserved and maintained. Breath taking views of it can be had from the castle/fort on the pest side.Adorned with statues and works of art, all along the walk to the bridge, every step was another opportunity for a photo.I would place Budapest as one of the top ten cities to visit in the world.Great spring weather, with no humidity and low amounts of people crowding.Be sure to NOT SNEAK onto the buses. They are cheap enough with an unlimited weekly pass. The fine for getting caught is higher than three weeks worth of passes!!"

It has a pair of huge stone lions on either side of the bridge - very impressive! From Chain Bridge, the view of the Danube and the landmark buildings on either side of the river is breath-taking. I walked across the bridge on my first morning in Budapest to get to the Buda side and see the attractions there. The next day, I took a bus from Roosevelt ter on the Pest side to Holy Trinity Square in Buda where Fisherman's Bastion is located in order to visit St. Matthias Church. It went across Chain Bridge and I got to see the panoramic views once again.On the Buda side the bridge leads to Clark Adam ter which is named after the bridge's builder."

The bridge itself is overrated as a tourist attraction; for example, the stone lions at the end of the bridge, while large and well-sculpted, aren't unique in any way.

I lived in BUD for 5 years and was amazed every evening on the ride home of the beauty of the place.We were fortunate enough once to be able to climb to the very top of the bridge, we have a friend who does pyrotechnics, and they were setting up for a show, he took us up.

Yep, as some other reviewers have said, it's just a bridge but let's not forget when it was built which makes it a pretty good example of early engineering. Definitely worth walking across and if you know the Marlow bridge across the Thames, worth comparing the two. Don't forget to check out the tunnel entrance on the Buda side, also desinged by Mr Clark. There are prettier, more impressive bridges around the world but it's still worth seeing.Here's the history lesson if you're interested: Tierney Clark designed four suspension bridges: at Hammersmith, Shoreham, Marlow and, the largest, at Budapest. Only the Marlow and Budapest bridges survive. The Budapest bridge is known as the Sz\u00e9chenyi Chain Bridge and is named after Count Istv\u00e1n Sz\u00e9chenyi who, in 1839, invited Tierney Clark to design and build a bridge across the Danube. It was the first permanent bridge across the Danube below Vienna since Roman times. Destroyed in World War II, it has since been faithfully reconstructed. The main span is 666 feet long; for a time the longest in the world. A plaque (unveiled in May 1998) on the Sz\u00e9chenyi Chain Bridge commemorates the link with Marlow Suspension Bridge"

The bridge was built by William Tierney Clark, a Scottish engineer, in 1849, but was severely damaged in the Siege of Budapest, and reopened in 1949. This is a nice bridge but I think it is better to look at it from Castle Hill, or along the Danube. You get quite a good view of Parliament, but it is better to look at it from Castle Hill. It was also quite windy on the bridge. You can't really see Budapest without going over this bridge, but I didn't find it incredibly spectacular."
