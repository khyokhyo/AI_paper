Regular clean and cheap, the 3 words that come to mind when I think of this train, if you are staying in bangkok, even though only limited stops, it will get you thru most of the traffic and even if you have to get a taxi at the other end will save both time and money in getting to your destination, it links with the other 2 modern rail systems mrt and bts so most places a tourist would want to go are reachable... it's also nice to see that there is no premium or increased fares just because you are leaving the airport.. on the negative side though the ticket system is different for each of the 3 rail networks so if you need to connect with one of the other lines you would have to buy 2 different tickets, this we are promised will be amended by mid 2017..."

It takes about 35-40 minutes between the airport and Phaya Thai station where you can take the BTS to other parts of the city. I stayed at a hotel in SIlom and getting there cost me BHT45 on the Skytrain and BHT31 on the BTS to Chong Nonsi which is a lot cheaper than when I took the taxi the last time which cost more than BHT400. The travel time was less than one hour which was shorter than the taxi ride which was about 1 1/2 hours. This is definitely a fast and efficient way to travel between the airport and the city."

We had been using the airport rail link a few times already whenever we go to Bangkok arriving at Suvarnabhumi Airport. It is cheap and convenient. It's costs 45 Baht from airport to Phaya Thai station and from there transfer to the BTS. On our recent trip we had to alight at Chidlom BTS and the one way trip from Phaya Thai BTS to Chidlom BTS costs 25Baht. For each passenger traveling from the airport to Chidlom costs a total of 70 Baht. For 2 pax is 140 Baht so that is so much cheaper than taking the taxi, minus the traffic jam. However the only downside is most of the BTS in Bangkok has no escalator to the street level so we have to carry the bags down the flight of stairs. Arriving into Bangkok and taking the train is okay as the luggage is still light. However if you are departing from Bangkok and after a shopping spree, taking the train may not be too convenient as you have to carry the heavy luggage up the stairs to the BTS station and maybe platform."

A very kind security guard pushed my giant suitcase to the street corner and stopped the traffic so we could cross in safety! He also stopped a Tuc-Tuc and I started to negotiate with the driver. I managed to reduce the asking price from 500 Thai Baht to 250. I gave the kind security officer 30 Baht, which made him happy! After some coaxing, I managed to sneek on board the Tuc-Tuc and we sat off in the heavy traffic. I was very happy when we finally arrived at the excellent Hotell Hope Land! I would strongly advice the Bangkok Transport System to Improve the interconnections beetween Airport Rail Link, Skytrain and the Metro. Now, it is simply not good enough!"

For those going to hotels in middle Sukhumvit Road: get off at \"Makassan\" where you can connect to the underground line MRT at Phetchaburi (about 3-5 mins walk between stations, separate tickets).Those going to Khao San Road area get off at Phaya Thain (final stop) and catch a taxi (avoid touts waiting at the station), Get one that just offloaded passengers, have your hotel adress in Thai writing on hand and insist on using the taxameter! Also to the Silom Road and lower Sukhumvit area stay on to Phaya Thai and change to the BTS skytrain (separate tickets).

Costs 45 Baht which is $2 AUD and gets you to Phaya Thai in about 25 minutes and you can then swap and go two stops to Siam in a few more minutes.It's very convenient if you have a few hours stopover at the airport!!!Only reason I am not giving 5 stars is because the express line has been out of service for a while and was annoying during my stay. Also I wish it opened earlier than 6am for those early morning flights.Highly recommend to anyone visiting Bangkok."

It links Suvarnabhumi Airport to Bangkok city centre with a total of eight stops. As the train frequency is not as high as BTS/MRT, the train could be very crowded at times. However, it is still a convenient and cheap way to get to the city centre. Please note that it operates from 6 am to midnight. My suggestion is to alight at Makkasan Station or Phaya Thai Station and then catch a taxi from there. The main reason is that the BTS and MRT stations in Bangkok are generally not luggage friendly."

I'm a huge fan of the Airport Rail Link from Suvarnabhumi Airport to Bangkok proper (cheap, very reliable and avoids horrendous traffic), and there's another airport link being constructed at the moment (Sep 2016) to service BKK's other major airport at Don Mueang. The Airport Train provides great access to and from the basement of Suvarnabhumi Airport - a great world class service that gets you as close to the airport as a taxi does, and there's an interchange station with the BTS Skytrain or MRT Underground Train stations.The Airport Rail Link is in very good company with both the BTS Skytrain and MRT Underground Train - all three provide public transport to a world class standard.  If you're staying within close proximity to one the BTS Skytrain or MRT Underground Train stations, they should be your primary transport whilst in Bangkok - if you're not staying within close proximity, I suggest you should consider relocating! If the Skytrain doesn't get you to one of the must-see attractions around Bangkok, the MRT likely will - and vice-versa.Skytrain offers the views of BKK whilst perched above the ground in air-conditioned comfort, but MRT stations provides a reprieve from the heat whilst waiting for air- conditioned trains to come along."

I use this option maximum time, as I go to BKK almost every alternate month and every time travel ONLY through Air Link. I usually need to get down or travel through Makasan station on Airport link, and some times getting taxi here to go to your hotel can be an issue. about 10 min of wait is usually required to get a taxi or Uber to arrive. During peak Hours, the trains are crowded and so if you are travelling in family or a large group with lot of luggage, allow yourself some extra time as you may have to wait for 2-3 trains to pass which may mean a wait time at station of around 15-20 min.

You can connect to the Airport Rail Link from any BTS line, just follow the maps posted everywhere in the stations. The BTS has announcements at every stop in both Thai and English. Get off when Airport Rail Link is announced and proceed to the train. It is really cheap and easy and you avoid all the traffic in Bangkok. My only reservation would be trying to get a lot of luggage on. I am 63 and only do this with a carryon. A younger person can probably manage more!"

No problems with wheeling luggage apart from a very short set of steps. The fare from Makasan to the airport was 35 Baht. The tickets on the two systems are not interchangeable but it's easy to buy them on the platforms from the vending machines. The sky train gives you a good view of the outer city on the way to the airport, so an added bonus."

It avoids horrendous traffic on all the main roads and will get you there in a predictably short time. The main short coming is that it will require at least a taxi ride to get there from nearly all hotels. On clear roads it would be tempting to just ride the tax all the way to the airport; Sunday a.m and Saturday before 10 a.m. would be good times to avoid the skytrain as traffic is quiet then."

First of all, you have to get to the transfer station at Phaya Thai BTS Station. At non-rush hours with light luggage this is not too difficult, but between 7:30AM - 9:30AM, or 4PM - 7PM it can be nasty. The other issue is train hours. It is not a 24 hour service so you need to match your arrival/departure times with train operating hours.Personally I only use this when I go to the airport to meet arriving or departing friends. Taxi service is ubiquitous and cheap in Bangkok. A taxi fee of $12 U.S. will get you anywhere, and usually it is less. Rush hour is a pain whether sitting in a taxi or fighting to board BTS. One note of caution - do not expect your taxi driver to understand much or any English. Have your destination written down, preferably in Thai."

If this is your first time in Bangkok and you do continue your journey by taxi, make sure the driver uses the meter. Some (though not many) unscrupulous drivers will ask for a flat fee, which invariably runs at B150-400.At the time of writing, a one-way journey on the train from Suvarnabhumi to Paya Thai cost B45 and took around a half hour."

From the airport, you can take the train to link with two other metro systems (the BTS and MRT). Actually, there is an express service which doesn't stop at all the stations along the way. The City line is the cheaper - only slightly slower service. From beginning to end, the trip takes only around 30 minutes. A lot faster than taking a taxi and soooo much cheaper. You can haul your suitcase and carry on with you into the train - no problem. No trolley though, which could really help for travelers like Beyonce or Kim K. But they probably booked a Limo anyway so...The end of the Line for the City Line is Phya Thai Station which links with the BTS line. If you are traveling to the Suwannaphum airport, you are bound to find a seat (if you move fast enough) at this station. At the next stops, the cars will begin to fill up.Fortunately there are escalators going up. Going down is the problem. You would have to haul your precious belongings down several flights of stairs - but then be comforted that you might be able to take on that MMA fight in the octagon after your journey.Love the City Line. Be thankful it is there for you."

If you arrive by Taxi or Uber my experience is that the drivers do not know how to get to the auto entrance of the station. My Uber driver told me that GPS was finished and that I should walk from the car, across a two lane road, climb a concrete barricade, cross two sets of tracks, climb another fence, cross yet another road to get to the terminal. Even of I were not handicapped, at my age of 72 it would be unlikely that I could actually reach my destination via that route. On my return, i found the directions to a taxi stand ambiguous, and was finally told one had to call a taxi. This was a challenge to my ability. I could and did summon Uber. You can opt to take the city line or the express line.. In my experience, timing is everything. I have paid the express premium, but they leave less often than the city line, and with the extra wait it actually took longer to take the express. Boarding at the main station, Makkasan, at rush hour often means squished standing room only for several stops. Boarding at Suvarnbhumi gives you a much better chance at getting a seat. Thais don't always respect a queue, and when the doors open there can be a bit of a stampede. The biggest downside is getting to and from the rail link station in Bangkok. The airport end is efficient, well marked, and easy to use."

Taking the train all the way to Phaya Thai takes about 30 min.

The Airport Rail Link is very convenient if you are travelling in small numbers, if it's rush hour, it's raining, or you are running on the cheap. If there are 4 in your group, I recommend taking a taxi as it reduces the amount of lugging bags.Hope you never have to travel on Friday evenings when it's raining!!!The Airport Rail Link is at the basement of Suvarnabhumi Airport. You need to just keep going down the escalators until you can\u2019t go any further. Then you need find your way to the centre of that level and you will find a downward slope towards the ticket office and gates.This is also where you can change your money. There are several foreign exchange counters in this area, and although you can\u2019t play one off the other, you can work out which one is offering the best rate and plump for that one. You probably won\u2019t get such a concentration of foreign exchange dealers in one location anywhere else in Bangkok. Also something to bear in mind, these guys like big notes. If you are travelling with large denomination bills, you will see on the electronic boards that they offer better rates for those larger notes.The line that you currently have no choice but to take the the commuter line. This also stops at Makkasan and Phaya Thai BTS stations, but also every stop along the way. The service runs from 06.00 \u2013 24.00While I can\u2019t give you the exact prices for all the stations, to get to Makkasan it costs THB 35, for Paya Thai it is THB 45 (about 60-80p in real money) for about a 30minute journey. As a point of reference, a taxi could cost around THB400 (\u00a37) and might take longer if it\u2019s rush hour or/and it\u2019s raining.You can either use the machine (which will be in English or Thai) or you can go to the counter. Very broadly, if your hotel is near an MRT station, you will need to go Makkasan, if your hotel is near a BTS station you will need Phaya Thai.In exchange for your THB45 you will receive a little token in the shape of a large coin \u2014 either yellow or red in colour if I remember correctly.Once you have gone through the gates, you make your way down the escalators to the platform. Usually there are people already queuing up at the doors. This not the opportunity to show how clever you are, and try to sneak to the front. Thai people are generally non-confrontational so probably won\u2019t say anything, but you will certainly get other visitors making comments to you such as \u201cget to the back \u2026 buddy\u201d or, if you\u2019re really unlucky someone just punches you one\u2026 no no \u2026 I jest, but there is reason there is a queue, people got there before you! If you happen to have arrived just as a train has left, you will find yourself at the front of the queue. This does not mean stand right by the door. You will need to stand behind the line. If you don\u2019t, you will soon hear a blast of a whistle when the security instruct you to retreat \u2014 bear this in mind, as it happens at all BTS stations. If you\u2019re wondering why the whistle is blowing, it\u2019s probably because of you!When the train does finally arrive, don\u2019t dash on before everyone has got off. Firstly, this is bad etiquette anywhere in the world (just because you left your home country doesn\u2019t mean you left your manners behind:)) but secondly, yes you guessed it, it will lead to a blast on that famous whistle. The security guards will visually sweep the train to ensure that there was nothing left on the train, or that there is nothing suspicious (other than tourists). Once they give the all clear, you can go ahead and board.Bear in mind that this is a commuter train so you will be sharing the carriage with many other people. Yes, when you first get on it is likely that there will be plenty of space. However, as you get to more and more stations there will be many people boarding \u2014 especially if it is rush hour and/or raining. Remember how you feel when it\u2019s rush hour? Yeah, you get pee\u2019d off when people take lots of space, so think about others. Keep your luggage close and don\u2019t take up those extra spare seats for your hand bag."

Pay for a token at the booth where they have live people. Price depends on where you go. The line is pretty straight, but it does have stops. I take it all the way to the end - Phaya Thai. It is air conditioned and fast. Before you board at the airport, they do have transit police that search the train when it arrives before they let anyone board, then they let people in. You use the token to enter the station area where you descind to the platform area. The trains run very frequently. This part is handicapped friendly, a lot of the stations are not however. Depends on where you go. some have elevators to the ground (or escalators) many stations only have stairs though. Phaya Thai station does have an elevator to the street."

Better you carry Thai Bhat or accepted currency for exchange, before you land, as there are no ATM facility before the immigration lane, in Bangkok Airport.Hope you make use of these tips."

Bangkok is a place worth visiting again as it preserves its traditional culture and heritage well. \u6a5f\u5834\u7684\u6548\u7387\u61c9\u8a72\u518d\u63d0\u5347, \u4f46\u662f\u66fc\u8c37\u662f\u503c\u5f97\u518d\u53bb\u7684\u57ce\u5e02\u3002"

Since it was my first time to visit Thailand, i was really glad to have found this airport rail link which was very easy to use. The translations inside the stations were also very helpful. Maps were everywhere except for the toilets. But the stations were really safe and reliable, clean and almost on-time. I think the train is usually packed not just by thousands of travelers but also of the locals so make sure that you can bear to stand for some time depending on where you're getting off. I guess in some stations exits were confusing so make sure to find someone to ask to before you go anywhere. There were stations that do not have air conditions also so be ready during summer time. Nonetheless, it's a great help for tourist alikes. I bet it is safe, too as i did not encounter any bad or alarming issues during my almost couple of weeks stay in Bangkok where i only used trans and trains and trains. Happy travel!:)"

The train takes almost 1 hour to get to the airport from Phya Thai BTS station, with many stops including the one at Lad Krabang where KMITL is located. A huge number of passengers adds to the ARL here and I found it was terrible. I could barely breathe with the sweating armpit of another passenger in front of me. Many luggages and bag packs kept everyone stuck in their places. And yes, we have to stand all the way to the airport (there are seats but very little amount). Another issue I found annoying is when I departed from the airport to get to the city. I understand the security reason that the security needs to check for any abnormality left in the train but the way they communicate is horrible. They shouted and blew the whistle at the passengers like some homeless dogs, to stop them from getting into the train before the inspection. Why don't they close the doors while doing this ?"

Up 40 steps, across walkway bridge, down 40 steps.My advise, spring for the little $5 USD extra and take a taxi to your hotel front door. You don't need the grief after a long flight."

From there, you can change to another train line or take a taxi. If you are planning to take a taxi from Phaya Thai Station, watch out for taxi drivers waiting at the station, who are asking for ridiculous taxi fares from tourists.

Traffic in Bangkok is terrible, it is a big city afterall, and we weren't trying to spend $30 to get to the airport (it was the end of our trip, so we had run through most of our money). We decided to give this a try and I'm so glad we did!We walked to our closest metro stop, which was less than 10 mins away. We put in our destination at an automated kiosk at the bottom of the station. You don't need exact change. We were given two tokens, one for my boyfriend and I. We were a little confused going up, but one of the guards helped me go through. We waited about 10 minutes for our train, which was running like 2 or 3 minutes late. We had 7 stops to get to the airport. It was air conditioned and not very crowded, though we just found a spot to stand in the corner. We were dropped right off at the airport. Seriously, this is the way to get to/from the airport! It's cheap, easy and by far the fastest method of transportation. This metro definitely beats the on in Washington, DC on cleanliness and timeliness, so if you're from the States you will be pleasantly surprised."

The ticket only cost 45 bahts and could be easily purchased from the vending machine or service counter. The train was crowded but still quite comfortable with nice air-conditioning. It had a few intermediate stations but could still brought us to Phaya Thai terminal station in around 40 mins. We could then connect to BTS sky train quite easily. Highly recommended for budget travellers without lots of luggage!"

I have been asked from tiurist from time to time whether they get on the right platfrom for blue or red line.The company should fix this. Also at acertain point along the route there would be a loud noise as if something wrong with the train. It is so loud that I thought those passenger who has heart diseases could be shock from the noise. Other than that it shorten your travel time from Suvanabhoomi airport to downtown to 30 minutes amidst the heavy traffic especially on friday evening."

Coming from the Skytrain where most escalators only go upward, the walk down the BTS platform can be quite a strain. Once you get to Phaya Thai, sign lead clearly. On the floor where you get tickets, proceed to the counter--it's faster than dealing with the machines. At least here, there's an elevator to the platform--which can get very busy and crowded so watch your wallets. When you move in, enter to the righthand side if you want a seat. Too bad they've forgone the express line that takes you straight to the airport.If coming from the airport, line up properly and don't try to jump right in after the people have gone down. Security needs a minute to scan and check the train. It's 45 baht one way, versus at ten times that on a cab. If you're alone or a couple, Airport Rail is a good idea."

Limo services will start to ask for your business as early as the baggage pickup area. and in the Arrival Hall. One floor under the arrival hall is the taxi departure line. As in most cities you want to make the ride on the taxi meter and do not negotiate a price. The basement of the airport holds the best option for getting in the city: the Airport Rail Link. Take the elevator down and follow the signs.  It is expected that you will have luggage to manage but reason needs to come into play. One large piece with a carry-on and personal bag is about all one adult can manage on the train. People in Bangkok have learned to take the Airport Link for normal transportation but understand the purpose is to accommodate airport traffic. It can be crowded so try to sit near a door to make getting off easier.  The Air link connects with the BTS Skytrain, and the MRT subway system. Generally you only want to have a carry-on bag on these two systems as they are for general population transportation. If it is early in the morning or late at night, then a larger bag can be taken.  Obviously I use the Airport Rail Link often when traveling from the city to the airport. A little common sense makes it a very useful tool."

The last and also my favourite is their city line, the most economical and connect to their MTR in some stops. They departs every 15 min and the whole route is about 30min- 45 min depending on time of day. This train is not only for tourists, their local also take this as one of their option. They run from 6am to 12 midnight. I think the same as their BTS. Bangkok's traffic is a nightmare, no matter what time of day. If you are coming from the international airport, definitely take their airport train then BTS or MRT, then perhaps a little taxi ride to your final destination. Highly recommended."

I was a little concerned that, having also damaged a knee before heading out on holiday, take a cab would be a better option but we decided to try the airport rail option having heard so much about how bad the traffic was in Bangkok itself. The reality was that the train couldn't have been easier. There's very simple to use ticket vending machines in the airport and within a couple of minutes of clearing arrivals we were heading into town at about 10 on a Monday morning with no fuss whatsoever. The sting in the tail was the then planned swap to the monorail system, which is equally clean and efficient, to get to our hotel was made a difficult task with cases due to the apparent absence of either lifts or escalators in most stations. Definitely recommend the airport rail but if you do have a lot of luggage then perhaps grabbing a cab once in town is worthwhile and save the monorail and other (very cheapens excellent) public systems for when you're luggage free. P.S. Having headed down to Hua Hin we did get the chance to compare in contrast with taxiing in and out of the city. Definitely take the Airport Rail!!"

The Airport Rail Link is an average experience which could be an excellent one. i rode this train on day 2 of its operation a couple for years back: a slick 15 minute ride from Suvarnabhumi to Makkasan city terminal with no stops. Trouble was few people used it. at 100 Baht it was only a couple of dollars cheaper than a taxi and Makkasan Terminal was too far to walk to Sukhumvit and too close for a taxi to want the job. So the SRT punted it to local commuters with great success - so much success that they needed the underused express train sets to cope with the demand. The result was that when I used the service from Ratchaprarop station to the airport a couple of weeks ago, I found standing room only and nowhere to stow my suitcase. Effectively the airport users have become an inconvenience. On the plus side it only takes 25 minutes which is quicker than a taxi, at 40 Baht it must be one of the cheapest airport links around, and it is clean and air-conditioned.The SRT needs to invest in new train sets. But when this will happen is anyones guess!"

We have used the service twice and upon arrival both times thought it to be very convenient to our hotel (Mercure Siam) although this also meant a couple of station changes for the correct line. Carriages were full but not jammed in like sardines. However when changing stations things did get a little funky, not too out of control but we were still travelling pretty light at this time, that is why I say arrival is a good service.Departure the first time we used this service was Ok we seemed to be ahead of the crowd and the carriages were relatively spacious and stations seemed less chaotic, however last time and it will be the last time for awhile, it was a struggle with our 2 heavy suitcases plus each with a small but full back pack. The carriages were packed and the stations were crowded, it made moving through people with our luggage very difficult and a nightmare to handle in the crowed.On the plus side though if you are travelling light and at times that don't conflict with work hours then it is the best option so you don't miss your flight by being stuck in Bangkok traffic."

Remember there is little to no English wording at the station and Thai is very difficult to read!"

People of western states very often make the big mistake to consider that train shuttle as as part of a commuter system on big airports in Europe or other big cities.It is run by State Railway of Thailand (SRT) and is that company has no connection to MRT (Mass Rapid Transport) or the BTS skytrain company.If you still into saving money after your arrival please take the fast red train which terminates at Makhasan Station. From there you have to go 10 minutes to find the Metro Station Petchaburi. And this is definitely no fun after a long flight and the tropical heat gives you a hard time.So you better take the blue City-line which I think has 8 to 10 stops until it terminates at Phaya Thai Station. From there walk down all the steps and after 10 meters walk up all the steps of Phaya Thai BTS Skytrain station. Buy a new ticket and then good luck to get access to the train with all your luggage and find almost all trains packed with people.Rather often the blue city line can get stuck on the tracks near Ramkamhaeng Station because of the very weak Ramkamhaeng power Station. During March a morning train got stuck on the tracks for 1 hour. The doors were not be opened and the air condition went out of power too. People collapsed and some had serious problems because of that.So please think twice before you do are confronted with rather big transportation problems after your arrival in Bangkok airport."

Cost for a trip is a mere 35bht.I can highly recommend using this mode of transportation vs taxis when destination is Suvarnabhumi Airport.

The problem is that this is not an \"airport express\" taking you quickly and directly into the heart of the city, it's a commuter train that happens to terminate at the airport, and thus is used by the locals as such, making it extremely crowded. What is needed is an actual \"airport express\" that takes you straight to the city, and would thus not be of any interest to daily commuters. The train is also mysteriously short of carriages - three - and does not make the best use of the what little space it has.That said, if you are staying near any of the major stations or the connections with the BTS stations, and are on your own with minimal baggage, it's a decent option and substantially cheaper than getting a taxi.

We arrived on the late evening on 29th April and by the time we exit immigration and gotten our luggage, it was almost 9pm on a Friday evening in Bangkok. All the taxi, AOT (airport taxi) were sold out. In the end we have to walk about 150m to the Airport Railink within the airport to take the train to Paya Thai Station in the city. There were suppose to have an express train but it was unavailable. In the end we took the normal train for 45 baths and it took us about 45 min to reach Paya Thai Station. Overalls it still beats taking taxi which will cost about 500 baths and there were a big jam in Bangkok that can easily take more than an hour compare to when we travel via BTS. Overall BTS is a sure bet to travel between airport and city if you do not have huge luggages. If you do, look for elevator to move between floors. Be prepare to wait though as there are usually only one or two elevators available at the airport and at the station."

If you have only carry on I guess this is an option, although you still have to get to a link station either via the Sukhumvit BTS line or MRT to Makkasan or by a taxi. The price is right to as I believe 45 baht as of now for a single ticket. I have used it once from the airport so I am really not an expert, but have spoken to others that have. You can no longer check-in bags at Makkasan station (which was one of the main selling points) so you need to hump them from your hotel up and down stairs at the various stations. From the main tourist/business areas I still believe you will reach the airport more easily by taxi (using the meter) and in a better frame of mind and spend not much more for the total trip say 300 baht as opposed to perhaps 150 or more depending # of persons and with more strain muscles."

Unfortunately, the rail link uses a different ticketing system from the MRT (which is different again from the skytrain), but it's easy to buy a ticket from the ticket machines, with 20, 50 or 100 baht notes (the ticket is between 30 and 40 baht). You'll get a token to use at the barriers. The train's come regularly, and announcements are in English as well as Thai.

I did not have to stand once on the Airport Rail Link; did have to stand on the Sky Train portion. It is safe, fast and air conditioned. I believe it runs until midnight, but the sign at the Sky Train says it runs until 11 pm."

Suvarnabhumi Airport can be some distance from Bangkok so to beat the always unpredictable traffic, the airport rail is probably the best bet. It is affordable and easy and can be found at the basement of the airport. You will be in the city in under 1 hour and can either take a city at the terminal station or link up with the BTS service to get to the other locations in downtown Bangkok. Clean, affordable and hassle free in my opinion!"

The Airport Rail Link is the perfect transportation to and from Suvarnabumi International Airport the heart of Bangkok whether for short or long jumps. Gone are the hassles with taxi fraud, shuttle bus confusion, and the minions with signs looking for a name. The ARL cuts the 25 km ride into town down to a swift 15 minutes to my regular destination at Nasa Vegas and off to wherever I want to go in town. Within minutes of clearing Immigration I am checked in and ready for the exciting sights, sounds, and senses of Thailand's glitter town. The descent into the train station is quick. The space allowed for baggage on the train is ample. The cost to get into Bangkok is unbelievably cheap.What makes the ride even more enjoyable is the incredible 30 baht (less than 1$ USD) fare. Exiting at Ramkhamhang station I can use the overhead walkway directly to Nasa Vegas or any of the convenient stations where hotels abound. Rather than a harrowing or anxious 200-300 baht taxi ride (if I am lucky enough to get an honest taxi driver) I can sit back and enjoy the short ride while watching the serene tropical landscape quickly pass by. Even if there is a crowd and I don't have a seat (which has happened to me only once) the short ride after the flight is worth the benefits of taking ARL.My May trip is in two weeks and I am looking forward to, once again, enjoy the cost and convenience of moving quickly through the distance between the International Airport and the City of Bangkok."

Then if you want to go to Silom you have to change trains at Siam. The only problem with this system is if you have a lot of bags and you hit the BTS at peak times (mornings and afternoon rush hours M-F) then you won't get on the train and Siam itself is chaos...and if you do, you will block everyone from getting off. If you have a lot of bags, take a taxi but if you are travelling light...this is the best and cheapest way to go and you should be riding the rails every time."

Through the language barrier I'm not sure of this was temporary or permanent. Don't worry though! If you're trying to get into the heart of Bangkok, take the city line from the airport all the way to its final stop. From there you can join the Sukhumvit line. To get to the interchange station (Siam Station) where the Sukhumvit and Solim BTS (Sky Train) lines meet, buy your ticket and proceed to the Bearing track. Siam will be the second stop. From there you can get on the Silom line if you need."

This station has escalators and elevators to lower levels for local taxi service in air conditioned environment without having to hike over to the Petchaburi MRT station to make a connection. Returning this way is a bit of a problem because either the taxi is trying for a fare to the airport or because they don't know/believe about the access method. Pretty good chance to get a seat from the airport; but, a toss-up about getting a seat to the airport.

You have two options of connecting to the BTS sky train from the ARL. You can take it all the way down to Phaya Thai then walk about 5 mins up to the BTS Skytrain station, or you can get off the ARL at Makassan station, walk a few minutes to the Petchaburi MRT station, and from there go to the Sukumvit Station by MRT. Once you get off at Sukumvit station, you can walk up to the BTS skytrain station. Keep in mind you will have to walk up some short flights of stairs, so if you have a lot of luggage, or kids, you might want to just get a taxi from the airport for about 350-400 baht to the city center. Using the ARL, MRT, and BTS will cost around 60-80 baht to and from the airport depending on where you are headed in the city.

From there, three stops on the BTS gets you to Siam and six stops to Asok, where you can connect with the MRT. You can pay a little less and get off two stations earlier to connect with the MRT, but it's a less convenient connection.I'd recommend it only with carry-on luggage, as you have to walk down a long stairway at each BTS station and heavy luggage is a pain. But, of course, once you're in BKK, you can get that pain massaged away!Good alternative to the taxi mafia if you use it right."

Most hotels are around Sukhumvit and Silom, Backpackers still like the KhaoSan Area.....i never understood this :D :Take the train to PHAYA THAI Station and change there into BTS Sukhumvit line to BEARING, there is another option too but then you have to change trains twice and i am lazy, time is about the same, check attached mapIf your destination (Hotel) is at Silom Road, Take the Train from Airport also to PHAYA THAI Station, change to BTS to BEARING to but check out again after 2station at SIAM Interchange and take the BTS train to WONGWIAN YAI and check out after another two stations at SILOMYou can also check out at PHETCHABURI Station and use the blue MRT line but like i wrote, its the same time...

If your hotel is not next to ART/MRT/BTS I can not recommend using the ARL at all. You would need to hit the road - in best sense of the word -, call a taxi and get to your final destination.

It was hard to shuffle through to get off of Makkasan, It is not elderly or handicap friendly, and can be tiresome with flights of stairs at the end of stations. Again, good to have change!!

The names may be confusing, but Skytrain (BTS) and the Airport Rail Link (ARL) are two separate systems (though they have adjacent stations at Phaya Thai). The ARL also connects (with some walking) to the underground Metro (MRT) line from ARL's Makkasan station. Stations have ticket machines, all accepting coins and some accepting notes. These issue a plastic token, which must be touched on a card reader at entry gates, and fed into a slot for collection at exit gates. In practice the system is easy to follow, with English signage and announcements as well as Thai. Fares are low (less than 50 baht end to end in Feb 2016) and the line is a quick and easy way to the city centre or via connections on other lines. It can get busy with non-airport travellers, particularly at peak times."

A ride from the airport to the center of town was ~60 baht but seating is very limited so be prepared to stand...and it gets full fast so there is no such thing as personal space, if you need that you'll need a cab. They have an easy system of scanning your token to go through the turnstile to enter and dropping your token into the slot when leaving through the turnstile."

The Airport Railway Link is a quick, air-conditioned, comfortable and regular service from Suwarnabhumi Airport with connections to the BTS (Bangkok Transport System) and MRT (Metropolitan Rapid Transport) network of inter-city stations.The Link originates from Suwarnabhumi Airport, running at regular intervals, and connects to the MRT line at Makasan Station by way of a short walk to Petchaburi Station. The MRT extends to Hualongpong Station where you disembark and walk to Yarrowat Road in 10 minutes and enjoy the sights, sounds and flavours of Bangkok's Chinatown. The MRT (only) also offers a discount for seniors (anyone over 60, including foreigners). Just ask for the 'senior' fare. Can't be bad!Alternatively, disembark at Sukhumvit Station and take a very short walk to adjacent Asoke Station on the BTS Line. Asoke will pitch you into the heart of Sukhumvit Road with its extensive range of restaurants, bars, hotels and night entertainment. Keep on the BTS line for shopping (Chidlom and Siam Stations) of for the river Chaopraya (Saphan Taksin) and cheap river taxis - a great and cool way to see the city. Or, keep on the Airport Link and connect to the BTS at Piyathai Sation which will take you to Mo Chit and the famous weekend market.It's a great way to connect to many interesting and entertaining sights of Bangkok without the chore of driving and the hassle and expense of taxis.The only drawback are the crowded stations at rush hour times - times to be avoided - as its difficult to get on a train due to the volume of human traffic and limited number of carriages.You may be surprised just how good it is! Enjoy."

If you have a heavy luggage and is not using a trolley, this mode of transportation from the airport to your hotel might not be suitable for you. Also, we rode the train at around 10am which is not rush hour in Bangkok. The train gets packed during rush hours. Some of the taxis in the airport will charge you 300-500 baht from airport to Sukhumvit area. Overall, this is the most convenient way to and from the airport since traffic in Bangkok is horrible esp during rush hour."

Also if you're travelling late at night or very early in the morning, the roads will be ok.

The train platform rises several stories above ground level and escalators rise to the top level without problem, though handling more than one piece of luggage plus having small children in tow, could be a problem. There is a very small elevator, but it was \"locked out\" for some reason, and token purchase (THB40) must be made on a middle level, with the escalators needed for access to the train level.

The service starts at 6 am till 12 pm and it leaves every 5 minutes (on time) from the station. It took me about 30 min from Phayathai to Survarnabhumi. The price is cheap (45 thb) compared to the taxi and also considering the distance. Also, there is some space for luggage inside the train. Bottom line: Consider it when you don't have many luggage for faster and cheaper ride to the airport enjoying magnificently beautiful view of Bangkok."

There are 5 stops between Makassan and the airport, with a journey time of around 35-40 minutes.The cost is very low, only 35 THB one way so much cheaper than a taxi.The bad news is that hundreds of cummuters use the same train, so if you are traveling with suitcases, allow a LOT more time, especially if you plan to take the journey at peak times. Chances are that you will NOT get on the first train you are waiting for. The train does stop inside the airport, so not too much more traveling - apart from getting from B1 level to Level 4."

There is no way to get your suitcase from the street or bts level to the train and vice versa.... The Airport link has a lot to learn from Hong Kong in terms of accessibility...Furthermore the getting a taxi from the end station (Phaya Thai) is not so easy. The taxis waiting at the taxi stand and Airport link lady which assigns you a taxi are corrupt and refuse to use the meter. Its not a 1 time case because it has happened to me 3 times already. Its best to drag your suitcase to the street and hail a passing taxi.Hopefully Bangkok will improve all the trains BTS, MRT, and airport link to be more airport passenger friendly."

If you're looking for a inexpensive and quick way to get to and from the airport AND do not have a lot of luggage, definitely give this a try. The airport station is located at the lower level of the international terminal. Although there was/is an express train it is not always running and quite a bit more expensive. Take the City Train and get off at Makasan Station or continue on to . It's about a 15 minute to 20 minute ride with all stops. From Makasan Station, follow signs to the covered walkway leading to the MRT (subway Petchaburi Station). It's a bit of a walk but easy and safe. The MRT connects to the Skytrain (BTS) one stop away at Sukhumvit Station. Please note you will need to buy a new fare when transfering from the Airport Link to either the BTS or MRT but fares are very reasonable."

On our second arrival at the airport (this time after our beach destination) we decided to try the Airport Rail Link into the city. We only had one bag between the two of us, so taking the rail link was easy to maneuver. Tickets can be purchased from vending machines before entering the station and the language can be switched to English. Our trip into the city cost only 35THB/person (Makkasan). The end of the line to Phyathia cost 45THB. Since we boarded at the airport there was no problem getting a seat. One item of note: after the arriving train empties, you will likely hear the security staff blowing their whistles advising people not to board as a security/trash sweep is made of the train before anyone is allowed to board, then the \u2018all clear\u2019 is given to board. It\u2019s a hassle-free transport into the city. Also take into consideration if you need to transfer to BTS/MRT and/or where your hotel is located.{**Don\u2019t get ripped off\u2026\u2026If you are traveling with lots of luggage or have more than a few people in your party, then the taxi is likely your best option and if so demand a meter rate (as the dashboard meter is likely covered with a towel). This is what we experienced on our first trip from the airport as I tried to advise my friend of this scam, but he did not listen and this was the incident that transpired for us. The driver may give you a laminated card with price quotes and these are \u2018suggested\u2019 non-metered rates ( ie..450 charge+75 tolls+50 airport fee), but don\u2019t settle for this either. You have likely already loaded your luggage into the taxi, after waiting in the taxi line, and now proceeding on your way out of the airport. If the driver still states no meter, then simply mention anything about contacting the Airport taxi police and \u2018Walla\u2019 the meter shows up and he will ask you to pay the toll fees and the airport service fee which is correct. Our actual taxi fare to our hotel from the airport was 230+75+50THB. Yes, this may not seem like a big deal, but the savings basically paid for a one hour massage!}"

It has stops in several other stations before you get to there. Coming from the airport, it's not that crowded but once you get to the stops, the train gets fuller and fuller, and this wasn't even rush hour. If you have a lot of luggage, it will be a hassle. But it only cost 40 THB compared to 400 THB for a taxi, so you get what you pay for.Just follow the signs at the airport and it's a pretty long walk but you'll get to the station. There was an attendant helping the people navigate the payment system. Just a note on the stations in the city proper: just because it was easy for you to maneuver your luggage around at the airport station doesn't mean it would be easy doing so once you're in the city. Crowded, uneven pavement await."

The cost of the train was 40b which is really cheap.There's 8 stops on the train, the last one being the Airport. The platform for the train was totally full of people. For the first three stops, more people just kept getting on until we literally couldn't move anymore on the train because we were so packed in. But the last two stops before the airport seemed to be where everyone was getting off. The last segment of the train ride was totally empty.If you have a lot of suitcases and you're heading out during rush hour, you might be better off getting a cab or Uber. When the train gets crowded you have to hold onto all your luggage the whole time to make space for people. As for carrying a backpack, a lot of people put them on their fronts to make sure no one can steal stuff out of the back of it.The train advertises as taking 30 mins and it really does take that exact time! Its a pretty fast and cheap way to reach the airport if you don't mind being crushed between a bunch of sweaty strangers."

The logistics of changing from one system to the other is a lot of walking. You also have to pay again. Frankly, with luggage either have a taxi take you to/from the Airport Rail or skip it.

My family of four would often choose the Airport Rail Link instead of taxi.We usually put up around the Pratunam area, and metered taxi fares from the airport to that area cost about 350 Baht, all-in. The Airport Rail Link to Phaya Thai will take about 45 minutes, at half the price.The direct non-stop train is permanently down until further notice - we have not seen that train in years.The journey to Phaya Thai is often crowded with locals who commute using the Airport Rail Link, as such getting a seat with your luggage may be quite a challenge. The train frequencies are at 15-30 minute-intervals, so make sure you allocate plenty of time. Most stations are not properly linked - Phaya Thai is the one that's connected the best - to the Phaya Thai BTS. We took once to Hua Mak and realised we had to perform an illegal crossing on the railway tracks to get to the nearest bus stop.That said, we found the Airport Rail Link to be bearable if we were to travel from Phaya Thai to Survanabhumi. We secretly wished that there would be greater improvements such as better connectivity, and increased frequencies (now that tourist numbers into Bangkok are steadily rising), but for the time being...we will choose this mode of transportation over taxis."

Very clear signage along the way!Generally, passenger need to pay THB 120 for the highway toll fee plus THB 250-300 taxi meter fare from town to the Suvarnabhumi airport thus using the Airport Rail Link not just saved you extra THB but more importantly you can easily manage your Travelling time on your journey between the stations without any worry and anxiety of caught in the heavy traffic jam on the road!My strong recommendation to use the Bangkok Airport Rail Link for your travel between Suvarnabhumi Airport and town in Bangkok!Jason"

It's badly connected: It doesn't get you anywhere, drives sufficiently far away from major populated areas to be useless, requires you to drag your luggage far distances from other public transport - and from most places that you would stay you need to take a taxi anyway to even just get to the airport link. Maybe one day taxis get so expensive that the train is cheaper. Maybe one day they extend the line to where people actually live. Maybe one day they make proper interchange stations.

Inaugurated in August, 2010 the Express train is already out of operation due to poor maintenance and lack of spare parts. The Terminus is located at Makkasan and consists of a huge, cavernous, under-utilised building in the middle of a swamp with poor connections to anywhere and taxi drivers loath to service passengers there. Due to the lack of rolling stock it has been reduced to a commuter train for workers living in the east of the city and is usually packed stopping at six stations en route to the airport.If you feel you must use this mode of transport then buy a ticket at Suwanabumi Airport to Phaya Thai Station which is the end of the line, two stations beyond the Makkasan Terminus. At least here you can connect to the BTS Skytrain system but this is where your real problems begin. You have to cart your luggage down narrow staircases and then walk a fair distance to Phaya Thai BTS Station. From here you can get to several parts of the city but a long walk/taxi ride to your hotel is often necessary from the nearest BTS station.If you have luggage and are with one or two friends then spare yourselves the agony and share a taxi directly to your hotel. Using the express way will get you to Bangkok city center in half an hour and in comfort. It's worth the extra money. Consider the train only if travelling very light, are prepared for a great deal of inconvenience, and are in no hurry for that hot shower and meal!"

The downtown stations of the airport rail link are very inconvenient, not located near major hotel or business areas and worse of all, not user friendly at all for passengers with luggage.... Yes strange as it may seem, they seem to have forgotten that passengers travelling to and from the airport are quite likely to have luggage, even sometimes big luggage. Try to interchange between the airport link and the BTS and you will need a good deal of strong muscles on your arms to carry your luggage up and down endless stairs as there are no escalators or elevators. All this for a price that is not worth it. Take a taxi at the public taxi counters outside the arrival hall. Price is by meter (guaranteed) with an airport surcharge of THB 50 and the expressway toll to pay. In other words for 400 Baht all inclusive you can basically go to any hotel in town, in the comfort of your taxi, door to door, without having to carry anything and without sweat."

After hunting for it I found it in the basement of the airport. The link seems to run every 30 minutes, which is quite convenient. The fair of 45 Bhat is quite a bit lower then the $500 bhat the taxi's charge. There are ATM type ticket dispensers located outside the station and really friendly staff to show you how to use it. Be advised that the train is getting popular and anything more then 3 pcs of luggage per person would be a challenge to manage as it gets crowded fast. The train's final destination is Phaya Thai which connects to the BTS system. This station also has ticket booths for BTS passes. Be advised that although this train station has elevators to assist with the luggage the BTS system does not. As such the prudent thing to do from this station would be to get a taxi from here to your hotel. Naturally, not being the wisest, I went on the BTS system and navigated the seven flights of stairs downward with three pieces of luggage, something, after having done it, I really would not recommend. I also took the Link back to the Airport. As a side note I got the feeling that a lot of taxi drivers are quite disgruntled by this system as many would not take me to the Phaya Thai station from my hotel and were trying to convince me over and over to use them to go to the Airport. As the Link runs within certain hours, this option is the better of the two as you avoid all of the traffic, provided the flight schedule allows for it. By the way the train was quite empty at the Phaya Thai station, easily accommodating the luggage."

Sometimes I take the Airport Rail Link when my time allows, and I am not in a rush to check-in to the hotel in town. Ok, so first off, the Express train from airport to Makkasan station seems to have stopped operating for some time now. So, the City Line that stops at every stop is working. It seems to run about 15 mins apart, so expect an average of about 8 minutes (10 minutes from experience) by the time you reach the platform to board the train.Each station is roughly about 5-7 mins apart, and it can get crowded, so try to get a seat if you can, especially with luggage. Its not the most comfortable, if you compare with Singapore, Hong Kong or London, but it gets the job done and airconditioning is good. The average time from airport station to Makkasan is about 25-28 mins. Add about 7-8 mins for PhayaThai. Its not superfast, but during peak hours could be the best way to get from airport to the city hotels. The only issue is that the interconnecting BTS trains don't really have lifts inside the station, and sometimes the lifts in the Makkasan and PhayaThai stations are under servicing, so be careful lugging the heavy luggage down the stairs. You may fall if you are not careful down a long flight of steps."

Right now you have to get coins from station teller booth and then go to a machine to buy tickets. Hence, you have to line up twice; one to get your change and then buy ticket. Note that only station from Bangkok back to Airport. I think from airport, you can get ticket from the ticket booth"

I landed at BKK on October 5th and since it was a trip on a budget, I decided to take the ARL to get closer to the hotel before getting a taxi. It was a very nice experience. Follow the signs from arrivals to the ARL. I had looked at a Youtube video to see how to pay and it was as easy as it looked on the video and you are off. Looking around for our first look at Bangkok and before we knew it we were there. Then we exit go down the stairs, there was a taxi counter and off to the hotel. All the estimates I got for the taxi from the airport to hotel were in the 400-500 baht range, But with the train and taxi, it cost about 225 baht for 2 people total. Since this was a budget trip, it was a great start. Plus it is clean, not too crowded (around 10 am) and rapid. A very nice experience from start to finish."

The ticket and information agents and even the security people were very helpful in guiding me to the proper platforms & stations needed and ticket purchases.

Is only and $35-45bth. Is the cheapest that I have ever paid for a train service to the city in any country that I have been before.One can connect to the MRT ( Dark Blue Line ) at Makkasan to many places such as Patpong at Sala Daeng Station , Huai Khwang station where the famous Sooboom Seafood are and the night market and further north you can find Chatuchak weekend market. You can also connect at Phaya Thai to light green line and explore the shopping belt along Sukhumvit such as MBK near Siam and Siam Paragon , Central World etc.Most important taking the Airport Rail line, you are sure of the time reaching town center. Traffic in Bangkok can be really terrible I was once caught up with traffic Jam for more than two hours from Airport to Town. That two hours could have gone to a good foot massage and shopping or some cold beer somewhere. Trust me traffic are really bad in Bangkok , always take the subway.Best of luck travelers"

Airport Rail Link (06:00-midnight) that connects downtown Bangkok with Suvarnabhumi International Airport is a smart alternative to the airport\u2019s express buses or taxis. it is better because you safe time and avoid traffic jam and money . howere it is not work 24 Hrs.The Airport Rail Link connects you to the MRT underground at Makkasan City Interchange Station (MRT Petchaburi Station) and the BTS Skytrain at Phayathai Station. Please note, the baggage check-in at Makkasan Station is no longer available. From Bangkok International Airport (Suvarnabhumi), the entrance to the Airport Rail Link service is on the First Floor.The ticket is 45 Baht.it is bad idea if you have heavy luggage."

What I usually do, take the train to Phaya Thai (last station) and change to the BTS to reach Siam station or Chit Lom station.

Not only is it the cheapest way to connect with the various sights in the city, it is also hassle free, safer, and cheaper. I practically did not have to 'ask' anybody out along the entire way as I traveled here. The metro map is well updated, and the information is laid down for an easy to understand language for the travelers. Buy a metro card and you can hop in and out into any part of the city at your own pace. Try also to use it to interconnect within the transportation systems such as the waterways and buses. In one simple word, I can say, it is your perfect 'MONEYSAVER'."

However, my personal experience is that the Express Link is often out of service which forces one to rely on the City Link. The City Link stops at a couple of stations, where locals get on and off. During peak hours, the train carriage is so full of people that I found it difficult to get my luggage on/off the train. At Makkasan station, one has to walk 100-200m to reach the subway system (MRT), which involves stairs, some escalators and security checks. If one has to change to the BTS skytrain system at BTS Asoke, more stairs and escalators will be involved. In my opinion, if you can afford it, go with a taxi. It will be around 400 baht (less than AUD20) to get from the airport to the city centre. It's not much considering all the hassles you will avoid (carrying heavy luggage in hot weather, buying tickets, security checkpoints, following maps, stairs, cramped train carriages, etc.)."

The rail link connects Savanaphumi Airport (BKK), the main international airport for Bangkok, with the sky train public transport service at Phayathai station and the MRT subway system at the MRT Petchaburi station (a short walk from the Makkasan stop on the air rail link). Note that the 'express' train system has been suspended partly because there were too few passengers willing to pay the premium price (the majority of travelers on the line are workers at the airport or locals using the line for transport between stations) and partly because of problems with rolling stock. The fare from the airport to the BTS is 45 Baht (about $1.25 these days) and takes 20-30 minutes. The major disadvantage is to transfer from the air link to the BTS requires going down a long set of stairs and with bags that is a problem. Going up from the BTS is on an escalator so that is not so bad though having more than carryon bags still is a hassle. It is not crowded and usually a seat is available plus there is space for bags on the train. A good choice for getting into the city if you are not laden with luggage."

Less often than BTS or MRT but it does go further so it makes sense. From airport exit there are clear signs - you just go to lowest ground level and find machine to put your coins in - hitting the button to where you are going. It will tell you how much it costs and give you a little bingo chip thing that you use to get past the security marker. Simple!"

To my surprise, it is really great - its only 45 Baht to Phaya Thai Station, and from there, you can hook up to the BTS system. The journey is a mere 30 mins with 8 stations inbetween. You can at least budget your time on ARL whereas on Taxi's, you know about the famous traffic jams in Bangkok..... If you're travelling solo, take the ARL, but if you travel with 2 or more, the taxi might be your choice. Also depends on where you stay. If your hotel is near a BTS station, then ARL plus BTS would be a great option. Another downside is that you might have to lug your luggage around a bit whereas on a taxi, it really is point to point."

There is quite a bit of walking to get to the rail express from arrivals and the walk from Makkasan to the MRT is a bit of jaunt but not too bad overall.

It is clean, quiet, fast, easy to use (machines and instructions have English translations), and cheap. It is much faster than a cab and WAY WAY WAY cheaper. Definitely the way to go. And no sitting in traffic!!"

Sadly, poor management and decisions surrounding its operations hamper its success.Currently, there are no express trains between the airport and Phya Thai station, the connecting station to the Sky Train. All express trains run only to Makkasan, which is right in the middle of traffic central for Bangkok, and which has much less passenger traffic than Phya Thai. Additionally, links to the Sky Train and the Underground are a VERY long walk from Makkasan station. Very poor planning.Furthermore, trains run only between 6am and midnight. Many international flights arrive between 11pm and 1am and depart before 7am, leaving arriving passengers arriving late or departing early with no alternative except to deal with taxis in Bangkok. This is yet another example of poor planning.Express train service has been curtailed as the train operator has no budget to purchase spare parts for upkeep or maintenance of trains, meaning that carriages designated for express service are being pushed into service as local trains as there are local trains out of service due to lack of spare parts. Still more poor planning.This is an excellent service and one which offers great potential. Sadly, poor management is causing passengers to seek other alternatives."

Total 600 TBH.The next day, we took a cab to the same address from the city not far from the Phaya Thai station, and our Taxi fee was only 170 TBH! Now we know why the lady guard is there, not to protect the passengers, but to make sure only her circle of taxi drivers with 'magic meters' that run at 3x the speed of normal taximeters, and unscrupolous drivers get to catch clueless tourists like us.Beware of Taxis, beware of Tok Toks. But no alternative!"

From Asoke to the airport including the change of lines took me 35 minutes. I only had one bag with me making things a lot easier but I did see some people with more luggage although I would imagine that might make the trip less apealing. It also costs a fraction of what a taxi would charge ,I paid a total of 50 baht."

Is easy to use and convenient as there are stations that are connected to BTS (Phaya Thai) or MrT (Phetchaburi).

There is a line at the token (train ticket) machines where (sometimes?) a train police man helps you get your token.

The airport link station is located at the basement of the airport . There are signs to direct U.S. and it is easy to locate . I just need to buy the ticket in the form of a token on the spot and then board the train . There is signs to show us how to buy the ticket . There is a staff manning the counter , so I was able to make any queries with her. The train comes frequently . The trains are always full , and it shows that many people take the airport link . Unlike the aircon in the regular BTS where air con is cold and very confortable, the airport link is not cold enough . It is very economical especially you travel alone or with another person . I usually bring only a cabin bag to Bangkok , so the airport link suits me very well. If you are in a group of 4 and with big luggage, it may be better to share a taxi . In my opinion , the airport link is one of the better airport transfer I have taken ."

The customer officer are well familiar to handle all kinds of queries.. One should reserve some additional energy to get in and out of trains depending on where your hotel is located and at what time your flight arrives.

For travel between the two airports it is about the same travel times by taxi or by train/bus/taxi.

Be forewarned: it is a long walk. There is no moving walkway, and there should be one. But that aside, there is one other major negative about the Airport Link. When it opened, there were two trains: one that stopped at every station, and one that went direct, non-stop, to the airport. The non-stop train has been cancelled. So you will now stop at every intervening station.When you get on the train, look at the seats. If they are hard plastic benches, you are in the wrong car. Look at the other cars. In the cars designed for luggage, you will find surprisingly comfortable chairs. That is where you want to ride. If you have minimal luggage, I cannot see why anyone would bother waiting in the queue for a taxi at the airport. If you are going to Bangkok, just go to the lower levels and follow the signs for the Airport Link. You can get a Subway sandwich down there. Enjoy."

Once on we took the BTS to Phaya Thaya where we transfered to the Airport Rail Link. There is an express line which does not stop and arrives about 15 minutes faster than the other option which stops like 3-4 times. The cost differential was minimal so we took the express. The nicest thing is you end up at the airport and avoid all the traffice and congestion which is Bangkok is pretty much all the time. Best way to get to the airport!"

So instead of the usual car ride I took the train. Its very easy, lots of English signs directing you to the train, easy to but the ticket and no chance of getting the wrong train ( well almost no chance) even after 14 hours of flying.The train is comfy, air conditioned, there were lots of seats and I had my bag at my feet. I got off at Phayathai station with no trouble and went to buy a ticket on the BTS skytrain. A bity tired at this point I bought a ticket, followed the crowd and went to get on the train that looked suspiciously like the the train to the airport. I quickly jumped off and went back down to the exit, explained the error and got a refund with direction to go down another level and get the BTS line. Went to Siam, caught connecting to National; and a quick walk to the hotel.On a GOOD day at the right time it would be about the same time to taxi in to my hotel. At busy times I think the trains would be quicker and 90 BHT Vs 500( incl highway toll road charges) So the trains are great for singles or couples but with a tired family I would use taxi or town car depending on the amount of luggage and kids."

When we were doing our research on Bangkok we came across the ARL and after reading enough about it we decided that we can definitely use the ARL as opposed to the taxi service.Yes it is way cheaper than booking a private taxi and that really works especially if you are traveling on a budget. It also gave us a first hand experience of Bangkok, it's infrastructure, systems and people on day one itself.We traveled between the Suvarnabhumi Airport and Makkasan. If you know where you want to get off then all you need to do is check the maps which are marked very clearly and in detail.There is no confusion when getting the tokens from the self service machine or looking for which platform you need to be at to board the train in your direction. Everything is well laid out.Getting on and off the train is also very convenient as people are more relaxed and follow a proper queue system. Most of the passengers were busy with their own thing, conversations, cell phones, etc. It is a great way to look at the city from above and the sights are very attractive. I particularly found this entire stretch (sorry do not know the name) that had beautiful homes with red roofs and interspersed with trees. Just made me want to get off and stay there. So, if you can then definitely do this train journey standing and not sitting.The announcements are clear and so there is no chance that you will miss your station. People were polite and didn't really catch anybody staring.If you have too much luggage or too many children (who are already getting tired and cranky) then maybe you can skip this and do it another time.The coaches were very clean and well maintained.

I always stay on Sukhumvit so I just changed to the MRT and got off at Sukhumvit station then walked the short distance to soy 15. If you are new to Bangkok I suggest checking a map for the station closest your hotel then catching a taxi (they rarely use the advertised meters so negotiate a price first). Walking long distances with luggage in the Bangkok heat is best left to young backpackers!I'm not sure, but this new link may have made taxi fares more competitive! I always get a taxi back to the airport, because I'm loaded down with purchases. I have paid up to 700BHT in the past, but this time it was only 500BHT and I felt I could have bartered lower!Getting around Bangkok is now better than ever before thanks to this link.

Airport link train is the best way to commute Between Bangkok City Centre and Bangkok International Airport (Suvarnabhumi Airport), if you want to avoid traffic and tout taxi drivers. The Airport link train station is conveniently located at the level B2 of the arrival hall of Bangkok International Airport. Airport link train runs from 6AM to midnight. Using this train you can come to Phaya Thai Station (in 25 minutes) and then can transfer to any Sky train (within the Phaya Thai Station) to go to the city centre (I mean Chong Nonsi or Bangkok Station) in 15 to 25 minutes. Airport link trains and Sky Trains are modern, safe, clean and spacious to carry luggage. Airport to Phaya Thai Station costs only 42 THB. Phaya Thai to Chong Nonsi Station costs 31 THB. Tickets are sold in vending machines in every station. On the vending machine, ticket price for each destination station is clearly specified. Customer service booths in every station help to convert cash to coin."

It connects with the sky-train (stations adjoin) at Phya Thai, so without much for baggage someone could transfer, in theory, but really it makes the most sense if headed to near one of the stations.

Located in the basement floor of Bangkok Airport, and for the equivalent of a couple dollars in cost, this is an easy way to get into the main Sukumvit Area and gain connections with both the Metro and the BTS Skytrain, especially during daytime hours when traffic is unbelievably snarled in the streets. In fact, during the day, I have walked from the Rail Link to Sukumvit with my suitcase in 20 minutes and that was far less than the traffic which was stopped beside me as I walked by!!It is best to go online and download and print out a copy of the rail links with the other rail systems for a good overview and guidance, but then it's pretty simple!I believe it runs from 0600 to midnight only so plan accordingly!The approximate length of trip from one end to the other is 35 minutes."

From Makkasan there is connectivity via BTS to Sukhumvit and other parts of the city but we took a taxi and it was just 50 Baht to Hilton Sukhumvit.

It can be a real hassle getting from BKK airport into the city by taxi, that is until you make your way down to the basement and take a 40 minute air-conditioned ride into the heart of Bangkok. Its comfortable & the last stop at Phya Thia you will find within a short walking distance many good motel to stay at as well as the BTS train systems that will take you even further. Siam is the centre if the shopping district."

Not one taxi would take me to Rachaprasong, where my hotel locates, because it was too near and traffic jam was bad in the area. I dragged my luggage all the way to the hotel. Another time, I got on the express link and got off at the Phayathai station, where I transferred to the Sky Train and got off at the Rajathevi station (1 station from Phayathai Station). This station has an access to the Asia Hotel. I believe it is safer and cheaper than getting in a taxi. Yes, rush hour is a challenge, especially when luggage is involved."

This is not really an attraction as such, as essentially it's a public transportation system, but maybe a decent ride 'out of town', if looking to fill an hour or two, on a quiet day. Travel in Bangkok from Suvarnabhumi (BKK) airport on the City Line (or return) is fairly straightforward, but is not without its pitfalls for the unwary. The Train Station is located on the lower level of the main terminal building.Whilst inherently simple once familiar with it, I strongly suggest that people do some research online before taking it on. This link might be of help:http://www.transitbangkok.com/lines/Suvarnabhumi%20International%20Airport/Airport%20Link%20City%20Line There are ticket machines, plus manned ticket kiosks. I personally find that the ticket kiosk is often easier and quicker, as queues can build up whilst people come to grips with a new and unfamiliar ticket dispensing machine.A ticket comes in the form of a small coloured disk, that can be tapped onto the barrier mechanism to open the gate, and likewise deposited into a slot at the end of the journey again to open the gate to let you out. There are also wider manually operated gates with station staff to help those people with large suitcases etc. Please be sure to know which station you want to leave the train. There are 8 stations end to end, but if going into central Bangkok you will most likely want: 'Makkasan' if connecting onto the linked MRT(Subway)Station at 'Petchaburi' and the Subway network,OR quite likely going through to the final stop at 'Phaya Thai' if then connecting onto the BTS (Skytrain) network.Regretfully I've heard people asking the ticket clerks 'which stop is closest to ????? Hotel' and this is usually quite beyond the average language understanding, or similarly the hotel location expectation of knowledge of the rail clerks.I think its helpful to understand that the fully elevated line runs to the North of the main city area, rather than through the middle of the city. So know which station you want beforehand. If you are at all unsure, I would strongly suggest that you take a public taxi instead.The train journey takes 30 minutes end to end. The trains themselves are purpose designed for the job they do and each carriage has an empty if non-racked area for cases and luggage. The consensus is that you stay with you baggage, rather than walk away to find a seat elsewhere.At the airport end, there are elevators (lifts) and escalators, to assist in the easy movement of heavy baggage, but be warned, that at many other stations there are precious few elevators, with only stairways as an alternative, so consider how much baggage you have and how heavy it all is, before taking the City Line train option.My final thought is that many Thai people now also use this rail service for their daily commute into the city, so early morning and early evening trains, can be very busy indeed. Please note too, that the consumption of foods and drinks are not allowed whilst travelling on the trains.Similarly, it is considered good manners to allow people off the trains first, through the centre of the doors and then enter the trains via either side of the doors, and not 'jump the queue' by walking through the centre area.NB: centre = center depending on country!! Quick, clean cost-effective and efficient, but please do consider the amount/weight of baggage that you have with you, before deciding to buy a ticket.Enjoy!"

From the MRT underneath the main Hua Lamphong train station, it's just seven stations to the Phetchaburi station, then walk about ten minutes to outside and along the overhead connecting ramp to the rail link station bound for the Suvarnabhumi Airport, then just take the City Line train to the airport which stops at like five stations along the way and takes about a half hour (there's supposedly an Express Line too which goes straight to the Airport without stopping at any station along the way but which costs more and will make a difference of only about 15 minutes compared to the regular City Line). So, it cost me a total of only about 60 or 70 baht (about 30 baht for the MRT from Hua Lamphong to Phetchaburi, then another 30 or 35 baht from the link station right beside Phetchaburi to the Airport with the rail link,) compared to hundreds of bhat that would have cost me if I had instead gone by cab or tuk-tuk! The time it takes will also be just about an hour from the time you get on the MRT at Hua Lamphong (about 15 minutes to Phetchaburi, then about 10 minutes to get to the rail link platform and buy a ticket, then about a half hour to the Airport itself).But, keep in mind that this airport rail link is only for the Suvarnabhumi Airport to the east of Bangkok, and NOT for the Don Mueang Airport in the north, to which the best way will be to take the train from the main Hua Lamphong station for about 45 minutes to an hour for just about 15 or 20 baht."

It is real easy to find.The entrance of the train station in the airport is very wide and look up for the signs. You can\u2019t miss it.You will need to purchase a ticket. At the time of my arrival in BKK, the Express Line is not operational and only the City Line is running. I heard that they have some spare parts issue on the Express Line.The fare to Makassan is THB35. Just queue up at the vending machine so remember to have some Thai Baht with you by then.There is also a staff that will help some \u201clost sheep\u201d to navigate the vending machine.You will get a yellow token to use to enter the station.The ARL is actually quite heavily utilised. It is good that the government is willing to build this rail line to ease the public transport congestion in the airport.The ride is smooth and I think I only took 20mins to reach Makassan station.Once you reach Makassan station, many passengers will walk to Petchaburi MRT station. When the ARL is just built, passengers will need to drag their luggage across the road to reach the MRT station.With the linkway bridge built, this got a little easier and safer.I then took the MRT to Asok station and walk to my hotel in Sukhumvit Soi 9.ARL will be good if your hotel is near to MRT/BTS station, you do not have many luggage and you have 3 person or more.A taxi ride from the airport to BKK central usually cost about THB400 or less and it is a door to door service but you will need to walk with your luggage using the ARL."

This was our first time traveling to Bangkok and as we went to Phuket, we ended up with four trips to and from the airport. In a taxi this can take anywhere from an hour to two hours, sat in traffic, hot, sweaty and considerably less well off when you arrive due to the base rate of this journey being 500 bht. When returning we used the Airport rail link and would always use this in future. It's so easy, you can get to it from all over the city, and it's only one line so no confusion. Plus at 45 bht, it was cheaper AND we got there in less time. Plus it's air conditioned and there is plenty of room for bags. Would highly recommend. Just ensure you find out what station is nearest to your hotel the first time you arrive."

It doesn't need much done with the scheduling. It doesn't need better uniforms or better trained staff. It needs a smoother passage from Customs to the station at the airport end, and could do with better promotion on aircraft, in Immigration and through Customs.. It would be best if one prepaid card, even if it was an ARL card, could get one from one's home station to the airport, without having to cue up for a ticket every time. Most important if all it needs a culture change - pride amongst the staff that, for many, they are Thailand's first ambassadors to tourists and the first to welcome home weary travelers - with a smile!Electronic boards at strategic points at the key connecting stations, and at the airport, showing the next departure times (in real time) would be helpful to all.I love the service - it could just be so, so much better."

For the station, Some stations easy to access such like Phayathai ( linked with Phayathai BTS ) or Ratchaparop( located on Main road ) Some station located in deep long street some station have to go from the main roade around 1 KM,. and the road so dark and Under develope . Event the station in the city Makkasan station , i really dont understand that located far from main road around 500 meter also dark and nothing there. actaully the land all the station belong to State of railway also. we still cannot fine the reason also. It seem all design for all system it is not user, User dont have any chance to put idea what we want , it is the mass transportation , it would bring us for the convenience.

Once aboard however the Airport Express would whisk you comfortably to the airport in 15 minutes flat - nonstop. I said \"would\" because the Express has been cancelled (forever it seems). Now one must jostle with commuters on the slower City Line. At 30 minutes, the time is ok but the journey is not. Ascending the train at Phaya Thai (the terminus) is almost dangerous as the narrow platform becomes extremely crowded as the minutes tick by until the next train arrives. With no safety barrier between you and the tracks, and poorly designed, the passengers coming from the airport (or any other stop along the way) alight onto the same platform (e.g. exit the same door you will enter) causing an even greater jam of people and then all head to the same escalator or stairs. I now avoid the train altogether and once again take meter taxis to the airport. Safer and much more comfortable - and quite cheap average 300 baht all up."

The last time I stayed in Bangkok and left the Suvarnabhumi Airport, my friend wanted to try alternative travel to the taxi, which is always a rip off with most drivers charging Baht 370 or more to get into Bangkok. So we tried the Airport Rail Link. The station is on the lower floor to the arrivals floor. There are plenty of signs to guide you. If you ask one of the spruikers however, they will convince you to use a limousine, 'very cheap now, just for you today only'. Don't fall for this one as it doesn't really turn out cheap at all with all the add on's. But, once, do it just for fun, no matter the cost. Anyway, back to the train. Finally found the station without too much trouble, ticket machines and station underground, with the cost of the tickets not expensive at all to travel to Bangkok. The trains run very regularly, about a 15 minute wait between each. Going on board with suitcases, you have to struggle with other travellers also coming on board with their luggage and traverse all those obstacles lying on the floor before you find your corner. Usually you have to stand, which I did not this occasion all the way into Bangkok. The train was fast, clean and well air conditioned. The trouble was knowing where to go when you arrived in Bangkok, which being the first time my friend and I had no idea. We got off at a station which sounded familiar but was still some kilometres from our hotel. I wanted to find the station which had the cross over to the Skytrain, but couldn't find it. Ended up getting a taxi from the station to the hotel. Lugging suitcases along stairs and escalators wasn't my idea of fun. Next time will get the taxi from the airport and pay the extra Baht cost for the comfort of not having to lug around luggage across town. But for the cost conscious the train is a good alternative. You may have better luck finding the station where you switch stations to the Skytrain than I did."

The commute will always take approx 30 min or so from Phaya Thai station. I've had some horrendous experiences in the past with taxi cab drivers and I try to avoid them at all cost. There is simply never any drama associated with taking the Airport Link to and from the airport and I love that. I just wish the Airport Link was available for travel 24/7 vs. 6am to 12am. Also, the Airport Link can be very crowded sometimes but I can usually find a seat so it's still a comfortable experience.

Head down to the basement, pop some coins into the machine, and get your ticket to the city center and lose the headaches (at least for a little bit). Since the train does get used by normal commuters, as well, it will tend to get more and more crowded as you approach the last stop, but I had no problems getting off and changing to the BTS even though I was wheeling a couple of unwieldy bags.45 baht, no haggling, no having taxi drivers stop by a suit store so they can get 5 liters of free gas, etc..

But what can be a huge headache is the peak hour traffic. It can be really nasty. Distance till Siam Discovery can take upto two hours. So the best way to beat it is by taking the Airport rail link.For the off peak hours, I would still suggest that you take the taxi. It is personal, and will not have the crowds of the Rail.So, if you are getting late or don't want to be stuck in the peak hour traffic, take this mode of commute."

Its very easy and the quickest way without any hustle and bustle. After clearing immigration, claiming the luggage & customs just follow the exit sign and then you would see Airport Link Rail sign it will direct you to the basement where the ticket counters are. There are 2 services Express Line & City Lines. Express line would cost you around 150 baht and drop you at Makkasan station in just 15 minutes while the City Line would cost you just 45 baht and drops you at Phaya Thai station in 30 minutes.From Phaya Thai (BTS station) you could continue your journey to the nearest BTS station to your hotel. But since I always prefer to stay around Khaosan road, I would get off at Phaya Thai Station and from there, I would take a taxi which cost around 80 baht to Rambuttari road. The same way you can take the Airport link to get to airport, Its very easy and convenient way to reach to airport which being stuck in the traffic jam which is a common sight in Bangkok."

We didn't have luggage with us and thought to ourselves that the ride would be complicated with luggage, but there were many riding with luggage. Along the route are metro stations that link to the BTS stations giving you lots if options are getting around Bangkok.

There were 3 of us and a taxi would have cost approx. 600 Baht. My kids who are used to taking the Sky train at home (Vancouver) were eager to try the sky train so off we went, One thing you must do if carrying suitcases is to look for the escalators taking you up to the station from the street or down to the street. There is usually only one set of each while there may be two or more stairs. From Nana station, it was a short ride to the juncture point to transfer to the Airport Rail line. Buying tickets for the Sky train is very easy. Get a map from your hotel and find out where you are getting on and what station you need to get off to get the attraction or point you are going. At the station, the yellow dot tells you where you are. Look for the dot where you want to get off and that corresponds to a number. Go to the ticket machine - you need coins so if you don't have any, you have to line up at the coin change booth to get some. Back to the ticket dispensing machine. Look for the point where you get off and it has a number. Push that number on the machine and the same number is how much you have to pay to get there. Put coins in and watch the printout tell you how much more you have to put in. Get the ticket and go to the wicket. Put the ticket in, take it with you as you need it to get out. At the exit wicket, put it into the machine and if you have paid the correct amount, the gate will open and the ticket will stay in the machine. At the juncture to the airport rail system, you need to exit and buy another ticket. For us, the total cost for 3 was approx. 45 baht each from the juncture and 31 from Nana station to the juncture (Phaya Thai). Total cost - 226 Baht. If you have suitcases, I suggest you get on at either the first or last train since they tend to be less crowded. It's very quick, especially the Airport Rail Line. If you are aways from the closest station, you can always take a tuk tuk to the station. Its a great way to see the city on the way out since you are elevated and you can avoid being stuck in traffic in the city."

The positives - its 45 Baht for the stopping train which takes 30 minutes to reach the end of the line, trains every 15 minutes. There are 2 connections points with Bangkok Metro/Skylink system, at Makkasan station a connection to the MRT underground and at the end of the line a connection to the Green BTS line at Phaya Thai station.

Trains can get pretty busy during peak periods, not just at airport but builds up with commuters from surburban stations as they get on heading for the city centre and also in terms of the Bangkok BTS/MTR you probably want to avoid trying to be on these say at rush hour peaks say 0730-0930 and 1600-1800 unless travelling North out of Bangkok centre on these lines.If you've got a lot of luggage then the train might not be a good idea as you've got to get your luggage on [ no dedicated storage facility on board ] and then off and to a taxi rank at your stop. Probably OK for backpackers and those with a wheeled case but if have 2 suitcases I'd re-consider using it. Don't forget to consider buying your Rabbit rover card card for BTS if its worthwhile for you at the BTS station. Check whether you'll use the MTR system enough to justify their travel card as a lot of MTR doesn't go near tourist area's. ( NB if travelling on MTR and paying cash you get a round token to use for gates its a bit fiddly so don't lose it / plus big queues build up at the cash machines for the tokens and thus 2 good reasosn for getting an MTR travel card ! ]Alternative to the rail are the airport taxi's which should always be on the meter and at the end a 50 baht surcharge is added [ not shown on meter ] plus the driver may ask for the toll money at toll gates en route which could be as much as 75 baht depending on routes taken. On edrawback of a lot of the taxis is that they have limited boot space - often they open it and what with the spare tyre, oil cans and other kit they can squeeze in 1 large suitcase.If you have a bit of luggage it might be worthwhile indicating you'd prefer one of the larger taxi's which have better boot space but also more seat room to store items in side the car.Another alternative is the AOT [Airports] Limo service - not cheap but very comfy and stylish & for those on an expense budget [ or one that gets past the boss! ]So to sum up - I'd use Airport rail if have say 1 suitcase and a backpack to/from airportIf visitng airport to meet someone or check on flights/buy ticketsPreferably outside rush hoursBut I'd check how close my final destination would be to the stations on the airport link/BTS/MTR stationsOtherwise - use taxi'sIf have lots of luggageIf your destination is a fair distance from BTS/MTR downtownIts the rush hour - may as well relax in back of taxi than stuck on a train/BTS platformNB If Headign for Don Muang Airport from SuvarnabhumiCheck out the direction connection coach service between the 2 airports.If Heading to Don Muang Airport from townRail link is not that reliable - don't trust it if going for a flight.Best option is BTS / MTR to Mo Chit / Chatuchak ParkTake taxi from main taxi rank there [ loads of taxi's ]About c 120-150 Baht to Airport depeneding on trafficThere is a bus from Mo Chit, I'm afraid I've only caught it coming from Don Muang but sometimes thats faster as airport taxi Q can be so longIf getting taxi from Don Muang sometimes easier to ask them to take you to Mo Chit BTS and then you continue on BTS...driver won't be unhappy as he gets back to Don Muang pretty quick for another fare - allow a bit more in this direction say 150-200 Baht because of traffic.I can't remember the bus fare but it's cheap maybe c30 BahtOther alterantive coming into Bangkok from Don Muang is the train - connected to airport by a walk way and basically all trains on the main line stop so plenty of choice & cheap far too - cheaper than the taxi. Takes you to Hua Lamphong main station which is on the MTR."

Forget taking a bus or a tax! The rail link loses one point for not running 24 hours.

You need to get yourself to BTS Phayathai, where you get the link for 45B. The link is separate from the BTS but in a connected area. We usually find accomodation near a BTS station so that it is handy for our departure. At the station you buy your token at a machine then proceed to the platform downstairs. You can take the fast train or the slightly slower one that stops at all the stations. There is not a big difference in time so just catch whichever one arrives first. The main link runs 2 minutes past the hour. At the airport you will arrive at the bottom floor so proceed to the fourth floor for departure check in. If you are arriving, go downstairs and find the CityLine. There will be signs. As in the reverse, the train will end at BTS Phayathai where you can then exit to taxi to your accomodation or stay upstairs and use the BTS. We find it is a very easy, efficient and cheap way to get to and from BKK."

Secondly a journey fro Swarnabhumi airport to say Ploenchit takes about 45 minutes not including the time to get from the station to your hotel. In off peak times i have done this from hotel to airport in 30 minutes- maximum even in peak times is 50-55 minutes, So in terms of saving time this is not such a great advantage. Lastly, of course you still need a taxi to get from the BTS station to your hotel so you need to add that to you costs (again I have done the airport journey for 280 bhath and adding all the costs here you will save about 150 bhath).Still convenient if you don have bags (or just small bags) and are travelling peak time)"

First you must schlep all the way down to the ground floor at the airport, walk over to the rail line, buy a ticket, and ride a crowded, narrow train. It rocks back and forth. Makes about 8 stops before reaching downtown Bangkok. Since Bangkok does not have an extensive mass transit system, locals use the rail link to get back and forth to work and school. There is no place to place your bags. Crowded, crowded, crowded. If you have anything bigger than a carry on and traveling with another person or more, take the taxi. Once into Bangkok, you need to carry your bags down a flight of stairs, walk over to the BTS Skytrian, unless your hotel is right there which is unlikely. Buy a ticket and lug our stuff upstairs to the train, which is also very crowded. Then when you get to your stop, you need to carry your luggage back down 2 flights of stairs and also to roll your luggage to the hotel. And who knows how far that is. The airport link cost 45 baht, the skytrain will be about 45 baht, so if 2 or more are traveling, you can take a taxi from door to door for just a little bit more money. I am a resident of Bangkok, not a tourists and have been on the airport link many times, so please do not be fooled by tourist reviews who think this is great. It is not."

After storing the laggage in the room \"Left laggage\" near gates Q in departure hall we went down to take a taxi (about 500 bahts). It was after 18.00 and there was a huge line for taxi. So rail link was the best option. City Link price is 45 baht per person and it brings you to final (\"terminal\") station near the centre. We waited for the train about 10 minutes and the trip took 30 minutes. It was dark and we mostly watched lighted skyscrapers around the elevated railway. I think it is much better in the daytime. The bad thing was that we found no taxi stand on the exit. Few taxi drivers which stopped at the street refused to go to Machalai district we wanted (I think because of short distance and small price). So we had to use tuk-tuk (150 bahts) to get to the restaraunt area. After awalk and dining we returned to airport by taxi (400B from the city). So if you have time and no laggage it is a good option."

The fare to Phaya Thai terminus is 45 Baht and then you have to add a BTS ticket(s) or a taxi. Getting to Bangkok centre can take an age in a taxi, and if you are unfortunate enough to be in rush hour traffic then be prepared to wait...like really wait! A taxi should be about 250 Baht to Sukhumvit. There is 50 Baht charged by the airport that is not shown on the taxi meter. Remember you have to add the tolls. So on balance we will always take the train. And as you are at the start you should get a seat for the 45 minute trip."

On exit from the customs into the arrival hall the direction to the underground platform is clearly marked. If you are able to manuver the amount of luggage you are carrying easily, this is the best way to reach different parts of the city without getting caught in the unpredictable traffic on the roads and at a fraction of the cost of taking the cab. We can reach the station using escalators moving from one level to the other. On reaching the station there is a reception desk where staff greeted us with the usual Thai warmth and smile. They informed us that the express train was not functioning and that we can take the regular train which goes from the Airport to Phayathai which iis centrally located. We bought our tickets from the vending machine (a member of staff was nearby to help if required). Trains arrive at frequent intervels and very clean and tidy.There was no problem finding a seat near the exit with enough room for our luggage nearby. As we proceed the train gets busy but not overcrouded. We changed at Makkasan, 5 stops away from the airport and walked to Petchabury, a MRT station nearby. the 5 minutes walks took us through a sky bridge over the road and down the escalators to the MRT platform. We bought our tickets for MRT and proceeded to our destination. Between us we had a medium sized suitcase on wheels, back pack and a handbag. We had no issues with the journey which took one hour door to door, including 10 minutes walk at our destination."

So, I hope to see improvement in this area though it's quite difficult for airport express and Normal train to Co-exist on same track."

We chose this route not because of cost but because the roads in Bangkok are so congested that this was by far the most time saving way to travel. The Station inside the airport was well signposted and easy to find and leaflets provided showing the various stops and routes.Taxi service was available from local stations then to the hotel. The trains were very smooth and afforded a good view of the City. Most impressed and a good way to avoid the busy roads."

You can take both from the lowest floor from Suvarnabhumi airport. Getting to the concourse is no hassle and straightforward. The express line was out of service when I visited, but that's no problem as the city line is cheaper and not much slower than the express line. It would take about 30 minutes to reach the last stop and there are several stops where you can connect to the BTS and MRT systems. Mind you, the city line train does not have much space to keep baggage, so if you have 5 or 6 huge suitcases, a cab maybe a better option. The total cost from Suvarnabhumi airport to Phaya Thai were the line ends is 45 baht per person, so its cheap for solo travellers or possibly groups with upto 4 members. Otherwise, it maybe cheaper to go by taxi which is more convenient and cheaper as taxi charges will be about 300 baht. The only advantage is that the train is faster compared to the traffic ridden streets of Bangkok, where even a five hour time advantage can vanish and you find yourself running around the huge hallways of Suvarnabhumi airport trying to find your flight!"

It finally opened a couple of years ago. There are two types of trains going into Suvarnabhumi airport on the same track. A non stop one and a slower one.A taxi into BKK will run you meter : around 200 B (+ or - depending on traffic), plus 50 B surcharge + toll if any 75 B soon to go up. The Express will cost you over 100 Baht and, like just about every train will drop you off at the train station from where you will need to take a train - underground MRT APat Makhasan or sky train - BTS at Phaya Thai or a taxi or both..Alternatively you take the regular train to town. Price varies on destination but is a fraction of the Express.Now when you off load you have escalators at Makhasan and steps at Phaya Thai. Not convenient with luggage. A walk and another queue to buy your ticket. The only time it is worth it is Friday nights from 5 to 9 when traffic from the airport to BKK and in town is horrendous.But there again, not easy if you have suitcases.Last, but not least, the airline check in ( like in Hong Kong) does not operate... So really, not much benefit except if you have spent all your money and need to go to or from the airport. Sure is better and faster than walking."

A one way local ticket which makes various stops is 50 baht, less then 2 dollars US and the Express ticket that takes you from the City to the airport in 20 minutes is 70 baht, about 70 cents more. I don't understand why anyone would take a local link. The problem with the Airport Link is that it brings you to this huge station which has no direct access to the BTS Sky train. You need to leave the Air Link station and then go up stairs to get access to the BTS to the rest of the city, I addition because the Air Link station leaves you in a desolate section of the city, if you don't use the BTS Sky link in is nearly impossible to get a taxi around the area of the Airport Rail Link Station. But when my friend and I had just a roller bag to to to Singapore for the weekend. We used the BTS to the Airport Link and we saved about 20 dollars US in taxi fare, plus the Rail link is faster during rush hours. My suggestion is use a taxi at the airport. For 300-400 baht you can get any where in the city with your luggage. 10-15 dollars US. Avoid the Rail link unless you enjoy adventure."

The Suvarnabhumi airport rail link promised to be an exciting new way to get in and out of Bangkok, when it eventually, finally came on line. True, it is a major step forward from taxies and traffic jams. It's a cheap, quick and comfortable way to get from the airport to, at its final station Phya Thai which connects to the main BTS line that straddles Sukhumvit. Or Makkasan, the station before. All good, thank you. One wonders why it's restricted to 3 or 4 carriages, because it's nearly always full to overflowing. More carriages equals more comfortable travel, I would have thought. It appears as though budget cuts might have kicked in by the end of the planning of the project. As a frequent Bangkok visitor, it was noticed that the infrastructure was set in place for YEARS before the trains actually started running. Anyway, on balance, it's good and useful. It might be nice if it ran 24 hours in stead of 18. Thank you."

I was not able to get a seat due to the number of people who did not disembark at the airport ( this is the last stop) and was squeezed like never before by the crush of folks boarding the triain. There are seven stations on this route. Many had to wait for the next train, which must be a problem as trains are only once every 20 or 30 minutes, whereas the BTS ( Skytrain) is literally every three minutes.

Be prepared to have small change such as the relevant Thai baht and 20bht notes to make the transition go smooth. Take note of all the English translation freely available and give courtesy acknowledgement to the local people with humility. Wait time is minimal at any of the stations and a viewing screen informs you of the next available service no more than 5 - 7 minutes. Adjust to peak periods when there maybe full carriages, this is NOT a negative aspect as they have a large population. The local people love and respect there silence as a appreciation of there environment and do not interrupt visitors, no barging or aggressive nature exists."

I used it from Suvarnabhumi Airport to Ratchaprarop (Pratunam) and return back to the airport few days later too.Generally, coming from the Airport is easier and less tense as there are no rush factors and more transportations are available. Naturally you do not feel that stressed and you are able to enter the train and there you go to your destinations. On my return trip, it was 1545H Bangkok Time at Pratunam and I was supposed to check in at 1740H. As it was a weekend, getting a taxi or shuttle service may prove futile as the jam outside is really bad. So I went for the ARL instead. I missed the one from Ratchaprarop ARL to the airport as it is too packed to accommodate even one thin fellow in the train cubicles. Out of desperation, I went to take to the next station, Phaya Thai, which is the terminal station of the entire ARL line and from there, bounced back to Ratchaprarop and Suvarnabhumi airport. You will be surpised that some of the trains have highrail like seats. Transportation costs are saved and prevent Taxi drivers from quoting us ridiculous prices. BKK is made easier to travel with ARL, BTS and MRT."

The platform is squelching hot - even if the temperature isn't that hot away from the platform. There is no air-conditioning and the platforms are packed with no breeze, full of sweaty, smelly commuters. It wasn't possible to get a space next to a bar to hold let alone a seat. It didn't really matter though as my hands were pinned to my sides due to the crush on the train. The driving was erratic and we all fell on top of each other several times during the journey due to heavy breaking. The trains are second hand and look it. All in all, a big fail for Thailand."

From arrivals in suvarnabhumi, go down and down til the basement( it's clearly signposted) and buy a ticket to the very central Phaya Thai for 45baht..you can change there to the main skytrain route to other parts of bangkok or take a taxi.Highly recomended!"

It stops quite a few times en route to central Bangkok and the doors close with a terrible 'clunk' every time. But it takes about 30 minutes to get to the end of the line. Unfortunately you are not done yet, you need to get to another station to get another train to the city centre. If you have bags, I'm sorry for you. It's the same site but a long walk. And you can't get a through ticket when you start your trip. You have to queue up with your baggage to get change and then again to get a ticket. But having said all that it's faster than by taxi and you avoid the taxi drivers who decline to use the meter. But if you are going to a hotel, get a taxi from the airport. It should be no more than 500 baht. (\u00a310). The train is about 100 baht, (\u00a32). But considering to get to a hotel you have to change trains, then get a taxi from the centre, you're probably better off getting a taxi to start with. Just insist on the meter. And make sure you get a taxi from OUTSIDE the terminal. These taxis are controlled. Inside the terminal touts will offer you taxis, limousine service, express service et al. The prices are horrendous. After a long flight they hope you will be glad to accept their offer. Don't. Just walk outside the terminal and get a taxi there. The train runs from underneath the airport."

First off it is very inexpensive if you are traveling alone and have few bags that are easy to lug around. However it also requires that your final destination in near one of the stops of the various rail options in Bangkok as they all inter connect.A plus is it does get you past the bulk of Bangkok\u2019s notorious traffic. The down side is the monster traffic is only for a few kilometers and likely near your destination. If you are not certain about the traffic, real time updates can be found on Google Maps and other apps helping your decisions. Assuming you would look at savings, taking a metered taxi to the Nana area may cost you about 300 Baht total . Where taking the Airport link would cost about 75 Baht total (per person) using the BTS Skytrain and the Airport link together to get you in the neighborhood. Personally I would take a metered taxi and get delivered to the lobby of my hotel as after a long flight cramped up in a seat for endless hours extra effort is not appealing. That sounds a whole lot better as opposed to becoming a pack mule with my bags on the Airport link and hoofing the last leg to where I would stay.So know where you are going and know how far you need to walk is the basic consideration to using the link."

I waited for the second train which was totally empty. The express train was canceled until further notice. I believed it was due to the costly fare and poor response from commuters. In Singapore, the train is card accessed but here in Bangkok a coin like disc is issued and used for train access. I was quite worried that I have a hole in my pants' pocket resulting in the disc dropped out from my possession or accidently slipped out of my hand into the drain or gutters.

The Air Rail Link terminal doesn't connect directly to other mass transportation. Instead, passengers are dumped at a relatively isolated terminal not very close to most people's final destinations. In most cases, passengers will then have to find their way down to the taxi stands and contend with often cranky and abusive taxi drivers (seems the ones around the Airport Rail Link terminal are among the worst in Bangkok). By the time passengers lug their bags around and get a taxi (plus waiting for the train at the airport) and make their way to their final destinations, they probably won't really saved much time or money, if any.Moreover, the terminal is not particularly \"people friendly\" with few lifts and the neighborhood around the terminal building is a bit dodgy (I would not comfortably hang out there, especially in the evenings). Finally, the trains themselves don't have luggage racks so you have to constantly juggle yourself and control of your bags.Unless you're going to a destination quite close to the Airport Rail Link Terminal, do yourself a favor and just take a taxi!"

Very convenient and quick. From the central station A7, it takes us 10 minutes to get to our hotel. Really easy and safe.Take the rail if you do not have too many baggage. Just ask for directions as Thai people are very friendly. land of the SMILES!get a local map and check out the MRT..it takes you to most attractions."

[During rush hour time you can be asked to pay 500 Baht flat rate for the same!!]. Plus it takes long if you are stuck in traffic. On the way back to the Airport I decided to take the Airport Rail Link. The Airport Link starts from BTS Phaya Thai on the green line. You don't have to worry about ,'how will i get through the automatic gates if I have luggage?'. The staff is very helpful at all the stations.{they open the manual door to let you pass}. The connection at BTS Phaya Thai is very convenient and passenger friendly (you don't have to walk long distances). The cost of the ticket is 45 Baht. (my trip from BTS Nana to Phaya Thai costed me 25 Baht). The Airport Link drops you right at the terminal - level = -1.So its very convenient and will save you a lot of money. If you are four people - it won't make a lot of difference in terms of cost but a lot in terms of time if its peak traffic time."

It has been a great help to avoid the traffic jam and the quickest way to reach to your hotel after a long flight. There are 2 services, the Express Line and the City Line. The Express line is a direct service which would drop you at BTS (Sky train station) while the City Line stops at every station on its rout and BTS ( Phaya Thai station) is the last stop of the City Line. Some people who have too much luggage might not find if comfortable as its not easy to drag your luggage around.If you are going to airport then there is a check in facility at the first stop. At Makkasan station for Express Line and at Phaya Thai station for City Line, so you can drop your luggage there and reach at the counter at the airport to get your boarding card.... its very easy..."

It was relliable and made our journey to and from the airport almost effortless. It was busyer in the morning but by no means uncomfortable, if you have luiggage you should be in the standing section anyway and you can always sit on your bags! Get a trolley at the airport and take the lift to the station, there is only a small amount of steps to the platform and most other stations have escalators out. You can't expect the line to go every where you want it to so do some reasearch before you book a place to stay, For us it was easy, we took the airport link then shared a taxi with another couple near to our hotel which was not expensive. When we went back to bangkok we chose a hotel within walking distance to the airport link station but also close to other attractions we wanted.. If you choose any old hotel/hostel before you check where the airport link stations and what other transport is around no wonder people find it hard! Besides traffic, this is a really easy city to get around with or without luggage. You really don't need to take much with you especially if your only going for a couple of weeks just pack light and take a large rucksack rather than a suitcase, laundry services will wash your things in less than 24hrs! Although I reccomend buying a cheap suitcase out there if you want to go home with tons of shopping... it's never as bad lugging things around when you leave and you'd be supprised what you can fit on a tuktuk."

Why they even run the express is a mystery to me. Hours of the train are approximately 6am to midnite so depends on when you arrive or depart as to whether train is option. Depending on direction you are traveling from Makhasan taxis are either easy or a big hassle. For instance our condo is just over 1000 meters from the station but to get to it taxis cannot turn right on Asok so have to take a long expensive ride through traffic. Usually if we are coming from the airport we just take a metered airport taxi. Going to the airport for us it's a better option."

            "review": "A good idea, badly executed.. In my view, the airport rail link has both good and bad features.The good are that it's cheap and is not a terribly long journey.The bad - it's not particularly comfortable. The non-express train just has plastic bench seats and no dedicated luggage area. It's basically a commuter train that also goes to the airport.The stations are an absolute joke. They were obviously designed by an architect who had never travelled anywhere. At Phayathai station for example (the end of the line), there is one lift only and hardly any escalators! You have to basically carry your bags up and down. Moronic.Makkasan station, originally designed to be like the superb Central station in Hong Kong, where you check your bags in before you board the Airport link train, receive your boarding pass, then never have to worry about your bags again - is a total failure and a joke. It is a huge white elephant, stuck in the middle of nowhere.After a while, they extended the Express train to go to Phayathai as well as to Makkasan. That made sense. Now, however, this train has been cancelled for ONE YEAR for maintenance!As the Express trains only seemed to run every hour anyway, you just had to be lucky to get one - otherwise it's quicker to get the \"city line\" than to wait for an Express.Go online to try to find a timetable and you will find different timetables which aren't the same!Today in the Bangkok Post (Aug 20, 2014), the SRT Chairman admitted that \"some sections of the airport rail link are damaged\" and that he has assigned crews to fix them!!!! Have they heard about regular, scheduled maintenance? It's not a concept widely understood in Thailand - especially with respect to transport infrastructure.There is now a direct physical link to the BTS station at Phayathai and to the MRT at Makkasan - albeit with a long walk.It's definitely a cheaper and potentially quicker way to get connected to the BTS / MRT system than a cab - but the whole system is badly designed and if there is a group, you certainly need to consider the convenience of a cab."

Instead of buying the Express Route tickets (Phayathai-Suvarnabhumi or Makkasan-Suvarnabhumi) for 150 Baht we opted for the SA City Line (stops at 6 stations before arriving at the airport) for 45 Baht. The 18 or 15 minute non-stop service is ideal for those who wants less travel time, who wants to avoid the city commuters and who is carrying tons of luggage. But for those people like us who isn't in a hurry, loves the commute and is carrying a reasonable amount of luggage, the SA City Line is good enough. The trains are big enough so you can stand side by side with your luggage."

If you want to avoid taxi and Bangkok traffic jam, use Rail Link going from (or to) Suvarnabhumi (BKK) airport.Use express train if possible. It is super convenient. There are 2 express lines: Makkasan and Phaya Thai. I used express train to Phaya Thai (that gets you to the BTS Sukhuvmit lane), and then, either by taxi or BTS (if it's peek traffic hour take BTS). However: Phaya Thai express is currently (form April 2014) under renovation, so you can only take City Train, which is slow and has many stops. Use taxi if you have luggage. Once Phaya Thai express is back, use it instead. It is fast and convenient to get you to area around Sukhuvmit (for example: between Phaya Thai BTS and Nana, there are only 4 stops). If you are going towards Makkasan (and can use MRT) use it!"

I'll start off with the good points for the Airport Rail Link, the two biggest positives are that you completely skip all the traffic (which depending on the time of day, can be really bad!). So this is bar far the quickest option at getting into central Bangkok. There are two types of Airport Rail Link, the City Line & Express Line. The City Line will stop at each station along the way (7 stops) and will take a little bit longer but is only 45 baht (one way). The Express Line goes straight from Phaya Thai to Suvarnabhumi Airport and is 90 baht (one way). The Express Line takes about 15 mins for a journey. The other major difference about the two lines is that the Express Line has racks / spaces for luggage so if you are traveling with a lot of baggage then the Express Line would be more convenient.The frequency of these lines tends to change every few months so the best way to keep up to date on departure times in to download the Airport Rail Link app from App Store / Google Play Store.Getting into and around Bangkok from the Airport Rail Link is rather straight forward. Get off at Phaya Thai and the BTS station (SkyTrain) is attached to the last stop of the Airport Rail link - about 5 mins walk. If you need to get the MRT (metro) you can either get off at Makkasan (second last stop of Airport Rail Link - will need to take City Line to get off here), and walk to Phetchaburi MRT - although this isn't the most pleasant of walks, particularly in BKK heat. There is a second option that's a bit longer to get on the MRT. Get off at Phaya Thai and get on the BTS (SkyTrain) and take this to Asoke BTS stop - there is another MRT stop at this interchange station - Sukhumvit MRT stop. This will only be convenient if it isn't busy on the SkyTrain (rush hour etc..)Which leads me into my negatives about the Airport Rail Link - it can be busy. If you are taking the City Line and its busy and you have a lot of luggage - this isn't going to be a pleasant experience. Likewise using the BTS (SkyTrain) to get to/from the Airport Rail Link is awful when you have baggage and its rush hour..."

Then taxi 30 mins for 2km to our hotel!!returning to the airport at the end of our stay, our concierge briefed the taxi driver to take us to makassan - it was rush hour - 40 mins later he dropped us at a station and drove off - it was not Makassan but ratchaprarop and it was a 45 minute trip to the airport, so be sure you go to makassan."

Using the MRT or BTS Skytrain and the airport rail link guarantees a smooth trip to the airport. However, be aware that during peak times (7-9am, 4-7pm) the BTS Skytrain can be packed to the rafters so getting on is a problem even without luggage."

Sadly it is based on no particular reasoning only a 'management decision'.It isn't to much of a problem to ride the City Line, which does get crowded dependent on the time of day, but I happily pay the extra charge for the Express, more speed and comfort and the basic reason for the Airport Rail Link in the first place.

I chose City Terminal (Makkasan) station since my hotel is closer to this station. I would have preferred the Direct Express Train with no stopovers ( which will take only 15 minutes to the Makasan Station at a higher fare of 150 baht) but I was told that the next trip will still take an hour to wait. So I ended up with the 6-stop overs Commuter Train for 30 minutes at 35 baht. Not that I mind the fare and time difference, but I find the commuter train a bit crowded. However, I do think trains are still the fastest and most affordable way to commute within a city and I'm thankful that Bangkok has opened this service line, which is convenient for tourists like me, who are the easy preys for inflated fare charges from wayward taxi drivers of Bangkok. The city terminal was really spacious, complete with health, security and safety facilities. However, I find the terminal taxis disappointing with their high metered fares. I ended up with the metered terminal taxi at 200 baht against the regular taxis at 80 baht to my hotel near Phleon Chit. I had to shell out another 50 baht for toll fees since the driver decided to use the expressway to avoid the rush hour traffic."

This way you also save the 50baht airport toll fees, which you need to pay if you take a taxi from the airport itself.But consider taking a taxi all the way to the airport while taking the return flight from Bangkok. This way, you do not need to pay airport toll and it's not worth to get off at Makkasan and take airport link to Bkk, specially at night, when you are tired after your trip in bangkok.

My flight arrived early and I had a short wait until the first train left. 15 minutes after leaving I was getting off at Makkasan Station saving considerable time and money.The Airport Link is actually two services sharing the same tracks and stations. The Express train (red and white) only runs between Makkasan and Suvarnbhumi Airport without stopping. The local line (blue and white) runs between Playa Thai (interchange with BTS) and Suvarnbhumi and stops at all stations in between. Arriving passengers are encouraged to use the former.In operation it's a cross between BTS an MRT, with the stations above ground on more than one level, but with payment by one trip tokens bought from a machine with instructions in Thai and English. Access is by escalator and lift but the platforms are open so are not air con.Criticisms? A few, while the Express trains are fast, they're not frequent one every 45 minutes is usual. The hub station at Makkasan while being modern and spacious (lots of walking) is nowhere near the middle of town. There is an MRT station nearby, but I took a taxi and had to wait while one was called. Also no one uses it, I can't remember the last time I took a train that had so few people on it, When I left I had to use a local line train (which was reasonably busy) because if I'd waited for an Express I would have missed my flight."

Total cost - 50 baht per person and best of all, we are not stuck in the nasty Bangkok traffic jam if travelling by taxi. However, a taxi may be a better option if:- there are 3-4 people in a group (you don't save much by train)- you have lots of heavy luggage (there's 10 mins of walking between connecting stations at Makassan)- your hotel is a long walk from the station (taxi provides doorstep service)"

Twice we used the rail link to get into the centre from the airport and twice we found it easy, very clean and comfortable. We took the slightly slower blue line the first time and departed at Phaya Thai station and then took a taxi to our hotel. The train took just twenty minutes and was a superb way to enter Bangkok for the first time. It is elevated and you get to see quite a bit of the city as you get closer to the centre ( though the rail link stops a bit short of the centre ). The second time we used the line we took the express link and got off at Makassan. This was the red line direct one stop route which took less than fifteen minutes. A little further from the centre than Phaya Thai Station but there's not a great deal of difference. In both regards you can also link with the MRT system, but as we were heading for the Khao San Road area again we just jumped in a taxi and 300 baht later we were where we wanted to be. All in all the Rail Link is excellent. Extremely modern and efficient, clean and very comfortable. It does finish running at 12 midnight so we couldn't use it to get back to the airport for our 3.00 am flight but by that time the roads were fairly clear and we just jumped in a taxi."

The airport rail link is a fine idea however when you reach the main station it's nearly impossible to get a taxi to take you to your hotel. condo, etc...The taxis are reluctant to come there as they see the link as competition. The express train is fast and clean. The local which runs more frequently makes a few stops but takes only 10 min or so longer. However, during the rush hours its very crowded! Hard to manage with bags when it's jammed with local commuters. The train is a good option if you're heading into Sukhumvit and traveling lightly. You can now take a walkway to the MRT (underground station) instead of leaving the station and going down an access road and crossing train tracks on foot to reach the MRT. With large bags it's still a pain though...."

You'll save money taking this easy and quick route to near central Bangkok, but if you're like most you'll have to then get off at the last stop and grab a taxi. We did and asked for a metered one. Even though we knew about where we were, the old man then zoomed onto an expressway and took us across the river. When I told him to stop and turn around (too late of course) he did, and stopped to ask a cop for directions to Democracy Square that was photocopied and written in Thai just for him (meter running of course). He stretched a $2.25 ride to $2.80 that way. Funny thing is, he ended up with $0.55 for his joyride, and missed a tip that would've been at least $1 per bag plus 15% for the ride. Until you've had at least a few days to adjust to them, don't set yourself up to take a taxi in Bangkok.Don't use a metered cab in Bangkok at all if you can avoid it. Have your hotel set you up with a cab at a price that the hotel thinks is fair. Same at the airport."

First the trains leave to the most odd times and the express runs only every 30 minutes. Even more funny, the express from Payathai that passes Makkasan (the main station), doesn't even bother to stop, hence the long waits in between. The if you actually take it form the airport and you arrive at Makkasan you first need to be lucky to get a taxi and if you do, the taxi has only one way to leave the station. And that way is not towards the city centre. So you probably have to spend another 20-60 minutes in the cap after getting out. I took it in total 3 times and every time it took me twice the time it would have take if I would have gone straight by cap. And I live just 20 minutes walk away from the main station!!!

The Airport Rail Link in Bangkok is the exception, being easy to find and board, fast and efficient, and basically dirt cheap compared to other means of transport. It is also air conditioned, which can be a lifesaver in the Bangkok heat. We have taken the rail link several times and have always enjoyed the experience.

Considering Bangkok's traffic condition and the protest situation, it is the best bet to avoid delay in travel plans. I have personally used it every time I visited Bangkok and so far, it has not let me down. It would have been perfect if there were shorter intervals between each Express Service, especially during peak periods. 30 minutes between trains are simply too long. That said, it is a minor inconvenience considering they also provide the Cityline Commuter Service. The difference is that this train stops at every station between the airport and the city. Hence the doubling in travel time to 30min. The plus side to taking this train though is it is much cheaper, from THB15 to THB45, depending on where you get off, compared to the Express Service's THB150. Point to note: the Express Service is a non-stop service all the way to the final station located in the city. Station name is called Phaya Thai and it is conveniently linked to BTS Skytrain service, which affords passengers connectivity to various parts of the city, including major shopping areas.The Cityline also allows passengers convenience to get off at another interchange station called Makkasan, which is linked to another transit service known as MRT, and this too, provides ease of access to parts of the city.Chris Lee"

There were also staff on hand at the airport station offering information to people catching the rail link. This is definitely a convenient way of getting into Bangkok city from BKK airport."

It's the easiest way to reach (for me) the BTS Skytrain (Phaya Thai) from where I catch the BTS Skytrain to other parts of the city, especially the hotels that I book nearby the BTS Skytrain. One way ticket costs 45 Baht, and it's a nice journey.When going away from the airport, it's an exciting feeling. When going towards the airport, one does feel nostalgic remembering the beautiful time one had in Bangkok.I'm awaiting to go back to Bangkok :) <3"

If you ignore the fact that the process of purchasing the tickets and knowing which train to board is a little confusing given signs aren't very clear, the train ride itself is fine. We got on the non-express train despite requesting for the express when purchasing tickets at the counter. Ultimately, no regrets since the express train only comes around at 30min intervals. The non-express train resembles any regular subway train and thus has no racks for luggage so beware if you have lots of baggage that this may not be the most convenient option. Consider leaving your bags in the airport. It's not expensive at 45THB/person into town. We took it to the last stop (Phaya Thai) which took around 20min tops. From there, transfered to the BTS skytrain. The transfer is similarly confusing with minimal signs telling you which direction to go (There are signs, but they are hand drawn, small and hung from railings). Note, there are no escalators at the BTS station so you'd have to walk up lugging all your bags. That wasn't too pleasant. "

At the airport entrance to the trains there are two sides with a pay booth at each. Look up and there is a sign telling you the length of wait for both trains. It may be quicker to jump on the city train instead of the express train if the Express has a long wait. First we went on the city side to the right, they said you should go to the express side. We walk around the booth. They said 40 minutes for the express city is only 10 minutes. Back around again. They must have been chuckling a bit. No problem ride was great.

For the six times that I used to get to and from the airport there was hardly anyone on it. The quality of the train is high and once it gets rolling your at your destination within 15 minutes. There is a non express option which will take longer as it has more stops.Certainly beats taxis and gridlock on roads but does run on the hour so you need to make allowance for the timetable but bits punctual.Unless you know about it you won't find it and default to taxis.At other end hop into take to hotel or use the BTS.Wonderful facility and don't know why it isn't used more."

But this time i thought \"stuff it\" am going to give this my best shot i had a idea were i wanted to go and as i waked up to the ticket office i actually started to panic , i mean all i was doing was getting on a god dam train right! well first the woman behind the glass screen was not a smiler which put me a ease right away NOT! i open my map i had and pointed to my final destination .\"ALL THE WAY\" was the reply i smiled and handed over a nice crisp 500bhat note expecting some change and she passed it back to me with a plastic coin went to the automated barriers and swiped my plastic coin and through i went. No going back now i thought the train came i got on and the lady was announcing the stops in thai and english,whit the wall chart much like the design of the London underground i plotted my journey it was a that point i took a look and the change i was given 50bhat that's what this ride was costing me a whole 50bhat i was smiling like an idiot as the train reached the furthest point i got off asked the station attendant haw to get to my final stop and was told to go down one level and take the BTS i thought should i just get a taxi now or chance my luck again and thought how happy i would be if i actually made it to my place just using public transport go i did it ,down one level you walk up to a machine and to hit a button were i hold was my stop and it load you the cost 30bhat amazing ! got on now this time i was in which the general public so a lot more people all busy on there phone looking up at me and problem thinking \" tourist \" but i did it got of at my stop got a final tuk tuk ride \"could have walked it\" so in short it was clean safe fast or and bloody cheap as chips i will never get a taxi again"

Later I used the airport buses which do not run (to the best of my knowledge) from the \"new\" airport. This ground transportation always ultimately sat in the legendary traffic jams of Bangkok. (It is possible that if I had made those journeys at 02:00 in the morning I wouldn't have had to sit in the jams, but it never happened like that) The world is a much better place now that they have completed the airport link. The train is clean, fast, and efficient, however the traveler with a suitcase has to get same on and off the train, and in and out of train stations. When I am more than 80 years old, I probably will no longer use the train, but until then it is for me the only way to go.The wise traveller will choose his hotel so that it is near an MRT or BTS station, thus affording him quick access from the hotel lobby to the Airport Rail Link, and minimizing the suitcase carrying.The only negative (other than the suitcase thing above) is the fact that the connection to the MRT is about a 5 minute walk. Previously you had to go down and cross busy streets to get from one to the other. Today there is a long ramp which takes you over the busy streets and makes life a bit easier. I cannot comment on the connection with the BTS (\"Skytrain\") as I did not use it."

Take the escalators to the very bottom of the airport and follow the red and blue train signs. Once at the station, the left side train, RED, is the express which takes will take 15 minutes to the City Air Terminal (Makkasan) train station. This service connects to the city's mass transit subway system. The train on the right, BLUE, is the stopping train which takes you to Phaya Thai. You will need to buy a token at the airport, single only, and swipe it a the turnstiles. It can take 30 minutes to get from the Phaya Thai to the airport and gets very crowded at peak times. Make sure you leave in plenty of time if you want to get to the airport as you will have to wait for the next one if there is no room for you to get on with luggage."

However it was great, as it's quicker and cheaper than taking a taxi and you're guaranteed not to be stuck in traffic which is always crazy in Bangkok! As it's an express train and costs a little more than the standard train, it was practically empty which was great especially when you have your baggage with you.

You just need to take the Sky train to Phaya Thai station and from there take the sky train all the way to the airport. The trip takes 30 minutes and there's also a faster alternative which takes 15 minutes. You will reach the airport faster than a taxi and it will be much cheaper as well. A taxi costs around 400 THB and the train is 45 THB/person (fast train 150 THB/person). In addition to that, my experience is that you always need to argue a bit with the taxi driver and you never know if he will take the nearest road or try to rip you off...I will for sure use the train if I would return to Bangkok."

( buying your tickets for the latter trains is an additional process).2. make the phaya thai BTS station more user friendly with provision of elevators or escalators so that baggage can be handled more conveniently. elderly are severely handicapped under the existing conditions as you have to carry all you bags down the steps leading to the rail link station.this is an excellent begining for the airport transportation. an extension to Hua Lum Phong ( the main railway station) could also be considered."

The only disadvantage is that the taxi stand area under the arriving Makassan station is rather dark and uninviting. Unknowingly I was waiting for my ride at the taxi stand when I was informed by the security staff of a free service to call for taxi and they record the taxi number plate and inform the driver of your destination ! No signs in English to inform arriving passengers. Have seen other passengers lugging their luggage to the main road which is quite a distant away.Surrounding areas of the Makkassan Station looks desolated and uninviting for first timers. Could be clearer with signage and up keep of the surrounding of the station.

The Airport Link is a great idea but it is let down by poor signage (a lot of which still seems to be temporary) and hardly any lifts or escalators which is unforgivable when most of the passengers are expected to come from the airport loaded with luggage. The City Line service, which stops at several stations on the way to the airport, comes every 15 minutes which is OK but nowhere near as frequent as the BTS Skytrain. The Express service leaves every half hour which is very inconvenient, plus it's overpriced at 100 Baht to go to the airport. Overall, if you live near a station along the line it's OK to use the City line to commute to other places along the line, but I'd only use it to go to the airport if I was travelling alone with very light luggage, or if I was travelling there with no bags, e.g. to meet someone there,"

OK so you are through customs, immigration and security and you have luggage on a trolley (Free at Suvarnabhumi) airport.Do not wait for the lifts to the lowest floor as they are few and the queues to use them usually long at peak times.Use the travelators and get to the lowest level and follow the signs to the \"City Line\" \"Airport Rail Link\". Use the toilets at the airport before boarding as there are non on the train system.You get to a pay kiosk (English spoken) and buy a token (round plastic disc) which you insert in the barrier. If however you have LOADS of luggage, the train police will allow you through the barrier and you take yet another lift down onto the platform. You should arrive knowing what station you want to disembark from however the end of the line is Phayathai and there you insert your token or again go to the train police, SMILE and get let through a barrier again, take the stair or a lift down to an underpass (still above ground level) and walk the 200 metres or so to \"PHAYATHAI\" station on the BTS. Here you reverse the procedure to enter the BTS network proper but the system for purchasing tickets is different so read the SKYTRAIN section of Trip Advisor.Trains are cheaper than taxis and trains are well air-conditioned.Now if you are elderly or infirm this mode of transport is not for you and you younger people with so much baggage that you cannot organise it's transit on your own,.... this is where we recommend you take a taxi.By the way, we never see the point of taking the EXPRESS train to the airport as it costs significantly more but is not significantly faster. It costs 150 Baht and if you are 'late' for check in then you might want to use it but the access from the airport (basement) is slightly different. Note this.Do you research and read several reviews here as if you come unprepared, it is horrible to be lost when first in a new destination. Really you should have purchased a train map or downloaded something online as you need to know your station although we expect most of you will be heading to the city centre (Phayathai).You get a good view of the suburbs as the track is elevated, the system very modern, fast (say 25 minutes to the centre. Look out for the giant TV screen on the side of a building as you near the City Centre and treat this experience as an excursion to be enjoyed.Best Regards.Chris & AnnaPS In theory this transport system is wheelchair friendly but we have found on occasion that the lift is out of order and then you would be stuck. If this is your category arrange private transport."

There is also the SRT train (State Railways of Thailand) train. This is a fraction of the price.

There is even a lift for passengers with huge bags. Fare for express line is 90 baht. Its quite confusing first but if you ask people they will help you and direct you towards the right ticket counter and and were to go next."

However, when you land at the airport you can get right in the train station located inside the airport, pay \u0e3f45, and get into the city a little while later. The Airport Rail Link connects to the SkyTrain at the Phayathai station, and the SkyTrain can get you around to a lot of Bangkok. It's an incredibly easy system, and far cheaper than a taxi. I'd definitely recommend the train to anyone arriving at BKK.Do be careful though, the night's last Airport Rail Link leaving the airport gets you to Phayathai after the SkyTrain has stopped running for the night. This means you get deposited at the Phayathai station with no onward train travel, and there are throngs of taxi drivers there ready to take advantage of your travel-wearied state. As anywhere in Bangkok, always demand that a taxi driver uses the meter; if the driver tells you the meter is broken, or tries to negotiate a rate beforehand, it means he's a shady person. Your best bet is to talk away from the station to Phayathai Road and flag down one of the taxis driving by rather than dealing with any of the taxis waiting to prey on people."

The train starts right under the Airport (you can take a lift down to reach here) and goes upto Phaya Thai station. Considering the Suvarnabhumi Airport is far from the city centre, this train is very useful for most tourists. I was staying at Royal Ivory Nana Resort near Nana Sky Train Station. The taxi from our hotel to airport was costing around 700 Baht. I took the Skytrain from Nana Station to Phaya Thai Station for 40 Baht and then easily changed to the Airport Rail Link. The entire journey from Phaya Thai Station to Suvarnabhumi station costs 45 Baht and took 45 minutes. Totally I spent 95 Baht from the hotel to airport which would have otherwise cost me 700 Baht in a taxi. Having backpacks is much better when travelling in this train. Though I had one roller bag and it was fine. The train is clean. Runs at a decent speed. The ticket machines are user friendly and very simple to use. If you are confused there is a guard to help you out. If your hotel is close to any BTS station and if you believe in saving some money on travelling, take this airport rail link. If you are a big family the taxi and airport link cost would turn out to be similar."

If your arrival time at Suvarnabhumi airport is between 6AM and 11:30 PM, and your hotel is near one of the BTS Skytrain stations, you might want to consider taking the train instead of a taxi. Taxis from the airport cost anywhere from 500 to 600 THB depending on traffic and \"other charges\" (the driver explained that they charge extra between midnight and 6 AM - not sure if that is bogus or not). My latest experience: Flying back from Phuket to BKK, I arrived at 4 PM. I took the Airport Rail Link (the City Line) all the way to the last stop at Phaya Thai, fare = 45 THB. I walked over to the BTS Skytrain and hopped on the next train to Asok station, fare = around 40 THB. The Park Plaza Hotel Sukhumvit was less than a five minute walk from the station. I was checked in and relaxing in my room around 5 PM. I do not know how long it would have taken in a taxi fighting Bangkok rush hour traffic - and with a meter running, that might end up being quite pricey.The trains are very clean. The ticket vending machines are pretty user friendly. It also helps if the nice lady in line behind you explains the system. :o) Of course, having a backpack instead of bulky rolling luggage makes it easier to transfer stations. And like in the NY subway (or any metro train), just have your wits about you and watch your valuables. For perspective: Coming from Sukhumvit back to the airport, I took a taxi. It was 3 AM and the trip took less than a half hour. The meter read: 197 THB. Go figure. (I gave the driver 300 THB. He looked real happy.)"

Because others referred to it as Skytrain, we booked our hotel on this line. It was not a disaster but we probably would have stayed elsewhere had we realized itOne perk of this was that we were able to get the \"elder\" stored value card for the ARL which was about half fare which is only available to Thai Citizens on the BTS. (You can get an Adult stored value card called Rabbit Card on the BTS - no discount but still simplifies the process)These trains are clean and fast. Many places here tell you not to take the \"local\" ARL from the airport but we never took the express which did not stop at our hotel and never saw people with luggage problems. The local is called the City Line and runs much more often than the Express. The time saved and extra cost isn't worth it. City Line is Blue and Express is red. Otherwise you get both at the same station.which is lowest level of the airport. Just follow the signs which are in English and Thai. Stations are clearly announced and also show on a TV screen.My one BIG complaint was that at our station - Ramkhamhaeng - BOTH the elevator and escalator down were closed for work. We never saw anyone working on them. We were there t the end of Oct at the beginning of our trip and again a month later at the end and the closings remained with no work apparently being done."

So find one for you. * Connectivity timings is amazing and you will not wait for a long time to get a train. * Train is superfast and dont have the issue of getting stuck in traffic, as via road is pretty tiresome, as traffic is heavy.

When arriving at the airport in Bangkok there are so many taxi drivers that try to cheat you so I will take the train instead. If you go downstairs to the official taxi line there is a good chance you will get a taxi with a turbo meter. After the third time this happened I stopped using the taxi line and will only take a taxi from the arrivals area that I see dropping off a passenger. If you do take a taxi from the arrivals area be sure not to take one of the taxis that's already sitting there. Those drivers are part of the taxi mafia and have paid off the police in order to park there, and they will then rip you off. But if you see a driver dropping off a passenger you should take that taxi. Those drivers are usually very happy to have a customer for their drive back to the city and shouldn't try to rip you off.When in Bangkok you will never want to take a taxi that is parked. They are always the ones that will rip you off. Always flag down a moving taxi and you will have much better luck."

A huge cathedral of a building that is obviously built for future passenger projections, at the moment it is an empty cavern. It signage is hopelessly inadequate - obviously no manager has ever tried to follow the signs and see if they make sense. However, what is worst of all is that Makkasan is situated amid an already crumbling external infrastructure - the paving/walkway is in a shocking condition considering it is so new, with uneven and loose paving slabs ready to trip you up. There IS an MRT (underground) station nearby, but at the time of writing, the only way to get there is to lug your bags over the uneven paving and across a busy road junction (in a poorly lit area at night). There WILL be a footbridge connecting the two stations at some point - it looks as if it is nearing completion, but the fact that it has taken three years since Makkasan was opened is a joke.As the Express trains are less frequent than the stopping city trains, you will be directed to City Line trains some times - and if you have luggage, it will be a nightmare as these trains are very crowded. If you are able to get an Airport Express service, these trains have nicer seats and room for your bags.If you are coming FROM Bangkok Suvernabhumi Airport, good luck finding the entrance to the Express line. All the signs will direct you to the City Line (stopping train entrance) and if you don't know about the Express line you probably won't find it.Be sure you know which Express service you are going to take - either the one to Makkasan's city air terminal, or the one to Phayathai. Get on the wrong one and life will be even more complicated.At the moment, my best advice would be to get an AOT limo when you arrive at the airport. For a relatively low fee you will get to Bangkok in comfort."

You can choose either the Express service (THB90 per person) which is exclusive and one-stop, or use the City service (THB45) which operates like any rail service and makes about 8-9 stops along the way. Overall, use it and forget the taxis."

I believe, that the ARL, BTS and MRT, along with the Water Taxi's make Bangkok a city with great public transportation.The ARL is great way to get into the city from Suvarnabhumi Airport. Take the city train to Phayathai, and then change over to the interconnecting BTS (Sukhumvit Line). Its also very good to get to areas like Pratunam or Ramkhamhaeng, if you are staying on Sukhumvit Road, or Silom, as the BTS interchanges with the ARL at Phayathai, and the MRT at Makassan.Its fairly reasonable, and the ticketing staff, though they don't speak very good English, try to help. Even the security guards help, and the entire experience of the Airport Rail Link is easy, smooth, convenient and pretty comfortable too."

However you may need to get a taxi to your final destination.Clean, safe & efficient.Separately for the adventurous, Don Muang can be reached by mainline train. From Hualamphong to Donmuang can take as little as 45 minutes. However, if you are in a rush then avoid it.All trains on the Northern branch stop there, then it is a walk to the terminal, through the airport hotel.

At this moment, the non-stop express train to the airport has been terminated and only the city link, which makes several stops and carries largely city commuters, is available. It is crowded and uncomfortable as it has just long steel benches for seats. But it is cheap - at just 45 baht (US$1.50, but expensive for daily office workers). The journey takes half-an-hour point to point. At the station (Phayathai), there are only escalators going up but not down. So if you arrive from the airport, you'd have to take the stairs down dragging your luggage. There are no facilities for travelers as it seems to be built for commuters."

A local suggested going a station or two beyond Makkasan (I think Phaya Thai) to catch a cab.Otherwise this is much better than fighting Bangkok traffic all the way to your destination in a taxi."

And the train is often packed, with many passengers travelling between stations on the line, or being staff at the airport. Most of the air passengers I saw seemed to be the more budget travellers. Still, fastest way into town - and out of town. The connection with MRT at Makkasan/Phetchaburi is awful though.

            "review": "Fast, Efficient, Affordable .... and Bizarre!!. What a strange, bizarre experience it is to take the Express Airport Rail Link from Makkasan Station to Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi Airport. First of all, there is no easy way to get to Makkasan Station. I was told to take the MRT to Phetchaburi Station, and then walk over to Makkasan. Sounded easy enough, except that there is a total lack of signage pointing you in the right direction, and no exit from the MRT that takes you directly to the rail link station. The exit takes you to a busy sidewalk, where I had to gaze around until I spotted the overhead railroad a few hundred meters distant. The I had to drag my suitcase and carry my packpack a good half a kilometer to reach the station, having to cross a busy side-street in the process. Once in Makkasan Station it gets really spooky. This place is HUGE!! Its terminal is bigger then most small airports, and everything is clean and shiny. The only problem is, that it is completely devoid of people! Noone uses is, likely because noone knows where it is. Your steps echo hollowly on the tiled floors as you follow signs directing you to the train. Staff are few and far between, but there was a helpful lady who told me where to buy my ticket and where to wait for the train. Once on the train, it was lovely, with comfy highbacked seats. The trip is amazing, shoooting by the scenery non-stop at highspeed, reaching BKK's main terminal in just 15 minutes! All for just 90 baht. I sat on an empty train, however, with all the seats around me empty at 2pm! Why is this service not being used by everybody? Well, when I returned the same way to Makkasan on my return trip, there were no taxis to be found at Makkasan, so there I was dragging my suitcase over to the MRT again. On a second occasion, I tried to take a taxi from my hotel to Makkasan and the driver had no idea where it was, and ended up dropping me off at the regular, slower rail terminal of Ratchaprarop. I said, \"No, I wanted Makkasan\", but he said, \"This Makkasan.\" So a world class facility sits idle because of the difficulty in connecting with it. It should be the busiest transportation hub in Bangkok, but because of poor planning it sits like a multi-million dollar ghost town. I direct link between the MRT Station of Phetchaburi, likely by an underground access tunnel, is absolutely essential to make this a meaningful addition to Bangkok's world-class transportation system."

This was the first time i was travelling with my sister to Bangkok.After i had been warned time and again about tuk tuk drivers and taxi drivers charging insanely ridiculous prices at the airport, the rail link was a sigh of relief. This is undoubtedly the fastest way to get into the city. The trains have enough space for those carrying loads of luggage. Every station as elevator facilities. You can get to Phaya Thai (last stop) which will connect you to the BTS sky train. The rail link is closed from midnight till 6 in the morning. All announcements are made in English too, so there's no chance of missing out on your station. The cost of tickets are from 15 baht up to 45 baht for the city line. (Much better than the 500 bhat taxi ride to the city) Overall i loved the system. It was easy to travel, cheap and as comfortable as possible!"

In Bangkok, one is treated to the world's only four self-sustaining and profitable mass transit systems: the MRT subway, the BTS skytrain, the amazing bus system and the Airport Rail Link. The rail link is not available to you if you arrive at Suvarnabhumi after midnight or before 6:00am, and this might be its only drawback. Should you be arriving or departing during operating hours, it is foolish not to take it. Even if your destination is not on the mas transit routes, you will be well-served to take your taxi from the terminus of the route when coming in to town. You'll save forty-five minutes (or more) coming in, and an hour (or more) going out, not to mention saving on cab fare and hassle. If you are going from town to the airport and have luggage, just check it in at Makhassan Station (yes, you can do an airport check-in right at the rail link!! I've done it several times and no lost luggage) and forget it...all hassles solved. If you have no luggage, leave town from the Phaya Thai station, where there is less congestion. The link is cheap, fast, hassle free, safe at all hours, clean, family friendly and the only smart way to go.. a must-do"

My own advice having used this service several times would be:Don't bother with the express.If you are burdened with masses of luggage, or are travelling with young children, then consider taking a taxi. As many have said it doesn't quite always join up in terms of stairs and being as close to BTS as it might present itself to be.If you are arriving very late at night and minutes are important to you, or your hotel is nowhere near the BTS, consider taking a taxi. It is probably a little quicker.However, as long as you can manage your lugage, if you are arriving anywhere near the rush hour, take the train. Being in a vehicle in Bangkok rush hour is no fun whatsoever. If your hotel is very close to the BTS, take the train whatever the time is - cheaper and more pleasant.If you have little or no luggage, take the train - it's just a better experience. Echo the person who made the point about great views as you come in.If you are on your own, take the train - better value and greener than hiring a whole taxi just for yourself.Tip: If you have the option of arriving with some coins, it will speed your journey a little at the ticket kiosks. It's currently 45Bt to Phaya Thai, and a further 35Bt to Asoke for example (the expressway tolls on their own are 70Bt on the way into town in a taxi).Once you've used it once, you will use it again."

When we left Bangkok on 13th February, the Express services had been reduced to one an hour, so there is even less reason to choose them over the City link, which only takes about 10 minutes longer. As the previous reviewer states, there is a bit of a walk (and flights of steps) to connect to/from the BTS at Paya Thai, so it would depend how much luggage you had whether this would be a good means of connection for you. As our accomodation in Bangkok was very handy to a BTS station, and we had packs rather than suitcases, it was a good choice for us. Trains both on arrival and departure were uncrowded, so plenty of room for luggage, and the journey was not affected by the frequent traffic congestion. BTS on arrival in late afternoon was VERY busy though."

A very sensible idea implemented with Thai wisdom, so therefore rendered virtually useless.2 services, City Line and Express, both use the same track, so you can see a problem from the start. If you want to use the Express, it goes at 20 minute intervals, whereas the City Line is at around 5 minute intervals, by the time you have waited for an Express you could have been there on the City Line for half the fare.The idea was to be able to take your luggage with you, there is sufficient space, but Makkasan Station has no taxis waiting and is not as close to the subway as they suggest, so if you go there you have to lug your bags to the road and try and get a taxi there. If you go all the way to Phaya Thai station, there is a fair walk to the Sky Train, and you need to open your luggage for a security check.Best not to bother.On arrival the cheapest taxi s are at DEPARTURES make sure they use the meter and pay about 200 - 300 Baht right to your hotel.Airport Rail Link TO the airport could have been good, I think they were copying the one in Hong Kong where you can check your bags in at the station, then just travel to the airport. Sadly as this is Thailand, none of the airport check-in desks are ever occupied except Thai, and if you want to check in you MUST use the Express.Having said that, if you are just meeting someone at the airport, it can't be beaten, but for its intended use - it is a complete failure."

A great service no doubt and we used it with the intention of saving some cash and possibly time.However, after a huge flight we arrived in Bangkok feeling terrible and just wanted to get to our hotel and lie down. Keep in mind that if you take the rail link, you have to worry :- about buying tickets, which can be confusing at the vending machines and with a language barrier via the attendants - having the right change to buy the tickets- getting off a the right train station (worrying about where you are)- finding a seat on the train (you may well have to stand up during the journey as the train is always busy)- then you at your train stop you still have to get a taxi or tuk tuk to your actual hotel which means a chance of potential rip off for newbies to Bangkok in addition to explaining where your hotel is to a local cab driver.In hindsight it would have been better just to hop into a taxi and the airport, sit down, relax and let the driver take us direct to the hotel doorstep (we did use a taxi the next time). Airport taxis are controlled at a departure point and are all metered so you will not get ripped off.Unless you are on a really tight budget or are feeling fresh and ready to go, I would recommend taking a taxi if you are a situation like we were. For the sake of a few bucks more, the convenience and lack of hassle is worth it.Nothing beats the ease of 'door to door' transport when you arrive in a strange city and are feeling destroyed after a long flight.ps. as far as time goes I dont think we saved any time using the rail link compared to the taxi which took the express motorway anyway. But sure, in times of bad traffic congestion you would indeed save time on the rail link."

This really was a mess when it opened, with tourists having to cross motorways with suitcases in tow, crappy signage and clueless staff though it seems to have improved. I doubt many tourists use it but they really should as it is a better option than the stinky and irritating airport taxis. I think the Thais use this more than tourists."

            "review": "It all depends........ what time of the day you arrive into Bangkok International airport, whether you travel light and whether your hotel in Bangkok is right next to a BTS (skytrain) or MTR station, all this factored in whether you should opt for the airport train or a taxi. I yield to taking the Bangkok airport train, travel light (only with a trolley) and to find a hotel right next to a BTS station (which I did on this trip). It makes your travel in and out of Bangkok so much less stressing (traffic in Bangkok can be a notoriously dreadful experience). What a positive surprise this new airport train is. Located down in the basement of the airport, it has 3 lines, one slow cityline and two non-stop express lines. I toook the express line into Praya Thai station which connected straight to the Skytrain. No hassels here with both elevators and escalators. It is only when you board the Skytrain you are in for overcrowded cars, and when arriving at the final destination, lots of stairs taking you down to the street level. Thus not very convenient with heavy suitcases. The airport train is clean and fast, only 17 mins from Praya Thai to the airport, runs every 30 mins (00 and 30 from Praya Thai) and is very inexpensive. From the moment I left the lobby at my hotel (Novotel Ploenchit) and to my arrival at the airport, only a total ca. 45 mins including Skytrain, connection time and travel on the airport train, and a ca. THB 50 spent on this journey. Will use again, 'cause as the saying goes: \"If any sight in Bangkok cannot be reached by neither train nor boat, then it is probably not worth visiting!\"."

            "review": "Not much of a convenience!!!!. I will be the few ones to give a poor rating to this service - the reasons are many. I will lest them in no particular order.- Bangkok severely needs to expand its mass transit system for its growing urban population. Instead of building this airport link they could have used that money to expand its three existing lines or added a fourth one connecting to northern suburbs like Rangist or eastern suburb like Pinklao . Occasional tourists on the other hand can always take taxis and there are better off taking it anyway which I will expand below.-Even for tourists this railway link really doesn\u2019t offer much convenience or time savings. Because Bangkok is big and not all the suburbs and hotels are connected with subway or sky train link. One may end up of taking taxi after getting of this railway link anyway. And most of the traffic jam is within the heart of the city so this railway link really doesn\u2019t same that much time. Getting to heart of Bangkok from airport on this airport link vs. taking a taxi is about the same duration if you consider the time to wait for the train, getting on and getting off.- This airport link seem to be best suited for business travelers with hardly any luggage and who live near the link routes or sky train or subway lines.- While most of skytrain have escalators around Bangkok not this airport link. Which beats me. You would think that they would have designed this with tourists in mind that travel with more luggage than the daily mass transit people and would add escalators on every station. When you get off at Phaya Thai station it\u2019s a zoo. The walkway beside the track on the station is not wide enough and usually there is a huge jam between people trying to get off and trying to get on the train. And again people getting off have to carry the luggage down the stairs. - If you get off at Makkasan station you have to come down to the street level and walk almost a city block with all your luggage to connect to the subway train.- All the stations along this route look like horse barns \u2013 dark and featureless with no windows or glasses \u2013 a far cry from glitzy Bangkok.

The Express train costs 90 baht and took 16 minutes from the airport to Piya Thai, where I was able to get on the BTS Skytrain to get to my hotel. The City Line costs 45 baht and takes about 10-15 minutes longer. A taxi normally costs around 300 baht, and takes about 30 minutes depending on traffic. It stops (for a minute) at a dozen stations on the way to Piya Thai.If you have a lot of luggage, a taxi may still be the way to go, as there are a limited number of escalators from the airport link exits down to the street level for taxi service to your hotel. The same can be said for the BTS, where you have to carry your bags down several flights of stairs at most stations (except Asoke). All in all, the rail link is a great savings in time and money. it can be improved with more down elevators and more trains during peak hours. I will use the Airport link, which runs from 6:00 AM-midnight, on my future trips to Bangkok. I can only hope that some of the improvements mentioned will be addressed."

As other reviewers have pointed out, there are two services over this line: a non-stop express service to Makkasan station (which may or may not be convenient for your destination) taking 15 minutes and the City Line service making a number of stops before Makkasan then continuing to Phaya Thai station where there is an interchange with the BTS Skytrain. Currently the single fare from the airport to Phaya Thai on the stopping service is 45 Baht and the journey takes 30 minutes.Both services leave from the Basement level of Suvarnabhumi airport. City Line trains leave every 15 minutes and it was just my luck to get a train leaving at a very busy time around 5pm. The trains are quite short and we had half the population of South East Asia in ours. However, the trains are air conditioned, smooth and comfortable.At Phaya Thai there is a direct connection to the Skytrain but there's quite a bit of walking and taking lifts/flights of stairs involved. By the time I'd done this with my suitcase then taken the Skytrain, I was quite hot and sticky. Not a problem, as I could have a shower as soon as I got to the hotel, but I chose to get a taxi back to the airport. The taxi fare was 400 Baht including the tolls on the expressway."

There is a ticket counter and staff were lingering near the machines if you need help, but it was a pretty standard system \u2013 select your destination, number of passengers then feed the money into the machine.  The trip was comfortable and the trains were noticeably clean and free of clutter. Coming from Melbourne it was nice to see a train that was not covered in graffiti and rubbish \u2013 you cannot eat or drink on the Airport Rail Link and that makes a difference to the state of the train. It took about 25 minutes from the airport to Phaya Thai station. The transfer from the Rail Link to the BTS was very smooth and well marked at that station.

Hope they have solved this problem.. certainly it's incomparable to the system in Japan or Europe.. but at least it's a good start for Thailand and Bangkok to provide a better transport.."

I wish I could recommend this but that will have to wait until they install more escalator connections and other amenities. Taxis are low cost and they use compressed natural gas-- so at least they are low contributors to hydrocarbon pollution. One day this rail link will be a complete implementation."

This felt like a long-distance train.I highly recommend using the airport link as it is fast and will likely save you money. However the airport link is not a good idea under the following circumstances, a) if you are a group bigger than 2, a taxi is likely better value, b) If your hotel is not near to the BTS and you have luggage, Bangkok is hot! c) you have large luggage, there are a lot of stairs, small gates for the BTS, walking...If you just have a carry-on/bag, your hotel is right next to a BTS stop, and you are 2 people or less, the Phaya Thai Express (non-stop) is a great way to get to/from the airport and the city. Also remember that the Express runs every 30 minutes (on the half hour and hour when leaving Phaya Thai)."

This modem of transport to and from the airport is particularly useful when traveling solo or with 2 people. Otherwise, I think a taxi starts becoming cost competitive without the hassles of the express link. For what it is I find it extremely utilitarian. It gets me from a BTS or Metro (the metro connection is not as good) to the airport and vice versa for 90 Baht with no stops. I recall paying 150 Baht in March 2011, so it's nice try dropped the price (likely because it was empty back then). Is it the most comfortable train? No, but who cares for 20 minutes. It's not painful or anything. Is getting luggage through BTS and particularly the Metro a pain in the hiney? Yes, but if you want it done easily than spring for the cab and stop complaining. In summary i would describe the airport link as: Cheap, simple, relatively easy to use airport link that is especially worthwhile for 1 or 2 travelers. More than 2 get a cab that uses the meter. Walk to Departures level to find one already going back to Bangkok and more likely to use meter since its more cash than driving backto the city alone."

Facts (from my tired brain at 2 in the morning):---------------------------------------------------------Cost: 45 baht from Airport to the very end of the line. It's slightly less if you stop at one the in between stops.Duration: About 30 minutes (I think) from Airport to the very end of the line.The Good:-------------1) Cheap and hassle free! This train is a direct train from the Bangkok Airport to the middle of Bangkok city. I've used it twice. Prior to that, I used to take the taxi from the airport, which used to mean running the gauntlet of taxi tauts and paying about 400-600 baht, depending on who you settled with and how much energy you were willing to spend bargaining.I hate the taxi tauts.2) Fast!Approximately half an hour by train, or up to an hour longer if you take a taxi and get caught during peak hour traffic.3) Convenient! Actually goes where it's supposed to!Unlike some airport-city links, this one actually goes the to the city and actually links to stations of the existing train line...ok, at the very end, you have to walk about 50-100 metres from the Airport platform to the BTS one, but I mean, thats not too bad for 45 baht! Think of it as exercise and part of the holiday experience ! :-)Compare this to the Shanghai high speed express- does end near the existing train line, but very far from city centre; and the Hong Kong Aiport Express where at some stops you need mini buses or taxis afterwards.4) Connects to the existing train line. Just check the map to see which station to alight, and, if necessary, transfer.5) You'll see locals!Most of the passengers appear to be Thai so you'll be getting the full Thai experience the moment you step from the airport.The Bad:-----------1) No luggage racks in trains. The trains seem to be regular passenger carriages so you just keep them next to you. Not a biggie.2) There's no escalator or lift at the platforms.All above ground stations in Bangkok seem to only have stairs between the ticketing level and the train level (there are 3 levels- street--> ticketing--> train) This makes it inconvenient to lug around suitcases, especially while the crowd is surging around you at the stairs. Still, everyone seems to survive. Again, part of the experience!3) Taxis.This next point isn't directly related to the Airport link, since you'll have probably transferred to the regular train line, BTS, etc, but it still is since it's a consequence of taking the Airport Link.You still have to get to you hotel, right?If it's nearby to a station, you just walk to it.If it's still a bit of a distance, or it's the middle of the day and it's Bl****y hot and even 100 metres seems too far, then you're going to have to queue at the road and flag down a taxi or tuk tuk.Depending on the time of day or night, this may take some time. This is the one advantage of taking a taxi- driver goes directly to the hotel (assuming they know the hotel- so many new ones have been built in the last few years I've found it common for them not to know it. Still, I consider it to be part of the experience :-)Gosh, I didn't think I'd write so much for a train line! Thanks for reading!!!!"

A taxi can take only 40 minutes to Sukhumvit on a good day out of rush hour. I don't have to lug cases around and its a airport to hotel door service.

There are two express lines from the airport: one going nonstop to Makkasan Station, where there is in walking distance an underground subway line, and the other line going to Phaya Thai station, where the Airport Rail Link easily connects with the elevated Skytrain. My suggestion, either way, is to take the Airport Rail Link to either station, then just get in an inexpensive taxi to your hotel. Most hotels will be closer to Makkasan Station rather than Phaya Thai station. It's very fast and comfortable and cheap, but if two or more people are traveling together, a taxi from the airport is probably going to be easier and only about 100 baht more total. Eventually, they will build some hotels adjacent to the stations."

There are two options available, take the express line (red line) which gets you to the city in 15 mins or the normal line (thin blue line) which makes a few stops and gets you to the city in 30 mins.I asked the staff there and was advised to just take the city line since the express train isn't scheduled to depart in another 30 mins. I paid about 45 baht (S$2). I ended up waiting for 15 mins before the city train arrived.The trip was quite fast and I alighted in Phaya Thai station, this is connected to the main train stations particularly the BTS. As you can see from the map below, Phaya Thai is already near the main tourist destinations such as Siam and Victory Monument.It can be quite troublesome if you have a big luggage with you since you have to go down a flight of stairs and then climb back up to get to the main railway.I was staying at Sanam Pao station, just two more stops so my entire experience was fairly convenient and fast. It's also cheap as a normal cab fare would set me back about 10 times what I paid for.Check out the photos here: http://bauerfan.blogspot.com/2012/04/suvarnabhumi-airport-rail-link.html"

This system really couldnt be easier and has re-written the rule book for me.In March I visited Bangkok twice. The first time i did just that.... Took a taxi. Immediately had the battle of getting the driver to use the meter, endured some dangerous driving in an old car with no seatbelts and bad air con. Had to figure out how much the toll fees were and in the end the driver couldnt find the hotel - even though i had the address in thai. Second time round i opted for the airport link. Finding it is easy as it is in the basement of the airport and well signed. No danger of getting the wrong train as the only route is to the city. I was staying in Chit Lom, which is on the BTS skytrain route, so got the airport link all the way to Phaya Thai station. The system is easy, buy token from machine ( in english) and walk on. The train is extremely clean and there are no crazy people. the service is very efficient and fast. I wouldnt recommend this if you have a large amount of luggage however as there just isnt the space to put it. 1 medium to large case per person is manageable. Once at Phaya Thai it is a short and well signed walk to the BTS Skytrain network which is similarly effective. Well signed, very clean and safe. A few stops and $1 later I am practically outside my hotel. No stress of dealing with taxi drivers, dangerous driving and air con that doesnt work. There is absolutely no reason to take a taxi if you are staying anywhere near a BTS station. I cant recommend this enough, it is THE way to get around Bangkok."

            "review": "Bangkok City Airport Link a Poor Service. While either the express train or the local stopping train takes you directly to the airport in 20 or 35 minutes respectively there are long waits for the trains. The airport link express train leaves only every 30 minutes with a similar schedule for the city link stopping train. On the city link there is no room for storing luggage and even the airport link has limited storage capacity in the carriages. A promised luggage car in which luggage would be stored and transported to the airport has not materialised.The connection to the BTS Phyathai station while easy to navigate the BTS Skytrains are designed and intended for people carriage only. So bulky cases cause a nuisance to other passengers on the often very full Skytrains. One then has to negotiate the few escalators and steps to the pavement level.The Airport link station at Makasan does not connect to any other transport system, not buses, underground trains nor the Skytrain and one either has to tramp across some pretty rough ground and a four-lane road or railway line to get to Petchburi Road metro station or get one of the few taxis from the Makasan terminal.The terminal itself is large and mainly empty because it is underused. There is a flight check in area but only one airline uses the facility, even though it was designed for many more airlines. This again is underused and hardly worth the bother. From the ground concourse level to the platform there are only one or two escalators and lift(s) meaning that most people will carry heavy luggage up three flights of stairs to the platforms.All in all this facility is not worth using because of its inconvenient location and dearth of facilities. The last time I used it the one-way fare from the airport was 150 baht and the taxi to Silom Road in the centre of Bangkok was another 100+ baht. A taxi from the airport to my home would get me there in about the same time and cost a similar amount.A very poor, badly planned facility for a busy city like Bangkok."

All of them take different amount of times and stop in different places to help cover all areas of town. I was going to hualangmanphu train station so I took the yellow express line all the way the penchenaburi stop, walked outside for about 5 min across the street (sign posted) to the MRT station that then took me all the way to my destination. I am not saying the system is foolproof, and I did have to ask for directions but it is a normal form of transport and safe. The transport from airport to train station took about a half hour.

I see no point paying 150B for the express that takes 15 minutes to reach its destinationOnce at Phraya Thai I would use the lift to take you down a level. It is a bit of a trek across the platforms. Depending on where you are staying in Bangkok you may wish to take a taxi from Phaya Thai if your hotel is not near a BTS stop.

The Express only goes to Makkasan station (close to city) takes 13 minutes and runs a suburban style train (proper seating and luggage areas). The Siemens trains travel up to 160 Km/h and are smooth running on the elevated tracks. The City line stations are not particularly designed for travellers with luggage but link up with other city rail transport including BTS (SkyTrain) and MRT (subway/Metro). The Express line ends at Makkasan station, which is a large terminal style building (almost deserted on my visit), is designed for travellers with lifts and waiting areas, although strangely no seats on the platform and the station has nothing useful nearby, but only a few Km from hotels. Tickets are cheap, and cheaper than a taxi even with a few travellers. Makkasan also offers check in for Thai Airlines only (not tried), and is apparently close to Metro station (not used). There were limit number of Taxi waiting and we Taxi didn't like to take you there, obviously preferring to take you to the Airport themselves. So be very clear in the instructions that it is Airport Link Makkasan and not the Airport itself.

When at the ferries near the royal palace, they will often target you for 500 THB klong tours. These trips last 30 -45 minutes and are total rip-off. You can go from the ferry near Khao san road or the palace all the way up north to Pak Kred and back for about 70-80 THB, And that's almost a 2 hour round trip. More bang for buck you're not going to get in BKK."

Great way to explore the city, we got one way ticket for 40BT, they don't have much change so make sure you have some small notes as it took them ages to change a 1000TB note. We got on the orange flag express boat from Sathorn (central pier) at 5.30pm to watch the sun go down on the river. There is another tourist boat on the river as the orange express is also a commuter boat, but i found that we got to see everything we wanted and if you have red any of the main travel guides, you'll already know the Grand Palace and main temples etc. We hopped off and walked to Khao San Road (to very quickly tick a box - it wasn't great, very tacky) and then headed into China Town for a fantastic meal. you can buy a pass for the river boats which means you can hop on and off all day for 150BT which would be a nice way to get around as a lot of the main attractions (The Grand Palace, the flower market, Asiatique market etc are on this route)"

Most of the boats do have plastic splash guards in place especially for the seats in the front, to protect against getting splashed, especially during windy or stormy times! There are also usually plastic 'curtains' to unroll for really rainy+windy times! The ticket ladies stroll through the boat collecting fares, seeming to remember who's boarded since her last time 'round-- and is quickly abke to give change. They will also tell you how many stops to where you want to go, and frequently will alert you when approaching your stop !  The river boat express definitely provides that extra link in the transportation scheme of Bangkok, as well as giving one fresh air, a chance to see the sights along the river, many foto opportunities, and occasionally the sight of a large lizard-tyoe creature, living among the growing river-plants, near the docks (they are far enough away to do no harm!) For those folks with plenty of time, there are also the TOUR BOATS of the Chao Praya, with a guide spouting information as the boat cruises along.. Also plying the river are the Sunset-Dinner-Cruise Boats, fully decked-out in lights ! Remember to check out the Canal Boats, for a whole other experience!!"

If its hot you get screwed.From there hire a tuk tuk and they they in 2 hrs show you around all the other points. Much much better. even in hot weather you will have better exp.EVEN better is to book the orange boat ticket thats just 15 BHT.

Anyway the regular ORANGE flag boat is great and worth paying a dozen times for the amazing view you get BUT I would say out of respect for the locals who use this to get to work, try to avoid rush hours, early morning till 9am and evening 5pm on. Otherwise I would say this is a MUST DO thing in Bangkok :) If possible get off and book dinner opposite Wat Arun (Arun Temple) and watch the sunset and beautiful temple views, truly majestic and unforgettable :) Note: The very last stop doesn't have much, except for a local temple and a few shops, 7-11, so no need to spend time looking for a hidden treasure, there are non there :)"

I will admit when we asked the information booth the best way to get there they suggested the blue tourist boat but the orange boat is cheaper and takes less stops to get there. We went around 9:30am and waited ten minutes for the boat to arrive. After being picked up we soon realized why they call it and express boat. At every stop people who are getting off walk towards the back before docking so they could scurry off while passengers waiting to board quickly jump on and off the boat goes towards the next stop. Unless you're on the side of the boat that docks or you're familiar with the route you won't know which pier they're stopping at because there's no signs or announcement of what pier they're stopped at. Even at some of the piers we weren't able to see a sign clearly displaying the name of the stop. When we got to Wat Pho we nearly missed getting off but I was able to hear the attendant standing on the dock announce our location and luckily we were already at the back so we were able to quickly jump off. Going back towards central pier was equally confusing. We went back to the dock but there weren't any signs telling us where to que so we walked down where we saw people waiting. After standing for a few minutes a man working there yelled for everyone to go back up to the pier and wait. It took another twenty minutes for a return boat to arrive and as we waited we saw a few more people who were as confused as we were waking down to the floating dock only to screamed at to go back up and wait. Once back on the boat it was the same story of us frantically looking at every stop to see where we are to get off. But there was a local we must've saw the lost looks on our faces because he asked us where we were getting off and let us know when we were arriving to our destination."

There are many types of boat separated by the flag behind the boat. The local one which stops at all pier is the one with no flag.

Moreover, asking the dock workers for information can lead to some very rude behavior...they are not always very nice! I have had a dock worker actually yell at me to get on (or off) a boat, and give me the kind of glare that would (in a bar) provoke a fight.

The boats are very long and the way they coordinate landing at docks is pretty impressive. You also get a unique view of various temples and buildings along the river. However, I made the mistake of standing at the back of the boat (it was pretty full) and was surprised at the amount of black smoke these boats produce, especially during the docking procedure. They only stay at a dock for a few minutes max and they need to keep the engined revving to keep the boat parallel to the dock as passengers load/unload. Do yourself a favor and sit inside towards the front of the boat unless you want to inhale huge amounts of black pollution!Overall, a great way to get up and down the river.

Okay, this can be difficult to figure out initially, so I have laid out the steps as clearly as possible:Things to expect:Nothing will be marked at the pier, probably. No timetables, no indication that the boat is coming. There were times listed for hours of operation, but they were wrong. Sometimes one side of the pier is for private long-tail boats, while the other is the regular ferry. Make sure you are on the right side.1) Just know the direction you are going and get on the appropriate boat. The boat doesn't really matter, provided that it stops at your location (there is a map on the wall showing which boats stop where). If you are going to the main tourist area, all boats will stop there.2) You are expected to hop on quickly and the boat guys will bark at you if you are dawdling or trying to wait for a friend. Don't be that person, just get on the boat. This is public transportation for Thais trying to get to work, not your personal shuttle.3) You pay onboard. There will be a lady shaking a can at you and you pay anywhere from 4-10 Baht. Have some change or small bills.4) The piers have clearly displayed signs. Be ready to disembark as the boat pulls up, as in be near the stairs or railing.It's a little hectic, but better than two train transfers or sitting in traffic in a taxi. Once you figure it out, it's a breeze, but we saw many tourists trying to ask the boat guys questions or dawdling or wandering the piers looking confused. Just get on, pay, and get off."

It is a short walk from the BTS to the Express Boat Terminal (just head towards the water).  The Express Boat is a good way to get across, up, or down the river without crossing the bridges. This gives you access to western Metro Bangkok Areas. There are also many temples on the banks of the Chao Phraya River worth seeing and this a very efficient way to do it.  There are actually several boat companies operating on the river. You can tell the difference by the color of flag they fly. I remember one is orange and one is blue. Each company has a different ticket and price. Take a little time to ready the boards and looking around before you buy the ticket or hop on a boat. After a couple of rides it become second nature."

I made the mistake of taking the local 14 THB-boat from Saphan Taksin to Wat Pho on a Saturday afternoon. It was extremely crowded, there were no more empty seats, and so I had to stand in a very tight space. I was wearing an unzipped under-the-arm bag and later after the ride, I found that my wallet was missing. I suspect that the old - harmless-looking (!!) - man that was standing very close to me on the boat actually reached for it inside of my bag without me noticing. In summary: the boat ride is a very cheap and relatively fast way to commute in the areas that are not covered by the BTS and MRT, BUT accordingly it gets very busy on the weekends and utmost caution with your belongings (avoid carrying around valuables and large sums of cash) is more than advisable, especially since there are no cameras on the boat to identify thieves.."

The Chao Phrya River Is a busy and fascinating waterway and in Bangkok many of the things tourists want to see are beside it or close to it, and it's sensible to use the network of public transport boats - effectively river buses - to get to them. So why not the waterborne version of the \u201chop on, hop off\u201d open top bus tours you find in so many cities? That\u2019s what the Chao Phrya Tourist Boat is \u2013 a river bus (like many that ply regular service on the river) that calls at the piers where there\u2019s something of tourist interest, with a day ticket (and a helpful little brochure, and a live guide).But in practice it gave us a frustrating day. Getting off and sightseeing was no problem, but it was really annoying to stand waiting for a pick-up only to see the boat sail past, not once but twice! It appears that unless there\u2019s someone on the boat who wants to get off at that pier then the boat doesn\u2019t stop. Eventually we made our way to another pier where one of the big attractions meant the boat was bound to have someone to let off.Frustrating, annoying and time-wasting, all in the heat and humidity of Bangkok. My advice \u2013 check with the tourist literature or your hotel concierge which boats (water buses) of the regular network serve the pier you want to go to and go that way instead. It\u2019ll be cheaper too."

In reality, this is not that pricey. The luxury of the BLUE tourist express boat is that there is an English recording telling you about the different attractions during your ride. However, wanting to feel more like one of the locals my husband and I opted for the ORANGE FLAG boat which was only 14 THB per person per ride. Ultimately, both boats lead to the same stops. If you want to visit the major tourist sites, then get off at the N8 Tha Tien stop where you will be right next to Wat Pho. The Grand Palace is within walking distance, so you won't need to board the express boat again to get there.Additionally, this stop/pier is also the one you want to use to take a ferry boat across the river to visit Wat Arun for 3 THB/person.That being said you really only need one roundtrip unless you intend to make other stops."

Don't bother with the tourist boat (blue) - its 40THB per trip and only covers half the distance. Orange is the way to go. We took the ferry each way to the end of the route and were able to see a lot of Bangkok landmarks together with a random collection of houses and saw a bit of how the locals live. All the way to the North (station 30) we recommend to get out and have a walk along the market street (cheapest everything we have found in Bangkok) and an excellent cheap bakery on the left hand side. Some stops along the way they have catfish feeding which is an unexpected sight to see (stop 30 and 15, maybe others too)."

I started at the Saphan Taksin Station next to the Shangri-La Hotel, and used it to visit Khao San Road, the Wat Pho, Chinatown, and River City. The sights along the river are worth the ride in itself. Make sure to look for the light blue flag and attendants in light blue shirts at the stations (they are excellent when it comes to advice).

This fleet of boats plies up and down the river, stopping at piers and taking on and dropping off passengers, just like a bus. They have several different lines of boats running, all distinguished by colored flags. It can be inexpensive to travel on: from the BTS station at Central pier to Tah Tien pier (Wat Pho) is 14 baht on the right boat. Inexpensive, that is, unless you get ripped off. This company will gladly rip you off for the mistake of asking them simple questions, like, \"is this the right boat?\" Or \"how do I buy a ticket to such and such pier?\" If you don't know and have to ask, you're a tourist and will get raked over the coals like oneInformation at central pier is deliberately scarce, and seemingly designed to get tourists onto a Blue flag \"tourist boat\" which costs 40 baht instead of 14, the only differences being that the tourist boat makes fewer stops at piers, and has an English-speaking announcer with a microphone pointing out tourist attractions along the river. It can get confusing with flag colors and the service charts for the boats and which ones stop where, but if you ask anyone working there, you will be directed, not to the cheapest way up the river, but directly to the 40 baht boat. They will print you a ticket that says \"40 baht, blue flag boat.\" It might as well say \"sucker\" I suggest you take an orange flag boat, as they seem to stop at every pier. This is the real commuter boat, and is the one that will take you for a fraction of the blue flag boat's fare. What you do is just jump on the boat (make sure it's going your way) and pay the attendant when he comes around later. The 26 baht difference may not be much, but it will buy you a cold drink, or a snack, at your destination.Either boat offers an interesting look at the river life of Bangkok, and would be worth doing even at 40 baht. I just get the feeling that they take heavy advantage of confused and lost tourists here in a way that's kind of deliberately unfair, or else I would rate them higher."

The orange flag boat stops at every station all the way to stop no. 30, Nonthabury, all for the same price of 14 Baht. This option is good if you know exactly where you are going, and if you can cope with a crowd. Many locals use the orange flag boat to commute and during rush hour the boats can be really overcrowded. Ideally chose a time to travel other than the usual rush hours.The blue flag boat for tourists is mostly not as crowded, and takes you less than halfway up to stop no. 13 for the cost of 40 Baht. A local tourist guide will point out some sites and buildings of interest in few and often difficult to understand words via a noisy loudspeaker. Either way, a trip with any of the Chaopraya Express Boats is a worthwhile experience, and a preferred means of getting to places along the river without being stuck in traffic jams.Important: I always sit on the aisle seats to avoid an occasional spray of river water, and like most locals, on the shady side of the boat, Enjoy!"

We had two incidents in two days. On the first my wife and I were leaving the boat, and after I stepped ashore the boat started totake off just as my wife began to step ashore. On the second we were waiting on the pontoon waiting for the boat, but as soon as all the passengers exited, the boat took off before we could step aboard leaving us stranded and waiting another 30 minutes for the next boat.These boats are a good way of getting to the major tourist sites along the river, but they need to make major improvements in terms of health and safety."

I highly recommend that everyone who visits Bangkok does at least one trip on an Chao Praya Express Boat, it's such a great way of getting from south to north (or vice versa). There are actually two main services and I'll try and explain the differences.The Orange flag boat uses the smaller of the vessels, has one aisle, is cheaper (B13), is more frequent, is used by most locals and is always full or nearly so.The Blue flag (or Tourist boat) uses the larger type vessel , has two aisles, an announcer explaining the sights (and the pier names), is more expensive (B40), is less frequent (every 30 mins), used mostly by tourists and you can often get a seat.I usually use the Blue flag for trips from Sahan Taksin (Central Pier) to Phra Athrit for access to Khao San Road area, it's a long trip to stand up all the way. I don't advise getting the river pass (B150) unless you intend to visit lots of different places in one day.Please note that the piers can be confusing if you're not used to them, you need to know which direction you want to go and which boat you want to get on. English or Thai is really needed if you want to ask anyone a question, also the turn round times (especially for the orange flag boats) is surprisingly fast."

There are various types of boat you can read about online but most tourists end up on the tourist boat. I couldn't see any other way to take a boat other than this anyway. Especially if you don't speak Thai. The ticket table was clearly marked, the staff spoke English and were very helpful. Once the boat arrived, they escort you to it and help you on board. The boat has an announcer giving some information about things as you pass them but it's barely comprehensible. Just listen out for the pier that you want to get off at.On the way onto the pier there was some young chap who tried to tell us the boat was too busy, the Wat will be too busy now, it's not worth going etc. I am fairly sure he was leading up to offering to take up somewhere but I didn't give him the chance. You get some good views from the boat and see Bangkok in a different light. It can be nice having the wind in your hair too, rather than the BTS aircon."

My personal suggestion is to take the orange flagged ones (cost just THB15 for the whole trip of nearly an hour) from Oriental Pier (near Mandarin hotel - not well marked, need to check with locals the way) which terminates at Nondabauri. After Tier N8, you can see Wat Arun on the left, Temple of Reclining Buddha on the right and at the next pier,the Grand Palace."

Some of these reviews aren't really talking about the Express boat, which should refer to one of four different lines along the river, the one with the orange flag. They all run along the same river, so different boats could get you different places, but this title could be misleading if a review describes something else. A short run-down:-the flag is on the boat is orange, and it makes most main pier stops, but not as many as some other boats, it skips some smaller piers. a sign at the pier will review where it stops, or if you have access to Google Maps that will say it too, it just might be clearer if you search \"pier\" to bring up the red dots.-the cost is 15 baht per trip, which you pay on the boat. one review here said there's an option for 150 baht per day pass but I'm not sure about that. since that's 10 trips it almost doesn't make sense anyway, no way to get on the boat that many times and do anything but ride it back and forth all day.-it can be crowded, the main complaint, it just depends on the time of day, or luck of the draw, really. I've been on the boat for a dozen trips or so and it's rarely so crowded that would be an issue, but I've seen it happen a couple times.-the \"tourist boat\" is the main alternative, apparently with the main difference that people speak English on that one, and are better about announcing stops, and it costs 40 baht instead of 15 for the same thing. the Express boat seems to run about every 15 minutes so it seems like timing isn't much of an issue; I'm not so sure about the tourist boat (or which color flag it has on it). -there are signs at every stop on the piers but the boats just stop and go again so you sort of need to know where you want to go. Google Maps makes it easy because you are looking at a map with you on it (the blue dot), or you could just do it the old fashioned way and know where you are going. the attendants are unlikely to speak English but stop names (piers) and main areas they would know.-the Asiatique free shuttle leaves from the Sathorn main pier, the Southern end of the route, so you need to go to there and queue up again if you want to go there.-the route officially shuts down at 7:30, but maybe better to not plan on using it after 7 since that's going to vary by when the last boat happens by."

Chao Praya Tourist boat hop on hop off day pass is a great way to see Bangkok\u2019s river life & tourist attractions that is true and it is affordable too.There are different operators red flag and Blue flag (witch also appear on the boats).We used the Blue Flag operator and they were good but you are treated like cattle they should learn how to treat tourists. But never the less it was a great experience.On the 30th of December we bought a ticket for 150 Bath ea. (blue flag). We toured the whole afternoon visiting all the attractions.At 18h00 we returned to the Pier (China City or Asiatique Pier) as to be in time. They never pitched -up. We sat there until \u00b119h40.The Blue flag boat operator never pitched-apothem the Red flag boat came to pick us up.Now: We were tired, it is hot and missed other appointments. The boat were totally overloaded and 30% of tourist on the boat could not get a seet.Apart that it was overloaded they had no safety jackets for most of the tourists.They were angry because they had to pick-up \"forgotten\" tourist from there opposition company (blue flag).The man anchoring the boat at various piers shouted and screamed at tourists. The boat\u2019s captain speed at a very high speed and we felt very uncomfortable and unsafe.I asked him for a safety jacket and he shouted at tourists again..I then said to him not to treat tourist in that manner it is very rude and we are not cattle. He shouted at me and threatened to hit me with the anchor rope. I told him that I will report him and if he threatened me again will end upon swimming in the Chao Praya river .He calmed down bur were very agressive.He then talked to other staff who then treated me like dirt. The tourist on the boat was very unhappy about his aggressive behaviour. Earlier I saw a Russian tourist arguing with the same company from our boat the previous day and now I understand his concern as well now it was also late and the boat were very overcrowded. Thai Tourism should look into this matter as I hear horrible stories about similar fairy tourist boats."

We took it several times on one day and it was full / standing room only each time. If you can get a seat with a view of the river, and can just sit and relax and watch things go by, it is fine. No matter where we got on or off, we had to stand the majority of the time, so it was hard to see without bending over, and each time the boat stopped, we had to press ourselves to the walls to allow 40 or 50 people to exit and enter via the narrow walk ways. It would be better I think if they limited the number of people to the number of seats. I saw some of the regular boat taxis going by and most of them were actually less packed than the Express Boat. There is an announcer letting you know what is coming up next, but the boat is very loud, so it was not always easy to hear what was being said. However, it does take you directly and clearly to within walking distance of many of the places you may wish you visit. And the buying of the ticket, loading, offloading etc. is easy. After you finish looking at the attraction, you just head back to the pier and wait for the next boat going your way. And, you just get on and off as you wish all day. And, some may find it an interesting experience. That said, having used the service once, I am not sure whether I would use it again or not. Next time, I think we might just take a taxi, or a combo of skytrain and taxi. There is the road traffic, but I think overall it might be simpler."

Start your journey at the main stop, although there are a couple before, but the Skytrain stop at Saphan Taksin is the most convenient to start your journey. Rush on and claim a seat if you don't relish standing. Get a map if you can. There are stops all along with the main tourist ones being close to Chinatown, The Grand Palace, Wat Arun. You may wish to plan your journey so you know which number stop to get off as the boat only stops momentarily so it is not recommended for the disabled or elderly people that are slow! There are different flags for different boats/destinations but as a tourist the only one you'll probably see will have an orange flag. The fare for any destination is 15 Baht (about 30p Stg) The longest journey takes about an hour. It is worthwhile going the distance as there is a big market at the terminal along with more river fish than you can shake a stick at! You can even buy stale bread there to make them even fatter! There is also a Tourist Boat that goes to the stop closest to the Kaosan Road area. I think it costs about 40Baht is less crowded, gives you longer to get on and off but has the most appalling commentary that depending on the guide is either basic or completely unintelligible! It gets VERY crowded at times, quite often MOST of the time, unless you are going to the route end. If someone falls overboard, it happens once in a while, take care because everyone will rush to the side that the victim has fallen from with no regard whether or not the craft will remain upright! I give it 'good' rather than 'excellent' because of those sort of factors. Knowing where you are going helps as no announcements are made on the Express boats, unlike the tourist boat. The boats run about every 20 minutes whilst the tourist boat runs less frequently. You need to be aware of what times these craft finish for the day. DO NOT miss this experience, even if you just go for the journey, but it's good to get to places that taxis will get stuck in traffic finding. It's basic, crowded, tatty and great fun!

Only the orange express line runs on weekends during daylight hours, but my sister and I used to it to get around for a few cents. Weekday service runs later and is more complete. Look for the colour of the flag on the back of the boat to determine the route. Stations all contain maps. The only downside is that stops are generalliy not announced, so you do need a map. However, the ticket lady on our boat did loudly announce the Wat Po stop for the ubiquitous tourists on board."

If you have mobility problems - this is NOT for you. Doing this ride during rush hour defeats the purpose of having an enjoyable boat ride. You will be looking at the armpit of the person next to you.After rush hour you just might be able to take some photos of the river scenery - the rickety houses built on stilts on the Chao Phraya river itself, the longtail boats trailing fantails of river water behind them as they speed along the river with semi-frightened tourists, the barges towed up and down the river carrying rice or aggregate for construction, the temples and bridges along the river.If I were to recommend a ride, I would take one from Taksin Bridge and get off at Tha Chang terminal just off the Temple of the Emerald Buddha - Grand Palace complex. The entrance to the Grand Palace will be just a couple of hundred meters away.Taking this ride on a rainy day is going to be a downer. Best time to take this ride is between November and February. It is going to be hot and humid. Expect to mix it up with lots of people - both local and tourists like yourself.This is a much better and perhaps infinitely cheaper way of taking a river ride on the Chao Phraya River. Please avoid touts who \"offer\" touristy river trips. Those are rip-offs to be avoided at ALL COST."

Between each pier stop off there are sights to see on each side of the river plus all the different sized boats and barges going about their duties criss crossing as if there were no river rules to abide by. The ferry prices are cheap and you can buy a ticket from the central pier which allows you to ride the river all day long from dawn to dusk.Do not visit Bangkok and miss a Chao Phraya River Taxi ride there is nothing like it."

We bought an all day 'pass' which was quite cheap and it became virtually a hop on hop off ride. The experience is really fun, we got wet a little bit, got roused on for being too slow by the ferry hand, met some nice people and saw some great parts of Bangkok. Some of the river cruises charge 10 times more then you pay on this so it is a very good option."

The ride was interesting and is a must, it only costs 10B and numerous stops have interesting things to see.

Fresh air, great views and no traffic jams make this one of the best ways to get around if you happen to plan to go where the boats go or just want to try your luck. There are interchanges with the BTS and stops at major attractions like the Grand Palace. The only downside is that the piers are now also used for tourist boats in numbers by far superseding the normal express boats so finding the real boats and avoiding the ticket hustlers has become a bit of a challenge compared to the good old times. Also the flag system indicating which boat goes and stops where is rather complicated so I would advise patience and if you miss your stop, well, you are still in central Bangkok so a short walk or taxi ride will get you to a BTS station, your hotel or wherever you wanna go. Tip: avoid the rush hours when people go to work or back home from work. At that time it will be crowded and less comfortable."

If you're planning to visit Wat Arun after visiting the Wat Pho (Temple of the Reclining Buddha) you have to take another boat pay 3 baht to get across the river is not part of the Chao Phraya Express boat.If you choose to go only one tourist attraction it's 40 baht each way. So I think it's a better deal paying 150 baht that way you can visit different tourist attractions.

If you visit only these two piers and then come back to Saphan Taksin, you just buy individual tickets for each journey. It turns out that starting from Santhorn Pier is a good experience, but while coming back you don't get a seat due to overcrowding.

Pleasant breeze though with heavily packed with people of all walks of life. Foreigners and locals, both take the boat either to go to other side, or enjoy a boat ride, to go to different temples or hotels. Many people take it to avoid the rush hours on the street also. I enjoyed the beauty of both sides of rivers, the high rising posh buildings or shabby old houses, temples, people, markets, in day light and also at night time. The views are great. Certainly a worth try to feel the vibe of the country."

What is does do is offer you a way to get to Saphan Taksin station where a couple of flights of steps take you to the central pier and the 'express river boat' service. It is not geared up for tourists, do not end up on a tourist tour boat unless that is what you want, look for the bustling orange flagged 'buses' that speed up, tie up briefly while passengers jump on and off and then speed off again. On board the standard ticket is 14 baht for a single journey, sold by a conductor who works her way through the single cabin. Central pier is easy to spot as a destination, some of the others are not so easy but if you get the right pier all the central attractions will be a short walk from one of the ferry stops. The journey itself is a great way to see the heart of Bangkok. Once we cracked how to use it, we loved it."

            "review": "Fun on the Chao Phraya Commuter Boats. Taking a commuter boat up and down the Chao Praya is a great way to get to know the city and the river better; there are more than thirty piers in all, so it's quite a big system. (I'm talking the COMMUTER boat, not the TOURIST boat. The tourist boat is a lot more expensive and has a tour guide with a mike, which I consider obnoxious. Local commuter boats have no flags; express commuter boats have different colored flags for different routes, and the tourist boat, should you wish to avoid it, has a blue flag.)The easiest way to start is at Sathorn pier, which is a five minute walk from the Saphan Taksin stop on the BTS Silom Line (there are signs). Because not all routes go to all piers, it's best to know which pier you want to go to; Sathorn is pier \"CEN Sathon,\" but the piers upstream and north are N1 - N33; and downstream and south S1 - S4. If you don't have Nancy Chandler's map, or a good transit map, there's a map at the pier that shows the routes and the flag color-codings. Once you know your destination, you can go to the ticket booth and purchase a (remarkably cheap) ticket. I generally go north to N13, Phra Athit. So now the fun begins! The Chao Praya is very much a working river, so you will see barges with little living quarters pulled by tugboats, \"long tail\" boats speeding along, barges going across the river, say to a temple, instead of up or down, hotel boats, as well as dinner and excursion boats. Generally there will be a scrum waiting for a boat to arrive; and sometimes there will be more than one line, so make sure to ask the \"head mistress\" of the line if you're in the right one. (Saying the name of your destination, like \"Phra Athit,\" will be sufficient, and she will chivvy you into the right line if you're in the wrong one.) At last boat -- hopefully yours, and going in the right direction -- arrives! The process is carried out with great elan, even by Thai standards: The driver thumps the boat against the pier, a crewman leaps off, trailing a rope, and loops the rope round a piling, tightens it to draw the boat close, and then throws down the gangplank, onto which the crowd will surge, and then seek out seats on the boat. (At rush hour, you may end up standing.) You don't hand your ticket to anyone; a conductor rattling a cylindrical money box will walk through the boat and collect the tickets; and you can buy a ticket from her if you missed out at the ticket booth on the pier.)At this point, it's best to look out and fix some landmarks in your mind so that when you come back, you get off at the right pier! (All the piers have good signage, \"N1\" and so forth, but they are easy to miss if the boat is crowded and you can't a good view; and the unboarding/boarding process is very swift, so you don't want to be seated, deep in the boat, when you start trying to figure out where you really are.)The boats are festooned with Buddhist amulets, inside and out, and are very close to the water, which is breezy and fresh, especially when your boat crosses the wake of another boat, and things get excitingly choppy. (I have never been splashed, regardless, but I believe being splashed by the Chao Praya is comparatively safe, unlike being splashed by khlong water, which can be medically hazardous!) You will see gaudy hotels and vulgar condo buildings, but also wats, the Grand Palace, various naval facilities, riverside parks, restaurants, old-fashioned neighborhoods that just happen to touch on the river, restaurants, hospitals, universities... And of course since you are on a commuter boat, no tourists, and no English -- how pleasant! -- but working people, aunties with shopping bags, students, monks... Working Bangkok generally, going to or from home.And I like Phra Athit as a destination, even if it does have the disadvantage of being adjacent to the backpacker heaven of Khao San road, because there are some good restaurants there, and because the Old Fort is a good place to stroll, and very photogenic. Phra Athit road also has some lovely old-fashioned teak shophouses.* * *Oh, and the lines run from 6:00AM to 19:30PM, so you might want to plan for an early dinner if you plan to travel back down to Sathorn pier."

Avoid the long boat which is 1000 Baht. Move to the back of the boat before your stop because the boat can become crowded. It may be really difficult to squeeze through the crowd. There are loud whistles to communicate with the Captian by the crew in the very back. Sometimes smoke and nasty water sprays into the boat---yet I rate this a 5 because it is very cheap and efficient. Sometimes the peirs are very hard to find because they are hidden deep inside markets. I suggest that when you make it to the street turn aroundd and memorize where you exited. Sometimes the pier is through a beautiful large arch, that may be without a sign. Some of the peirs are next to temples. I used the boat system every day."

The ride was quick and there was a cool breeze coming off the river. It was certainly better than taking a taxi through Bangkok's notorious traffic jams.

The express boats are really just one \"route\" along the same path, up and down the Chao Phya river, along the Bangkok side of that river. There are a number of Express ferry piers and also more local piers, and four different lines of boats that stop at different places, more or less \"local\" stops. It's not as hard as it sounds, but there isn't much information or staff support at the actual piers either. If someone is trying to go to and from a main pier the worst case is that someone could get on a commuter version that doesn't stop often, and then might need to go back a couple stops on the more local boat.The boats cost either 15 or 20 baht per trip, which you typically pay on the boat, which seem to run relatively often, maybe every 10 or 15 minutes (but then again there are different boats). With even a little research it's a great way to get around and a great new perspective on the city (provided you want to travel to and from near the river, but there are a couple stops right beside BTS / skytrain line stops, and the main temples are near stops). If using Google Maps it's really easy because you just type in \"pier\" and it shows where they all are, and even on the boat you'll know where you are related to where you want to go."

A mild breeze made the ride highly enjoyable. Malls and cafes along the banks teeming with the holidaying crowd made for a pretty picture. The ride to Nonthaburi and back took a little more than an hour. We learnt that it is a cheap and easy way to travel from one place to another within the city. Dusk had drawn in on our way back and the shimmering reflection of hundreds of neons on the dark river from the adjacent buildings created a magical environment. The boat on our return journey was crisscrossing the river to stop at piers on both banks which was, in itself, an interesting experience."

Chao phraya express boats run up and down the river frequently and you can get tickets for 40 Baht one way or 120 Baht for an all day unlimited stops ticket. The ticket ladies and boat guide speaks good clear English and will tell you the age and location of the sights you pass along the river and also which piers are good to get off at to access other sights. (China town, wats etc) Ferries across the river are 3baht per person each way - some wats are on the other side of the river to the main piers.I got off at Maharaj for the Royal Palace and more. You need to be modestly dressed to enter the sights here - no thongs, shoulders covered and long pants - they do offer you free clothing to borrow if you forget. I walked from there easily to Khao San road - only about 10 min, along Thanon Ratchadamnoen Nai and e huge field in front of the university. Cross the major intersection and then verse left - you should see plenty of tourists heading I. That direction...you'll be at the head of Khao San road in about 1 minute.I had a great thai chicken and noodle lunch for 100 Bhat - so big I couldn't finish it! And a refreshing icy strawberry daiquiri (150baht). The Beer Garden close to the other end of the road - you can't miss the vibrant coloured flags in the massive tree centre of the beer garden. From there I walked to the end, turned right and then left onto the main road. Walk for about 10 min past the Democracy Monument (straight at the big roundabout), when you cross a canal cross the road (Thanon Ratchadamnoen Klang) and you will see the canal boats at Phanfa Lilat pier (look for it under manat thai Uthit Bridge) and for 9baht & less than 10min was taken to Saphan Hua Peir within 300m of national Stadium BTS & MBK Mall. (300m in the opposite direction from the pier takes you to the other BTS line - Rachathewi Station) This is how the locals travel and for 9baht you travel 1/3 of the way across townA wonderful day to get a taste for many different sides of Bangkok.

As said you get more of a chance to sit down, but it costs more and doesn't run as late into the evening.The orange flag boats at 40 bhat and you get a feel of local life on these mixing in and much more worth it.

The \"Tourist Express\" boat is 40 bht, while the local boat is 15bht. Once you know where you want to go, the local boat is absolutely fine and there are always people to ask for directions - the local ticket sellers speak some English, other tourists and other passengers are always happy to help. It does get crowded and you don't always get a seat, plus it stops at virtually every pier. There is another post that describes the different colour flags on the boats - I don't understand fully the different colours, but the local boat with an orange flag seems to stop at every location.Catch the BTS train to Saphan Taskin then follow signs to Central Pier. There are numerous signs advertising Tourist ferry, local ferry and long boat tours so just take your time and read all of the information. If you are not in a hurry just watch a few boats come and go and you will soon see how it all works."

The Chao Phraya boat is definitely a great way to get to many key tourist locations and in and of itself is also a great way to spend time, riding on the river that is the lifeline of Bangkok. The 15 baht ticket is for the local boat and can be used once you are familiar with the stops, as there is little warning of the upcoming stops. The 40 baht boat is more comfortable and comes with a guide who provides commentary along the way. Tourist destinations are clearly announced, though the PA system on some of the boats was difficult to hear. Having used the boat on 8 different occasions, I can testify that the quality of the commentary of the guides was highly variable. Some seemed more intent on emphasizing shopping opportunities, some went to great lengths to point out the 5-star hotels, and the best ones provided a very good commentary of the history and importance of the buildings we passed. The 150 baht ticket, on the same boat with guide, allows one to hop on and off. I never went with that option, simply because one spent a great deal of time at the \"hop off\" sites, making it less economically to \"hop back on\". However, if that fits into your plans, it is worth considering."

Of course you have to deal with the crowds and learn how to purchase the tickets and get on line, but it is definitely worth the wait .

It is best if you are not in a rush so you can enjoy the river traffic, people watch and take in the scenic views. This was one of the best rides we had in Bangkok and is a great way to avoid the horrendous traffic. There are also ferries that take you from one side of the river to the other for a nominal fee.

After researching and learning the routes/flag colors/how to get around using the river-taxi service beforehand, I found NONE the effort spent very useful. In general, the floating piers on the right as you enter the Pier buildings are for upriver boats and the ones on the left are for downriver, but this is NOT a given at all piers. Some stops have NO information in English and although I also memorized the stops by their numbers/what sights were at what number pier, the numbers were not always posted or visible from whatever position you found yourself jammed into on these massively overcrowded, chaotic boats. I never did get on a boat where finding a seat was possible and was invariably pressed up against some other poor tourist just trying not to fall as these boats banged into each other and the piers. I saw many confused visitors being yelled at very rudely by the staff who seem to take their authority as absolute. Tourists are loudly commanded-around getting on, positioned, and off these boats and the stops are not announced in any discernable way AT ALL. The first time I took the boat from Sathon Central Pier off the Saphan-Taksin BTS stop was kind of a nightmare and there were NO FLAGS indicating what stops the particular boat served. This absence of a flag can mean that it's a local, many-stop boat, but in this case, it was not a local boat at all but seemingly one drafted into general service and stopping arbitrarily. The staff were simply yelling at all of the confused people on the Pier to get on and ignoring people's questions about stops. All of Thailand's tourism is set up to process mass non-westerner tour groups, which are NOT the travelers who use this River Boat service. These boats were filled with a mix of locals, Asian independent travelers, and large amounts of western independent travelers. Even after many days of using these boats, I found them fairly unuseful both because of the wait times, but because of the complete absence of any information at the Piers themselves and the ambiguity/inconsistency of the \"flag color\" system. To get on a boat, it was often useful to approach a staff (if you could find one) and specifically ask \"Bpai __________?\" If that particular pier weren't crowded, sometimes you would be directed to a boat that would work for you when it arrived or you might receive a gesture for you to NOT get on it, so sometimes if you actively pursue the staff, they'll help you. In general, people onboard seemed surprisingly good-natured (possibly because they were only using the boats for one or two sights) and those TOURISTS closer to the approaching piers would try to help, in many different languages, the other tourists onboard trying to figure out where to get off. Even at non-peak times, these boats seem to operate at maximum-capacity and if you have a large backpack or luggage, GOOD LUCK! There's an area in the back of the boats where the staff might direct you to place your backpack/luggage, but you may or may not end up anywhere near your items once all the pushing and shoving is over. I stayed at the Phranakorn-Nornlen Guesthouse a ways off Thewet Pier N.15 and very difficult to reach by any other transport, so relied on these boats quite a bit over 5 days. I often ended up just walked long distances through the vendor-filled, uneven sidewalks and traffic to avoid using this river-transport. Please don't count on any English being spoken or printed at any of these piers or on any of these boats even though alot of the English internet sites seem to be saying that in Thailand there is lots of English understood and spoken.....this may be true for the high-end hotels, but definitely not anywhere else."

We bought tickets at Saphan Taksin for the return as well, but I'm not sure we could have used them in the end as they had an entry point designated. In the end we decided to walk to our next destination rather than find our way back as we were confused by the hectic dock with very little signage. We did make it to Wat Pho with no problem as we did hear when the staff person on the boat said it was the right dock to exit.In contrast, when we stayed at W Home, we used the \"Orange Flag\" boat. The fare on that boat is only 15 baht which is paid on board. It was cheaper and felt easier as well. I'm still a bit confused about whether they stop at every dock and whether you need to tell them or not for them to stop, but again, we made it okay and even found our way back on the boat despite the lack of signs.Be careful as there is definitely more splashing on the orange flag boat whereas the tourist boat had seats in the middle that were mostly protected from splashing.

The Tourist Ferry doesn't stop at every stop though but if you are a tourist, you will not need more than these stops. Glad that we took the Tourist Boats as it was a public holiday and the normal public ferry was jammed pack and wasn't as safe for kids and seniors. The guards/conductors on board were all really helpful and caring as they helped hold the kids & seniors during embarkation & disembarkation.The Tourist Ferry also has an English speaking 'tour guide' who explains the sights along the Chao Praya.The N5 (Chinatown stop), on the way out from the ferry terminal, the 1st steal on your left, they serve really really yummy flat noodle soup! The lady is teochew so most Malaysians and Singaporeans should be able to communicate pretty easily!"

Avoid the pressure sales from the private tour companies where you will pay 40 Baht vs 15 Baht and due to the far longer route will be able to see a far greater portion of Bangkok from the river while being able to stop at all the same piers and enjoy the top sites. Since seating may be hard to get at times, if you wish to have a best views and take some great photos ride boat beyond stop15 and then catch another boat in opposite direction. A trip from Sathorn Pier to last stop (25) will take about 80 minutes but is a relaxing way to orient yourself it sites while enjoy cool breeze as boat moves down river."

We jumped on the orange flag boat as we only needed to do one trip and it was an experience, as well as getting us where we needed to go for just 15B. These are no Thames Clippers! The guy at the back uses whistles to the pilot at he front to manoeuvre the boat, people hoard on and off at each jetty, and I will admit to keeping my eye on the shortest route to shore...Pay on the boat - there'll be someone obviously dressed rattling a ticket tin. There is the option of the 150B all day tourist ticket which I believe allows you to use all boats, not just the blue flag tourist express. If you have reason to make a lot of trips, or need / want to use the blue flag express boat then this will be the ticket for you. It's a shame really they aren't all a bit more frequent."

I would certainly recommend The Chao Phraya Express Boat to you if you wish to have a good look at Bangkok, the Venice of the East.How to? First, take the BTS and alight at Saphan Taksin Station, Exit 2, follow the sign to Sathorn Pier, the central pier for the express boat. However, be aware of the friendly staff at the pier. They will guide you to the tourist boat booth which I think is not necessary. You can take the Orange Flag boat that serves the same purpose but you save. Imagine 15 baths vs 150 baths. Both will take you to places except that the tourist boat is not that crowded. I recommend you visit Wat Pho, Grand Palace and Wat Arun along the way at one go. At Sathorn Pier, just ask for Orange Flag boat, the queue is to the right of the tourist boat. You don't have to buy ticket at the booth. You can pay onboard or the conductor will come to the queue. Alight at N8, Tha Tien Pier. Get out of the boat, walk straight to the road and you will see Wat Pho right in front of you. After visiting Wat Pho, I will recommend that you come back to Tha Tien Pier N8, take the cross river ferry to Wat Arun and then take the same ferry back to Tha Tien N8. From here, take a tok tok to the Grand Palace. Costs about 100 baths. You may just end you tour at the Grand Palace after a tiring day but please be reminded that you are to dress up in proper attire. Otherwise, you may be refused entry into the temple or the palace."

The tourist boat is pretty much exactly the same as the local one the only difference is a man on a microphone stating the obvious.With the ticket they put you in a different line that you are waiting 3 times as long for the boat. If you don't buy a ticket and line up with the locals a boat will come along near enough every 5 minutes. You hop on that one and pay 15bht each! I know how cheap i must sound but its not about the money, its the principle! I just found it very sneaky as there was no advisement for this and felt as if we were \" just foreigners \"All in all its a very convenient and gets you places you need to go quickly!

Bangkok roads are crowded - just about anytime, Between the Skytrain (BTS System), and the MRT underground - and the River Bus System - you can cover a great deal of the city for relatively low cost.The Chao Phraya Express River Express is a system of river boats that run every 15 - 20 minutes, and cover Bangkok with 30 plus stations - starting with Wat Raisingkorn in the South, up to Bang Po in the North. The river express system connects with the Skytrain - BTS Silom Line - at the Saphan Taksin stop, with Central Pier. From Central Pier it is a 15 - 20 minute boat ride to the Grand Palace, and many hours of touring some of the most beautiful parts of Bangkok. The best part of the Chao Phrya Express - 15 TBT price, and no river traffic.If you have the time, take a ride all the way to end of the line. It is interesting to see the variety of barges, speed boats - and if you go in the evening and catch the sunset, the colors and views are stunning. The boats use color flags. The yellow flag stops at all stops and covers most of the route. Blue flag is an Express, and costs 45 TBT - still a great value. So, if you go and take the boat, be sure you know which one you are taking, and look at the map to make sure the one you are taking stops where you want to go.Great transport system, great value and just plain fun!The boat route is shown on most tourist maps, and on the city BTS (train system) map.

Ticket - there are two main type of boat, one for tourist and one for normal ticket. I prefer to buy one day pass and with this ticket (pass) you will be allowed to hop on and off at any of the pier stops. So you don't need to worry if you get into boat that go to the wrong direction and also with this pass you can either wait for the tourist boat or you can also hop on to the normal boat (in case the tourist boat is late). I saw one review said the tourist boat not as frequent as the normal boat - well yes it is. But with the one day pass, you can actually hop on the normal boat too - only disadvantage is there will be too many peoples in this type of boat a no tour guide to tell what's attraction at the following stations. Anyway, with the one day pass, you will get a booklet on the attractions with the pier name - so use this as a guide.I would say one day pass is worth the price as you will definitely spend the whole day at all the main attractions which is all along the river. Also, in case you get into the wrong boat that goes to the opposite direction as you would want to go - it happens to me once (haha..)"

Overall it was a dry and comfortable way to travel.Inside the boats there are no announcements so you need to have a map and now where you want to get off \u2013 all the station names are in English and in Thai and the maps provided as well as the maps at each station are also well detailed and also in English and Thai. The public information available is excellent including there very informative website \u2013 once again in English, and the main ticket office\u2019s staff speak good English and are very helpful.There are different boats, which are colour coded, depending on where you want to go \u2013 all are once again well marked. Certain boats operate only at certain times and only stop at certain stations, so you have to make sure that you get on the right boat \u2013 the good public information maps and ever present staff are always there to help. There is a dedicated tourist boat which provided more information for tourists and stops at all the major tourist sights stations \u2013 you also get an information booklet \u2013 the cost for a day pass on this boat was 150 Baht per person. We decided to rather use the normal boats as it worked out a lot cheaper as you only pay the trip fee \u2013 for the two of us for the entire days travelling up and then back down the river was only 60 Baht with a further 12 Baht for two river crossings, a lot cheaper than the 300 Baht excluding the river crossings. You can also use the day pass n the normal boats, not only the tourist boat. Depending on how many trips and stops you are going to make, think carefully before you purchase the day pass ticket as it might well work out a lot more expensive."

Got told that the all day pass was 150bht & didn't realize that you can buy a one way ticket for 40bht or even cheaper on the local boats. I didnt think 150 was a bad price if the boats actually stopped to let you on & let you off safety. They seemed very rushed and one lady couldn't get off on time while her husband managed to jump off!!They also rushed off after letting passengers off but didn't let us on even though we were waiting right next to the boat!!! Awful service & long wait times! Go on the local boats!"

Get on a boat with an orange flag, buy the tickets on board for 15 baht per person. The only major difference is the blue flag tourist boat provides bad English narration. Be sure you know where to get off to see what attractions you are interested in. All piers are marked clearly with English signs. Ta Chang is where the Grand Palace and Wat Po are. This is absolutely my favorite thing to do in Bangkok. Sometimes I just ride to the end, and ride back. Great way to see the city and kill time for $1 round trip."

            "review": "Cheap way to explore a different side of Bangkok. As long as you do not care about narration, avoid buying the tourist boat pass at the dock, and just get on any of the non-tourist express boats (you can identify the boat from the color of the flags, the tourist has a big blue flag that says 'tourist boat', and it is a different style boat from the others). You buy the ticket for the non-tourist boats on board after departure, usually 10-20 baht. The orange flagged boat stops at all of the tourist locations, and charges a flat fee of 15 baht, so they are the best option for most visitors. The other boats do not stop as often, but you can see where they stop and what the fare is on the big sign in front of the pier, which has the route map. You would have to go on 10 trips on the river to make the 150 baht tourist pass pay off, which is very unlikely for anyone.The express boats are the best way to reach the Grand Palace, Wat Pho, and Wat Arun (you need to take a 3 baht ferry from the Wat Pho ferry landing to get to Wat Arun). Just take the BTS Silom Line, to Saphan Taksin, go down the stairs and walk towards the river. Personally, I like to go up north during the day, and come back south after sunset, to get a day and night view (just make sure you do not miss the last boat back). If you have the time, I highly recommend going all the way to Nonthaburi (stop #30). You will get to see the whole route, and Nonthaburi is a very nice area to walk around. There is a large cluster of shops, bakeries, etc right outside the ferry landing. A few blocks away is one of the most interesting outdoor food markets I have seen in Thailand, much better than Chinatown or any other I have been to in Bangkok. If you enjoy outdoor markets or food, this is definitely worth the journey to explore and wander around. It is a somewhat narrow and winding alley that is full of all kinds of fresh meat/seafood and produce. It is definitely off the radar of most tourists, the only other ones on my boat up just turned back around and went south, without even setting foot in the town. I found this place entirely by accident but it was the highlight of my day."

Just get on a regular river boat that locals take, and an attendant will come around and collect only 14Baht from you, giving change even. Tourists all think they have to pay for a ticket before getting on and pay 10 times as much as they should. Many even get on the wrong boat and have to pay again when the attendant comes around. The 150 Baht tickets are for the tourist boats with blue flags only. It's the same ride down the river."

            "review": "Very recommended transport service!. I contacted Notty through whatsapp and he responded quickly not like other companies. We are family of 7 with lots of luggages so we need a big van to accommodate our mobility. We book 4 trips in total with him and every single journey was amazing. Notty was truly like a friend who recommended good places and good services. Since I am taking my parents so we need to adjust some destination and schedule when the prices are set based on destination, but with Notty those are not problems. He is really generous. We are extremely happy that when we want to adjust our trip he did not always come to \"additional money\" as solution. He is happy to help and always asking if we are doing great with the driver. Mr Swang our driver was great, he always smile and happy to joke with us as well. He is also accommodating. At the end of our trip (4 trips booked with Notty) we left something at a mall and need to take it before our flight, Notty was really good that he allow the driver to turn around and take me to the mall when the price we agreed was supposed to be only airport transfer. I am beyond happy and definitely recommend all of you to book with him. Nothing should be improved since everything was good with Notty and his company. Good job! Will book again from you."

This company can be contacted via website or WhatsApp. Notty, the person in-charge, was rather prompt with his reply.We booked this transfer from airport to hotel as we wanted to secure a transportation that can fit 2 adults and children comfortably and safely. We were afraid that we would not be able to get a spacious taxi if we were to take queue for one at the airport. Price quoted by Enjoy Taxi is reasonable and definitely competitive as compared to some other companies that I have contacted. Price is inclusive of any tolls or surcharges.Our flight was delayed and we were about 1 hrs to 1.5 hrs late. However, the driver waited patiently for us.Thank you!"

We needed a transfer from airport BKK to Hua Hin (3h drive) and back for our family of 4 with a lot of luggage. As I have previously booked transfer services for other holiday destinations I have 3 major requirements:1. The car has to be big enough for 4 people and luggage (4 suitcases+4 onboard-trolleys). If you ever spend 3 hours in a car with your trolley on your lap you know what I am talking about\u20262. All seats need to have functional seat belts. Especially the middle seat in the back should have something to prevent that my little one flies through the windshield in case of an accident.3.The driver should know that he has to look on the street and NOT constantly on the mobile phone. I like Formula1 on TV but not live in a car on the other side of the world\u20264.I am always afraid that they might not show up or are late. Reliability on transportation is a wonderful thing if you have to catch a plane.Notty (he is the owner) and his company Enjoytaxi fulfilled all my requirements completely. From all of the taxi services that I contacted, they gave the second best offer and I chose them because he was committing to the type of car (Toyota Innova) while other taxi companies just told me we would get a \u201efamily car\u201c.The email communication was precise and professional, our plane was 1 hour early (5.10am!!) and the very friendly driver was still on time as they were tracking the arrival.The driver did not speed, did not constantly pay attention to his mobile, drove save and not aggressive.The car was in a very good condition, clean, functional air conditioning, not an old model. I would have preferred a 3-point seat belt instead of the hip-only seat belt in the middle back seat but I was happy that all safety belts were there and working.Finally, one day before our trip home, we decided to keep the car for the entire last day and they were also very nice and gave a fair offer for the additional time we wanted."

The next day he drove us to the floating market for what was a great experience. I hired him to drive me to the airport and was early with a cold bottle of water as well as willing to stop for coffee. I would hire Notty without question the next time and every time I am in Bangkok !"

Notty was easy to communicate, all via email and whatsapp. He sent his driver, Mr C (cannot spell!) who spoke English (approx 30%) and we booked a 7hr first day transport to wat pho and then to the river. Notty's rates are very budget friendly in comparison. Mr C picked us up in an Innova, had water in the car and Notty was able to rent two car seats (one booster) for us. Traveling with twin toddlers is hard enough and the ride was comfortable and safe. We also hired Mr C / Notty for transport to Safari world and purchased discounted tickets from Notty. There are cheaper rates online but I offered to pay more for less hassle with Notty. The ride to safari world was pleasant and Mr C took us into the safari park and made up time to see the tiger feeding. After the tiger feeding, we breezed through the rest of the park, all in less than 20min. It would have been better if we had taken our time driving through the safari park with a more concerted effort to slow down. Mr C did forget to give us our entrance tickets so we had to wait at the gate for him to come back. It was a hot and crowded day so that was a hiccup, however, I was able to take the kids to the bathroom so no morning time wasted. Overall it was a happy experience and Mr C was ready to pick us up and fly out of the parking lot. Note that this is only a transport service. No frills. The driver picks you and and drops you off where you want to go with approx destinations discussed ahead of time. They do not walk inside the market with you, eat with or translate. Mr C's van was clean, car seat installation and buckling had a learning curve, most of the time the driver understood us and you get what you pay for. I would highly recommend this car service for the price and service. Notty was flexible and very trustworthy."

Airport transfers: we used Enjoy Taxi for transfers 3 times using a big taxi/SUV since there are 4 of us with 3 big suitcases and 3 hand carry suitcases. At all times, the drivers knew basic English to communicate with us. Always friendly, respectful and importantly very prompt. One driver, Mr. Chompoon, offered us to use his cellphone when he overheard us talking about the slow internet (we use T-Mobile and we get free data coverage in Thailand but only 3G speed). Notty coordinated all the pick ups for me. I initially sent him an email to inquire. I gave him my cellphone and let him know I use What's App. He then contacted me via text and email. For my last transfer, I sent him a text the night before I needed the service and within minutes he confirmed it. 2 hours before the pick up, I asked if it was possible to move pick up 30 mins early, and again within minutes he replied and confirmed. For peace of mind that I'm not being overcharged, we asked concierge for prices for the transfer. We were quoted 3x for the use of the hotel service, then double Notty's rate for a private car company recommended by the hotel. Temple tour:Notty himself picked us up in a Camry (3 adults + 1 teen). He was dressed very professional (even in the heat) and speaks very good English. He recommended we do Grand Palace with Emerald Buddha and Wat Pho. Soon after our pick up, it started raining very hard. On the fly, he revised the plan. We went to Wat Pho first and told us to get a message while waiting for the sky to clear. Smart idea. We walked around on our own at our own pace. Then texted him when we were ready and he picked us up where we got dropped off. The next stop was at grand palace. We parked the car and he walked the palace and temples with us. He is not an official tour guide but he was still able to give us basic facts and answered our questions. He knew the grounds and having him there made the tour efficient for us which a made a big difference when walking in humid and sweltering heat. Notty offered to take us to Jim Thompson house on the way back. But the heat made us tired. We requested to be dropped off at the mall instead on they way to our hotel since my MIL just wanted to go back. Yes, I totally recommend this taxi service."

If it's one thing I hate in Bangkok it would be Taxi Rip-off, but as I stated on my title it is all about \"Peace of Mind\"; I have been all over Thailand and even for a seasoned visitor like me, I still get scammed by taxi driver, and for this trip I am traveling with my folks so I opt to go for a transport service agency and after reading reviews I believe I have chosen the right one. If you have read all EnjoyTaxi Bangkok review they are all about \"Prompt and Great Service\", this is their motto as explained by Mr Trai who sent us to Ayutthaya from Bangkok, What I like about Trai was that he was very kind of him to call me in advance to inform the that he is stuck in traffic and that is already a plus for this company. As for the rest of the drivers Mr Sompop and Mr Kasemsuk who picked us up from the airport and back they were all on-time and waiting for us at the airport and lobby. Really kuidos to your patience and service. If it's one taxi to take in Bangkok this company will be it. And Kudos to Mr Notty who will reply your message / emails within the hour, so if you are in Bangkok and need a taxi services for tour or business trip do call to arrange in advance as they are always mostly fully booked."

After a brief exchange of details, we were confirmed shortly thereafter. Communication was prompt and clear.Our driver, Trai, was waiting for us in the hotel lobby the following morning. He spoke very good english and was most gracious, and transportation was comfortable and easy. Trai was willing and able to deviate from the original plan such that we could fit in a visit to the Museum of Contemporary Art on our way back to BKK. This was a real \"bonus\" in our travel, we cant thank Trai and Enjoytaxi enough for the personal effort they make to deliver the best possible service.In our conversations with Trai, we learned that he was a former pro Muay Thai fighter who still trains other fighters. When he learned of our interest in the sport, he offered to take us to Channel 7 stadium for the Sunday afternoon events (there's no admission fee, so Trai didn't make any commission). We jumped at the chance to employ his services for another day and it proved to be the kind of \"insider\" experience about which many of us dream. Trai is impressively well-versed in all aspects of Muay Thai, and having him point out details about everything from the gamblers to the champion fighters to the general history was fascinating. Having been to Lumpinee Stadium (both old and new), we strongly encourage anyone interested in Muay Thai to seek out Trai through Enjoytaxi for transportation plus \"guided tour\" (for lack of a better term) of Channel 7 Stadium on a Sunday afternoon. If you can't book a trip with Trai, at least make a point of checking out the fights there by yourself. Not only is it free, but the competition is primo and the small \"stadium\" is packed and wonderfully intense. Thank you Trai, we will definitely see you again!"

Uber can be a bit hit and miss in Bangkok.Yes it's not the cheapest way to get to or from the airport but they are efficient, reliable and courteous and offer peace of mind that gets you to the airport on time and stress free."

We just wanted to see a few temples out of the dozens there and had done a little research. The driver accommodated our request, however, was very familiar with the most visited wats if you did not know which ones to see. We did not want to get stuck on a 6-8 hour tour with the obligatory candy making demonstration and pressure sale($100pp) or hassle getting back and forth from the train station.

Even though the booking was made last minute with less than 12hrs to go, our reservation was confirmed within minutes. Being our first time to book them, the 300bht down payment was a reasonable gamble. We chose a Camry and scheduled a pick up 2hrs after our arrival expecting that we may opt to have lunch before the long drive. However, since we were still full, I took a chance and emailed them using the Airport wifi requesting for an earlier pickup. Response was again swift, we haven't even gone thru immigration! We were informed that the driver was already waiting outside. Perfect! For our trip back, we again booked online the day before and we received the confirmation instantly. But this time no down payment was required since it was a repeat booking. What a nice policy! Overall, booking and coordinating with them was flawless!Now for the actual trip. The car was acceptable, clean but obviously overworked. The ride was smooth and thankfully we arrived safely both ways. We are not sure if the driver understood English as he did not speak to us and just nodded. For our overall experience, it would have been perfect if not for the following:- Safety Issue - both drivers kept on answering calls while on the highway- Drivers were in plain clothing and are not uniformed. I'm not looking for a fancy uniform here, just a simple t-shirt with the company's name and logo would have sufficed. It would have been more professional looking. Having any Tom, Dick or Harry carry a card with your name on it in a crowded terminal is not all comforting to see.Will I book with them again. Sure!"

This time all good from Bangkok to Pattaya, Pattaya to Bangkok Hotel Furama Silom, good car good driver but has wrong hotel, when we arrive at hotel tell him not the right hotel, stuck in traffic for another 30 mins while he finds right hotel. Then booked to pick up at hotel and take to Suvarnabhumi Airport for flight home. Picked up early thank God, driver cannot speak English MPV vehicle very average condition, onto motorway and passing signs Don Mueang International. My wife tries communicating with him and he just waves hand and says international Ok. after passing another sign I say 'NO Don Mueang',Suvarnabhumi. Car stops on motorway, phone call by driver, then the trek starts, back to Bangkok to other side onto the correct motorway and to Suvarnabhumi.

Honestly, it was Jo who made our day that extra bit special. He took me, my wife and our two boys to all the best locations. He was very polite, friendly, informative and helpful. My two boys (Charlie aged 6 and Ollie aged 2) really liked being with him. He helped with the boys, for example helping up steps and holding the little one's hands to keep him safe. Again, Jo made the day even more fantastic and he is a credit to the company. We would recommend Jo and Thai Happy Taxi to anyone. Many many thanks"

We booked with Thai happy taxi from Bangkok to Pataya and then another later in the week from Pataya to airport at the end of our holiday.Iwas dubious at first as wanted a reliable company but previous reviews convinced me to book online, (normally I would book at a higher cost direct with the hotel). I was really impressed with the service received beginning to end, you did not have to pay in advance and had regular emails confirming if still required and that driver (name) will pick you up. The drivers at both locations turned up 15 mins prior, although they spoke little English they confirmed my name and location driving to and we're professional throughout. I emailed the head office a couple of times and always had a quick response. The taxi's were clean and tidy and got me to my destination in one piece. I would definitely use this company again in the future."

It was quite unbelievable to see. When it wasn't in his hand and texting or calling he would sit it down next to the seat and he would glance at it constantly in intervals of about 2 seconds picking it up every 30 seconds at least. Mostly chatting on the app LINE (he wasn't using gps) all while travelling 120 or 130km an hour to pattaya. They were also the most expensive at 1400 when compared to pattaya taxi or cherry taxi. I thought the higher price and happy name might mean better service. It didn't. The car was nice but when you die because the driver isn't looking at the road I don't think a nice car will matter."

We have 4 people in our group so it's just right for a taxi to take us from Bangkok to Amphawa Floating Market, to Hua Hin with a return trip. Total cost for the entire (2 way) journey 5000baht. Yes it's quite expensive but it's an MPV that can comfortably carry 4 people with luggage and you don't have to rush or carry your luggage to a bus terminal, they come directly to your hotel to pick you up. It's such a relaxing journey. Our first driver is Mr. Phi (I hope I spelled your name correctly) who are very friendly and always smiling and joking. We stopped mid way to look at the floating market for around 2 hours and continued on to Hua Hin and he waited patiently in the parking area for us. We arrived smoothly to Hua Hin and felt refreshing and not a bit tired at all. Our second driver when we went back to Bangkok (didn't ask his name) is very quiet, maybe he doesn't speak English well enough but nevermind, we were quite tired and slept throughout the journey anyway.All in all, it's worth the money for these kind of trips if you don't like taking public transportation."

At first, I had a hard time to booked thru their website, so I send them an email, asking for help. 1 day after, I received a reply from Benja. He apologized for the late reply and he informed me that their website is down at the moment. So then I ask his help to booked for me our pick up from Bangkok Airport-Hotel.He replied fast and also patient to answer all my questions. That's truly a sign of a good service. He quoted me some prices and ask me If I would like to pick some of their tour package.So I ended up booking a private transport from Bangkok city to Kanchanaburi Province. This tour includes Floating market, Tiger temple and Bridge. But I choose not to have a tour guide. We just want a private vehicle. And this was enough for me and for my bf. I also want to give a good comments to our Driver, Mr. Jo, he is on time and very kind to us all throughout our journey. So I do recommend to all of you who wants to have privacy and good service. Take the Thai Happy Taxi. And definitely you'll not regret it. Kind StaffsGreat ServiceClean & Private transportationGOOD JOB THAI HAPPY TAXI!!!!"

            "review": "Realiable. I had an overall good experience with Thai Happy Taxi. We were two girls travelling from Bangkok airport to Hua Hin at 12am midnight, so we wanted to be super safe and looked for an established company for taxi service. Thai Happy was very good with keeping records and they responded to my emails very efficiently, and even sent us the contact details of the driver prior to meeting him. Their pricing is very competitive too, though they do charge a 300B early morning fee for odd-hour trips like ours. The driver picked us up at arrival on time and took us to the car right away. The car was one grade higher than what we requested and it was very clean. The driver was very friendly throughout the trip and at no point did we feel unsafe (we were two girls travelling alone). I had a bad cough and the driver even offered me his small bottle of essential oil and told me it would make me feel better (and it did). I really appreciated the kindness. However, one thing that I have to pick on is when we were within 30 mins to Hua Hin (it was approaching 3am in the morning at that point), the driver told us that he was very very tired which got us worried. All along I assumed that he was a night-shift driver who wouldn't be fatigued during late hours.When we got off, there was a disagreement between us and the driver on the amount we owed but the driver didn't persist and accepted our lesser amount. When I was able to check my email I realized I had paid the wrong amount, so I emailed the staff right away. They were very courteous and said it was okay for me to pay the difference on the return trip. We had a different driver on our return trip, who arrived at our hotel earlier than our pick up time. Again the car was a mini van (not what we requested) but it was more comfortable. He was a fast driver but it did not make us feel unsafe. We got back to Bangkok airport at around 3 hours on a Sunday afternoon. Overall we thought it was a very reliable and pleasant experience although I would suggest the company to deploy actual night-shift drivers for late night trips to ensure the saftey of your customers."

The driver assured me that this was due to the long drive back to collect us and that we would only have to pay the balance of 1700 baht on our return journey 3 days later. OK - all appears well..... then the following day I need to travel back to BKK due to an emergency and I spoke with Thai happy taxi who advised they could not get the taxi to return until the agreed date which I totally understood and arranged alternate transport. Then it came to the over payment I made - no refund, no part refund which I almost understand (but don't agree with) so I asked that the credit be taken to another taxi which I needed the following week ....point blank no!

I strongly recommend his service if you want to avoid any risk of delay and miscommunication (as he speaks fluent English, Swedish and soon Japanese)."

I booked Happy Taxi on line from England and agreed their quote (very reasonable at 2200BAHT). They communicated with me via email and I confirmed my flight details, arrival time, destination address. They emailed me to advise which arrival gate to go to (there are quite a few ). As soon as I approached the gate, I saw my name clearly displayed on a board held by my driver. Very polite and courteous, took my luggage, modern clean car with aircon and tinted back windows (stops the glare in the back) and off we went. Straight to my hotel in Hua Hin. Perfect, absolutely hassle free. I booked Happy Taxi for my return trip and the driver arrived 30 minutes early in a brand new 4x4. For anyone travelling to Thailand and not sure of how best to arrange onward road travel, Happy Taxi are all you need. Period !"

We have used Thai Happy taxi several times now since we moved to Bangkok in July and we are a very pleased customer.We got Thai Happy taxi recommended from a colleague of us who highly recommended the company.What we appreciate very much with this company and their services, is that they keep a high level of communication with you by mail and mobile. The information flow is great and it minimize the risk for misunderstandings. You always get fast reply on your emails. They always brief you by email about key information in good time ahead. The drivers are always on time, often 30 minutes before, so you never have to wait or be worried if they come.The cars are nice clean and in good shape.The drivers are very polite and take stops when needed and you not have to 'small talk' during the travel if you don't want. The price level is absolutely fine. You can for sure always fine someone who offers a better price, but the price is not the only parameter for a successful travel. We find that Thai Happy taxi deliver a trustable and excellent service for reasonable prices.There are no hidden costs for e.g. high way fees. The agreed price is all inclusive.We can highly recommend this company for your next travel. We will for sure book at them next time we need a long distance drive."

We booked a return journey from Bangkok to Hua Hin around Christmas on line using the web form on their web site. They responded quickly with email confirmation. In fact all emails were responded to within minutes in good English which gave me confidence. I supplied my room numbers by email but in any case drivers arrived smartly dressed at the hotel lobbies with my name on their phones. They didn't seem to speak much English but that was fine. They knew where they were going and the cars were clean and good quality.It took two hours each way from Le Meridien Bangkok to the Sheraton Hua Hin. Smooth ride both times.The company did seem slightly more expensive than the cheapest online companies (B2600 and B2300 each way - explained because it was around Christmas) but I would be happy to use again because of the reliable and quality experience."

This is one of the best values for tourists who want to go to a specific attraction and the drivers can create a custom tour that fills all your needs and is reliable and very inexpensive. To get this service contact the conserge at your hotel they will make sure you get the real thing. Be careful as many bandit cabs try to offer this service. not the same as the original. great value and very knowlegable drivers who will also take you to many great off the beaten track sites and eateries that are excellent"

The price was fair and the drivers were very safe. I would definitely recommend getting the next size up vehicle for a more comfortable ride. There was just two of us but we booked the SUV which was very comfortable and held all of our luggage. I will definitely use their service again."

First the driver didn't even noticed us at the hotel. He loved to speak so much to his telephone. The hotel bell boy went to tell the driver that we are arrived to the lobby. And the driver only open tailgate and still spoke to the telephone. And the car was old and lowered. After 10 minutes drive driver first time noticed us and say: Sorry. And stop the car next on the road and took another phone from the pocket and start to use that. Totally he spoke first 30 minutes to the phone. The ride was very very uncomfortable because of that old and lowered car. It feels sometimes that you are in the amusement park because car swinging and bouncing so much. Car was also very loud so nothing what Thai Happy Taxi promise at their internet site at the cars are new and comfortable.After these two rides I hope that if somebody book trip from Thai Happy taxi they will get that first driver, that another should go to the phone seller because he love to talk to phone so much."

Hi all.Hope this is useful to those who are planning to go on any day trips with any provider.* Need to google on the places before booking any day trips in future; as we had learnt this a hard way through our booking with Happytaxi.I've booked this tour last thursday (11 Jun 2015): http://www.thaihappytaxi.com/WebPage/TourKanchanaburi_MarketBridgeWaterfall.aspxhere's my feedback.It is impossible to complete the tour within the scheduled 9 hours. We spent more time in the mini van than sight-seeing. this tour is a complete waste of time. The driver picked us up at 8am at Centara Grand (Central World; near Siam BTS) and we made our way to the floating market. The journey was more than 1.5 hours. At about 10am, we reached the Damnoen Saduak floating market and started our 1 hour plus boat ride (at around 1015am) through the market. this was enjoyable. (end of boat ride at about 1130am). However, it was very expensive too. 4000 baht for about 1 hour and 15 mins of boat ride through the floating market. I suspect we were brought to a private pier and prices were exhorbitant. The initial price quoted was 5000 baht and we managed to negotiate to 4000 baht.We then wanted to go to the Railway market as listed in the itinerary. However, the driver was not very keen to bring us there; we insisted and he brought us there. We reached the railway market at about 12 and walked around till around 1230pm. We then made our way to Kanchanburi town. We reached the town at almost 315pm! It was almost a 3 hours ride. I didn't expect the town to be so far away. We then spent some time having lunch, looking at River Kwai and the bridge. Didn't have much time to explore as the driver told us that the trip back to Bangkok would take another 3 hours! We then left the town at around 415pm and reached Bangkok at 7pm! We didn't even have time to go to Sai Yok Noi Waterfall (as listed in the itinerary), which according to the driver, is about 50+km away from Kanchanburi town.The tour is a complete disaster. We paid 5500 baht to sit in the van whole day and we wasted one whole day sitting in a van. Total time in van is a horrifying 7 to 8 hours! As a tour planner (Happy Taxi), I didn't expect HappyTaxi to bundle places that are so far apart in 1 single tour and to estimate that the tour would take 9 hours? We wanted to explore and see places and not to sit in the van whole day. The only sightseeing we get is the river boat ride. We spent a total of 9500 baht (~282USD) for this tour and all we get mostly was sitting in a van. I think Happytaxi should stop offering tours that waste tourists' precious time. Most of us have about 1 week at BKK and we wouldn't want to waste 1 whole day sitting in a van. I would rather go to a shopping mall; eat, shop and massage my day away."

All on different days. I didn't do any price comparison with other taxi,I just trusted them by the good reviews. They were very prompt on time on all occasions. Good driver's behavior. They sent 3 different driver's on each day. Over all they made our travel comfortable. Only one sad thing happened at safari world,even though we arrived early at ticket counters, there was a delay of almost 30 min for the driver to get us the ticket, because of some communication gap between them and not because of long q at counter. This they could have arranged much earlier. My daughter was disappointed since we missed the orangutan show. Driver was very apologetic.

            "review": "First rate services. We travelled to Thailand in March/April 2015 and were planning on spending a week in Hua Hin. While we went down on the train (good fun I might add) we didn't want to get the train back. We looked into a few taxi services and we chose Thai Happy Taxi as they reviewed well. We were not disapointed. We booked our taxi a few days before we needed it and it was no issues (we did it online). We recieved both a text and email confirmation of our booking. On the day we were leaving we had a accident and my wife broke her toe. Our plans were up in the air as to when we could leave (or if we could depending on how bad the injury was) so I contacted Thai Happy Taxi to let them know. They were more than accomodating and just said, please let us know when you know. We finished changing our time for them to collect us 2 hours later than we originally booked. We finished up being out of hospital far quicker than expected, were packed and waiting in our room with about 1 and half hours to go before pickup so rung them again to see if they could now come earlier. No problems they said and were there in 10 minutes! Superb.The driver didn't speak a lot of english but enough to get by. They trip was uneventful and he even picked a good road side service station/rest area with loads of food options for us to stop and get lunch.We were so impressed we also booked them to take us from our hotel in Bangkok to the airport. I wouldn't think twice to use their services again. Thank you Thai Happy Taxi"

When I asked for a price for my trip I got an answer right away, they understood English well and also everything got confirmed within minutes. The driver was on time on the day of my booking, very friendly, the car was a better one than I booked, very comfortable. There was only one thing which I did not like so much, that was that I got the phone number of the driver only late in the evening and my trip was early morning. But the company did sent it as promised and the driver was great.Great job!"

The most disconcerting part of this service was the car which was indeed a Toyata Camry which unfortunately looked like a souped up teenager's car. The suspension had been lowered and it looked like it was scraping the road. You could feel every bump on the road which was very uncomfortable in the back seat. Also, since this servicef is not an official taxi, they could not pick us up in front of the airport. Instead we had to drag our bags into the upstairs parking lot where the car was parked.We cancelled the rest of the service and took a metered taxi instead. The car was normal and more comfortable. But the shocker was the fare! It cost 50% less than Happy Taxi to our hotel!!"

All went fine when driver Sonram from Thai Happy Taxi arrived 15 mins early and pick us up from hotel to the airport till we settled ourselves down comfortably in the airport lounge after immigration. Shocking news came when my friend found his mobile was missing and probably left in the taxi. We all thought even the driver was kind enough not to take the mobile to himself, it's no way to get out again, plus we didn't know the driver at all. While we were depressed as the trip ended in such a sad way, I suddenly received am email from Thai Happy Taxi and asked me to call them ASAP, as Sonram, our driver, had picked our phone up and had been waiting in the airport for us for almost an hour after we got off the taxi! After countless of calls with the Thai Happy taxi to arrange and the great effort of Sonram, we finally got our mobile back after 2.5 hours.I am truly impressed by Sonram's kindliness and his warm heart to return a phone to strangers like us, as well as the taxi company's effort to arrange for us. This experience, to me, is more than getting back the phone, but a touch of great human inner beauty. Here, may I express my hearty thank to Sonram and Thai Happy Taxi tour again and I for sure will recommend this tour to you."

I made an itinerary for 5 days with multiple city stops from Bangkok to Rayong and they were always on time and ready to go. The emails were prompt and easy to understand and they clarifed and reconfirmed almost each ride. The cars were mostly clean and the drivers were courteous. Good value for money and so much easier than any other transportation options. Mostly just get in and go with good planning.We also booked them for a half day \"tour\" to some temples and the Jim Thompson house. They drove us to each place and gave us mostly adequate time at each place we wished to go. The driver doesn't give any tour info and there is no tour guide unless you add on one which was what was expected. The problems we had were that drivers often didn't know the end destination and would frequently pull over to ask directions, turn around and go in a few circles but we always made it to the destination. The other problem was the half day tour driver asked about going to his \"friend's jewelry store\" and the \"great deals\" to be had there. It was annoying but this was only one driver out of the many we had who were much more polite. Be aware of this but overall a good experience. Strange tip but:The cars on the website have huge Happy Thai Taxi logos on them, however the cars are unmarked when they arrive so no worries about screaming you are a tourist upon arrival at each destination."

This was not our first visit to Thailand but finding Thai Happy Taxi Tours made this visit so much easier.Lots of people can provide taxi services but your standard of service has gone above and beyond the normal and has made our trip so much less stressful than it could have been at every stage. Plenty of clear details about pick up locations etc - right from my initial request for a quote - and friendly reminders and confirmations along the way so that all 3 of our airport and hotel pick ups went like clockwork. Quality vehicles and friendly drivers who were where you said they would be - when you said they would be and who knew exactly where we wanted to go - along with fantastic all inclusive prices which were more than competitive.With the number of tolls involved in and around Thailand the all inclusive price made such a difference, rather than having to keep reaching into our pockets to find the right change for the driver. For us it was just get in the taxi, sit back, relax and get out just where we wanted to be.I cannot praise your service highly enough and would recommend you to anyone looking for standards of service at the highest level and not just a taxi like all the others.Thank you very much."

I booked their airport transfer, as well as a full day chauffeured service within Bangkok. For airport transfer, I booked their MPV vehicle as I wanted a more comfy ride. It turns out to be the right choice as their vehicle is huge, clean and looks quite new. For the day trip, I booked the Camry instead and the vehicle is just as clean and new.The only gripe is their punctuality for airport transfer. I read from their booking website that it's best to book a timing half hour after flight arrival and I did just that. But the driver was late but just about 10 mins. Same for transfer back to airport. So if you decide to use their service, do buffer some time for lateness. The driver for the day trip was very punctual though. But a little episode kinda tainted the trip. We went to a temple for praying and when we were out to meet the driver, we were petrified to see the bangkok traffic police wheel clamming our vehicle, presumably he had parked illegally while waiting for us. We had to wait for the driver to go to their police office to pay the fine before the vehicle could be released.Other than these, the service is generally good, especially the reservation. As they will send you prompt confirmation and even email reminders. If you could afford it, use their service by all means as they are prompt, reliable and safe. Thank you Thai happy taxi, we are happy customers!"

It's not more expensive than others. I think in Bangkok you will pay the same or more for the same service. We have done just Bkk-Pattaya and Bkk Airport but intend to use them every time from now on, also for private tours. The best think is that you can book online, they reply quickly and in English: you know what you are getting and how much it's going to cost you. The drivers were on time every single time. Coming from the airport into town I've always used the public taxi service and it's been OK. And depending on where you are going, do not hesitate to use the Airport link: it's a fantastic service."

Dawin speaks excellent English which was helpful. The car was very clean and comfortable, we felt safe and relaxed during the drive. We were very impressed so we immediately booked again, and the service was equally as good the second time with another driver.

The vehicles were meticulously clean and driven in a very safe manner. Dawin also maintained a high level of communication , answering our emails promptly and making a cell phone call to us as we were being transferred to our Hotel to ensure that our needs were being met.The other nice thing was that Dawin offered his assistance should we find ourselves in need of help, which was reassuring in a city like Bangkok as you never know what issues may arise.As I said in my heading don't hesitate to use this company."

After going through the reviews and liaising with Dawin (TransferBKK), I felt comfortable with engaging his service for a whole day private driver. Though it was last minute, I had emailed our plan in advance. On the day itself he was early to pick us up at the Hotel and was very professionally dressed. His car, a Toyota Fortuner was very well kept and comfortable. As itinerary was sent over earlier he brings us to our destinations without any difficulties.

Since I knew I'd be tired when reaching Bangkok and didn't want to have to deal with the possibility of a taxi driver who didn't want to use the meter, I decided to pay a bit extra for a pre-booked transfer. Even though our flight was quite late, the driver was waiting for us at the designated meeting point; he then pulled the vehicle around and loaded our bags. Once I saw the size of the regular taxis, I was quite glad we had a larger vehicle to accommodate our family and luggage (I'm not positive our three large suitcases would have fit in all taxis). The trip was long due to traffic, but quite comfortable and our driver drove very safely. Our experience was pleasant enough that we decided to request the return transfer as well. Once again we were very pleased- the driver met us at the hotel exactly at the time we requested, and dropped us off exactly in front of the check-in desks for our airline. Again, due to the size of the vehicle, we had a very comfortable trip. It does cost a bit more than a metered taxi, but there's no hassle and no uncertainty about price. I definitely recommend this TransferBKK if you're looking for a transfer service."

            "review": "Great Service. We arrived into Bangkok at 4.30pm. Our arranged driver was waiting at the appointed Exit 2. We waited till he went to get the vehicle. He was very kind, helpful and spoke reasonably good english. Unfortunately traffic was mayhem, but we got to our complex in the end. Thankyou."

Dawin is fluent in English.Pre-arrival: My flight delayed for at least an hour and I contacted Dawin via Whatsap to update him on my flight status. He was very quick to read my messages and made me feel assured that the driver he sent will pick me up.Arrival: Once I touched down at BKK airport, I used the free airport wifi to message Dawin and he guided me to locate where to get a local SIM card for my iPhone. He also guided me to the exit location where the driver was waiting for me with a name sign. Once I met with the driver, the walk to the car was pretty quick. He parked near the exit area - 2 min away.Car: Very clean and air conditioned perfectly. Bottled water also provided.Driver: My driver's name was Aey. He spoke little English, but was able to confirm with us about hotel location. He also called Dawin to confirm the pick up. Meanwhile I also confirmed with Dawin via Whatsap that I got picked up. This was very reassuring and it made me feel very safe.The drive to hotel: Safe driving! The driver was focused on driving and didn't call/text on his phone. He paid the tolls on the highways. The whole drive from BKK to my hotel at National Stadium BTS was about 30mins or so. It didn't feel long because there wasn't much traffic at 11 PM.Price: 990 Baht. I tipped the driver on top of that as well. You pay upon arrival at your hotel.Final thoughts: I highly recommend TransferBKK's reliable transport services. It certainly may not be as cheap as other taxis, but the quality of the car and reliable service is what I wanted. TransferBKK is totally worth it."

Found TransferBKK on TripAdvisor and wrote to Dawin a week before our 7 day Bangkok + Hua Hin trip about an airport transfer to our hotel in Sukhumvit. Received his prompt and detailed response with rates. Through a quick exchange of mails, understood how particular he is - which was hugely comforting for me, because I am like that too. Like being buttoned down to the last detail. I had indicated that as we were arriving much earlier than the normal hotel check-in time, we would want to deposit our bags at the hotel lobby and carry on to visit a friend for breakfast close to the hotel. Dawin was there at the designated gate - in fact ahead of time, and undertook to drop us right till our friend's apartment including the stopover at the hotel. Right through the journey, he gave us great advice on places to visit, restaurants to try. I had by then made up my mind to use him for our Hilton Hua Hin transfers to and fro as well. On the next day, Dawin himself was there, again early, and he was very appreciative of our sticking to the committed time as well. The drive in the sparkling clean Toyota Fortuner was very pleasant indeed. We did the distance in 2.5 hours without any speeding. Even the return trip from Hua Hin 4 days later was a breeze, we were driven by Mr Manote, an affable elderly gentleman who drove us. Finally we hired Transfer BKK also for our airport transfer from Millennium Hilton at 2 am. Again at that time, the driver was there at the hotel porch, waiting with a smile to whisk us away. This is one caring company you can totally trust. Their drivers are handpicked, they do not subcontract, keep cars in excellent condition, are very well-presented and very courteous, and totally time-conscious. In short, professional and great value for money! Thanks Dawin... wish you the best in your business."

            "review": "Excellent service . Used Dawin and his team for airport transfer and a full day of Bangkok transport around town. Dawn picked us up (husband and twin toddlers) in his fortrunner with two car seats at 2am in BKK. He was there with cold water and greeted us at the gate. His car and car seats were clean and he drove confidently. We also had Dawin for 8hrs to floating market/ JJ market. He was very attentive with my girls and it was so helpful to have him with us at the crowded market esp with a stroller. We all had a wonderful time and couldn't have done it so smoothly without his translation and assistance as he is a pretty fluent English speaker. His partner took us to the airport and he even went back to the hotel after arriving at airport because we left our camera charger :( That was a nail biter as we were tight on flight schedule as is to Koh Samui. Thankfully, we made it though with charger and all and they didn't charge us for the extra trip.TransferBKK will not be an economical rate but in comparison you will get what you pay for. We needed a kid friendly person who will be with us all day (not drop off and pick up), flexible with destination, speaks fluent English and two car seats (w/ no extra fee). Well worth the cost, if this is what you are looking for. Dawin rates are not negotiable and I think it is fine for what he is offering. Highly recommend his service and we will be a return customer.

Dawin is also very responsive to any questions, comments or concerns you may have. We were able to adjust our pick up times to accommodate potential traffic from the Songkran Festival. If you are looking for a clean, reliable and timely transfer we highly recommend this company. Also was great chatting with Dawin during our transfers. Made the drive go by really fast and our daughter really enjoyed talking to him as well. He's very kind, engaging and thoughtful.

I contacted TransferBKK, just 2 weeks before arriving in Bangkok.Dawin (the owner) responded very quickly and explained that the Isuzu 4x4 I wanted was not available for my visit but I could have a Nissan Sylphy for the same price.The price agree was 990THB for each leg transfer.When we arrived Dawin was waiting for us and much to our surprise came in a Toyota Fortuner 4x4 and had cold water for us, which was great, as getting through Suvarnabhumi customs took a while.Dawin was very smart & spoke good English.We arrived early Saturday 5th March 7:30AM & Dawin explained that the roads would be much quieter than later that day or during the week and the journey took about 35mins.He took us on 2x toll roads which he had to pay 50THB & 75THB to use and during the journey he told us that his company also did tours which and quite a bit cheaper than what I'd already arranged and paid a deposit for back in the UK. He also told us that Khao San Road would be good to visit (but we just couldn't fit it in during our stay).He said that if we needed anything during our stay to give him a call, which I thought was a nice touch.On the return leg 9:15AM Tuesday morning we were picked up by one of his drivers in a Nissan Sylphy, who was waiting for us in the hotel car park before the agreed pickup time. The car was immaculately clean.This time though the driver didn't use toll roads and the journey took a while longer in busy Bangkok traffic, but we still got to the airport in ample time for our onward flight to Chaing Mai.Dawin called the driver and asked to speak to us just to check everything was OK with the return and a general chat about our visit to Bangkok.Both journeys I felt their driving style was very smooth and I felt safeIN SUMMARY, would I use TransferBKK again - Most DefinitelyMark & Kelly"

As we were travelling as three adults and a 1 year old, using the usual taxis was not really an option, with all our baggage. Also I was keen to get transport with a car seat for my daughter. I got in touch with TransferBKK via email and very quickly had a reply from Dawin, the owner. His organisation is second to none and I would recommend him to anyone travelling to Bangkok. We were there for a very short period and then travelling out again the following day. We used him for our departure transfer as well and then on return to Bangkok we used him again for transfers in both directions. On all of our trips, either Dawin himself or one of his drivers was waiting for us at the arranged time and all transfers were stress free. When we got picked up by one of his drivers, Dawin actually rang him and spoke to us on speaker phone just to make sure we were happy and everything was going well. They guys pick you up ready with cold water and an air conditioned car in great condition. If we had had more time in Bangkok we would also have used there services for transport around the city too."

I booked this transfer last minute as I was travelling with my parents who are in their 60\u2019s and didn\u2019t want to mess about with Taxis after coming off an 11 hour flight tired and exhausted. Dawin was waiting for us as per his email and brought the car round so my mum who has arthritis didn\u2019t have to walk too far to get to the car. The transfer was seamless and the car was clean so I booked Dawins service again for all our airport transfers in Bangkok (as we were flying in and out to go to different places). It is obviously possible to use normal taxis for transfers but on two particular occasions, I was relieved I had booked this transfer. The first was when we were stuck in traffic for over 2 hours from the airport and were in a nice comfortable car without having to worry about the meter and the second was on new year\u2019s eve when we were heading from the airport to our hotel and some of the roads to our hotel were closed due to NYE celebration preparations. Our driver spoke English, explained the problem and above all was committed to making sure we got to our hotel despite the road closures and traffic on that day."

Mr. Dawin (the owner) is a highly educated young business man. He is polite, discrete, caring, reliable, flexible, funny and of course an excellent driver. He and his team strive to offer outstanding transfer services in Bangkok and the wider area. Moreover his communication skills are the best you can ever expect to find in Thailand!My experience was more than I could wish for. The vehicles he uses are in perfect condition, clean and brand new. Air conditioned and full of amenities to make your ride even more comfortable. He replies to email requests almost immediately and his rates are very competitive. Excellent value for money, you won't regret."

I sent Danwin an email to arrange the booking for airport collection and then for hotel to airport transfer a few days later; I don't like the standard taxi stress in Bangkok. He responded very quickly. I booked based on other positive reviews and I was very happy with the service. He arranged a driver to pick me up from the airport and while in the taxi to hotel he called me to check everything was OK and if I needed anything else - he really understands good service. Danwin himself took me to the airport and we had a really nice chat. For a little extra you get a really nice comfortable service compared to standard taxis and I would certainly use again."

I booked this company for a transfer from Suvarnabhumi airport to Hua Hin and from Hua Hin to Bangkok a few days later.I chose them because they can do the transfer in a Toyota Fortuner - a large and comfortable SUV. I have driven this car a few times in Thailand and it feels very safe because of its size.We were met at the airport in the agreed location and the car was immaculately clean, quite new, and the driver was safe and well presented.The journey passed without event. The road to Hua Hin is quite fast - we were overtaken by a double decker bus which was doing about 140km/h. On the way, the manager, Dawin, spoke to me on the driver's phone to check that everything was OK. He also said I could call him when in Thailand if we needed any help with anything which I thought was a kind offer.We were collected at our hotel in Hua Hin at the agreed time and again had a comfortable and safe journey back.I would definitely use them again and I can recommend them without a doubt."

DAWIN @ TRANSFERBKK IS AMAZING!We booked Dawin for our 4 Days Stay in Bangkok (then added more airport transfers) before moving on to Krabi for second half of our vacation. From the first email to the very last goodbye, Dawin was very professional, extremely polite and ensure all of us (Myself+ Husband+ Parents) had a great time touring Bangkok and nearby cities. Dawin not only drove us from one site to another, but also accompanied us inside and provided in-depth tour of each location, its history and more! He made our parents and us feel as if he was part of our family. We were able to ENJOY BANGKOK and all the sites thoroughly AND THE CREDIT FULLY GOES TO DAWIN! I had a set schedule of all the sites we wanted to visit and he made sure we kept up with the schedule and showed up every day on time. He is a VERY SAFE DRIVER and knows his way around Bangkok and other cities - Ayutthaya / Phetchaburi / Samut Prakan / Ratchaburi etc. Even when we were stuck in Bangkok traffic, the ride felt short as he kept us entertained with the discussions about history and lifestyle of Bangkok.. We feel that even a hired tourist guide wouldn't have done that!He always went above and beyond to make sure we were Hydrated throughout the day, he even bought us a bag of fresh fruits as we were walking around on our own at a historical park! He surprised us with chilled water bottles every few hours and drove nearly 15 miles out of way to find us a clean restroom! Last day, he drove us to the local mall and he even negotiated prices / translated for us and alerted us when we were being charged too much. He speaks English fluently and was able to hold conversation with my parents and us for hours! We have nothing but great memories of the trip in Bangkok and really that says a lot about the service we got! 5 STARS ALL THE WAY!"

I sent an e-mail to Daiwin and everything was set-up in short-order. His driver met me at the designated location with a sign with my name on it. He also had water and a cold-compress for me, which was outstanding given the humidity. I was very pleased and impressed with the driver's ability to speak English and he knew where he was going. No scenic tours for extra fares, no tea money, no funny business. Straight to the hotel. As a frequent traveler, I really appreciated the professionalism and value afforded by Daiwin and his staff. Most definitely will use this service again on my next trip. The other thing to note, is there is good reason you are told where to meet the representative INSIDE the airport. I won't elaborate too much on that, but Daiwin is a very thoughtful individual who is well traveled himself. He has chosen the pick-up location wisely with your safety in mind. Enough said."

We decided to book a airport transfer prior to travelling as we had a toddler in our party and did not want to queue for a taxi.I came across transferbkk.com while browsing and what caught my eye was that a child seat can be made available if needed. Knowing Bangkok's chaotic traffic, it was better to be safe than sorry and fortunately all went well.We were picked up by Dawin (he's the boss) and he showed up punctually at the airport. The drive into Bangkok was smooth and Dawin is a safe driver, as evidenced by the fact that our toddler did not fuss in the car. I found his service so good, I decided to book him again for my return transfer from the hotel to the airport and that trip was all good despite some traffic in the city.Transferbkk maintains their cars well and the interior is clean. The child seat is also well maintained and was available to and from our hotel. Do make your bookings early especially during peak periods as they are not a very big operation. If you have any special needs, do put it down in your booking email.While there are cheaper alternatives around, I give transferbkk two thumbs up and will definitely make use of their service again the next time I am in Bangkok."
