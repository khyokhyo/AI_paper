You may either see it from he tallest building - The Freedom Tower, The Empire State Building, Top of the Rock at the Rockefeller Center, from Brooklyn in Eilliamsburg or Long Island City in Queens. In Brooklyn and Queens go to the water edge way west so you can admire the skyline. Beautiful at dusk too where you can see the sunset.If taking photos at night, best to keep the flash off - you won't be able to see the skyline with lights. You might as well take a photo anywhere as the subject matter is you.If you are lucky to have a friend with a rooftop or nice views - take advantage of that."

            "review": "Iconic. New York has architecturally significant buildings in a wide range of styles spanning distinct historical and cultural periods. These include the Woolworth Building (1913), an early Gothic revival skyscraper with large-scale gothic architectural detail. The 1916 Zoning Resolution required setback in new buildings, and restricted towers to a percentage of the lot size, to allow sunlight to reach the streets below. The Art Deco design of the Chrysler Building (1930) and Empire State Building (1931), with their tapered tops and steel spires, reflected the zoning requirements. The Chrysler building is considered by many historians and architects to be one of New York's finest, with its distinctive ornamentation such as V-shaped lighting inserts capped by a steel spire at the tower's crown. An early influential example of the international style in the United States is the Seagram Building (1957), distinctive for its facade using visible bronze-toned I-beams to evoke the building's structure. The Cond\u00e9 Nast Building (2000) is an important example of green design in American skyscrapers. It doesn't matter these days what building is going up the whole skyline is iconic. We were on a harbor tour and the guide had an amazing fact about all the famous skyscrapers. I could have stared at it for hours. If you are here then you have to do some sort of tour whether it is by boat or helicopter to see this amazing site, it will stick with you for the rest of your days."

The vessel l was on had bars, toilets & ample viewing points.

However, to really appreciate it, you have to get out of the city. You can do this from several different places. The ones I like the best are the cliffs above the Hudson River in Weehawken, NJ, Liberty State Park in Jersey City, NJ, a dinner cruise around Manhattan on one of the many dinner cruise lines, or my favorite, which is Long Island City, NY just across the East River thru the Midtown Tunnel or the 59th St bridge. In Weehawken you get a beautiful view of the city all day, night and if you are an early bird, at sunrise over the city. Bring your camera or iPhone. Liberty State park is by the Statue of Liberty and there are many areas to get great shots of lower Manhattan and NY Bay.The dinner cruises are not very expensive, and give you great views from the Hudson to the East River, so you get all the angles except from the North.My favorite is from Long Island City, just across the East River from the UN Building. If you are visiting the city with no car, this is the best place to go, since the 7 train out of Grand Central has it's first stop in LIC, and you can walk a couple of blocks to the waterfront. LIC is the fastest growing part of the city and perfect place for young couples with children to live if you work in NYC. Many great restaurants, rental apartments, condos, and public parks right on or close to the river. Again, don't forget your camera, or be sure you have memory on your phone, because you will take a lot of pictures. Oh yes, from LIC, you have a clear view of the Empire State Building and Chrysler Building and if you catch it right, sunset thru the the Canyons of building in the city."

This comes free with your admission to the museum (which is still pay what you want, but you must pay something)."

For great views of Midtown Manhattan I recommend Gantry State Plaza Park and Four Freedoms Park. For amazing views of Lower, Midtown and Upper Manhattan I recommend going to Weehawken, NJ!

The Manhattan Skyline is fascinating, for the sheer number of tall buildings alone, some of the buildings don't look good or look out of place, like the huge concrete building downtown or that new apartment cube by the park.At the same time it has some great looking buildings, Th Chrysler Building, Empire State Building, One World Trade, The Woolworth Building, and many more.As people say, it's a concrete jungle, so it can look great from some angles, ugly from others, but almost always great at night or during sunset (practically any city does)The best places to view it from, inside the city, is from the top of the Rock, Empire State and One World Trade.I didn't get to see the it from Jersey City, but it's supposed to have some great vantage points over there and it looks amazing, I've seen pictures of it though.Two other places i did see it from is the Twilight Cruise, it starts at peer 78 and takes you a good length around the island and past the Manhattan bridge before turning back. It looks amazing at night time, going under the bridges with all of the lights on.Probably the best place to view it from that I found is the park below the Brooklyn Bridge, on the Brooklyn side. On that side the Brooklyn Bridge and Manhattan Bridge are right next to each other, so you get great views from below both bridges, great to be there during sunset, it's a shame I never got there at night.Two other great places to view it from is from Liberty Island and particularly Ellis Island. It looks amazing from there and I was there on a day when a big rain cloud was hanging over the city, so it looked even better (starting pouring down the moment I got back into Manhattan)"

That said, the city is always changing, new buildings are transforming the Far West Side, Tribeca, Columbus Circle--everywhere. The classic 3 hour tourboat around Manhattan Island, or free trip on the Staten Island Ferry is one way to get a view, but three hours is more than you need for most of our skyline, and you may not need to take the Ferry to and from Staten Island, even for free. Here's my suggestion, should you be downtown, perhaps for the Trade Center Memorial. You will be at the start of the Brooklyn Bridge pedestrian path if you walk over to City Hall Park and keep going (you'll see the Bridge!). Just start walking. Within ten minutes you will be at the first, awe inspiring span. Stop, look back at the city. You could keep going, and you will soon (15-20 minutes) be in Brooklyn, where you can exit off the bridge and make your way to the Brooklyn Promenade, a famously expansive view of the lower Manhattan skyline, especially at dusk. There are subways back into Manhattan nearby. Another way to see the skyline is to walk around the Jackie Onassis Reservoir in Central Park (1.3 miles), at any time of day, and watch the changing skyline of elegant apartment buildings especially on the West Side (see if you can spot the Ghostbusters building), then the scrim of skyscrapers to the south of the park). Can't walk 1.3 miles? Enter anywhere and plunk down on a bench. Voila: waterscape, skyline, the whole schmear."

Be a passenger in a car on any highway, ride Amtrak, Metro North RR, Long Island RR, NJ Transit, any of the NYC surface subway lines from the Bronx, Queens, or Brooklyn. Sale aboard a commuter ferry from any direction, especially aboard the Staten Island Ferry. On clear days views from the hills of New Jersey 20+ miles inland, even coming down from Upstate NY or across Long Island, vistas are fascinating tens of miles away. Each time of year, each time of day, every weather predicament offers something different to see and enjoy. Coming down from Summit, NJ on an NJT train is great on a winter afternoon with the sun setting on the buildings for instance. Or from Jamaica LI on the J train as you zoom the picture in until you cross the Williamsburg Bridge. Amtrak spread things out wending its way through the Bronx and crossing Hell's Gate high above the East River waters enroute from New England or catching glimpses as your train winds along the east shore of the Hudson River until you are under the George Washington Bridge. Drive? NJ's Pallasades offers some close ups especially into Weehawken. But between the buildings of Hoboken, Jersey City and Bayonne in NJ are also great places (don't want to drive here? Then ride the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail line out of Hoboken Terminal for unque perspectives). I've done them all over the years and each time I go to a different place in the area, I see something different. Most recently, while riding the surface subway lines in the Bronx. What is nice, is that you don't have to spend a huge fortune for guided tours to see and enjoy."

What a city!! i loved it,and it lived up to all the hype.It just kept giving and giving.Im not sure what i was expecting if im honest but what i got was above and beyond.JKF i have to say was so dissapointing as one of the major gateways to this fabulous city.I took the subway all the way into manhattan early evening it was so cool and i have to say i felt safe.It takes a little time to get your bearings though.Upon leaving the subway i can only describe it as bursting on to time square!! wow what a place alive and kicking what an introduction to the heart beat of the city it didnt dissapoint.I checked into a local hotel fairly pricey i have to say for the standard of accommodation but hey it is what it is,i was only resting my head and showering each day before heading out to see the sites.You know all those movies you see?OMG here i was stood in the middle of the biggest movie set ever!!It felt really familiar and it just didnt give up giving.I could sit here and list off all the places you should visit but hey your gonna do your own thing?but just a couple of things you should try and do.The new world trade centre is a must the views will take your breathe away and the ellavator to the top just has to be done!!.Its an experience in it self.Ground zero wow what do you say except wow.Puts life into true perspective?If you have the finances the hellicopter flights accross the city are a must that will always live with you!!One tip though is puchase one of these muli-attraction passes saved me a fortune plus you can build your day arround them and decide what attractions you wanna see but the biggest freebie is just walk and walk and walk.The best way to get arround is on foot omg i walked mile upon mile but the views were well worth it. Food was fairly expensive were ever you go but i did find one little gem of a place on 42nd street called the west bank cafe i ended up sitting next to elderly couple from brooklyn they where simply charming and full of ideas of things to do and see.The restaurant was full of New Yorkers from what i could tell they seemed to know alot more than the tourist boy was the food good fresh hot and tastey service was slick to.I dinned there twice durring my stay it was that good.Well needless to say i wanna go back and do all the bits i didnt get to do this time so dont think about it go on give it a bash!! you really really wont be dissapointed."

I live on the waterfront with an unobstructed view of the Manhattan Skyline from Williamsburg Brooklyn... it is like looking at a painting that changes ALL THE TIME. If you are visiting, on a clear and beautiful day you should take the EastRiver Ferry that goes back and forth between Pier 11 (Wall street/South Street Seaport) and 34the street. Both of these stops are in Manhattan. In between, the stops are in Brooklyn (3: Dumbo, So. Williamsburg, No. Williamsburg) and in Queens (2: Greenpoint and Long Island City). The cost is $4 for week days and $6 on the weekends. The skyline in Brooklyn and Queens are getting better by the day and lots of developments are taking place. From the ferry you can decide which parts of Brooklyn and Queens to see and discover."

The gardens are well maintained landscaping pieces in some areas accented with sculpture and natural seating areas of modern architecture, and they are wind blown wildflower patches hardening a more refined mad max or apocalyptic feel, where the wild flowers overgrow old train tracks. I went during an art exhibit of creative architecture design that was interactive! Monks roam the area asking for offerings and blessing you. I jammed out with a drummer. Friends of mine did a Butoh piece atop this great garden!"

At night, the entire skyline is lit up and the Empire State Building generally has colors for different occasions, What is really interesting about the skyline is when you are close by. you can see the different building shapes, Some of the buildings are very unique and there a quite a few very tall buildings in the skyline."

            "review": "Get out of Manhattan!. The problems with being in Manhattan is that you can't appreciate the iconic skyline when you're buried in the canyons! You have to leave Manhattan in order to appreciate it's amazing profile.You can do this from Queens, Staten Island, and the other side of the River Hudson (New Jersey). While you can get some idea for the tourist boats which circumnavigate the island of Manhattan, they are really too close to get the awe-inspiring grandeur. Taking the boat to the Statue of Liberty or the (free) ferry to Staten Island will give you a nice view of the bottom of the island.However, the three options I would most recommend are as follows:1. If you are coming into Manhattan from JFK or LaGuardia airport, and are lucky enough to enter Manhattan through the Midtown Tunnel, you will see the 'Great Wall of Manhattan' shortly before you enter the tunnel. It is especially dramatic at twilight. Manhattan rises like a wall before you - a truly unforgettable vista.2. If you are coming from Newark Airport, regardless of whether you are coming by bus, coach, taxi, Uber or friends, once you pass the Bayonne exit, you will be treated to amazing views on the right side of the car, stretching from the Statue of Liberty to mid-town.3. If already staying in a hotel in Manhattan, the two best options are to take a ferry to Jersey City or the PATH train to Hoboken. Ferries cost around $5 - 8 and the PATH around $2.75. The ferries leave several places on the River Hudson - ask your hotel concierge. Average tsailing times are 10 - 20 minutes. PATH trains go from a number of stations beginning by Macy's at 33rd Street and 5th Avenue (again, any decent map will show you the route and the stations). This goes under the River Hudson: make sure you take the Hoboken and not to Journal Square train - look for the destination on the front of these underground trains). Travel time is around 20 minutes. Either way, simply make your way to the river's edge and enjoy! Evening is a particularly good time, since the sun lights up the glass buildings in golden tones as it sets. Keen student bonus: if you take the PATH train on to Pavonia-Newport instead, as well as the views you'll be at Pavonia-Newport Shopping Mall, and New Jersey sales tax locally are less than a third of Manhattan!"

One is to take the Staten Island Ferry back and forth. It runs daily on a regular schedule and is free. Spectacular. Another way, more extensive and more close up is to take a Sunset Cruise on the Circle Line. This cruise is about 2 hours and goes from 42nd Street on the West Side on the North River of the Hudson to Upper New York Harbor around the tip of Manhattan and north to the East River of the Hudson and then back to 42nd Street. It combines a view of many of NY's most exciting locations, including the Statue of Liberty and the Brooklyn Bridge. The really neat thing is that you get to see a sunset and then the skyline of New York lighting up. It's breathtaking."

The Manhattan Skyline is a living dream: part and parcel of an ever-expanding reality constructed by engineers and architects, visionaries who have propelled a once ground-bound humanity to the far reaches of imagined possibility. These towers of Manhattan are the towers which stand, built to endure the vicissitudes of time. They are living testaments to the gusto of the American Experiment, our shared commitment to use science and knowledge to bring out the divine spark of creativity in each human individual, and so use this spark to shape and build, aspire and challenge, climbing ever upward, come what may, persevering through any tempests of fear. Though this Skyline, surely, has been assaulted in some tragic ways by those still caught in the nightmares of a superstitious and ancient fear, these towers stand as the protectors and propagators of freedom, architectural manifestations of the iron resolve of our Experiment---ever enduring, ever rising, and ever fulfilling the undaunted beauty and peerless majesty of the American Dream."

There's a large, square sports arena in the park, surrounded by a walking path, and here there are fences with large square poles where you can place your camera for some still photos at night with long exposure. After taking photos, head East along the walking path towards the Brooklyn Bridge, and you'll find a superb ice cream place which serve a fantastic banana split."

If you are not up for the drive then I like the view from Long Island city . You can get some great shots of the sun setting between the buildings. The view isn't the same since 9/11, but life is about evolution after all. Another way to enjoy it is hop on the Bateaux, or any other dinner cruise.

The iconic Manhattan skyline is something everyone would have already seen without ever visiting New York, but it is necessary to get out of Manhattan in order to look back at the view.We did a guided night excursion/tour with a Spanish speaking company who were hawking for business outside our hotel on 8th Avenue. This was simply because Mrs Mono is Spanish, I speak Spanish and the group was going to be much smaller than the English language tour, and the rep was the least pushy of the lot.Leaving central Manhattan at around 6pm seemed rather early but being December it got dark very early and so we had an interesting ride around the city before heading to Dyker Heights. I'd never hear of this place before, but it is very famous for the extent to which the residents decorate their houses with Christmas lights (and the amount they spend on electricity to keep them illuminated!). It was very beautiful, but started to snow, so the 30-40mins we were given out of the minibus to explore and take photos was a bit excessive under the circumstances.We then went to Brooklyn Heights where we parked and went to view the skyline from the opposite shore. Everything was illuminated as you can imagine and it was pretty spectacular - even for a sceptic.There is also another good view from Long Island City which we also did during the daytime, but this involves a short train/subway ride from Grand Central (or maybe other stations) which provides another perspective, this time including the UN building."

Take the 7 train from Grand Central or even Times Square to Jackson Vernon subway stop (1 stop from Grand Central). Now you are in Queens. Walk to 48th Ave and turn left and head toward the East River. Terrific views of mid town Manhattan. The UN building will be directly across from you. Many movies and tv shows are filmed in this area. Great walking areas. Lots of restaurants in the area especially on Vernon Boulevard."

            "review": "Tips for the best ways to see it. OK, so you are visiting NYC and want to be able to best see the skyline. Obviously if you are actually in Manhattan (one of the 5 boroughs of NYC) you cannot see the Manhattan skyline. You need to be someplace else. Viewing Manhattan from the north is not the best. Viewing from the south is pretty cool, as well as from the east or west. If the day is clear you can see it from as far away as Nassau County on LOng Island, but obviously only the tallest buildings such as the Empire State Building and the Freedom Tower. You want a view that will 1.) allow you to view the skyline from several different viewpoints 2.) be close enough to see many buildings and 3.) allow you to stop and see it, not rush past it (like in a car on a roadway in Brooklyn)My first suggestion is do a boatride. The circle line is great for casual viewing with a narrated view. There are several options depending on how long you want to be on the water. We did the half island tour, which allows you to view the most popular skyline views (midtown going south to battery park) but you can also opt for a longer tour that goes all the way north to the Bronx. There are clipper ships that do a tour of the harbor around the statue of liberty and southern Manhattan that are also great (all outside, though, so if in need of shelter from sun or rain this is not the best option). Many people say the Staten Island Taxi (free) is the best, but we felt it was way too crowded to be able to get a good view without feeling like cattle. Also, the ferry to the statue of liberty provides a nice view of southern Manhattan. If opting to see it from New Jersey, Liberty State Park is nice. If opting to see it from Brooklyn, the Brooklyn Bridge park is great. And if you can walk across the Brooklyn Bridge (early on a weekend morning is best as this route gets VERY crowded) you will have a gorgeous view of the Manhattan skyline and you can take pics at your leisure. I mentioned that you can't see the skyline from Manhattan, but that doesn't mean you can't see parts of it, or buildings from Manhattan. The Freedom Tower (I have yet to do), the Empire State Building and Top of the Rock at Rockefeller Center all provide great ways to get an amazing view. Our favorite is top of the rock, as the lines are much shorter than the Empire State building and the space is larger. It also provides a great view of not only Manhattan buildings (like the Empire State building, Chrysler Building and Freedom Tower) but also of Central Park, which is pretty cool from this vantage point."

What always impressed me was the spectacular skyline that is so unique to the City. I've traveled to many countries but no where does the diverse architecture of the skyline stand out like in NY. The key as you was the streets is to look upward. You'll be amazed at the detail on some of the older buildings that may not look much from below. Manhattan has so much to offer. No wonder it's nicknamed the \"Big Apple.\" But taken for granted sometimes is the amazing skyline composed of various architectures. Truly spectacular."

The closer the better for viewing perspectives - if you're really, really interested in a great view then make the schlep over to Weehauken and stand on the cliff park and take a look from there."

Take the subway to Brooklyn and walk down to Brooklyn Park and walk around to find the perfect angle. Another option is to take a walk over the Brooklyn Bridge which also will provide you with some really impressive views of the skyline, A third option would be to take the Staten Island ferry, which is free, which goes from Downtown Manhattan. This will give you a closer and more \"undisturbed\" view of the famous skyline. Whichever option/location you choose, you cannot visit New York City without viewing the skyline from a distance."

Getting here is so simple - the NJ Transit bus runs regularly from the Port Authority Bus Terminal and only costs $3.50 and will take you to Boulevard East - whether it's during the day or after dark, the view is breathtaking as soon as you step of the bus and take in the view.After taking in the view, you may want to take the ferry back across to the city (it only takes ten minutes) which provides more panoramic views of the city from a different angle."

As the bus begins its route into NJ, there's a spectacular view over the Hudson to the Manhattan skyline. Stay on the bus for 20 minutes or so, take a look around an area which seems predominantly Korean then catch the same bus back, this time sitting on the left. Cant beat the view from the New Jersey side."

Or take a look from Brooklyn Heights + Brooklyn Bridge"

While I am a bit prejudiced and realize that many big cities have beautiful skylines, it is certainly a unique sight to see the Freedom Tower (on the grounds of the World Trade Center), the Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building and others from across the river in Brooklyn or New Jersey. It is quite breathtaking. It is a particular attraction to visitors from smaller cities. I strongly suggest seeing the NYC skyline from those vantage points across the river before going to the Observation Decks on either of the two tallest buildings. It will give you two different and unique perspectives: Looking in from the outside and looking out from the inside."

You can also go up to different observations decks around the city to see the skyline from above. We saw it above from the observation deck in the World Trade Center Observarory.

Every time I see it I'm impressed and proud to be a New Yorker. There are buildings of varied age, height and style. Those to impress with girth and those of beauty. But like the city and her people themselves, the skyline is a living, changing work of art. So I suggest you find a few different perspectives and soak it in. Find a favorite building, bridge, view point. ..etc. I happen to like the Manhattan bridge and the Chrysler building, at first thought.  But it you have the time, check out Lincoln Center, the chandeliers of the MET (opera house), Carnegie Hall and of course the top of the Empire state building."

Even if you've been to New York countless times, there's nothing like seeing the Statue of Liberty and skyline while sailing by with the cool breeze. We were able to easily switch seats from side to side on the benches. I tend to get seasick easily, but was fine. The crew served drinks (all you want) throughout the cruise. Thankfully, there was no narration, recorded or live. Reservations are needed, as I understand that many of the cruises sell out early.

The skyline vistas are simply incredible, both on the East River and up the Hudson. And cruising over to the Statue of Liberty is always inspiring. While I take my visitors in my own boat, the Circle Line cruises are a terrific way to do it. Plus, you get the guide's commentary along the way.

The first is either from the Chart House in Weehawken or the Ferry which also leaves from Weehawken. The second is during a flight landing at Newark. The Skyline evokes an expanse of memories and emotions for me, having witnessed the post 9/11 aftermath from my hotel in Secaucus, the Tribute in Lights six months later as the City recovered and today with the addition of the Freedom Tower. The Empire State Building, with all of the different color combinations, commemorating holidays and sports teams, add an occasional change to this magnificent view. And the Chrysler Building, in my opinion, is the most majestic of all."

It's treat to the eyes, mind and heart to view those magnificent buildings standing very close to each other almost like rubbing shoulder to shoulder.. !!The avenues, streets, lanes and by lanes of Manhattan were laid down very nicely and these magnificent buildings are then constructed side by side. The traffic management is amazing on the road and subway network in Manhattan is just awesome. The Empire State building, World Trade Center building, Met life building, One Penn station building, Lexington avenue building to name a few sky scrappers that welcome the tourists and fill their hearts and minds with amazing and astonishing feelings.I walked through the Lexington avenue, Madison avenue, Times Square Street, 34th street and had my mind and heart with countless praises and appreciations to all the engineers, owners who invested their amazing skills, huge money and precious time in creating such magnificent modern structures. Also, you got to see the beautiful rivers \"Hudson\" & East rivers on both the sides of Manhattan and also a vast and beautiful \"Central Park\" in the middle of Manhattan. Walking or a cab ride through the streets of Manhattan is a must and without which your trip to New York city is incomplete.."

As you step off the tram pick up drinks and snacks at the Duane Reade or coffee at the Starbucks before you walk south along the water front to the new Roosevelt Memorial Park. If you stay late stop at the one of the restaurants near the Tram for a light dinner. 2. Long Island City in Queens is a 10 minute ride on the number 7 train from Times Square. Hop off at the Vernon-Jackson stop. If time allows visit PS1 MOMA Museum. Exiting from the subway walk east towards the river, to Gantry State Park. This park faces the upper East Side of Manhattan. Vernon Blvd. has cafes restaurants and botiques. 3. The number 4 train from Grand Central or the ferry from lower Manhattan will take you to Brooklyn Bridge Park under the Brooklyn Bridge, which faces the waterfront skyscrapers of Wall Street, and views of the three iconic bridges of NYC."

I am fortunate enough to be able to see the Manhattan Skyline daily as the train approaches the East River tunnel from Queens to take me into Manhattan. I still am in awe of the beauty of the skyline every time I see it. It is a monument & testament to all of the architects, engineers & construction workers who devoted years to creating these magnificent structures. It's also organic, changing periodically. One57 was added fairly recently and is very visible from Queens. The Manhattan Skyline was also radically changed on 9/11/01 when the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center were destroyed and thousands of lives lost. The Skyline is still a spectacular site but there is a scar in the Skyline where the Twin Towers once were that will never heal.I love New York City & believe visiting it should be on everyone's bucket list. The Manhattan Skyline is a site that should also be on everyone's bucket list. If you come to visit, as you gaze at the beautiful Manhattan Skyline, say a prayer for those lives lost on 9/11. You should also make a point of visiting the 9/11 Memorial."

It is the countless movies and TV shows I suppose, although many are now filmed in Toronto and dressed up as NY. In fact in the UK the premier film studios Pinewood are about to build a permanent set representing a NY street. But nothing can beat the real thing. I first saw it driving over Manhatten Bridge just after darkness. It is stunning. Just look and wonder. Because the open bus tour guide had a crisis - it was her first night and someone insulted her, so she refused to carry on for a long time - the driver took is on a detour to Brooklyn and parked at a viewpoint so we could take pictures and the guide could have a sneaky cigarette. It was well worth it. Another stunning angle to view the skyline and spot the famous buildings. it's pinnacle is the new Freedom Tower of course, a clever piece of architecture. Don't miss this view. Looking is free. I bet it looks great in all weathers."

So we'd recommend taking a boat trip around Manhattan (by the way, bus tour companies usually offer a complimentary boat tour tickets) or visiting townships of New Jersey along the Hudson shore (e.g. Weehawken, Hoboken, etc.). Bus tickets to New Jersey cost 3 dollars/person, the buses usually start on 42 Street and then through Lincoln Tunnel to Boulevard East and further (depends on bus route, ask the driver).

The only issue was the patrons, who despite being told repeatedly to sit in their seats OR go downstairs for standing at the bow and rails for great pictures. These idiots wanted to sit, until they felt the need to record or snap photos with their IPAD, phone or professional camera, blocking the view of every other person who was seated. They serve drinks on the boat and the return trip, gives all the splendor of sunset and a lighted Manhattan skyline."

So if you haven't been to NYC in several years you must come back just to see some of the new skyscrapers. The best way to see the city is from a distance. One excellent way is to take a ride on the East River Ferry starting from its terminal at 35th street on the East River. It makes various stops and goes down the length of Manhattan to the Wall Street area. Then ride the Staten Island Ferry back and forth along New York Harbor. Both of these alternatives are relatively inexpensive ways to see the skyline."

New buildings are constantly going up and if I'm not mistaken, some are even taller than the Chrysler Blgd or the Empire State! A few are even residential towers. I would say that the best view I ever had was at dawn as my cruise ship entered New York Bay.

A third is to stand at sunset or sunrise on one of the major avenues such as 42nd or 34th and look from east to west.

The skyline shows a city thick with buildings that seem to poke up like matchsticks of varying sizes and shapes. It is always a wonder to imagine the millions of people that are buzzing around the city on any given day -- within those buildings as well as down amongst them.

The skyline is everchanging and it is what makes New York, New York. But i can tell you it is worth a trip thru the Lincoln tunnel by car or bus (from Port of Authority bus terminal) to view the skyline from NJ. The bus #128, 166, 165 goes along John F. Kennedy Blvd. EAST!!! Many people take wedding, prom and above all sunset pictures of the view. When one experiences the sun setting with its' glow bouncing off the skyscrapers it's amazing!!! Something i never get tired of seeing!! If only they would bring the July 4th fireworks back to the Hudson River!!! ."

Come down to Hallets Cove (nearest subway is N or Q to Broadway and transfer to Q104, or another view is from the 7 train to Hunters Point and walk to Gantry Park. You can also get great views from Astoria Park, but its a walk along Hoyt Avenue from Astoria Blvd (N or Q) subway to the waterfront.Note the waterfront along Broadway, and 31st Avenue is going through a major transformation. There is free kayaking at the weekend at Hallets Cove on Sundays. Oh and for those who like to shop, checkout Costco on the waterfront. FYI there will be a ferry service between downtown Manhattan and Astoria starting in 2017, or you can currently take a ferry from mid-town to Long Island City (Gantry Park) and catch the 7 train back to the city. Non US tourists -these locations mentioned offer some hidden gems of NYC and fantastic views of the Manhattan skyline. You should definitely not passed up. All Astoria and Long Island City locations are with 20-30 minutes of the city. You can also visit a Japanese garden at the The Noguchi Museum, and stroll in Socrates Sculpture Park and relax at Hallets Cove, just to name a few attractions along the waterfront."

For those who like the water there are cruises which cirfcle the island of Manhattan. You can also view the beauty of the skyline from the top of the Empire State building or the \"Top of the Rock\" in Rockefeller Center. You will be impressed by the lights of the city. You can also view a variety of architecural designs of the buildings. In the day time you can also see the sights by just walking along some of the avenues or going to the high buildings.

Seeing Manhattan's skyline is important and delightful, but it becomes better when you know how, when and where to do the viewing, especially when it's free.  Here are some viewing tips from a life-long New Yorker:1. If you are coming into town from one of the airports, take the time to look:a. from Newark, there are some great views looking eastward across the Hudson, especially from Hoboken just before you go in or out of the Lincoln Tunnelb. Coming accross the Triboro Bridge from Kennedy or LaGuardia Airports--or to them--you have some great views of Manhattan from the East Sidec. An even better view is from the 59th Strteet Bridge (Queensboro Bridge) made famous by the Simon-Garfunkel song;d. Another great view is coming into Manhattan from the LIE (Long Island Expressway--495) coming into the MIdtown Tunnel2. If you are in Brooklyn, there are great views of Manhattan and Financial District from the south, viewed from Park Slope and the Heights3. Inside Manhattan, the views from Freedom Center and other buildings near Ground Zero give some beautiful views of the syline, along with explanations4. Another great set of views is from the Empire State Building at 34th and Fifth Ave.5. A great and unusual view is from the Whitney Museum outside cafe at just below W 14th Street6. A smaller but more charming view is from Sheep Meadow in Central Park, looking south at Central Park South7. Other buildings which have great views include Rockefeller Center's various building, the Chrysler Building etc all around Midtown.8. If it's the Fourth of July, you want to be along Hudson or the East River for the Fireworks at Night, though you can also get some great night-time or day-time viewing from a helicopter ride, though it is expensive9. The Staten Island Ferry is one of the cheapest rides in NY, and it gives beautiful views of Manhattan, as does the more expensive Circle Line cruise around NY10. The view from the Statue of Liberty is the greatest view of NY"

We took a boat trip from Pier 11 around the southern tip of Manhattan, out to the Statue of Liberty and back again, along the Hudson River landing near the Intrepid Air Museum, near 42nd street I think.It was late afternoon and sunny and mild and throughout the journey we had an informative commentary over the speaker system. The boat was full and there wasn't much room to move around though that wasn't a problem. As we left the pier we had good views of Brooklyn Bridge and out into the bay to the Statue, passing it and returning.The view of Manhattan was truly spectacular with the buildings appearing to rise out of the water, all different designs, sizes and colours, the ones finished in blue materials disappearing against the blue sky. The Peace Tower got brighter and brighter as our position in relation to the sun changed until a brilliant and blinding flash as it reflected exactly opposite our eyeline. There was an occasional tourist helicopter giving passengers and aerial view as well as other tour boats.A lot of my photos have the hands of other passengers in them holding their camera phones in the air but with a bit of elbowing I soon got the edge of the boat where I had uninterrupted views . . and better photos.The tour lasted about an hour and a half and I would recommend it. We took a night bus tour to view Manhattan from the other side and though brief, with just a two minute stop, the night view is also spectacular and well worth a visit."

Everyone comes to new York for the skyline whether you're seeing it by boat, helicopter or from the Brooklyn shoreline...My wife and I went on the 15 minute helicopter ride which left from downtown. We went with liberty helicopters (although there are a few similar companies which operate from the same place). Worked out about $160 per person with a discount with our new york passes. This may seem like a lot of money but definitely worth doing once. The tour takes you up the Hudson river as far north as Yankee stadium (whilst taking in the statue of liberty) so you don't miss a thing.Not sure the 20 minute helicopter trip is worth the extra cash. I think the 15 minute ride was sufficient for most tourists."

There are many angles from which to view this amazing cityscape, but in general I prefer the view of the East side of Manhattan, or the Southern tip. The west side views are now dominated by horrendous \"luxury\" hi-irises, boxy and boring. Most of my favorite views are from the Brooklyn side; if you are taking a car over the Brooklyn Queens Expressway, there's a great broadside view over Calvary cemetery, itself a kind of landmark (\"Harold and Maude\" was filmed there). A walk over the Brooklyn Bridge from the Manhattan side also yields an ever-changing vista --keep looking over your shoulder-- and once you are on the Brooklyn side, sit on a bench on the Promenade for the best view of lower Manhattan anywhere. And there is still something thrilling about taking the #7 train to Queens (also dubbed the International Express, and you'll see why)and emerging from underground, rounding a corner and seeing the skyline appear."

Although I live in Manhattan again, I've been looking at it from many different angles for many years, and it never disappoints.Despite losing the Twin Towers, we still have the Empire State and Chrysler buildings in midtown, not to mention Woolworth downtown, all of which and many more have comprised the most recognizable skyline in the world for most of my lifetime.From a plane, or a boat, or a nearby shoreline, it is and will always be an awe-inspiring sight."

The view of NYC from that height is fascinating. There is nothing else like it! The excitement of seeing the skyline of Manhattan and also seeing the hustle and blustle going on below you is exhilarating to say the least. At night, the city actually glitters and it is mesmerizing to look at. The sunset was a deep hue of orange and lasted over an hour getting more intense until the end. (Unfortunately, some of it was probably due to pollution but it was gorgeous nonetheless.) It seemed we were standing in front of the windows overlooking the city most of the time we were in the apartment. The NYC skyline is a must see."

It is a bit strange and odd to write about a \u201csky line\u201d but Manhattan\u2019s is one of those that require a word or two.If you are in Manhattan you are too close to the trees to see the forest; you must view it from a distance. That is for me usually the NJ side of the Hudson although the preferred venue for me is from the Staten Island Ferry. From the ferry I love to watch the sky line from a distance come closer and closer until one is engulfed within its magistracy and energy.Living in a major city as I do, I am used to tall buildings creating cement canyons but Manhattan is different.Although it no longer contains the tallest building in the world, from across the river you can not help but see the Freedom Tower and the Empire State Building, tall enough to make any body\u2019s list.One can just sense the intense energy level that such a place generates.Some years ago I was traveling at night by bus to JFK Airport. I was on the east side of the East River looking west into Manhattan and the lights reflecting off the glass of the buildings just radiated with a sparkle like colored diamonds.Emerald City come alive."

No better way to see the manhattan Skyline than from the river Hudson. we departed from pier 81, for an approximately 2 hour cruise. You will experience a different view, cruising down the Hudson passing New World Tower, Ellis Island & Statue of Liberty on the rightside or Starboard side of boat, onward under Brooklyn Bridge, Manhattan Bridge & Williamsberg Bridge, as far as the United Nations Building on Eastside of Manhattan, and return.

I will start with the best and highest priced: take a helicopter tour. That's what is done for visiting VIPs, and we are all VIPs, right? There are several helo operators. Just google and see if the price makes sense for your budget.2. Harbor tours. Lots of these at various prices. Besides a helo tour, this is the only way to see the skyline from almost every angle (except from Central Park, which is also terrific.3. Reservoir in Central Park. This may well be our favorite view, and it's free! Go to the north side of the reservoir, and you will have the lake and the jet d'eau (fountain) in the foreground, the lovely park just beyond that and the towering skyscrapers, If you scan with a video, you get more of the park and the lovely, classic buildings to the east and west of the park.4. Observation towers: One World, Empire State. Rockefeller Center. These are expensive, especially if you have a number of you. Hard to say which is the best. They each provide a different perspective. Not worth it, in my view, if it's not a clear day.5. Staten Island Ferry. Another free one, with lovely views of the southern skyscrapers of Manhattan as well as the Statue of Liberty. Hard to beat at this price. There are more options, but I will leave it here. On our visit earlier this month, we did all of these except One World and Rockefeller Center. I think one skyscraper observatory is enough."

Even though one only has short glimpse of the skyline while driving in on either the LIE & the Whitestone Expressway, it is a short, but beautiful sight. The best views are flying into Laguardia from NC (& probably other places). Try to sit on the Left side of the plane. If it is clear w/ no clouds, you can often see The Statue of Liberty, World Trade Center, Empire State Bldg., & MidTown. The plane then often turns right & you can catch a glimpse of the remains of the 1964 World's Fair and the USTA Tennis Stadium at Flushing. Then a quick glance of what used to be Shea Stadium, now replaced by Citi Field as the plane straightens out for its approach to Laguardia. I believe NY is a city of change, adventure, growth, full of vibrancy & life and I believe all this reflected by it's Skyline.PS: When leaving Laguardia, the views are good, but you don't get the great skyline as coming in."

Viewing Manhattan's Skyline is always something that leaves great impression upon my mind, be it when approaching from JFK by taxi, or making way into the city by rail from Newark or southward from Boston, it is also an image that remains etched in my mind long after having left the city.During a recent trip to NYC, we took the Liberty Island and Ellis Island ferry, something I hadn't done in nearly 20 years. In addition to the attractions at both locations being quite special, I really enjoyed seeing the Lower Manhattan Skyline from the Star Cruise vessel as we made way to the Statue of Liberty. Perhaps more impressive and memorable was seeing the skyline as we approached Battery Park upon our return. Wow, what a skyline! The sleek look of the skyline as it gradually encroaches upon your field of vision is awesome. If it similar to what we have in Hong Kong, when taking the Star Ferry across Victoria Harbour between Kowloon and Central. Seeing skyscrapers as you quickly approach by water vessel is just really neat. You have little in front to obscure your vision and can take lovely pictures. I had forgotten how much I enjoyed this aspect of the Liberty Island, Ellis Island and Statue of Liberty tour until our recent visit. Now, I look forward to taking this ferry again and will eagerly look forward to seeing the Manhattan Skyline from the harbour in the future."

One World Trade Centre left even the Empire State building in its shadow.To view it all at night was amazing.

And it is well worth a look. To get the best view, you have to cross over to Brooklyn (you also have the same option on the other side to cross over to Jersey, but this is more popular). I would recommend you to walk down Brooklyn Bridge. Its a lovely walk indeed. Once you cross over, you should head down to your right and you come up to a pier like structure and there it will stand at the other of the Hudson. Best time to view is at dusk. You can catch the sunset and wait around for the buildings to light up like a million fireflies. You can sit and enjoy this over a beer and hot-dog or an ice cream. The pier is full of stalls ready to satisfy the weary city tripper. Whats so amazing about this place is that you know the hustle and bustle on the other side, you know how choc-a-bloc Manhattan is, and yet the skyline gives you a serene tranquil view of the city sans the noise and the rush but intact in all its urban architectural splendour. One can always take the ferry by the river back to Manhattan. Ticket counters will be right there. I would advice against walking back via the Brooklyn Bridge if you already walked in that way. Its way too long to do it twice."

Great picture taking of the skyline. Next head to 90th St and 5th Ave, the entrance to the Jackie Kennedy Onassis Reservoir, walk up the stairs and there before you is the incredible Manhattan skyline of the Upper West Side.If you are going to the Metropolitan Museum check out their roof top also good skyline views. Naturally the top of the Empire State Building and Freedom Tower have great view but be prepared to pay $30.00 per person to enjoy the views. Of course there are many rooftop bars available so check those out as well"

That's because its V-shaped lighting inserts on the facade's top floors identify it immediately, and often various colors achieved by floodlights embellish the upper part of the structure even more. At 1,046 feet, this Art Deco building used to be one of the tallest in the world.Day or night, as an architecture buff, I like to pick out various skyline buildings as I do with constellations in the sky. The Empire State Building is easily identifiable, of course, and I always picture King Kong when I see this icon. The tallest skyscraper now is One World Trade Center at 1,776 feet. It is also the tallest in the Western Hemisphere.There are myriad places to get good views of the skyline, but I prefer to look at it from afar, such as underneath the Brooklyn Bridge, on the Staten Island Ferry or on a boat tour. On my most recent visit, I got a remarkable - but quick -- view from New Jersey on the Airport Express en route to Newark Airport."

The first of them dominates many views of the skyline; there will be others: 432 Park, 117 West 57th Street, One57, and 111 West 57th Street.From New Jersey, the Bronx and Queens the first looks taller than the Empire State Building. In fact it is 1004 feet, compared to 1,454 for the Empire State and 1046 for the Chrysler Building nearby.I tend to be on the negative side at the moment, but the skyline may be more interesting when the other three are constructed. It's very true that the many boxy building give a rather clumpy feeling to the whole ensemble.In any event, there is nothing to do about it, but perhaps to dream of Tuscany and the city of towers there."

To experience it firsthand can be hard to define, but here goes.Traditionally, the expansive view comes from across the Hudson, from Jersey City or Hoboken. Just get yourself down to the river's edge and there you have it it is best for seeing the density of skyscrapers, both in midtown and downtown.Another option is to travel through Central Park and see the glimpses of buildings through the trees. This is most delightful in the fall where the colors of the trees set off the buildings behind. Best for views of the wonderful structures along Central Park West.The view of the skyline coming over any of the East River bridges is one of my favorites. Depending on the bridge you choose, the view will be different, but I find them to be the most intimate.The least explored is probably the views from Governors Island. I love these views. Most dramatic is the view from the Parade Grounds, where one can vies the skyline as if you were in the middle of the country, with Oz riding over that next hill. Awesome views herd as well of the Statue of Liberty, And both the Jersey City and Brooklyn waterfronts."

From the top of the rock the sun setting in the background is a truly beautiful picture with the iconic Empire State proudly standing alone in the middle of Manhatten dwarfing the surrounding buildings and behind her in the distance the financial area of Manhatten standing proud , the Freedom tower towering out above them . out in the bay Liberty looks so small but in her own way just as iconic.the view of the skyline is free , but gaining the position of height/distance will cost you entrance unless you are on Brooklyn bridge walking over I am so glad that I have visited this spectacular skyline , it shouldn't be missed"

The cheapest way to enjoy the skyline to get at sunset to the Staten Island Ferry Terminal. This is best done with warm weather and with some cheese and a bottle of wine. Take the ferry (IT'S FREE!!) and just take in the breathtaking view you will enjoy. The skyline will change as you approach Staten Island at any segment of the trip, it will change. Sunset will turn Manhattan on fire and that will add further beauty to the trip. You could also do in the morning or at night. At night, one of the most beautiful places to take in the skyline id the Brooklyn Boardwalk, an ideal place to take memorable pictures. If you don't mind spending a few bucks, especially with good weather, you should take a boat tour of Manhattan."

This attraction is absolutely free and the sheer number and density of unique architectural sites is rivaled by very few places--perhaps Shanghai, Chicago come close but New York probably still takes it for the enormity and diversity and overall numbers of tall buildings even if it no longer has the tallest. The only problem is that to see the skyline of Manhattan, you have to be at a vantage point that takes you out of Manhattan to get an optimal view--and even once you are there--in New Jersey, in Brooklyn or Queens, on the Circle Line boats, or (for free) on the Staten Island Ferry, you still can't see the whole thing at once--just too long and too wide. The very best way to see it is on a plane descending into or ascending out of one of the two NYC airports if you want to see its vastness and get some sense of the geography. Other wise, the view from DUMBO in Brooklyn, from the Triborough Bridge entrance ramp going toward Queens (it goes by fast), from the pedestrian walkway on the Brooklyn Bridge, or on the Lincoln Tunnel helix in New Jersey or one of the unobstructed park views from Weehawken, Hoboken, or even Edgewater will provide the most encompassing views, though each a bit different. Should you really want to take in the whole thing, you need a higher and further vantage point. I recommend Eagle Rock Reservation overlook in West Orange, NJ--which is 17 miles away but from which on a clear day, with or without binoculars, you can see from below the Statue of Liberty nearly up to the George Washington bridge."

What a change this trip brought to our attitudes? Our earlier trip had involved a couple of days in the city (pre 9/11 but after the first attack) and a hire car circuit of New York State, Niagara and the Canadian cities as far as Quebec, before returning through New England. This time we had a week in the big apple, and oh how we fell in love with the buzz!We used the tour buses for transport as well as the tours and boat ride which was convenient and economical. It was supplemented by taxi and rickshaw journeys - experiences in themselves. The good weather let us enjoy the top of the rock and central park to the full, and the Guggenheim was open this time. We took in the irreverent but hilarious \"Book of Mormon\" show and had a great meal at the Da Marina Italian restaurant nearby.There is nothing to match the solemnity and respect due at Ground Zero (except for the Pentagon memorial to that fateful day) and the entries recording lost infants still make me well up at the thought. Perhaps it is these memorials more than all else that unites our hearts with the citizens of New York.In summary, we now love NY and cant wait to get back to the energy of Manhattan.God bless America!"

Sunlight reflecting off the tinted windows of these buildings gives the view a different perspective when seen at sunrise, mid-day or at sunset. At dusk, just before sunset, the skyline takes on a golden hue. At night, the skyline comes alive with a million specks of light - a view worth taking in. If you have the City Pass, you will have 3-4 opportunities to view the skyline - by taking the Circle Line cruise along the Hudson river or taking the ferry to the Statue of Liberty. From the statue, the skyline includes New Jersey, Manhattan and Long Island. If you have never had the opportunity to take in this view before, then I would highly recommend it. Great views of the skyline may also be had from the top of the Empire State building or The Top of the Rock."

The spring night was clear and I managed to get a photo of the full moon reflecting on the river high over the skyline with the slight ripples from the ferry adding texture to the photo.

Access the walkway from 178th St. and Cabrini Blvd., a short walk from the 175th A train station. The walk all the way across (about a miles plus) takes about 20-25 minutes, about 10 minutes to get half way. Just be aware that because there are so many bikers, if you walk, you may have to do so single file Make sure you go on a clear day. The north walkway gives you the view of the Hudson, NY and NJ looking north. It's also free. If you only want to walk one way you can continue on to the Bus stop and take either of the numerous buses back across or the Spanish Jitneys. Bikers note that the North walk way entrance at 179th St. and Pinehurst has stairs. The south side does not."

As they say, the third time is the charm, and my trip started on the highest of high notes. I took a shuttle, mid-day, into Manhattan from La Guardia Airport. I can't provide a lot of specifics as to the route that the shuttle took, but suffice to say we made our way from the airport to the Queensboro Bridge. A few minutes out from the airport the view opened to reveal the new One World Trade Center tower, which was gorgeous to see. That proved to be the tip of the iceberg, as the highway continued to bend to the right, and suddenly I was presented with the full length of Manhattan Island, from One World Trade Center at the south end, to the Empire State Building on 34th Street, to the Chrysler Building further north. It was breathtaking, and I must admit to tearing up at the beauty of the view. I wish I had been in a position to try to capture it on camera, but it will be burned into my memory for a lifetime."

Day or evening you will be positioned for good views. A few minutes from this location is Brooklyn Battery Park. Definitely go there to take in the view.Nearby Brooklyn Heights Promenade provides a second exposure of the skyline with breath-taking views. If time permits another of my favorite locations for viewing the skyline is to actually walk back and forth across the Brooklyn Bridge. It is simply magical.Best times to see the skyline are early in the morning to catch sunrise or late in the afternoon before, during and after sunset. I use my DSLR with a tripod for capturing beautiful images of the skyline after sunset when the sky and the city are all aglow.The New York City skyline is something you should not miss."

This was our first visit to New York and definitely will not be our last visit. although the city is very popular, noisy and crowded this did not spoil the experience. We were here for Five days and this was not enough time to explore and visit all of the attractions. We visited Wall Street, Ground Zero the Memorials and the 911 Museum. We went on a Big Bus Tour, two Hudson Cruises and experienced the fantastic views from the Empire State Building. We saw Grand Central Terminal, Bryant Park and Central Park. We walked up and down & East to West around Manhattan Island. We had sore feet but thoroughly enjoyed the entire experience here. There are great bars and restaurants and great shopping experiences to be had. Only thing i would say is it is definitely not cheap in New York - You will be shocked by some of the prices...."

Its a tourist mecca everything about NY is geared towards the visitor. First things first if you intend to travel in NY alot or even a little then you just got to buy the 7 day subway pass unbelievable value at $31 even a 5 year old could make there way around NY on the subway together with the ingenious street grid layout you cant go wrong.LOL. The Hudson cruise is a must which in a lot of cases its thrown in if you buy a three day Manhattan bus tour (we went with Graysline) and it was fun especially the banter and good humour of the on-board guides you can hope on off so spread your sightseeing over the three days bring water and a sun cream and a hat it can be very hot in summer.You can buy legit cut price tickets to Broadway shows from TKTS kiosk on Time Square but be willing to cue get advice on best cueing times and strategies it will pay off Must visit the MOMA museum of modern art free on Friday evenings. With an intro like don't get me wrong NY NY is irresistable you can guess there is a word of warning coming up so here it is Keep your precious plastic friend within eyesight at all times mine got turned over. I didn't heed my own advice and it turned out a wasty surprise for me. NY dosent operate chip and pin (how amazing is that) so your card is always been swiped through this machine and that and unfortunately ended up a just another victim. Here's another gripe small enough if you are not a big foodie but a major one if you are. The food in NY is not up to standard its full of hype and presentation and low on delivery and it is relatively expensive. I would advise if your don't have a fundamental dislike then McDoanalds is a safe bet at filling the main course and treat yourself in the evening but do shop around. Speaking of shopping go to Maceys you just got to....... Hope my advice will be of some use to you Ciao for now."

The best way to see the skyline is from a boat, and there are many choices - the free Staten Island Ferry, the ferries to the Statue of Liberty, the New York Water Taxi, many cruise choices including those at sunset, cruises on old masted clipper ships, etc. You can also see the skyline from the Brooklyn Bridge (take a walk or bike ride across, there are bike rentals there) and from the Brooklyn or New Jersey parks directly across from Manhattan. There are two main areas of skyline - the southern end with One World Trade Center towering above the others, and then midtown where the Empire State Building, Chrysler Building and Rockefeller Center are just 3 of many huge buildings. Don\u2019t forget the UN complex which can be seen from East River. We had a New York Pass which included several of the boating options. One we took was the sunset cruise, hoping to get some nice skyline with sunset pictures, but that didn\u2019t work out as well as I had hoped as, though we were in East River at the time with Manhattan between us and the sun, most of the sunset took place hidden by the city. We got a few snapshots of the still bright but reddening sun between skyscrapers."

We got a glimpse of the famous buildings as we moved along the Hudson river and East river passing below the famous bridges and seeing the sun set with its hue cast on the Statue of Liberty standing in its majestic way. The newly built World Trade center tower and the Empire state building,very familiar in any photo of the Big Apple are clearly visible as is New Jersey. As dusk settles its a million stars glittering and beckoning you to go and enjoy the nightlife of New York."

I would rate all of them great. You should do all three of them. I did the Staten Island Ferry in the night so that i could see the Manhattan Skyline by night.

We couldn't get to go and see the statue of liberty as it was fully booked up till November so the best way to get close to it for a photo is the cruise. There was a ramp for wheelchair users like me. You can buy food and drink on the boat and it was for 1 & half hours long."

Some of the best places are Boulevard East in West New York and Gutenberg (an easy bus ride from Port Authority), the ferry terminal, Mitsuwa Japanese market in Edgewater (worth visiting itself). The absolute best view is from the helix coming up out of the Lincoln Tunnel, but you can't enjoy that unless you're stuck in traffic.For a more distant view of the skyline, try Eagle Rock Reservation in Montclair."

However, New York City and the Manhattan districts is a true Metropolis, and the skyline is memorable and ever growing. In the outside burroughs skyscrapers are rising up as well making this whole region a megalopolis. On our recent visit, it seemed every second or third building was surrounded with scaffolding and construction workers improving and renovating skyscrapers.

Whether you're viewing the skyline from a Circleline cruise, or looking out at it from your hotel window, it's hard not to feel that New York is the most vibrant city in the world when you gaze at its skyline night or day. Thanks to the gift of geologic bedrock from Mother Nature, Manhattan was uniquely positioned to be the home of the skyscraper, and the skyline continues to evolve and amaze. Especially now as the Freedom Tower and new World Trade Tower replace the towers destroyed on 9/11, the NYC skyline is not to be missed."

The line (on Wednesday in July) was between 300 and 500 people. One reason is because it takes an inordinately long amount of time to get to the elevators that take you up stairs. The line snakes back and fourth between displays about rivets and pictures of old lunch kits the workers had. If you're not an engineer or history student, it meant very little but you still had to walk right buy the displays. Do yourself a favor and buy express tickets. It's the best value in New York. You get to bypass standing in the lines (no where to sit either) in both directions. The view from the 86th floor suffices in terms of awesomeness. You're at the perfect height to where you can recognize what you're looking at but can look up and see the landmarks. It's something every American should see so they can gasp at wonder (or disgust) at what man wrought. The managers of the Empire State Building should do a better job at allowing you to get upstairs in the easiest way possible."

The skyline of New York City is definitely very impressive but you need to see from a distance to really take in a large panorama. Best Views of Lower to Mid Manhattan can be had on the Brooklyn Promenade on the Brooklyn Side of course.Best views of Midtown are definitely wonderful from Long Island City (Hunters Point South Park area to the East and West)And if you like views of the West Side Manhattan Skyline, Best views can be found on the Palisades Parkway northbound side. There are three different scenic lookout points over the Palisades which give you stunning views especially around sunrise and sunset. Enjoy!"

You have a couple of options to get the optimal view. You can pay around 30$ a person to go into one of the skyscrapers (Rock, Empire or WTC) . I recommend the WTC for its experience (the elevator ride itself is great). Only problem is that you don't have a view of Central Park. So if that is important for you , choose the other two. Another option is the Brooklyn Bridge or the Staten Island ferry. Especially at night those are great. IMHO the best way to enjoy the view is by going to Brooklyn Bridge park.

Great Suites that prevent that feeling of being in a hotel room and crowded. Large living room, and bedrooms with great bathrooms. The cost was great. If you need a limo, car service or just get stuck somewhere and need a pick up you can trust, Call Luxor Limo / Car Service. They can even give you great suggestions on where to eat, or cost effective city options. This trip changed my Grandsons ideas of how big a city can grow. Yankee Stadium was almost as great as their old stadium across the street. Easy to get to by subway also."

The Empire State Building is still to Manhattan, as the Eiffel to Paris, the Burj Al-Arab to Dubai, and Big Ben and London Bridge to London. The Empire Beacon changes colors with occasions, as in red, white and blue on July 4th, Green for St Patrick's day, orange for Halloween and Christmas colors for the holidays and some for changes for even lesser occasions. Newer buildings, mostly residential/business keep sprouting. Their designs and architecture although tend to be modern generally blend well with existing edifices. At night specially week days when offices and residences are lit, the city sparkles. The skyline can be fully appreciated from a bird's eye view or an ants eye view. It is a well coalesced city of buildings new and old."

Its attraction can range from good to just ok, depending on the weather. My apartment is actually part of the skyline, but I have looked at it time and time again from across the East River at Long Island City. Some nights the reflections from the buildings' lights are more saturated and extend some distance across the river. Other nights, the colours in the water are subdued and the reflections are shortened. The colors of the Empire State Building always stand out though and are always prominent except when it plays misty for you (pun on the movie). Best times for viewing are very early mornings as dawn breaks and in the evening, when there is still some light in the sky, giving it a very blue effect, which contrasts with the recently turned on reds and yellows of the building lights.During the daytime, it is deep, narrow concrete and asphalt gorges.I recommend a ride in any ferry that traverses the East River; you will enjoy it."

It also features a view that you wouldn't see in other observatories, the 3 big bridges on the East side of Manhattan.Top of the rock is a treat too for real Manhattan lovers.

Or splurge for a ride on the thrilling Beast on the Hudson River in midtown, or take the Water Taxi, you can take it from Manhattan to lower Manhattan to Brooklyn with uncles views of Manhattan. Or if you are in a romantic state of mind, go down to lower Manhattan a catch a sailboat the embarks a little before sunset, and it is an amazing was to see the skyline. There is a 20 minute free kayak excursion that let's you see the skyline fro a very different perspective. But my favorite all time splurge of a lifetime and every bit worth the thrill is a copter tour up the hudson, circling around Yankee Stdium, the George Washington Bridge and the Upper West side. To this day I feel ecstatic feeling just thinking about it. Enjoy whichever you choose. You are bound to enjoy. There is also one other way to see the skyline, a brief view. Take the Governor's Island fro ferry on a weekend. There is always entertainment. If the budget allows rent a bile, and you will see the skyline in a very delightful was. It's no wonder NYC is my favorite city."

It's like no other place you've been: a park, botanical garden and walking paths all built on an elevated railroad line. The walkway twists and turns and meanders in between buildings and then goes out on the straightaway again. At every turn there are stunning views of the Hudson River and New Jersey to the west, the rest of Manhattan to the East and more gardens and pathways to the north & south. It's different at each season and at different times of the day and night. Combine your trip to the High Line with a meal at one of the many Chelsea and West Village restaurants that line the streets below. And it's perfect for the whole family with benches to rest on when you get tired of walking. Best of all: its free! The High Line has quickly become one of New York's best treasures."

My first visit was 1956 and included a visit to the top observation deck of the Empire State Building -- where we could look down on the huge Wanamaker Building fire that afternoon. For a kid from Central Vermont, that view of the skyline was more than impressive.I have, since moving here, viewed the city's skyline from hundreds of angles. Until the mid-1980s or so, I have loved showing these views to visiting friends and family members. The sights were magnificent!HOWEVER, this is absolutely no longer the case! Rampant and largely unregulated construction of hundreds of UGLY skyscrapers with no regard whatsoever for line or beauty has turned my pride in the city to an unwillingness to show it off anymore! It's all part of the ruin of the city caused by the real estate industry! (Unfortunately, It has spread to the other boroughs, too!) Greed seems always to promote uglinesss.I'll still escort visitors to the top of Empire State ... but only if they insist.One possible helpful hint: wait until after dark and take the Staten Island ferry out from southern Manhattan. As you board, hang back and stand on the rear of the boat. As you move away from the ferry slip, that awesome display of light opens up as a magnificent panorama before your eyes. When you reach Staten Island, just get off the boat, follow the signs through the terminal and go back down the entrance ramp (you'll get on the same boat when it next leaves). This time, move through the boat quickly to the front -- and take your photos (that you may have missed on the trip out) of the beautifully lighted Statue of Liberty! Oh, yeah! I should mention that the round trip is FREE!"

As the boat pulls further and further away from Battery Park, the really tall buildings suddenly rise up above the others, until you are well of shore and their is a clear difference.It's all about perspective.

Take a couple hours in the afternoon & check out of one of the boat tours. Unparalleled views of the skyline, very relaxing (and I have a fear of water -- these boats are big, no worries) and you get a chance to just talk, maybe have a glass of wine, enjoy without the waiting & the hassles. And you see the Statue of Liberty from the perfect point of view - the water! Definitely a plus plus experience."

Midtown is very disappointing. Old grey buildings for the average of them. Special ones : Chrysler Building, Rockefeller Centre. Crossed the area from South to North and West to East.The Financial district is the place to be. Been 1 of the first 4000 foreigners to visit the One World Trade center, the highest tower. Beautiful architecture, nice and beautiful area. A must do. The best boat trip you can get of Circle Lines. A 1 hour trip on East and Hudson river to see that skyline of South Manhattan.

The great thing about seeing the skyline from the Staten Island Ferry, is that it takes it time travelling each way, meaning that you can really soak it up and appreciate it. If you're heading over to Staten Island, sit at the back of the ferry and vice versa coming the other way... we really enjoyed it and got a hugh number of photographs which came out really well.

The iconic Manhattan skyline is breathtaking, and can be seen from many venues. Obviously some go to the Top of the Rock at Rockefeller Center, some to the Empire State Building, and the freedom Tower (1 WTC) has just opened. CityPass has options for the first two; individually elevator rides are about $32.  The skyline is also appreciated on a trip to the Statue of Liberty (or at. Isn't from the water is CircleLine tours, or returning from Staten Island on the free ferry--all these see lower Manhattan. Walking back from DUMBO over the Brooklyn abridge at sunset or at night also gives a great view of lower Manhattan skyline. Finally, walking along Broadway in the Financial district (start at Battery Park and the famous bull is at 23 Broadway, and veer to 5th Avenue at a Washington Park and head north past Empire State Bldg at 34th and Midtown to the Plaza Hotel, FAO Schwartz and Apple at 59th/Central Park. Or veer back to B'way at 42nd. Night skyline when many buildins lit is a sight."

It is, without doubt, the world's most famous skyline. And deservedly so. Dramatic, majestic, awe-inspiring, powerful...these are just a few of the many adjectives that attempt to convey what you feel when seeing the Manhattan skyline for the first time. And as many times as I have seen it over the years, and it must be tens of thousands by now, I continue to be stunned by its magnificence, each time still feeling that thrill of a chill running up and down my spine. Who would not be overwhelmed by its towering spires piercing the sky, fearlessly and courageously standing tall, thumbing its nose at the rest of the world with that irrepressible New York attitude. To wax lyrical in describing New York's skyline is a well-deserved tribute to a sight in its entirety that is truly without equal. Whichever way you choose to see it, it will take your breath away. Because it is more than you could ever imagine. Welcome to New York."

The walkway connecting hoboken to grove street is great and I have seen people strolling in the night too (though I do not recommend very late night for travellers). Newport pavonia is residential so generally safe if you want to sit and watch the skyline and also watch the ferries go by. Another place to sit and watch the skyline is peace is boulevard east (there is a garden right near the hudson river). Great views of george washington bridge as well. Great for a couple :)"

For the best views, get a water taxi or one of the public taxi shuttles that go to Brooklyn. It's so much cheaper, so much less crowded, and will allow you to enjoy the skyline with other New Yorkers. The free ferry to Staten Island is also worth hopping on if only to see the Grand Old Lady in the harbour."

The best way to experience the city is to walk its many varying neighborhoods. The best place to experience its skyline, in my opinion, is from across the Hudson. Take a hike, or a car, to the Palisades (themselves worth seeing, both as in the Palisades Park and from across the Hudson, from Manhattan) and look toward Manhattan. Then repeat the visit at night, when the lights are lit in the countless towers and apartments of the city. Then store the memory."

The added height of the liner gives really great views, including Brooklyn bridge.Skyscrapers don't normally do it for me but the view from the sea can only be marvelled at. Looking down from the Top of the Rock,as we did on our trip, was great but here you have no ugly sights on top of the buildings just clean lines stretching to the clear blue cloudless sky with seemingly endless helicopters buzzing around.

Although it seemed as thought there may have been 500 people waiting to get on the ferry, (and probably was) it was easy access, lots of seating and we all got on board.

And half way through, you can stop off in one of the trackside bars and get yourself a cider to cool down.

If you are in central or downtown Manhattan, the impressively tall structures block your view of the larger whole. You could go to the Top of the Rock (in Rockefeller Center), the Empire State Building, or the new World Trade Center building for spectacular views looking down, and I recommend that you do so. But there's a lot to be said for viewing all of Manhattan's skyline from outside Manhattan.Good ways to do this are by boat (e.g., the Staten Island Ferry or a Circle Line ride), or by simply crossing the Hudson to New Jersey or the East River to Brooklyn or Queens. From any of these places you'll get great views of the Manhattan skyline. It's equally impressive at daytime or night."

Whenever you happen to have a view of the skyline from wherever you are you have to take picture, after picture of it. It's simply stunning.I took photos from the bridge, Liberty Island and a ferry, and also the Empire State Building.The feeling in your tummy when gazing at this is unlike anything else, not even when I've been gazing at Paris from Montmarte did I feel this way, You'll love it! And make sure to take as many snaps as you can, but still bask in it's majesty with your own eyes."

On my first visit to The Waldorf, I had a wonderful view of Park Avenue which was a joy to see day and night. This time I was on the 13th. floor and although my view was the back of a building being renovated, however I had a lovely view of the Chrysler building. A friend in New York told me he never looked up at the tall buildings as it made him look like a tourist. I however loved the skyline and don't mind being identified as a tourist, that was why I was there, apart from celebrating my birthday. The skyline is pure New York City and I love it."

No matter how you take it in, there is nothing that beats any view of the beautiful Manhattan Skyline!"

Either way its going to cost you about 12 to 15 dollars. Its a ripoff so its better just to stay in New Jersey and get a good look at the skyline from there. Its also depressing to think of all the wealth tied up in the structures that might have been better spent elsewhere but its not for me to say how the rich spend their money."

When it comes to NYC, per my opinion, this looks better in the day than night which is more picturesque though. You would just want to gaze at the skyline in awe and do nothing else. The two trademarks - One World Trade Center and Empire State are easily visible and hold their respective importance. The presence of historic buildings makes it all the more amazing than other skylines of the world. If you are visiting NYC, do buy a portrait of the skyline for ur collection."

And the feeling is mesmerizing to get caught up in the energy and history of this vibrant city."

Many Bollywood movies shooting took place here, so its been a place I had to Go :)2. At Evening - Rockefeller Center - From the top of the Rock you get great view of whole New York City along and the color effects of Empire State Building as night falls, You can see Manhattan lighting up in different lights. Depending on sunset timing - 6-8 PM would be good enough to Witness the Evening & Night Views of Manhattan.3. Statue Of Liberty : Once you enjoy the cruise and land at State of Liberty you can have a another side view of Battery park of Manhattan.If you cover these three You can enjoy almost 90 % best possible views of NYC rest 10 % is for Chopper Ride ."

Our first glimpse of the skyline took place then, with major elements of the cityscape coming into view. We were staying in a bed-and-breakfast, in an apartment near Central Park that also offered a fantastic view of the city and framed each morning's first glimpse of the city from a penthouse view. The apartment was owned by a composer and musician who had worked with Elmer Bernstein, so it also was an amazing apartment filled with historical items such as photographs and incredible artwork. The arrangements for the stay had been made by our daughter-in-law who worked in New York, so our experiences certainly cannot be compared to any hotel stay. Imagine each morning, our host would prepare breakfast for us and then liven the day with recollections of his work with the famous conductor.There is so much to take in from the massive skyscrapers to majestic sights such as the Statue of Liberty, that we planned on another way to see the New York skyline. Seeing the buildings at street level, made for a neck-craning and mouth-gap \"tourist right here\" appearance. We opted for a harbour tour which allowed for a more leisurely pace around the city. We picked a time near the end of the day and on our last day because we now were more familiar with locales such as the Empire State Building.What a beautiful way to see the city- highly recommended."

There are countless places in this city to catch this picturesque skyline. In my opinion I would suggest you start in Long Island City and visit Gantry Park. This is a free attraction to visit and you can bring a picnic and enjoy the views. After you are done with your picnic jump on the East river ferry, which is a $4 ride during the weekdays, sit on the top deck and absorb the beauty that is the New York Skyline as you ride from Long Island City with views of midtown and you work your way south, passing under the Williamsburg bridge, Manhatten Bridge and Brooklyn Bridge. You will then disembark in the Wall street area and from there you can go visit the 911 memorial and the Freedom Tower. Depending on when you come you can then go up to the new observation deck in the freedom tower to see yet another perspective of the skyline."

Our NCL Cruise was starting in New York and sailing down to the Caribbean. It was a freezing cold day but it was very clear and although we had to wear scarves and gloves and thick padded coats we wouldn't have missed sailing out of New York and viewing the Manhattan Skyline for the World. We sailed out just as the light was changing and everything was bathed in an orange glow. It was an amazing experience, perhaps made more significant for us because we were stood up on deck next to someone from New York who was explaining his first hand experience of the awful day the Twin Towers collapsed. It was probably one of the most amazing sail outs from a Port I have ever experienced and the best way to view Manhattan. We sailed very slowly and I was able to photograph all the buildings I had wanted to see for many years. The view across to the Freedom Tower is something I will never forget. The colours were magnificent as all the lights in the buildings were starting to sparkle around it. The highlight for me came when we passed under the Bridge before we left New York and sailed out to sea. There were inches to spare between bridge and ship and the views back towards Manhatten were spectacular. If you really want to appreciate Manhattan this is probably one of the best ways to do it. We met many people from New York on our cruise who do this trip on a yearly basis and now I know why."

In combination with the water I think this is the most beautiful place to enjoy the view of the skyscrapers. You will also see Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty. When you arrive in Staten Island, just take the boat back to Manhattan to see it all over again.2: South bike line of the Manhattan bridge. The Manhattan bridge has to cycling/walking lanes, one north and one south. From the southern lane you have a perfect view of downtown NYC and the Brooklyn bridge. You can take great pictures here and it is far less crowed than the Brooklyn bridge. You can take the city bike to save time walking. 3: Brooklyn Bridge Park: This park is located at the waterfront in Brooklyn and allows to relax and enjoy the beautiful scenery. You have a great view of Manhattan, the Brooklyn and the Manhattan Bridge. 4: Top op the Rocks: In Midtown Manhattan, you will find Rockerfeller Centre. At the top of the skyscraper you have a beautiful view of the skyline. Not free of charge, but you have a 360 degree view. North Central park, south downtown. And the great hing it, you have a great view of the Empire state buiilding.5: Rooftop Bar. When you enjoy drinking cocktails and enjoying the view, try one of the manny rooftop bars in the evening. Make sure to dress up as most of the bars are fancy places. Also expect to pay around $15 a drink. But you have a great atmosphere and a rememberable night. Try Gansevoort Hotel in Meatpacking districk or lLe Bain in Chelsea"

I recommend several places to view it from. Taking the Statton Island Ferry gives you an amazing view of the tip of Manhattan and if you can do this just before sunset the buildings will glow in the golden sunshine. You also should drive across one of the rivers and get a view of Manhattan at night time, quite breathtaking. However it is hard to beat a view of Manhattan from the air where you can gauge the scale of the city and just marvel at how beautiful it is and the expanse of Central Park in the middle. Just writing this makes me long to go back to New York City."

Walking the many riverfront walkways and parks in these cities is also a remarkable experience. If you are close enough, a drive to any of these areas will not disappoint."

It is a safe place to walk around but, you are in a City, so take the usual precautions on personal safety. BE AWARE. The metro runs down to Manhatton from the City Centre.

Of course, a river cruise or chopper ride, as mentioned here in other reviews, will give you first-hand viewing, but just driving down the Palisades Interstate from the north offers a great view just before crossing the bridge into the city.No matter where you are in the vicinity of NYC, plan to stop a few minutes and appreciate the view of the Manhattan Skyline, particularly at night.

All I can say is the view is spectacular, and no specific sightline is any more or less breathtaking than any other. The 911 Memorial will leave you in tears, the Statue of Liberty will make you swell with pride, and even Wall Street will make you appreciate how busy - and old - this city is.If you go to Manhattan to see the sights, pray for sunny warm days and slight breezes.

The best view of the city(in my opinion) is from the top of The Rock, better probably than from the Empire State Building as when you are at the top of that you can't actually see it! Not an enormous queue either. Visited the landing stage where the immigrants landed from the ships in the early 1900's,very poignant for me to see where my Grandfather would have first stepped on American soil after running away from his wife and two children. We learnt such a lot on the trip but can't tell you what company the guide Geoff was from just that he was amazing!Was surprised to see how small the Statue of Liberty is but perhaps it is bigger when you approach by ship. Great to actually see Central Park from up there, quite amazing! The iconic postcard with men (in caps) sitting eating their lunch on a scaffold was actually taken when the Rock was being built, I did not realise that until I read it on the back of the postcard. I was thrilled to think I had been in that iconic place. Prepare to spend 2/3 hours up there just taking it all in. Amazing! Oh yes, the lift!!!! Breathtaking, watch the floor numbers change it is mind boggling!"

Try Brooklyn side as well especially opposite the three Manhattan Brooklyn bridges.

There is absolutely nothing like it on this Earth...the view of Manhattan on a clear night, as seen from the New Jersey side of the Hudson. The juxtaposition of nature's beauty and man's inspiring architectural creations makes for great photography. Get in the car and drive through Edgewater along the Hudson River, down past Palisades Hospital, down to Weehawken's Chart House. Everywhere the view takes your breath away. Just pull in a parking lot, and enjoy the majesty. George Washington Bridge up north, West Side Highway, Grant's Tomb, Riverside Church, midtown skyscrapers and the WTC downtown take on a special look in the clear night sky."

You can get a closer view from the top of Rockefeller Center or the Empire State Building, but many people probably don't realize you can get an excellent view of the skyline from New Jersey simply by taking one of the dozens of ferries. One of the easiest is from 42nd street near the Circle Line. Just one block down are the ferries that cost only $10 to get to Hoboken in less than 15 minutes. From there you can get a nice view of the city and on a nice day, I would suggest going just before sundown as you will get two different views. You will have the sun shining right on all of the buildings and slowly you get to see the lights come on. A picture with the sun setting and a picture during dusk and later will give you plenty of nice memories. And if you are hungry there are restaurant and coffee shops nearby. The ferries leave quite often and will get you back to the city in no time."

The tip of the classic Woolworth building is close to the proud, majestic Freedom Tower or iconic One World Trade Center (WTC), tallest skyscraper in the Western Hemisphere and 4th tallest world-wide. You pass by the recognizable Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges, see the colorful twinkling light program of the Empire State Building at 34th Street and stately United Nations building at the East River's waters edge. There are so many key sights to see. The glowing lights abound. Times Square is illiminated brightlight and further along you may see the Art Deco era spire of the blue hued Chrysler Building next to Grand Central Station. The sloped Citicorp Building can be seen near the Ed Koch Queensboro Bridge at 59th Street, and structures at Columbus Circle across Midtown Manhattan.

How to see it best depends on how much time and money you have to spend.At the high end is a helicopter tour around the city. Naturally these tours are very pricey, but they do offer a vantage point like none other and an incredible experience. Another pricey option: staying at the top of one of the hotels around Central Park and getting a room with a view.The most popular midrange option would be to go to the Empire State Building or Top of the Rock at Rockefeller Center--you'll get a great view also not available from the ground. However, you could also consider a tour on the Hudson or East River (i.e. New York Media Boat or similar), which is obviously much less crowded and personalized, and offer a chance to get out on the water to boot. At the lower end of the range, you can pay $5 for a ticket on the Ikea Ferry that shuttles between Manhattan and Brooklyn. For the price of a train ride you can go over to the Brooklyn waterfront, or also New Jersey. On the Jersey side, you can go to Liberty State Park for fantastic views of the World Trade Center, or just get off at the Exchange Place stop on the Path--the station is on the water and offers clear, close views of the Freedom Tower. Some good views are also available from the Newport path stop. If you have access to a car, you can drive to any number of overlooks--the one of the Palisades Parkway is quite popular, and that road is a pretty drive anyway, especially in autumn. Also, as others have mentioned, the Staten Island Ferry is free."

As the sun goes down and the lights come on, you could just sit and watch it endlessly! From here you can get a picture of the Brooklyn Bridge and the skyline and if you walk down the walkway, you may be able to get a pic of the statue of liberty herself. We had walked all day so I didn't make it that far. Another great view is when you are going to NJ through the Lincoln Tunnel. As you come out and up look to your right and get ready to snap some good pics! Beautiful!"

You can also get cheaper views from the river boats (such as the free south ferry) or accross the river from Brooklyn or New Jersey. If you take a metro to Brooklyn you can also check out the Brooklyn Bridge. If you plan to go to an attraction to specifically see the skyline it's good to go during end of the day before it starts getting darker. That way you'll see it in the daytime, evening and night.

As I look back at my first pictures and moments through this short time I can see the skyline ever changing. I love as I approach New York by plane and see the Skyline come into view, Manhattan all jammed onto one tiny island, it means I'm home! As far as viewing there are many free locations, local rooftop bars and garden restuarants. Top of the Rock is a favorite as you can see 360' in the crows nest and get the perfect view of the Empire State Building and there is no wait to go up. I recommend the day pass where you can go twice, at sunrise then at sunset and see the city change from day to night, the lights all turning on, it's amazing. Walk the Highline and get a great view of Flat Iron and Midtown districts. Any view from the water is great whether it be the Hudson or the East River. The Roosevelt Island Tram is great, especially for the price of a subway ride, it's a beautiful, magical city, enjoy the skyline."

You can always take a boat ride (Circle Line) or you can do what I think it is the best way. Take a cab from Manhattan to Brooklyn Heights. Do this in the late afternoon. Walk around. This area is filled with blocks upon blocks of beautiful brownstone homes. It will take you back in time. Just before dust, find your way to the Esplanade. This is very easy, head towards the East River. Anyone on the street can tell you how to get there. It is a short walk. Get there just before dusk. The Esplanade is a beautiful walkway with benches where you can look across the river and see lower Manhattan. It is now that you are transported from New York's past to New York's future.. While you sit there with the old brownstones behind you and see the sunsetting over Manhattan, the city lights will start going on. Then the magic of the New York Skyline happens. Make sure to do this on a weekday. During the weekend there aren't as many lights turned on in the office buildings. Try it, you'll love it!"

As a New Yorker born and bred and still living in NYC I think the best thing and the cheapest thing to do in NYC is absorb the streets, the atmosphere, the smells and characters of the city. I have traveled to many other cities abroad and in the USA and in no other can one interact and have an instant conversation with people as in NYC. New Yorkers are unafraid and open to all kinds of conversations and people especially those who begin by asking, \"I need some help. Can you tell me where ...name the street, spot, etc. is\"? The first NYorker will stop and help and if you don't get suggestions and directions from at least 5 others, I'd be totally shocked. We are very curious, gossipy, and helpful if only to find out where the person is from and how they like us. Tourists and many of those on the city streets are tourists, thankfully for the city's economy, are most welcome to New Yorkers. We love them. I have taken photos of tourists with their own cameras by the hundreds. I have seen the same thing done by other residents. What some tourists don't realize is that you can have more fun by walking around aimlessly, just looking and smelling the food stalls, sitting in parks, enjoying people watching, asking a few questions, watching street performers, and do it all for nothing, than you can have by standing in lines at various exhibits, restaurants, museums etc. When I go to a new city I walk all over, take local transportation, ask residents questions, and look for the cheapest meals going. In fact I avoid lines at all cost. New York itself is a beautiful place. Don't waste hard earned money by spending it on \"tourists traps\". Strike off on your own. Take buses up and down town and talk to the people next to you: \"I'm new here. Do you know a nice restaurant that doesn't cost too much and where is it?\" is one opening gambit. You can see so much from a public bus.Also, the famous Metropolitan Museum of Art, one of the best in the world on 5th Ave and 82nd street need not cost too much. If you read the admissions sign it only suggests the admission price. Anyone can give what they want to, in order to get in. I know because I have given $3.00 and no one said anything. Just a tip! Also, a gorgeous sight on a clear, even cold night is to go to the east river, and watch the lights across the river and look up in the sky. What a sight. You can even do that from Brooklyn Heights, which is downtown Brooklyn; a magical place to see Manhattan across the water. Another tip. If you don't know this already try this out. Eat at the NYC diners, usually on street corners of the city. We have many of them and they have great food and very moderate prices. Enjoy the city. You don't have to go broke doing it."

Sure, Paris has the Eiffel Tower, London has Big Ben and Sydney has the opera house.

If you can't view it from the air, the skyline can be enjoyed on the water. The \"Circleline\" ferry circumnavigates the entire island of Manhattan. It's not fancy, but the views and history are terrific. If you want to have an elegant experience, try the dinner cruises. If the water is not your preferred venue, you can see the skyline best from northern Brooklyn or Queens. There are several restaurants on the Brooklyn / Queens west coast that enable you to get a great view of Manhattan. Go just before sundown, so you can experience the sun going down behind the skyscrapers, creating a glow rivaling any great art. If you want to have the \"lived experience\" of the skyline, try the Water Club (on the East River at 30th St) or \"Top of the Rock\", high above Rockefeller Center. Why not try all the views? They are all spectacular."

Since then I have visited other big cities with amazing skylines and even have to admit that Hong Kong is much more impressive with its bigger and more modern constructions. Nevertheless, there is something to NY that makes it better than any other place. Definitely a must see at nught or at sunset (preferably by the lower east side)"

My best way was from the top of my 44 story apartment building, which gave a view above but also at the buildings, and at night, gave a spectacular view. From the original World Trade Center towers to the Woolworth building, Empire State building, Chrysler building, uptown and downtown, a 360 degree view.

Try to visit during sunset, you will see nice colors. (If you drive make sure you park on the proper side of the road. In most of the roads you can not park without zonal parking pass) If you want to come by public transport to Hamilton park from NYC, come to 33rd street herald square or WTC path station, take path train to Hoboken, then take light rail towards Tonnelle avenue and get down at Port Imperial and climb the stairs. - Hoboken, NJ.  - Exchange Place, NJ - Brooklyn Promenade, NY - Roosevelt Island, NY - Palisade avenue, Jersey City, NJ - Newport, NJ (Better if you know anybody in the Atlantic or any other high rise buildings)"

I did the free ferry trip on a lovely sunny day. On the return trip I was at the front of the ferry outside and took some gorgeous photos as we approached Manhattan. The skyscrapers are spectacular and the blend of old and new is perfect. I walked the Brooklyn Bridge at night and looking back at the Manhattan skyline is so pretty. You have yellow taxi's wizzing by and a glimpse of the Statue of Liberty in the distance. The buildings are all lit up and look so pretty. The fact that there are no ugly neon advertising signs make this a truly impressive view."

I woud have liked to have gone all thecway to the top but time was against us.A tip, we found the City Pass is worthcwhile as long as you have the time to visit more that 4 attractions, we ordered it on line and had to go and que up at their offices across town whichate up our time to visit the attractions and didnt get started until after 11am. If its possible get the pass delivered to your hotel, then you choose when you start."

Fascinating ride where I learned a lot about Manhattan, the areas and the history."

            "review": "Checked!. I grew up in a big city that I never had the urge to visit NYC. This year due to a big family gathering, we decided to meet them there and check it out. I was going to write an overall review about NYC but apparently I had to select an attraction. So, if you are looking for something specific, you may not find enough information here.As I predicted, NYC is like other big cities, but dirtier. The food may be great but we have our favorite restaurants back home that are very competitive, maybe except Chinese food. We had the best Chinese food in San Francisco, so NYC came a few years late. The thing I hate the most about NYC, apart from the piles of trash bags in every street corner and the rats, is the subway system. It's nothing like those in Asia or even Chicago. I have not been to DC or Boston but I think I can imagine. There are always delays and in many stations, if you going to the wrong direction and need to get off, you have to pay to change platforms. That is really not tourist friendly.We couldn't afford to stay at a hotel room in Manhattan, so we got a vacation rental in Brooklyn right by the station for $100. It was a very good price for 3 of us but I don't think we will ever do that again. The thing about vacation rental is that most of the owners live in their properties. They move out when someone is leasing it. Although they say they have clean sheets and towels, they are strangers. You don't know their living habits and you don't know what they clean and do not clean after every renter leaves. At least in hotels you know they clean the bathtubs and toilet bowls and provide clean towels and sheets. It's a phycology thing, I gather. It's better if we don't see it. For example, we were looking for extra blankets and found them in a closet with many other things... Well, maybe not every owner is like that. Honestly, if you can afford to stay anywhere in Manhattan and that's where you'll be most of the trip, do it. We got screwed by the rail system and taxis we ended up spending $50 a day for transportation between downtown and our place. Oh, I didn't mention the subway stations are not accessible. If your foot hurts, or you have difficulty walking but cannot afford a cab, you'll have to take the buses... providing you can walk to the bus stations.I've heard a lot about New Yorkers' attitude but the ones we encountered were very nice, except the box office staff for the cruise. We took the Watertaxi for a lower Manhattan ride. That was really nice. The staff was not when we asked for directions. Yeah, I know. Tourists are annoying everywhere. Ok, the Manhattan skyline. It's pretty, but other than some world famous landmarks it is not any prettier than Chicago and Hong Kong we have seen.We did not go to any broadway shows but we spent 2 hours in the M&M's store. That's the best time of the trip for me : )Now, will we go again? Unless we are attending a wedding of a family member, or Barry Gibb's concert, we probably won't go there again. Besides, we have been to New Orleans and San Francisco, we have hit all 3 unique cities in the US, mission accomplished!For you, if you like crowds, if you have not been to a big city, if you have not been to many cities in the world, please go. It's worth for you to have that experience."

If you are going to NYC then I strongly recommend you invest in a New York Pass - (not be be confused with the very limited NY City Pass) there are lots of different ones out there but we think this is the best. We spent $130 for a 2 day pass and got free access to virtually everything that we could possibly cram in to 2 days of our 4 day trip - you can purchase as many days as you want but in those 2 days we took a cruise to the statue of liberty, went around Liberty Island, Ellis Island, Empire State Building and the Sky Ride, Top of the Rock, Night Cruise round Manhatten, Museum of Modern Art and several other places too - we packed a lot into those 2 days!!!. When we added up the total cost of entry for where we had been over those two days with the NYP it was well over $230 PLUS it gave us discount on our purchases at several places along route as well !!! All in all, it saved us a huge packet !!! You can buy them online or from lots of places around NYC but I would strongly suggest that you look around online first because depending on where you buy it will depend on potential extra options - by that I mean ... we bought ours in NYC from the Water Taxi people but later found out that if we had purchased through Grayline we could have gotten a free 1 day hop-on hop-off bus tour or heavily discounted longer bus tour pass or if purchased at that time through Top of the Rock we could have gotten a free photo deal so do check out the different locations you wish to visit first online and see what they offer with the NY Pass deal before you buy. If you can find time to squeeze in a trip to Dylans candy store during your Pass days then go ... it is the biggest sweet shop you will ever see !!! And you get 15% off everything with your Pass !!! Save at least 1 day (not a Pass day though !) for shopping ! Don't forget at the till point to tell them you are a visitor as many of the stores (including Bloomingdales and Macys) give you an extra 10% discount ! Most importantly - wear really comfy footwear - you'll need them ! Have fun xxxx"

For a eastern view the best option would be the park at the bottom of Brooklyn Bridge, just walk across the bridge and stay on the southern side. For a western exposure I would suggest West New York, Boulevard East view, especially at night. If you are not familiar by crossing the East River, don't be intimidated, just catch the private buses on 42nd St at 8th Ave, ask if they go to \"Boulevard East\" and get off when you see the amazing view on you right. Return trip is the same, catch the frequent buses from across the street on Boulevard East. Other , more expensive options are of course the Rock and Empire State observatory. Empire State turned out to be a must for a first time visitor but avoid it afterwards, just like New Years Ball Dropping in the Times Square. The Rock (Rockefeller Center) is a more civilized trip but costs a lot. For a mid-town view go to the Central Park and stand a little north of the ice rink, you will catch great views of the Plaza Hotel and 59th St silhouette. Finally, for a downtown view either pay for an expensive boat trip/cruise, or catch the free Staten Island ferry from Battery Park. Oner Ayan"

I must say the new Freedom Tower still feels like it doesn\u2019t belong there and I am sure, that in time, we'll all get used to it, but I just must say that I miss the Twin towers in the skyline. To take in the views: - go to Brooklyn Prospect Park by walking the Brooklyn Bridge (visit the Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory below the Brooklyn Bridge \u2013 amazing) - go to the Roosevelt Island by the tram - take the Staten Island ferry - take the Circle line 3 hrs tour around Manhattan - go to the Top of the Rock and the Empire State Building - take the helicopter ride"

At dusk from Rockerfeller Centre. - gives you a feel of how majestic the skyline is during sunset and you have Empire state building in the frame2. Early morning from Libery Island or while on the ferry to Liberty island- an opportunity to have Statue of Liberty and one world trade center building3.

Newark was landing to the south-west that day, so our approach took us over parts of NY adjacent to the Bronx, then we turned right and were all lined up on a 10-mile final ILS approach to RWY 22L. Therefore, the final 10 miles we were flying south, parallel to the Hudson River, and I was able to get a stunning view of the ENTIRE skyline from ~ 3,000 feet.

Can't you see it in your mind? the water, then the camera sweeping in to focus on the skyline? We loved the time of this trip because although it had been a hot July day, the 7:00 sunset cruise was cool. Other things we saw on this cruise besides the Statue of Liberty and the Manhattan Skyline was the Brooklyn Bridge. See the photo below of the newest World Trade Center Bldg."

From the Staten Island Ferry (free Public transportation) which leaves Manhattan at the Southern tip, right next to Battery Park, you'll have a real Close-up of the skyline. Its from this angle you realise Manhatten is an island, With Hudson to the left (west) and East River on the other side. You miss some of the height of some of these high rises that makes Manhattan such an impressive town. When you enter the boat, walk upstairs and towards the far end of the boat (the one towards land). If you want a closer look at the Statue of Liberty, walk upstairs and to Your right. From the Brooklyn Height Promenade, you're obviously further away from the skyline. But you'll be rewarded With a view that's equally impressive. And for visitors in the summer, you can enjoy the views from one of the many benches in the shade. Last, and least, you'll see the Lower Manhattan high rises from the Brooklyn Bridge. Alas, as the walk way is in the middle of the bridge, views are restricted. At least when it comes to takng photos."

The Chart House in Weekhawken (reviewed separately, 5 stars every time) is a restaurant on a pier in Weehawken. I like to make my reservation about 30 minutes before sunset so I can watch the lights come on in the city. This is my preferred restaurant for business dinners, especially with out of town guests. The view is aligned with the Empire State Building.3. The third place is also in Weehawken at Hamilton Park on JFK Blvd. This park is up on a cliff and is aligned with mid town and I am convinced that most photos of midtown Manhattan are taken from this spot.I hope this helps you find your perfect view of Manhattan."

Each is special in a different way and each captivates and elicits a breathtaking response. While I've never personally seen the Hong Kong skyline and understand it is by far the densest of all the skylines in the world, for me the NYC and Chicago skylines are more impressive because of their sweeping views of the buildings from many different angles. On that basis it's difficult to separate the NYC and Chicago skylines since each is fantastic in its own right but for sheer awesomeness I'd have to give the NYC skyline the edge. The length of the skyline on both sides viewed from the Hudson and the East Rivers is incredible and very impressive. If you're a fan of architecture and skyscrapers in particular and are impressed by the sheer density and sweep of skylines NYC's is a must on everybody's list."

If you are in NYC some of the best skyline views are from Top of The Rock Observation in Rockerfeller Center or from the Roof top Cafe in the Metropolitan Museum. Other favorites are from the Beach Bar in South street seaport...Great view of Bridge. However my absolute favorite skyline views are from the NJ side. The Liberty House restaurant in NJ has a fantastic view of the skyline. The Chart House in Weehawken NJ or the Sheraton Weehawken Hotel are also just a ferry ride across from Manhattan. There are many others but these offer great views and great food and drinks in their respective locations. Enjoy"

(realize this is NOT a luxury coach ride or even as \"good\" as a typical city bus. people talk loudly to each other or on mobile phones, the music will frequently be blasting reggaeton or merenge and unless you love that music, you will want to gouge your ears off. and the ride is jerky and super uncomfortable, but for some will be worth the convenience and might be worth the urban cultural experience--sort of :-)http://www.jerseyjitneys.info/?page_id=30the more \"suitable\" option, but a bit less convenient is the NJT bus inside the port authority. takes some good gate navigation skills for each route but there are customer service desks both at the north and south buildings. these ones don't run as often or as late. the routes are 23, 128, 159, 165, 166, and 168 but check with ticketing or customer services inside the NY/NJ port authority terminal. cost now is $3.25 possibly went up recently."

WE had a long wall of glass overlooking the river and the skyline.We saw the bridge, Roosevelt Island and tram as well as the industrial part of that view. We always left before it got dark, so didn't get to appreciate the bright lights and all...but was still lovely all the same.Everyone should see this - at least once in their lifetime. Come to New York everyone! I also saw in Grand Central Terminal a picture with a quote that said...'a bad day in NY is better than a good day anywhere else'...I agree!!"

While exploring Manhattan on foot amid the tall skyscaper is an experience within itself; seeing the beautiful skyline from afar gives you a different perspective and leaves you in awe!There are primarily two ways to do seeing the Manhattan skyline and one of them is when you are doing a ferry ride tour of the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island. Most tourist undertake this tour, so its pretty easy to go about with it. When you are on the Liberty Island (which hosts the Statue of Liberty), go across from behind the statue facing New York City and you will h(ave some nice views. You can also get the views when you are on the ferry and depending on where you are seated (on the outside deck ofcourse) you could be facing it either while departing NY or on your return journey. However, given that these ferries run only during daytime, you may want to see its during the night time too when it is beautifully lit.For this purpose, I would recommend that you go across from Manhattan to Hoboken (a part of New Jersey state). You can either take a \"New Jersey Transit\" train from New York Penn Station or you can also the \"New York Waterway\" from midtown Manhattan. I would recommend the later since it throws you right into the perfect place to take in the views at night and the area is good for a stroll too. Incase you are into photography, there are some perfect spots there too for long-exposure photography and you would not want to miss the beautifully lit skyline of Manhattan from here.There are some nice cafe and dining out places too right by the coastline and if you are a fan of \"Cake Boss\" then do check out his exclusive bakery / cafe here for a quick bite of celebrity food!"

When you first see it, it's so amazing and then it has a feel of not being real, an illusion. You can't believe you are actually going to this place. An emotional time for me was our first visit after 9/11. I knew the look would be different, but still a beautiful sight. One of my favorite times to view the skyline is at night. I've been on the Hudson River dinner cruises before and the skyline is just as awesome. I love to stand on the deck and view the scenery, taking everything in. Now that the Freedom Tower is complete, the skyline takes on a different look. It's as beautiful as ever, and there is a sense of pride that you feel. As we left from our last trip, I watched as we drove away. The sun had started to set and again I was in awe. I don't know when our next trip will be, but I know I'll be just as amazed as I was the first time that skyline came into view."

When the bus exits the Lincoln Tunnel, and drives around the bend, you will get THE BEST VIEW of Manhattan's WEST SIDE! The elevated view is great to snap a photo if you want. But, the view only lasts about 10 - 15 seconds depending on the speed. On a side note, the trip to IKEA is worth it especially if you like bottomless cups of coffee, inexpensive entrees that taste ok and/or watching planes take off/landing (lots at Newark Airport across the way). Plus, if nothing else, IKEA is a fun place to stroll and plop down on sofas and beds. Who knows you may pick up a frame for that great photo you just took. (Coming back, sit on the left side for an ok view-not as great as going, but ok. Buses operate every half-hour on Sat & Sun only.)The other great view is from the B/D train (Orange line) to Brooklyn because it crosses the Manhattan Bridge. You will see the Brooklyn Bridge and the NY skyline. Once in Brooklyn, make your way to DUMBO and enjoy some time on the riverside park and the view across the way. I understand there is a bike path there now which I have yet to try but it should give you a great view of Manhattan along the East River, as well.Another suggestion is the tram to Roosevelt Island. Surely, an aerial view of Manhattan's East Side and the island itself would be spectacular. Although I live here, I have yet to try it. I will this summer now that I am writing about it! :DFinally, the Staten Island Ferry is free and the best bargain for tourist who want to snap a photo of the Statue of Liberty fairly closeup.You will also have beautiful views of lower Manhattan's looming towers. Likewise, during the summer, two for one deal: Go to Governor's Island for a day of fun and spectacular views of Lower Manhattan and the Bridges of the East River. Sigh... so much to see, so much to do. I hope you have the time to take it all in. :) Enjoy!!"

The skyline is best viewed from across the Hudson River in NJ (Hoboken or Weehawken) where public walkways along the river are available to take in the views. There's also the Staten Island Ferry, which is a 30minute ride to/from Manhattan/SI (which is free) from where you'll get a great view of lower Manhattan and the Statue of Liberty.

My job is to location scout in NYC, so please believe me when I say I've seen every angle of the sky line.Everyone knows about the view from Brooklyn Promenade/Empire Fulton Ferry/Brooklyn Bridge park view in DUMBO just under the Brooklyn Bridge. It's a lovely view, and a great area to visit!But if you want a different view to show the folks at home, here are some options. (NOTE i'll share NJ views of the skyline another time if people are interested. This is just the 5 boroughs)Water Taxi Port - S WilliamsburgKent Ave between S 8th and S 11th St has a walk way to the East River Ferry, and a great view. A bit desolate down there. Safe, but best to travel by day if you are concerned.Grand Ferry Park - WilliamsburgUp the block there is a small park at Kent Ave and Grand St. Not the best park, not the best view, but interestingEast River State Park - WilliamsburgHere's an up and comer. Sometimes they have live music, and on a beautiful summer day you'll see Brooklynites hanging out in this park. Great place to chill with the view.Hunters Point South Park - LIC (Long Island City)This neighborhood has really changed! Great little upscale park in an area most tourists' don't seem to visit. Walk north in the park to\u2026Gantry State Park - LICIf you went to Hunter Point, you are all ready here. Why not walk a bit further North and see the famous Coke a Cola sign!Queens Bridge Park - QueensVernon Blvd and 41st Ave. Just under the 59th St bridge.Can be a bit sketcher here, especially at night, but this makes it one of the unvisited views. On summer nights, you can often catch locals playing baseball NYC style on the various ball fields. Proceed with a smidgeon of caution here. Be aware of your surroundings, don't leave cameras hanging out, and don't go alone. It's not really that bad, but better safe than sorry.And now, the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance!Roosevelt Island - Look it up!Go to 59th St and 2nd Ave in Manhattan, take the tram across the river to Roosevelt Island. Travel to the southern tip for great views and the old Small Pox hospital, or north to the park with the light house.http://www.rihs.us/landmarks/renwick.html just to get you inspired.The whole island is like nothing in NYC. Not super cool or flashy, but one of a kind.Bonus points if you can find the original farm house. (The whole island was once owned by a single family. Try forgetting something at the market when you have to row across the east river!)Truly worth the effort to get here.Enjoy!"

            "review": "There truly is nothing like it!. I've been visiting New York City from my younger years, and I lived there for years too; it is my second hometown. Yet every time I see the Manhattan skyline, I am still amazed at the scale of the skyscrapers, the variety of architectural styles, and the city life that the buildings sustain. And the ongoing changes to the skyline, for better or worse (the destruction of the old Twin Towers on 9/11, the construction of new buildings including Bank of America Tower and the new World Trade Center), are a reminder that time does not stand still, and neither does life in New York City.There are lots of good ways to enjoy the skyline too. The touristy way, Circle Line around Manhattan, is quite good, thanks to some nooks and crannies (and on-board narrations) that reveal some hidden details that most people overlook. A free ride on the Staten Island Ferry is also an excellent way to enjoy the Lower Manhattan views. Walking across the Brooklyn Bridge is probably my favorite way, though views from below the bridge along the East River waterfront are also excellent. Even glimpses from subway trains outside Manhattan (such as on the 7 train in Long Island City) are excellent.Sometimes instead of looking for big iconic skyscrapers such as the Empire State Building, I may look up from a park (such as Battery Park or Madison Square) and look at the architectural styles of the buildings surrounding me. And that's what I like about New York City; while just about any city these days can build a modern skyscraper, New York City is one of the few places in the world where skyscrapers also exist in older Neo-Gothic or Art Deco styles, and sometimes it's the cacophony of those different styles mixing together that makes New York City stand out.There truly is nothing like the Manhattan skyline. Enjoy the views to the fullest!"

I was extremely shocked that we were going on this ride around NYC. I had never been on a helicopter ride before. We were an hour early and we were so anxious to get on that we asked if their was any possibility to move up our reservation. The staff arranged it all and moved us up! They were amazing. They gave us instructions and went over some of the rules we had to follow and the next thing you know we are walking towards the helicopter. The wind blowing through my hair and the loud noise was a bit intimidating. However, I was looking forward to it. We got the best seats in the helicopter. Make sure you sit on the left side. You will get the best views of the statue of liberty and Manhattan. You can see ground zero, the Yankees stadium and the buildings. It is an amazing view. I would definitely recommend everyone to try this at least once. Loved it! :)"

We went to Times Square after a Broadway show which you get an idea of midtown Manhattan and the large skyscrapers around it. Then in the evening we went to Water's Edge restaurant in Long Island City which has an amazing view of midtown, including the UN and eastside buidlings - Empire State, CIticorp, etc.)Then after dinner we took a drive from Long Island City through McGuiness Blvd. to Williamsburg. From there we went to the DUMBO (down under the Manhattan Bridge overpass) and the Brooklyn Bridge park. Here even the road goes by an area unobstructed by any buildings and you can see the Manhattan downtown and bridge (of the Brooklyn and Manhattan bridges) skyline up close. You will recognize this view as many movies and New York shots shoot from this view.From there we took the local route south along the water until Atlantic avenue and then took the BQE north to the Brooklyn Bridge. The views all along the way are amazing. And driving on the Brooklyn Bridge into Manhattan you can not only see the skyline but up the East River with the other bridges and parts of Manhattan north.You can do this either daytime or nighttime. Just make sure the weather cooperates."

I paid and sat on a bus for about 20 minutes then got off as the bus took forever and decided to pull over for 15 minutes while they had a discussion. I kissed goodbye to the fare and decided to complete my tour on foot. It was a much better and more personal experience which finished at Ground Zero. I have been to most places in the world but this is by far my favorite city. I staged right in the centre of the city in Times Square and had the time on my life. I was also fortunate to work on a cruise ship for a couple of months and have pasted some excellent shots of the sky line as I came up the Hudson to Pier 88 early one morning. My best advice is to take some comfortable shoes and walk the city as you miss so much sitting on a bus and the shops in 5th Avenue are amazing as is Central Park and the must eat is a Cronut. They truly are a delicious pastry and something you are not able to buy anywhere else in the world."

I am very fortunate, since i live in the Penthouse apartment just off the ferry and get that view every evening - and watch the Empire State Building change its colors nightly (red and green for Christmas, Orange for Halloween, etc)."

We arrived at the heliport by yellow cab, ( a first ), and found that we had to queue for about half an hour to get our flight tickets validated and our lifejackets fitted etc. this in no way distracted from the trip as it was quite reassuring to listen to the safety procedures. It was quite surprising to see the number of helicopters on the deck, and the frequency with which they took off and landed. It is a very slick operation. The views were astounding , with three or four circuits around the Statue of Liberty, ( which was closed, as were all other public buildings, due to the budgetary problems ). The very friendly pilot took care that everybody on board had ample photo opportunities, and all too soon the trip was over. We flew with Liberty Helicopters, and although pricey, it was more than worth it."

The largest building in the midtown Skyline, the Empire State Building, looked magnificent in very bright green and red colors. The Manhattan Skyline is a thing of beauty and should not be missed. Another great view of the Skyline could be had when airlines flying into Newark Airport take a southern approach to the runway. If you are lucky enough to be on the left side of the plane you will get a great view of the midtown skyline, as well as the Freedom Tower in the financial district and also the Statue of Liberty.

The trip from JFK into the city gives you a stunning view with the empire states building standing out in the centre - they will not build around it, and it looks magnificent. The view looking south from the Rockerfeller centre give you the empire states building and the financial centre further on. I'd also recommend the Staten Island ferry but to be honest the list is endless. A tip - go up the Rockerfeller just before dark so you get both day and night views."

Nice is the walk on Brooklyn Bridge, but you can't make nice photo's because of the steel cables. Better walk to the other side, go right under the bridge and walk to Brooklyn Heights. Here you have the best view at Manhattan and the bridges. For the best light, go early in the morning (or get here for the most beautiful sunset!).Another way to enjoy the skyline, is to take the (free!) ferry to Staten Island from Battery Park, downtown Manhattan. Be sure to leave with the last daylight, so you can return in the dark."

Night or day, the free trip on the Staten Island Ferry is the best way to appreciate the sheer scale of the skyline. And wherever you stay, check and see if there is access to the roof.

The bedrock folded and compressed as a result of the collision to form a very solid base in those two areas and remained in place after the continents separated and the island was formed.

Doesn't matter if it's from the from East River, across the Hudson River in New Jersey or on the Staten Island Ferry across the NY Harbor. You simply stare and themagnificence of a man-made wonder. Some of the best memories I have are from theLong Island Expressway (the major highway towards Midtown). You drive West up a slighthill with a panoramic view then dip down towads the Midtown Tunnel entrance where thebuildings suddenly seem close enough to touch across the River. Or you can take one of the elevated train ride above Queens and simply watch as the skyline unfolds while your car is noisily lurching above the streets and traffic below. The skyline can be seen for miles in any direction. It is beautifully eerie on nights when the low clouds or fog partially obscure the building tops. For those of us who have been lucky enough, we have seen it from the passenger seat or Flight Deck seat of an aircraft on approach to New York's LaGuardia Airport. Whether you're on the ground or in the air, the perspective is amazing. It does not rival Giza, The Grand Canyon or the Amazon for natural beauty or grandeur. I't simply New York. That's why we live here and why we visit here."

We spent our New Years Eve on Hornblower - this experience was all about the view, and the view had it all. Music on Hornblower was awful, food so-so, service so-so, but still our New Years Eve was unforgettable, as we saw lights of New York and we were hypnotised by them.Next time, we took Stanton Island Ferry - free of charge - with our friends, on a sunny day in April.And again - the experience was amazing, we loved the view!I would not mind to take boat trip again - not for New Years Eve, but definitely next time in NYC I would like to have some jazz event on the boat, just to admire skyline again!"

When you're in Manhattan you don't really get to see the skyline, You're in it and, while many of the buildings are individually magnificent, you can't get a full impression. Throughout the city, the view is dominated by two buildings which appear in view, wherever you are. In Midtown, the Empire State Building looms over everything. Its not much taller than (say) the Chrysler Building but stands out more, by virtue of its position. Looking downtown it is One World Trade Center that captures the eye.To get the full impact of the view, you have to be outside it. The first views are likely to be the distant skyline seen from JFK or the view as you drive through Jersey City as you approach the Holland Tunnel. Both give quite a breathtaking impression.Luckily for tourists there are two separate ways to combine viewing this iconic skyline with other free tourist 'must see'sFirst, take a stroll across Brooklyn Bridge. There's a wide pedestrian walkway above the traffic so it's easy and safe. Looking back you will see the Financial District skyline on the left, with helicopters buzzing round the Wall Street Heliport like flies. Just below the bridge on that side are the historic sailing ships, docked at Pier 15. To the right Midtown is visible in the distance, beyond the Manhattan Bridge.The second option is to take the free Staten Island Ferry. There is a frequent service from the ferry terminal adjacent to Battery Park. Take up station on the deck on the starboard side (That's right, you landlubbers). As the ferry turns to the right on leaving the terminal, the view back to Manhattan is unforgettable. But don't go away. Stay where you are for a fabulous view of the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island as you pass them.I almost forgot the third free option. Go into Central Park. This is well worthwhile for its own sake, but looking back from one of the lawns or open spaces, the skyline of the Midtown will become printed on your eyeballs.There are other options, if you are prepared to pay. Helicopter tours take off from the previously mentioned heliport, for about $150 each, or you can go up to the viewing platforms of the Empire State Building or the Rockefeller Center (Top of the Rock) for $27 per head."

And the journey is free! This iconic city scene is a classic amongst all city views and your visit to New York would be missing a vital ingredient if you leave this out. Alternative ways to enjoy the view are from cruise boats, such as the ones out to Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty. However, if you savour the view in daylight it is nothing compared with the Manhattan skyline at night. The ferry and boat cruises offer great aspects but so too do some excellent restaurants on the edge of Brooklyn. The walk across the Brooklyn Bridge to Manhattan is also a fine experience and an excellent viewing opportunity."

We took a Statue of Liberty cruise in the harbour which provides that added feature of seeing the viewing the skyline from many angles and vantage points. Having seen it prior to the devastation of 9/11 the absence of the \"twin towers\" was saddening yet seeing the new construction rising from those spaces and adding to the historic beauty of the Empire State Building, Chrysler Tower and so many other buildings just makes it more exciting and speaks to the need for a return trip as the new buildings are completed (2016 - 2020). The skyline is an impressive melange of time periods, architectural styles and building materials. It will leave you breathless."

The local saying is that \"you can tell you are from NJ when you can see the NYC skyline from the top of every hill.\" This is true. At the top of hills on roads in Passaic/Bergen counties you can see the skyline. I guess it is about 15 - 20 miles away. This is especially true from the hill on Rt. 208 in Hawthorne and Rt. 3 going towards the Linclon tunnel."

You can't appreciate just how beautiful a cityscape this is until you're standing there, meditatively reflecting on Manhattan's gleaming, soaring monuments.The best way to experience the Lower Manhattan skyline is to get the train to Brooklyn, then walk over the bridge back to the island. No point walking the other way, with your back to this most spectacular of views.During my week of exploring Manhattan, I fell in love with the attitude of New Yorkers: the honesty, the normality, the total lack of \"better than you\" mentality you get from so many big city dwellers.New Yorkers are surprisingly modest, and despite it's grand scale, the Manhattan skyline somehow illustrates this modesty. You don't feel overwhelmed, you don't feel like \"a little person\", you never feel inferior. You feel a part of it. Manhattan is welcoming; from the people to the architecture, the minute you land on this incredible island, you instantly feel at home."

Probably the best place to overview the skyline of Manhattan, New York is from Union City on the westside of the Hudson river. The uphill park in the area of Union City provides stunning views on the Manhattan skyline, and even better, it is free and very quiet (not crowded at all). The best time will be just before sunset till it gets dark.How to get there:- Take the bus saying \"Paterson/NY\" at the front of the New York Times building, near Times Square ($3 one way). It takes you through the Lincoln tunnel within 10-15 minutes (depending on the traffic)- Get off at the first stop after the tunnel (Park Ave) and walk up park ave and go to the right at Highwood Terrace- At the end of this road you will find Hamilton Park. ENJOY THE VIEW!- To get back, take the same bus on the opposite side of the road through the tunnel"

Its amazing really, and the extra thing the photos don't let you experience, is the noise... almost a constant buzz from millions of people, cars, helicopter,s sirens all mixed together into a haze of sound, its incredible and I really love this aspect of manhattan.The other alternative, is take the staten island ferry, and watch the manhattan skyline behind you, or alternately on the return journey watch the skyline approach - with the added bonus of the statue of liberty of to the side also, and its free!! The best freebie in NYC for sure!Try both i you have the time, you will not be disappointed with either!"

The best views are from the top of the rock at night especially around 11 pm, closes at midnight, and the other great location is form the reservoir near 96th and Columbus, especially on a clear night.The circle line which is the harbour lights is another good way to see it, but make sure you are on the left side of the deck as you board, as the views on the way out are all on the left side and as the cruise comes back, it is on the right side, but by then the guided portion is pretty much done and it gets kinda chilly."

Looking at NY's westside skyline from New Jersey you'll see a spectacular site, particularly when the sun is setting behind you and reflecting its colors in the glass walled skyscrapers. If you're impressed then you need to see the eastern skyline as well. The best place to see it is from just above the Brooklyn waterfront on the promenade in Brooklyn Heights. Go well before noon when the sun is high, lighting the face of the buildings and you'll be in for a treat better than the NJ view because the East River is so much narrower than the Hudson. Then go back at night and you'll see completely different spectacle. The buildings disappear in the dark sky but are emphasized by the lighted office windows where night staffs are busy working."

Following the advice of others, we printed out our tickets from the Rockefeller Center website, and although the tickets were for a specific time period, no one seemed to bother checking. We avoided a long line of those who needed to purchase tickets, and were on the fast elevator almost immediately on our arrival.The trip to the top is fast, and having done the wait and ride up to the Empire State Building, must agree with others that this trip was tops. You can take photos above the glassed-in area, since there are two levels above the floor where the elevators take you. The view south, of the Empire State Building, Statue of Liberty, and No. 1 World Trade Center, is great, and looking north at Central Park and the rest of Manhattan is pretty impressive as well.We all wished we had time to ride up at sunset, to watch all the lights go on--and a nighttime trip wouldn't be bad either. We'll have to save those rides for next time."

Due to recent political developments in NYC relating to the NYC Police Department and Stop Frisk which kept the residents and tourists safe has come under intense scrutiny. NYPD officers publicly stated that they will no longer go above and beyond to pro actively pursue criminals to PREVENT CRIME for fear of being sued for their actions. Some potential criminals have already rejoiced in this decision.This decision will have a negative impact on tourism because it is anticipated that the crime rate will rise substantially and mass police retirements in the next few years are anticipated. Please advise potential travelers to NYC take extra safety precautions when visiting, travelers checks, sight see in groups. do not go off alone and some common sense measures.In summary, police are not permitted to stop individuals whom just appear to be acting in a suspicious manner unless there is an actual crime in progress.  I urge Trip Advisor to please post this commentary so visitors can enjoy a safe visit. My many years experience as a NYC Police Officer and Detective should be considered since I have dealt with many crime victims when Police were told to lax some police enforcement duties in 1980's thru 1990's when the homicide rate climbed to 2000 per year as opposed to the past few years of just a few hundred. I too travel with my family and read Trip Advisor's reviews and want to feel safe when Im traveling."

Afterwards there are some nice walking areas on Pier 42, and you can also rent bikes there if you wish (bike path all the way along the shoreline)"

To me, this was one of the most beautiful views of the Manhattan skyline aside from arriving on the airplane or the Staten Island Ferry. This park was great. I would have loved to brought the picnic basket and a frisbee for a nice afternoon. I am personally from Houston (the wife from NYC) and I use to think that Houston had alot of big buildings but it has nothing in comparison to this concrete jungle. It amazes me about how far engineering and technology have come in the past 200 years. Have fun!"

The view from the Staten Island Ferry is also Phenomenal but you have to fight for a good spot, pushed around a little. If you can deal with that, it is worth it.From the Brooklyn side the view is also Fantastic with The Manhattan and Brooklyn bridges. But the best view of the NYC Skyline is around Hamilton Park area on JF Kennedy Boulevard East in New Jersey. The best time to view the skyline from there is to get there 1-2 hours before sundown so you can take pictures while it is still Daylight and also catch the reflection on the buildings from the sun as it sets behind you and then watch the lights from the Skyscrapers emerge and get stronger as the Dusk turns in to darkness. It is something that has to be experienced with your own eyes."

It's been recognized as awe inspiring since the early 1900s. One of my fondest memories was of returning to New York by ship, on a vessel loaded with Europeans and noticing the stillness that came over them as the ship headed up the harbor, past the Statue of Liberty, as the full force of the skyline came into view. For me it was just home, but i could see on their faces looks of awe and even some fear. The hole left by the collapse of the Twin Towers is almost filled and many new buildings have joined the party since that day in the harbor, but the skyline continues to be one of the most striking man made things on this earth.Incidentally, there are two skyline views. One is better known than the other. The best known is the harbor view, best seen from the water (either on the Staten Island ferry or a tour boat) or from a neighboring land mass (Brooklyn, staten Island, Liberty Island or NJ). The less known is known as the inner skyline and is the view of midtown, best seen from inside Central Park. Good vantage points for this view are the road at the north end of Sheep Meadow or the road that crosses the park at the north end of the Great Lawn at approximately 84th street. The latter has the added charm of including Belvedere Castle in the vista. I'm referring here to roads within the park, not to the transverse toads, which are all sunken below park level. While on them you can see nothing but their retaining walls."

However, when compared to the East Side of the river, its only a mid-level building....absolutely nothing special at all.While you can walk around with your neck turned to the sky, to truly understand the scope of the New York City skyline, you need to get out of the City. Free options include the Staten Island Ferry (great views of Lower Manhattan), the Brooklyn Prominade, any subway that goes on the Manhattan or Williamsburg Bridge. One can also take the Circle Line Ferry (a costly option, but an interesting one)."

Being an elongated, narrow north/south island, Manhattan actually has any number of wildly disparate skylines, so it depends on what you're looking at and where from. For this lifelong New Yorker, Manhattan is best viewed (a) from the air, in a helicopter tour, (b) from the water, almost anywhere but especially in the bay around its southern tip -- so you get to feel just a little of the awe and majesty of one of the world's greatest natural harbors, (c) from the Brooklyn Heights Promenade, and especially (d) at a window table at the River Caf\u00e9 -- destroyed by Superstorm Sandy but due to reopen around Labor Day 2013. The trick is to time your reservation around sunset if at all possible, so you can watch the sun disappear behind the Manhattan skyline, and see all its lights come up. One of New York's -- nay, the world's -- most beautiful experiences."

I am sorry I never got to witness it before 911 with the Twin Towers, but this is one of the most magnificent sights you can ever see. I'm originally from Los Angeles and thought L.A. was big! It's nothing compared to New York City. My cousin who has lived there all of his 40 years told me he is sad because there is so much to see, so much to do, that he can't see or do all of it in his lifetime. I now understand. The buildings are so beautiful and NYC is packed with history. Manhattan is something you must do."

Go to the top - top of the Empire State Building, or Top of the Rock. Each offers unique views of the various buildings surrounding you....2. Take a cruise in the harbor...we used Statue Harbor Cruises, which took us up a bit of the East River, as well as the Hudson - so we could get great views of the city.3. Walk - or drive - or take a subway - across the Brooklyn Bridge...there's a place at the foot of the bridge called \"Fulton's Landing\" - which offers a FANTASTIC view of the skyline. We did this at sunset - and it was incredible. 4. Visit the Rooftop Sculpture Garden at the Metropolitan Museum of Art - which will give you a unique view of the skyline as it looms over the trees and beauty of Central Park. Wherever you choose to see it - just soak it in and enjoy it...it's beautiful!"

This is a great place for a 4th of July meal or just to sit on the patio and take in the skyline with snacks and drinks. They have a good view from inside as well and you can go to the second floor. It has a cute Mexican d\u00e9cor. Best to come early evening to see all the stages of the sunset and the lights of the city turning on. check out the thatched ceiling and nicely decorated bathrooms.To get here: From New York City take:1. the Midtown/West 39 St. ferry to Port Imperial, Weehawken, New Jersey. $8 It is on all the little maps you find around New York and even has dotted lines for the path the ferry takesor 2. from World Financial Center Ferry to Port Imperial Weehawken, New Jersey $13or3. Pier 11/Wall St. to Port Imperial, Weehawken, New JerseyWhen you exit the front of the Port Imperial Ferry Terminal walk across the street. Go down the street towards the trains. Enter the walkway and go up the stairs that take you over the road to the trains. Do not descend down to the trains but keep going on the walkway. You will come to a high set of metal stairs. These stairs will take you up to the terrace above. You will see Charrito's from the top of the stairs. You will come to JFK Boulevard East with its great decorative wall and viewing areas. This is a very safe area and the best view as there is a large police presence here and the roads are blocked off on July 4th. My teenage daughter and I had a great birthday celebration here with the fireworks in the foreground as we sat and ate our supper. Make sure you get the ferry information for the last ferry back to New York before you leave the terminal. Great activity for a family with boys age 6 -18 years where the romantic parents want to see the skyline but the boys can use up their energy and be delighted by the short ferry ride and some snacks to fill them up."

            "review": "So much OF it! From so many angles.. I live in Manhattan but in all my years never 'did the Circle Line' until today, when my mom was in town on a bright summer day. I'd recommend that and will review it (with photos). But, how it relates is that I have a totally recharged appreciation now for the Manhattan Skyline, from so many perspectives. The classic sunset silhouette, with Empire State Building, Chrysler Building, WTC (once) etc. is the view from New Jersey, actually, across the Hudson River (Sunrise is quite nice for views from the East Side of Manhattan or Queens, and from some spots, sunset is awesome too, like from River Cafe (great place for a special occasion), under the Brooklyn Bridge, looking West at Sunset over Manhattan's East Side (and bridges). So circliing Manhattan on the boat today, after days of photographing classic 'skyscrapers' from the ground, and doing some touristy things (like Times Square), I saw the Empire State Building and Chrysler Building glistening in the sun, with the tour guide describing their conception and the rivalry between the two auto magnates for the tallest building. Now Manhattan is like a porcupine in the density of tall buildings. There's a new one (we also passed on the water), Freedom Tower, now completely built, and again there's some interesting history. All of New York has history, and taking it in from a skyline-level view makes sense. It's also beautiful, and an endless feast for artists, photographers, architects, and visitors. There's just too MUCH sklyline to review it as one monolithic attraction, IMHO. The attraction is the island of Manhattan itself, visually. See it from NY, NJ, the air, a tall building rooftop, or by boat. No wonder it is rated #1 attraction in New York. It IS New York. And 'the skyline' is iconic."

The first being the view from Hoboken. You can easily take the ferry from Battery park. It'll drop you right across the river. This place wasn't too crowded and isn't regularly frequented by tourists. Also, it's a great place to skip rocks! Walk along the shoreline and take the Path train back into the city. Another fairly obvious place to gaze at the skyline is Rockefeller Center. For about $20 you can take an express elevator all the way to the Top of Rockefeller Center. This is a must see and in my opinion, way better than the Empire State Building. It is recommended to either go during sunset or at night."

There is such a variety of building sizes and styles that it is a treat for the eyes. The views from the bus were short in duration, but my pictures let me revisit the skyline whenever I wish. Views from the Brooklyn Bridge were somewhat interrupted by the bridge support structures, but they were still impressive. Well worth the walk."

I've often wondered why the world's primary and most universally recognized skyline looks like it does and how it got where it is in the first place. For those somewhat unfamiliar with New York's skyline, there are actually in a sense two sectors blending together: the classic midtown (think Empire State & Chrysler buildings) and lower Manhattan (think-sadly-Twin Towers and resolutely Freedom Tower Trade Center). With those questions in mind , I did a bit of research and got some interesting information which hopefully others find worth knowing as well. Certainly there are thousands who were sooner and much more scientifically informed about all this than I, but for the rest of us, here goes .The fact is there were and are virtually no other potentially strong enough candidates beyond precisely where they're situated. The issue is rare behemoth density of an exacting type of bedrock. Not many places have the natural structural mineral underpinnings necessary to function as the subterranean foundation absolutely necessary to shoulder a small army of skyscrapers above.The next time you look at the New York skyline remind yourself that everything is absolutely where it belongs. Somehow that's even a bit more reassuring about the strength of this great city's signature skyline as a lasting symbol, in the face of whatever challenges, of both our collective local and national resolve ."

Secondly, You can get a beautiful shot of the Empire State Building from here as well.. You can even get the new Freedom Center.. and a GORGEOUS shot of Central Park"

Probably the best place to view it is from the top of Rockefeller Center (Top of the Rock). This puts you smack in the middle of the city with 360 views of everything, it is quite stunning. Also Top of the Rock has short lines and not wait, unlike the Empire State Bldg which is the exact opposite. The WTC is going to be opening it's observation deck soon as well so that will probably be a good option as well. A trip to Brooklyn is also a great option too, you can walk along the water and get a great view of Manhattan from there"

Come in via the George Washington Bridge and see NYC from upper Manhattan as you make your way to Midtown. Also avoid the Penna Turnpike. It sucks with toll booths and limited access.

From the top of Rockefeller Center, especially the highest outside viewing platform,the view was spectacular. It was especially cool seeing the Empire State Building from so high up just a short distance away. It was also beautiful viewing the skyline from the Harbor Cruise. It really gave a great perspective of where everything is in relation to everything else.We also had an interesting, but not as pretty a view, from the deck of the aircraft carrier Intrepid at the pier.But my favorote skyline view is and always has been, the view from Central Park looking out on all of the lovely buildings surrounding the park on all sides. I love to admire the Dakota, on the western side, with its appearance reminding me of its interesting past, the twin buildings nearby that look so regal, and of course, on the south side of the park, gazing at the beautiful Plaza, with its lovely mansard roof."

It doesn't matter if you see it from the observation deck of Empire State Building, the Top of the Rock (Rockefeller Center), Brooklyn Bridge, New Jersey or the water. There are so many high-rise buildings in Midtown and Lower Manhattan; it has the densest skyscrapers in the world. While walking in the city, you will see skyscrapers surrounding you and there are 92 of which standing taller than 600 feet (183 m). Currently, Empire State Building regained the title of the tallest building in the city after the World Trade Center towers were destroyed by terrorist attacks in 2001. The 1,776-foot (541 m) One World Trade Center will be the tallest building when it is completed in 2013.We had the chance to enjoy Manhattan Skyline from Empire State Building at dusk, Rockefeller Center at night, Brooklyn Bridge and water taxi during daytime. All of them are worthwhile for you to experience. If you want to have good photos, you need to adjust your settings when in the boat. It is very difficult to have a good photo at night if you do not have a tripod which is not allowed at observation decks of Empire State Building and Rockefeller Center. New York City is so amazing that you must see it yourself. You will recognize those scenes like you saw on countless movies and TV series. The boat ride on the Hudson River will let you see the unpredictable and surprising beauty of the skyline from different angles. You have to find for yourself the best spot to see the skyline you like and of course it will take lots of time and walks.Next time I will try to see New York City from New Jersey to discover its beauty during day and night. The same advice here is doing your homework before you go and you will see all what you want as planned. Enjoy your stay in the Big Apple."

The ferry is free and it sails past the Statue Of Liberty and provides excellent photo ops along the way. The skyline is breathtaking. There is no greater city on Earth than NYC and there are no words to adequately describe the view as you sail toward the forest of majestic buildings, some in the grand art deco style and some modern that symbolize the Big Apple. I highly recommend this trip but it's even more mind boggling at night. You'll want to make this trip several times during your stay just to take it all in."

When you come around the bend and look to your right, and there's the City, ah, it's fantastic. Magical. Insert your favorite superlative.Coming to Manhattan on the Staten Island Ferry is another great place to see the Skyline - however, there you are looking at it from the narrow southern end of the Island, and all the buildings are kind of scrunched together. Other great places to get a good view of Manhattan are coming over any of the eastern bridges (Brooklyn, Manhattan, Williamsburg, Queensborough) or approaching the Lincoln Tunnel from the west."

Bring a camera to take picture (but not at night because you can't see the skyline). The best places to see the Manhattan is Top of the Rock or one top of the Empire State Building."

I love watching people from out-of-town - some who have never seen such tall buildings. I'm always amazed myself! The thing I dislike about wandering in NYC is seeing garbage strewn here and there along the sidewalks and gutters, and the people who would rather bump into you than walk an inch out of the way. But all in all, NYC is an experience because the skyline is like no other."

The view you know so well from TV and feel like you know every building so well is just amazing, also along the way across the bridge, after the hoarding in place at the moment, there are rare views that offer brilliant photos. A must do is the view from Brooklyn. For you foodies out there who want that tradition NY pizza experience try Grimaldi's on your way back, it sits just under the bridge at Brooklyn and make amazing Pizza. This was our pit stop after an extra long walk from times Square. The address of the Pizza place is: 1 Front St New York, NY 11201, United States"

On previous trips I had viewed the NYC skyline from the Empire States Building (do during daylight as well as at night) and from the circle boat tour of Manhatten. When visiting in 2011, we ate at a very noisy restaurant (great food, but, we couldn't have a conversation). Our hosts suggested we have a dessert at the Beekman Tower Hotel just north of the UN. On the top floor of this Art Deco hotel, the view was superb. So, on this trip I stayed at One UN Plazza Hotel and asked for a room with a view - far nicer than a hotel room overlooking a brick wall. The views of the skyline A1 at night or during the day - especially waking up on the Sunday to a sprinkling of snow. Pure magic!"

Its fascinating to see how this little strip of land stands tall, the skyline yearning to touch the sky! Day or night - both are as great! One can never tire seeing it - every time you see it, you will want to take your camera out and take \"yet another shot\"! The Staten Island ferry is a great way to see the New York Harbour (and the Statue of Liberty from a distance) - and its free. The view of the Manhattan Skyline receding in front of your eyes is amazing. Haven't still gone on top of the Empire State Building or the Top of the Rock, but I am sure they would be just as special! Most cities have laser shows to highlight their skyline once darkness sets in...well, Manhattan doesn't need any special laser show! Its fascinating just the way it is! If you just had time to do one thing in New York, just spend that time seeing the Skyline. Whether you see it from the ferry or from top of the high-rise, its immaterial! It will thrill and excite you as much! :)"

I also thought it could have had more substance/detail - there is so much to NYC and i had hoped the ride would be more than just a ride - it is a greta learning opportunity but it was not maximized. I am still happy we did it - my daughter really enjoyed it and it also made the trip to the building worth it because the rest of our time in the building was very short - it was such a cold day, she looked in the binoculars for two seconds on the observatory deck and then wanted to get back inside!"

Had a good visit to St Patricks Cathedral and saw the Christmas Crib. Went to see Statue of liberty on ferry and Staton Island & Wall Street. Then went to see 9/11 Memorial which is looking very respectful and holds great sensitivity and dignity.Saw Brooklyn bridge and then went to art gallery/museum, however, this takes all day to get around!!! well worth a visit to New York, put it on your bucket list!!!u"

THE NEW YORK CITY SKYLINE FROM THE TOP OF ROCKEFELLER CENTER: www.topoftherocknyc.com NYC\u2019s skyline is rated the #1 NYC attraction by a lot of reviewers here, many of whom believe that sunset is the best time to view it. I agree. The top floors are called \u201cTop of the Rock\u201d. To avoid lines, get tickets in advance. I bought 2 adult tickets ($25 each) on-line when we were already in NYC. The ticket area took my confirmation # and printed our tickets, which we then took to the entrance. Since we wanted to be there at sunset, I chose our entry time by looking at this site: http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/astronomy.html?n=179&month=1&year=2013&obj=sun&afl=-12&day=1 I got entry tickets for 3:45 p.m. on January 3rd. Turns out, it was just perfect for not feeling rushed, seeing three 4-minute films (only available on the way to the top, not on the way down), walking around the top 3 floors, then watching twilight and the sunset. I LOVED watching the city lights come on slowly \u2013 in the buildings, on the bridges, in Central Park, and even the red and white streams of headlights and taillights \u2013 all so beautiful. We almost skipped the 3 little films, but are glad we didn\u2019t. Top of the Rock is open 8:00 a.m. to midnight, 7 days a week, 365 days a year despite weather conditions. They have a good FAQs page at http://www.topoftherocknyc.com/visitor/faq/ Phone #s are 212-698-2000 or 1-877-NYC-ROCK (877-692-7625)."

We changed hotels during our NY stay and our room on the 25th floor of the Double Tree at Hilton in 29th Avenue provided a wonderful view of the Empire State Building. We also enjoyed the Manhattan skyline from the Staton Island Ferry. The ferry pulls away from the Financial District (near Ground Zero) and travels past the State of Liberty to Staton Island. The ferry is free and is a comfortable ride. If you want to see the Manhattan Skyline, we suggest the ferry. Parts of the skyline can be seen from within Central Park."

I would suggest investing in a NYC guide book that outlines where many buildings are as you may be walking through an area and a block over may contain an interesting building that you may not be aware of. If flying into the city, especially into LaGuardia, make sure to look out the windows as the landing patterns can bring you in a couple of different ways from the South over Brooklyn and Queens with Manhattan on the left side, or up the Hudson with Manhattan on the right side."

You really get a great view from there (you are literally standing on a cliff overlooking the river) and it is really mesmerizing. The best time to be there is at dusk when the last sunlight reflects off all of the glass on the buildings. It really just does something to you.  This is not a well kept secret and it is usually crowded there so expect to park a block or so away from the cliff, unless you're lucky. For all you romantics out there, you should go to the ChartHouse restaurant in Weehawken which is about a 20 minute drive from the cliff. The restaurant is frequented by celebrities (I met Patrick Ewing there once), offers a great view of the Manhattan skyline, and in the summer, they have a deck outside that is right on the water. The dress attire is business casual, the food is a little pricey but is well worth it ( approx.$150 for drinks, entrees, appetizers and desserts for 2). If you really want to impress, this is the place to be....bar none."

One of my most favourite things to do when I go to NYC is to take the Circle Line Tour around Manhattan. Most of the time the guide is very informative and a person comes away with a better understanding of the building of a city and a nation. I would recommend this trip after a few days of walking to see the sights as it is a good time to give your legs a rest and see NYC. You can get snacks, coffee and beer on the trip and mostly you can relax and enjoy yourself!"

Even though we go to NYC yearly and lived there many years ago, we are still awed by the views. For those really interested in the views, I strongly recommend going to the Brooklyn Heights esplanade and looking back. I also think a trip on the Circle Line is great. Finally, go at dusk to the Top of the Rock at Rockefeller Center. This gives a great view from up high. Sunsets are great and you can get the Empire State Building in the picture."

It is Free and offers great views of the city skyline, the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island and the great Port of NYC. Whenever I am in the area, I hop of the ferry and make the return trip immediately. It takes a little over an hour but it is such a peaceful visual experience.

We travelled from Washington State for a wedding. Stayed 6 days. The night after we arrived we did a 3 hour \"night lights of NYC\". Next day did a 6 hour \"premimum tour of NYC\". In those 9 hours we saw everything there is to see. They also included 2 boat cruises.The Statue of Liberty & Ellis Island are awe inspiring. Ground Zero at first was a let down then realized it is meant to represent rebirth of a city & continuing on which it does. A carriage ride through Central Park was great. Two things very obvious - NYC loves their Yankees, John Lennon & Mayor Giuliani. We were lucky to see a few celebrities just walking down the street. They smiled & waved. Just going about their business. The people are so beautfiul everywhere you turn you wonder who you are seeing & just dont recognise. The food is outstanding - ANYWHERE.. Hells Kitchen is unbelievable. Found 2 wonderful lounges - one in the Marriott Hotel looking down at Time Square. The other next to Centeral Park in the Columbia Mall (Time Warner Building). It had the most amazing view of the park & the edge of tall buildings surrounding it. Such a contrast. Relaxing to sit & have drinks at both. I LOVE NYC. It should be a must see for everyone. Just as important to older children to have on the bucket list as Disneyland. Its the real deal folks."

Now if you are in New York, you need to know WHERE to go for the best shots, best views... My friends are so grateful when I take them out from the busy Times Square, crowded streets and superficial paid tours and show them where the best views of this great City can be caught.Of course, you can see the best on a clear day from the airplane before landing or right after departing, and also there's a breathtaking view from my apartment. But since I can not invite you all in my house, here are some great insider tips to see the best of New York's famous skyline. It has 2 parts: Downtown and Midtown & Upper Manhattan.The Downtown Skyline is amazingly viewable from Brooklyn Bridge Park (down under Brooklyn Bridge and Manhattan Bridge, in DUMBO, Brooklyn). Take A or C to High St. or F to York St and have a walk down to the park. (yes, there is also a bus, but don't be lazy, this new sparkling neighborhood worth to be seen). You can also see Downtown Skyline from the Staten Island Ferry (it's a free ride) or Statue Cruises Ferries ($17).Midtown is visible even from Lower Manhattan, from New York Marina (have a walk along the East River Park at around 23rd St, you can get here by M23 an M34 buses as well), but the best view is, of course from across the river, from Queens. Long Island City piers are just as amazing, just like the recently finished Williamsburg piers in Brooklyn. To get to LIC just take the 7 train to Vernon-Jackson, and again, don't be lazy to have a walk all the way down to the park. The now highly rated out-of-Manhattan neighborhood is just amazing.You can pay for a tour at Rockefeller center, on 86th floor's Top of the Rocks or just visit Empire State Building.If you insist to visit my house...all right, that's OK, I hear you. Just call ahead... I have to clean the dishes... :)Enjoy New York! Doesn't matter which Season, what kind of weather. New York is Stunning!"

            "review": "Not to be missed!. We were lucky to visit NYC when the visibility was good (late September 2012), so had plenty of opportunities to see the beautiful skyline. We went up both the Empire State Building (early morning) and Top of the Rock (just before sunset). Both were quite expensive and fairly crowded, but worth the hassle because of the views. On balance if I had to choose one, I'd go for ToTR, which is slightly more civilised, and which as a view of ESB! However, you will get a better view of the Chrysler Building from the ESB.However, there are plenty of places to get good and cheap (or free) views. Try going across Brooklyn Bridge and seeing the views from Brooklyn. Take the free Staten Island Ferry and get great views of Manhattan (and the Statue of Liberty) across the water. Go on the aerial tramway to Roosevelt Island - and walk along the western bank to get great views of the Empire State and Chrysler Buildings between other residential skyscrapers, as well as the UN Building.You must not visit New York City without searching out some good views of the iconic skyline!"

But the midtown harbor cruise provided the best views, plus awesome views of the bridges! So many iconic buildings; even though this was my first trip to NYC I recognized several of them."

You can't hardly wait to see the Empire State Building.There are so many stories to be told about the building it is interesting to read.All these tall buildings on one little island called Mahattan. Which was bought from the Indians. A good reading in history books.It's a magical place,busy and noisy but in a good happy way.There is so muxh to see and do. Alot of walking involved too."

If you want to take in a panoramic view of Manhattan and see the Statue of Liberty without the crowds, sneak over to Governors Island on the free ferry. Governors Island is one of those hidden gems where you can merge a history lesson with a great view of Manhattan at its finest. We recently took the ferry over to the island and enjoyed a sandwich and a beer on the manmade beach overlooking Manhattan. You can clearly see Liberty Island, Ellis Island, the Manhattan skyline, and the Brooklyn Bridge. After taking in a few tours and walking around, we took the ferry over to Brooklyn, had ice cream at the Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory, and then walked across the Brooklyn Bridge to take in more of the Manhattan skyline. The Manhattan skyline is a \u201cmust see\u201d for anyone who visits New York. Night or day, it is an amazing view!"

We saw the Manhattan Skyline from walking the streets, from atop the Empire State Building and Top of the Rock, from a boat cruise around Manhattan, from the top of the Metropolitan Art Museum, from the grandstand in Times Square, from under the ground via subway, and from our hotel room which looked upon the top reaches of the Empire State Building. Obviously this skyline is not going anywhere and it's so in your face where ever you might be, but it still took our breath away with each view, and no two are the same. I was truly surprised with how clean the city is. You will find plastic bags of trash piled up waiting to be removed, daily, but litter is not prevalent along the streets. We walked and walked and walked the city, and thank goodness we brought good walking shoes. NYC is no time to go glamorous with your shoes. We expected to see many glamorous native New Yorkers walking the streets, but found only hardworking people of all ages, races, and gender, just like us, only slightly less patient, especially when you get in their way on the sidewalk. Most everyone we encountered was polite and helpful, not condescending or rude. I really was impressed with the city and although I would not want to live here, I do see why many others would. It really is a paradoxical city - very much representative of the rest of us in the country (albeit without our sense of moderation), yet very very different then the rest of us. I may come back to visit again someday, but maybe not as there are so many other places to visit. I am glad to have been here at least once in my lifetime. If I do come back it will be to visit the 9-11 museum when it is finished. That will be a tearjerker of a site. In this regard, we are all New Yorkers."

The location there is 300-feet above the River, looking straight on at the towers of Midtown Manhattan. New Jersey Transit Buses #128, 165, and 166 run every 5-to-20-minutes, 7 days a week, leaving Gate 212 of the Port Authority Bus Terminal (8th Ave & 42nd Street). Ask the bus driver to let you off at \u2018Blvd. East\u2019 & \u2018Duer Place\u2019 (this is the first stop along Hamilton Park). The neighborhood by the park consists of pleasant homes. Buy tickets for going and returning at the bus terminal in NY. Fare is $3.20 each way for an adult; less for seniors and children. Mid-to-late afternoon sunshine gives you terrific photos. This is a really a fantastic (and short) journey on a bright sunny day. See photo below from Wikipedia \"Boulevard East\"."

The night-time view of the Financial District from the Promenade in Brooklyn Heights, with the East River bridges in the foreground, the Statue of Liberty in the Harbor, and 1 World Trade towering over from the West Side, is always humbling to me, although I've lived here all my life."

We arrived later in the afternoon, and found a restaurant called the Waterside. Our table had a view of the city that was extraordinary. The skyline was beautiful during the late afternoon. As the sun set, the windows reflected the golden sun, and finally as dusk settled, the twinkling lights of the city reflected the beauty of amazing NYC. Took the ferry back to Manhattan, just as the Intrepid let off a fireworks display. Then we hopped the \"free Waterway Bus\" ( it is free with the $9 purchase of the ferry ticket. ) that took us back downtown and within a block of our hotel."

Don't miss this opportunity."

The view is so nice, especially at night and I have even taken friends there who are visiting NY. Another great view of the skyline is while driving on the BQE. Just don't look too long or else you may rear end the driver in front of you! I like the skyline best at night with all the twinkling lights. It's also fun to see what color will be lit up on the top of the Empire State Building--it changes according to the holiday."

When you are on the observation deck and you look around on a clear day, it such a wonderful sight you can see so much, like all the buildings,the rivers,central park, the bridges and the cars on the street looks like match box cars and the people looks likes ants. It is a really fun and cool place to see for the young and old. It a must see must visit to go."

The first day in NYC my wife and I walked about 4 miles trying to takein the skyline and the various neighborhoods and were exhausted at the end of the day. Plus, we had to contend with thousands of pedestrians and cars -- I know, that's New York, but I didn't like it. I hate crowds. The following two days we took the Gray Line Tours' Downtown and Uptown tours. Smartest thing we did. The driver does all the hard work while you take in the sights. The best part is you can hop off and on whenever you want, which gave us a chance to see things close up. Next time we go to New York we will have a much better idea of exactly what we want to see."

Pass the bridge on foot or by bike, then lay down in Brooklyn Bridge Park and enjoy the view with an ice cream. Another great place to enjoy nature and watch the skyline is central park. Skyline is smaller here, but nature is a little bigger.The skyline does get obscured by clouds at times. So choose a day with clear sky to watch the skyline. Meaning that a ride up the upper most deck on the Empire State Building (33/34th st - 5th avenue) will deliver you a crystal clear view all the way to Harlem and Brooklynn. Not just a foggy three hundred feet view. Another great view from the top is available at Top of the Rock (33/34th st - 5th avenue). Don't forget to watch the skyline at night as well."

Although Hong Kong's and to some degree San Francisco's skyline are more visually interesting, Manhattan is no slouch in the sheer man-made beauty category. And with the events of the last 10 years, the history quotient has been pushed upward dramatically making it one of the world's gems."

It literally shone like a beacon of modernity and commerce in the gloom of the early hour. Approached from the south by sea you get a glimpse of just how high the Manhattan skyline actually is which is lessened somewhat when you look down upon it from the Empire State or Rockefeller buildings although these views are also well worth taking in."

What an amazing pulse this city has! Like nothing we experienced before. What an amazing architecture, what an enormous wealth. How hard to make a life in this city. Grey Line bus tour, a 'spanish speaking' staff group, very poor service level, The guide, 'Juan', I believe, the only english speaker except for the driver who was not allowed to speak to the tourists, was good, nice touchy stories about the past overlapping a deep personal frustration. Tour proved to be too expensive and useless as it was extremely fast, didn't get to take pictures nor to hear complete stories. Wouldn't take this tour. Central park the jazz saxoplayer. Wow, great! Times Square, crazy dangerous place. Too many homeless, deviant, angry raging groups. I feel for the policemen facing them. Felt good to see them around watching over us.5-th avenue, nice sight. Empire state nice view at the top. Too many loose cheap deal buggers. The nicest personnel in stores at L'Occitane and the best European store - Italian food market:Eataly- the best cappuccino in a very long time.The best calzone. Very good chocolate and icecream, great salami and prosciutto!! . The Hotel, Club Quarters was clean and comfortable. The room was big enough and the kitchenette was well equipped. Dissapointing coffee, very expensive treats on a tray in the room, room 208 had a wall as a wiew and no sunlight at all, the terrace at floor 20 facing the memorial site is very small, don't be fooled by the pictures shown on the hotel's site, the restaurant is not high end at all and it felt liket those poor 3 spanish speaking bartenders were there only for the tip and not for work so it felt very weird, at 10 they were already preparing the place for closing while the closing time was at 11, felt like poor fellows shooting themselves in the foot. What a joke for a restaurant, too bad for the beautiful view of the skyline. Gorgeous view!. The fellows at the reception were nice. All in one, would go back or who knows, maybe I will choose the Hilton at next block? The walk back to the hotel was great for a Saturday late afternoon.The inconvenience caused only by the scaffolds all over the place, the rats running around from point A to point B especially at dusk, the crazy homeless around corners, the shouting spanish speaking workers whistling when they see an elegant woman, that about the downside. And then the view of the city, the Architecture, the pulsing life, the cabs running around like crazy, the skyscrapers, the stores, all great to experience all over again. Let's not forget the Statue cruise. Nice experience, felt a little dry though. Nice personnel at the giftshop ! Oh, and the security checks, very sensational. Were escorted by an army boat on our way to the island, never got why but they must have had reasons. Felt good though with all the security forces around, really good! Hope this helps!"

Here's a tip from a commuter - if you're ever in the Weehawken area, you'll have an excellent view, almost lined up in the center of the view (now this is towards Lincoln Tunnel, so be careful with the traffic). If you enjoy taking photos, definitely find a water tour, cruise, or just the water taxis. Always check out the colors of the Empire State Building- it changes often and you can google why the colors are the way they are at any time - for instance, the next two weeks, the tower is multicolored to match the rings in the Olympic logo.Definitely hop on one of the tours and try to catch a view from the water and NJ."

You get the views of the cool buildings because you aren't on top of the tallest ones.#3 = Top of the Standard Hotel. If you can manage to get into a roof top party day or night, this is a unique view of the city in all directions. Downtown, the Hudson, and Midtown are all in different directions and you are positioned high up to see it all."

Washington on the NY side date back the the beginning of the revolution when the English drove Washington's army out of NY. His top General (Lee...father of the famous Civil War General Robert E. Lee) held the NJ side while Washington held the NY side....hence the names Ft. Lee and Ft. Washington.

It's a 90-minute cruise which leaves from pier 78 and goes around the financial district on the East River to United Nations building. Back down to Statue of Liberty to end again at Pier 78. There is somebody onboard to point out interesting buildings. In our case this was a really entertaining and knowledgeable person. We enjoyed the cruise, sights are beautiful and we have some really nice pictures. The skyline is fantastic!Other option off course is Brooklyn Promenade which is free."

Alternately get the PATH to Hoboken which is worth visiting in itself. Walk North up from the station up along Frank Sinatra Drive for a stunning view of Chelsea and Midtown. After the hustle and bustle of Manhattan, Hoboken is refreshingly quiet and using a tripod is no problem. One word of caution, the PATH doesn't run throughout the night so check the times before you head over."

From our experience, the best way to view the Manhattan Skyline is through:a) Taking a boat cruise along the Hudson River.b) Visiting the Observatory at Empire State Building (or Rockefeller Centre, Top of the Rock). Either of these two will give you a great glimpse of the Manhattan Skyline looking north and south; the boat cruise has a night schedule and Empire State observatory is open until 0200 hours so I suggest you take a day visit and a night visit to maximize the Skyline view. This is not to miss when visiting NYC."

Or go on the weekend for free....make sure you time your ride back near sunset to see lower Manhattan in all it`s glory. An other option is to take the ferry from East 34th St to Brooklyn and Queens,ride down from the 1st stop in Queens to Dumbo in Brooklyn.....get off and enjoy wandering around that historic area...plenty of places to eat...all prices....visit the carousel, a bookstore or the few galleries,enjoy chocolate from Jacques Torres, then get another ticket back to the Wall Street area(great views) or in the summer continue on to Govenor`s Island where one can walk,rent a bike, or go on the jitney to explore the island, and take in the skyline views of lower Manhattan...also one can see the Statue of Liberty.

There's nothing but air between you and New York from the top of the Rock. It was a \"HIGH\" point during our week in New York."

It's always changing, yet it is always familiar. My wife and I are lucky to live in NJ, where some of the best views are available. We have seen it from the Jersey City waterfront, as it comes into view on Route 3, and from Skyline Drive. Last night we saw it from the Lincoln Tunnel helix as the last daylight was fading. It's amazing how weather and changing light can make a familiar view seem brand new. Formerly, the WTC twin towers were the major landmark. Now the Freedom Tower is rising to bring a new life to the skyline."

I did not like it. Manhattan grew on me with time, however, and the skyline was one of the first things I fell in love with.If, like me, Manhattan fails to live up to your expectations at first, go see the skyline. If your love story with Manhattan is already going strong, go see the skyline. It'll only make it better. Schedule a dusk cruise, or better still, go to the Brooklyn Bridge Park or some similar remote location around that time, and watch as the city lights up against the darkening sky. It's magical. It's romantic. In my book, it ranks among some of the most beautiful sights on earth."

Four of my favorite places to view the Manhattan skyline from are, not surprisingly, in New Jersey (born and raised, but soon to be an ex-patriot).1. Hoboken: The little Hudson Riverside \"pier\" next to the Castle Point Skate park on Frank Sinatra Dr.BONUS: Besides the view there is the shaded canopy and benches that make relaxing as you the visit even more pleasant.2. Liberty State Park, NJ - Terrific views of the financial district. If you go to the end of the drive you can park free for up to 2 hours instead of the longer term lot where you park if taking the ferries to Ellis Island or Statue of Liberty.BONUS: Take in the NJ 9/11 Memorial that frames the 9/11 site and the new World Financial Tower and stop in the beautifully restored Jersey Central Railway Depot.3. Weehawken Heights: The last exit in NJ before the Lincoln Tunnel, off Rt. 3 and a left at the 2nd light will take you to a terrific elevated view of midtown opposite the cruise terminals and aircraft carrier Intrepid as well as the site of the Hamilton-Burr duel where Alexander Hamilton lost his life. You can usually find a place to park along JFK Blvd. History with a view... what a free deal!4. Rockefeller Lookout - Off the Palisades Interstate Parkway near the George Washington Bridge (about 1 mi. north). A view of the Westchester County, the Bronx and northern tip of Manhattan (look for the Cloisters in Fort Tryon Park).BONUS: About 2 mi. north is exit 2 which you can use to drive down to the river and along the base of the Palisades. There is a boat basin where you can park for an excellent view of the GW Bridge and a surprisingly bucolic drive along Henry Hudson Dr. as well as a few small waterfalls (if there's been some rain). Best of all you can pull over under the GW Bridge for an awesome view form a most unusual angle. Finally as you reach the end there is a historic center with displays and information about the Revolutionary War and George Washington."

I still firmly believe that NYC has one of the best skylines in the entire world, a skyline you should see during the day and at night. And don't be turned off by rain, as long as it's not sheeting down, you might get some great cloud views as the rain breaks up. Even foggy views are pretty neat because to watch the skyline get gobbled by fog is kind of freaky and sci-fiction like...and fog doesn't usually last too long so try again later in the day or the next day to get the clear views. The places I recommend viewing are: Manhattan Bridge pedestrian path (or take the Q/N/D/B across the bridge); Brooklyn Bridge pedestrian path; Brooklyn Heights promenade; Roosevelt Island; Staten Island ferry; Long Island City; 59th Street Bridge (if you can handle the noise of the traffic); Williamsburg Bridge (even with the mesh barriers it's still a fantastic view and don't forget about New Jersey either. Take a water taxi across the river or the path train and wander the water front. Fantastic views."

So we went for crossing the East River on the Brooklyn Bridge.This is, as I recall, the first serious bridge built between Manhattan and Brooklyn. I remember seeing a documentary on this, flagging the engineering prowess its construction represented. This was at the end of the 19th century. It was the longest suspension bridge in the world for some 20 years, since its inauguration in 1883. The bridge has a pedestrian pathway built in its center, above the automobile traffic level. At times of public transportation strikes or catastrophes (such as nine eleven), it is the main means of crossing the river, to the point that it may sway, or \u201cwobble\u201d, when too many people are using it! Not today though! People, mostly tourists but also lots of locals, are walking or running it, or biking it. A bunch of school kids stopped us, and Cynthia enthusiastically answered their questions, in response to some school assignment."

For years, an abandoned, elevated railway reminded West Side residents of a different New York, when trains serviced the warehouses dotting the riverfront to supply the stores and markets of the city. Perched just a few stories up, a group of imaginitive citizens were [finally] able to pursuade the authorities to let them develop an elevated garden on these tracks, beginning at 14th Street and continuing up to 28th Street so far - with expansion up to 30th St. still to come. It can be reached by elevators in several locations if climbing stairs is not an option. Since its opening, it has become one of the jewels of smaller parks in Manhattan, almost like strolling the hanging gardens of Babylon. It is intimate, ever-changing and simply desinged, and you leave with the thought: Why didn't this get done sooner? PLEASE: Do Not Miss This; it will take your breath away and leave you feeling gently elated."

My hope here is to share my favorite vantage points with those of you visiting the city. Reading some of the previous reviews I have seen the most popular choices mentioned (Empire State Building, Rockefeller Center, Liberty State Park, Circle Line, etc,) and they all offer breathtaking views and perspectives. But my own personal favorites are the Brooklyn Heights Promenade, which can be easily reached by bike, car or a healthy walk over the Brooklyn Bridge. My second favorite is from the Roosevelt Island Promenade, which can be reached via the Roosevelt Island Tram. The final vantage point I would recommend is the Brooklyn Bridge Park, located in the D.U.M.B.O. neighborhood (Down Under The Manhattan Bridge) but because of it's somewhat remote location I think a daytime visit there would be best in that case. I mention these as an amateur photographer as they provide a little more proximity with all of the \"sweep\" and grandeur of the other locations. Enjoy"

If someone were going to see the three views we saw, I would recommend what we did--ESB at night but the TofR and cruise during the day. This way, you get to see all the lights spread out below you, but you really want those daytime shots from TofR looking south over Central Park to the north.We used the CityPass. In 3 1/2 days, we used all of the tickets. Yes, we didn\u2019t see EVERYTHING at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, but we couldn\u2019t have anyway--we saw pretty much everything there that we wanted to see in the time allotted."

You can see the view of Manhattan bridge, Brooklyn Bridge and Williamsburg bridge."

Moving to NYC, for two of those years I lived in Brooklyn heights and gained a whole new appreciation. Yes, NYC is loud, crowded, and it can smell. When it's hot it's hot and when it's cold it's cold. This city can kick your butt, but it's New York. And it truly is one of the greatest cities in the world- with the most recognizable and beautiful skylines.Don't pay $ to see this. Go across the river, somewhere- NJ or Bk. Or go on a ferry ride, take a water taxi, there are plenty of ways to see NYC for free."

There are many ways which I was able to view the skyline. We walked over the Brooklyn Bridge and got a fantastic view, we took the Staten Island Ferry and got a wonderful view, but my favorite view of all was from the top of Rockefeller Center. It was just wonderful to see the Empire State Building and the rest of the Manhattan skyline from there. I don't think you can go wrong with any of the viewing areas and you can pick a favorite for yourself!"

If you look at a trip to New York as a sight seeing tour rather than a holiday, then the hustle and bustle is all worth it especially when Manhattan is seen from one of the viewing towers. It is absolutely staggering to see this Metropolis in all its glory and think that it was originally bought for the equivalent of just $24.The Empire State Building offers breathtaking views of the city and there aren't many travellers to New York who won't want to go up it, if for no other reason than to say that they have been up it. But if you only intend to go up one of the viewing towers, bear in mind that if you go up the Empire State Building, you are up it, so by default you cannot take any pictures of it. The Top of the Rock (GE building) at Rockefeller Plaza however, offers far superior views of Manhattan and sits between the Empire State building and Central Park and offers fantastic views of both and is a much better viewing experience than the Empire State Building, is much more interactive, is spread out over 3 floors, so is not as busy and has free wi-fi, so you can face-time your friends and family and show them Manhattan in real time"

Every day we really appreciated what we were viewing across the river from the bus. The magnificent Manhattan skyline. By morning it would look magnificent against beautiful blue skies and by night all lit up it really was a site to behold. Our apartment was right on the water's edge and we could see all the famous landmarks. The Empire State Building, The Chysler Builing etc etc and all the way down to the construction site where the World Trade Centre Buildings once stood. This stirred up many emotions but made me realise how strong and motivated the people of New York have been moving forward from such an horrific event. I thoroughly recommend doing what we did and doing the trip to downtown Manhattan each day. It really was an experience."

An incredible sight and quality of life experience."

The Rock had a great view, modest crowd and the whole experience worked better. Empire State building was a miserable experience. First of all skip the \"interactive ride experience\". Perhaps the worst application of this kind of motion ride I have ever experienced. Not updated since Twin towers were destroyed. Poor graphic resolution, jarring ride without a good reason to do so, voice over by Kevin Bacon, the script was so bad he should be ashamed. Wait for the elevator, get six stories to your destination and wait some more or hike it yourself and was very crowded on \"top\" get to the top and find out for ONLY another $13.00 per person you can go another 16 stories to the needle observation tower. What a rip-off. Had to take the kids but hated every second of the experience. Hope I never have to go again for any reason.Top of the Rock rules would be happy to visit it again, much better experience."

Perhaps I ama biased 22 year resident of NY but it is a place like no other than has a very distinguishable skyline (esp. the Empire State and the New York Life buildings).

The view from the Brooklyn Heights Promenade is spectacular, especially at night. This is easily reached by taking the 2 or 3 subway to Clark Street and walking a few short blocks down Clark Street to the water. (Other subway stations also serve the area, though they are a bit farther from the Promenade.) Beautiful neighborhood too -- well worth seeing in itself. Walking across the Brooklyn Bridge provides a good view as well, though the Promenade view seems more panoramic. You can also take the Staten Island ferry, perhaps going in the late afternoon and returning as the lights go on in the evening. In addition, there can be very good views from the New Jersey side of the Hudson. The higher you are, the better. In both New Jersey and New York, the highways approaching Manhattan can provide spectacular views. Within Manhattan, you can get a wonderful skyline view from Central Park. All the tall buildings that line the park also frame it. Obviously, you also get a great perspective from the Empire State Building, though that costs money and usually involves an irritating wait."

We got off and walked through the So. Seaport area, having a great cup of coffee at Jerry's Coffee. There is a free weekend ferry from where we got off to Ikea- the store subsidizes the ferry so people from Manhattan can go to the store and back, but you can just go for the ride if you want. This ferry is a wonderful inexpensive way to see the NYC skyline!"

The view from Central Park is so classic looking back toward midtown. The Staten Island ferry is a great way to see the World Trade Center and financial district area from the water and you go right by the Statue of Liberty and it is free. I think one of the best views is from Brooklyn Bridge Park and the Brooklyn Bridge. I like Rockefeller Center better than the Empire State Building for a view from the top of a building (try both day and night). Take a harbor cruise if you want to get a view from the water. If you are in shape, you can run the NYC marathon and really get a view of the Manhattan Skyline."

The view back to the skyline was magnificent and being able to view it at different times it takes on a whole new light. Seeing it lit up at night is simply marvellous, it is one of those sights that you will never forget and we thought this was a most special way of seeing the skyline for a first time.

We mourned with the Twin Towers fell and some people thought that others were being horrible when it was said that our skyline was forever altered.

It still hurts to see movies that show the skyline with the Towers. However, we are mourning, remembering, rebuilding and our skyline is still impressive. Go to Jersey and see the sunrise, go to Brooklyn or Long Island City and see the sunset. Take a ride on the Staten Island Ferry or Roosevelt Island Tram and take a gander or stand in the middle of Central Park at look up and around. Drive into Manhattan over the 59th Street Bridge or RFK Bridge and enjoy the scenic route. Stand on the Brooklyn Promenade at dusk or hike through Palisades Park in Jersey. Ride around the perimeter via bicycle: start at W 125 Street and go down the West side, hook around at Battery Park and head back uptown past South Street Seaport. Be brave and take to the streets at 34th street, get back on the path in the upper east 70's (parts of the path are under construction)."

I go here fairly often and rarely see tourists,so here's how you get there:Take the R train from Manhattan to the Court St stop in Brooklyn. It's the first stop in Brooklyn. After you exit the train, look for the Montague Street exit. When you reach the street, ask any passerby which direction to walk to the Promanade (prom-a-nod) then walk along Monague Street to the end and you are on it. If you get to Brooklyn Borough Hall, you went the wrong way.This view is awesome and you'll feel like a local. And the best part is it's FREE!Recommended to see the movie, Moonstruck with Cher, before coming here to get in the mood."

NYC is like no other place in the world, and the skyline is just the start. So where to go to get some great views?You may get your first glimpse if taking a taxi from LGA or JFK to Manhattan via the 59th Street (aka Queensboro or Ed Koch Queensboro) Bridge or on the Long Island Expressway to the Midtown Tunnel.Great views can be had from the [free] Staten Island ferry, Governor's Island, the Brooklyn Bridge (walk across it), the Top of the Rock observatory at Rockefeller Center (great view of the Empire State Building), the Brooklyn Heights Promenade, and from one of the many boat rides around Manhattan including Circle Line. Another idea is to check out one of the many rooftop bars in NYC, as some have great views. For a meal with a view, there are many options, but one of the most frequently recommended places is The River Cafe which sits along the water under the Brooklyn Bridge on the Brooklyn side.There are many other places to catch different views of the NYC skyline, so explore the city and enjoy!"
