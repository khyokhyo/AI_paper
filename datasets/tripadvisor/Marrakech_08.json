In this case a cooking class and tour. Karima was our host and she took us through the markets to buy our ingredients. This included buying the chicken, which we bought live but it wasn't for long! It was then off to her kitchen where we where taught how to cook a tagine and salad. Everything was explained including historical backgrounds so it was informative as well as educational."

The guide, Mustafa, was a fountain of knowledge giving our group a history of Moroccan food and how the influence of other countries have shaped the different dishes served up at the many places we visited during the walk.DO NOT EAT BEFORE. Delicious food and a great way to explore the city on our first night. If we had not gone on this tour I would probably have been eating pizza or burgers all week. Instead I'm now a Tagine junkie."

A great way to get your bearings and be initiated to the craziness of the Medina. The tour takes you around many narrow streets passing stalls of food, beautiful lamps, fabrics etc. Mustafa our Guide was just brilliant, spoke excellent English, good sense of humour and very personable. He could answer any question not just about the foods of Marrakech but culture, the city and things to do. Make sure you go along with an appetite as there is soooo much food eaten at little stops across the Medina. Cannot recommend enough!"

            "review": "Ensure your stomach is empty!. My friends and I booked the food tours last 12th October 2016. Overall, it was a great experience and I wished my stomach was emptier before I went for the tours as it was really a \"stuff yourself\" type of tour. We learnt many different food and was exposed to the Morocco culture by Abdul who is not only a great guide, he was also very insightful.However, I would like to bring forward that we did have difficulties with the start of the tour. We were informed to meet at the Cafe France at 6pm and look for a guide holding onto an Urban Adventures sign. We were informed to be early and as such, we came about 5.45pm and decided to sit at the cafe first. However, there were no such person even at 6.05pm. Thus, we decided to stand in front of the cafe and was approached by Abdul at about 6.15pm. He showed us a small card stating that he was from Urban Adventures. We waited for another 15 mins as there were late-comers and the tour started at about 6.35pm instead. I am unsure if the late-comers were actually there at the square but maybe they decided to leave after they couldn't locate any Urban Adventures sign. I hope the management could tell the tour guides to hold onto signs instead of a small card and going from tourist to tourist asking if they had booked a tour from the company."

The food on this tour is in abundance so remember to not each much at lunch. From the lessons of understanding the fundamental spices used in Moroccan cooking to drinking mint tea with treats, sampling a large variety of olives, visiting the local bakery (locals sharing their biscuits), eating roast lamb, tagine, soup, various sweets and ending with a digestive drink, this certainly gives you a taste of Marrakech and eating in local places. However, this tour was more than food with Mustapha being a wonderful guide, sharing the culture and way of living for locals. I was able to gain great insights into religion, politics and customs - a very knowledgable man. Thank you Mustapha for a wonderful evening and going above and beyond to ensure I arrived safe at my Riad. This is a worthwhile experience in Marrakech for the food and getting to know the medina. Mustapha helps bring the UA slogan to life- best day ever!"

            "review": "Quite good but not worth the money. A group of 5 of us recently booked onto an evening Food tour with Urban Adventures. Starting outside Cafe France in Djemaa el Fna, we were welcomed by our tour guide at 6pm. We then went to 9 stops to eat and experience different types of local foods. A couple of issues. Firstly, it is expensive for what you get. For the \u00a346 pp you pay, you get a variety of foods and a running commentary from a guide. This would be expensive even for UK/London prices. \u00a330 would be a fairer valutation, especially given that the local foods were cheap in themselves.Secondly, one of the stops was a 'Herboriste' shop where the owner sat us down and showed us different spices and cosmetics.This was a food tour not a spices tour! I also didn't appreciate the hard sell at the end - we had had enough of that after a couple of days roaming the souks.Thirdly, after the 9 stops we then get told we're going to 'dinner'(!) despite being unbelievably full. The place you eat dinner is a semi -fast food restaurant that serves Moroccan food. Was probably tasty but most of us were too full up to even touch our dishes.As an aside, two of our group also got food poisoning the next day. It may have been entirely unrelated to the food tour but it's worth ensuring you wash hands (consider bringing wipes etc) and make sure food given to you is clean.As a plus, our guide was excellent. Very attentive, helpful and brought the different foods to life. Can't fault him.Overall, an enjoyable evening but not worth the money and could be organised better."

We have been to Marrakech before, as a couple, and had previously experienced the souks. This tour allowed us to take our daughters and feel that we were able to experience the best of what there is to offer.We met up with Mustapha as arranged, checking his credentials upon meeting, and he confirmed his identity / credentials. Cognisant of the tips for writing a review, it may be helpful to mention the following, in that Mustapha advised us that recently a sole tourist had been \"hijacked\" by an individual posing as a \"guide\". Rule one - check the identity of the guide, there are lots of people looking for a quick buck in all parts of the world and it would appear that Marrakech is no different! (BTW don't ask a closed question such as \"Are you the TripAdvisor / tour / souk guide?\" A confident \"Yes\" can be given by any chancer! )To OUR tour......We had 5-10 minutes minutes getting to know / make intros / drink some water and most importantly we were asked in detail about what each of us wanted to get out of the tour (have a look at the detailed info on the urban adventures website for the sorts of things to concentrate upon).We never felt rushed and Mustapha interspersed souk touring with some historical info. and local customs. Whilst passing, there was a quick trip to the communal bread ovens, where we were welcomed enthusiastically and had some of the bread, hot out of the oven....awesome!As an aside....Whilst looking in on a caravanserai - I spotted an old gentleman sitting serenely and as a photographer, I was aware I would cause offence if I simply started taking some close ups (he had one of those faces that all photographers want to photograph for B&W portrait nirvana,). Mustapha negotiated a set of close ups for less than a cup of coffee. Can't wait to get home to process in Photoshop!So what did we buy; a leather briefcase and a stylish leather backpack, some argan oils (for considerably less than we would have paid at home) and some candle holders.What did we save - I would suggest more than the cost of the tour (and a private one at that as we were not a group - just the 4 of us - costlier but for us, worth it).Was it worthwhile - definitely.Did we save money - yes!Did we learn more than how to haggle - yes, (much).Did we enjoy ourselves - most definitely.Would we recommend - 100%Well worth it!!!!!"

            "review": "Tour of Shopping Secrets of the Medina. RE: confirmationSarah 7/24/16 Flag this message To: Sales SupportHello,I went on this tour because I was a solo female traveler and wanted to check out the souks with a guide first before going back on my own. I was a bit disappointed because the guide did not ask me what sorts of things I was interested in buying. Instead, he took me to places where he obviously knew the vendors. I was OK with that except when the guide told me to raise my price when I was bargaining for something. This made me believe that he was getting a kickback from the vendors if I bought something. What I found really objectionable was my experience while visiting the spice and argan oil women's cooperative. As we entered the shop, the guide explained that the women still make the oil by hand. At that moment, 3 women jumped up from naps on the couches and quickly started to work churning the oil. As expected, I was shown all the wares and then asked if I wanted to buy something. I ended up paying 800 Moroccan Dirhams for what I bought, which I thought was a bit steep at the time, but the prices were fixed, so I did not argue. However, on the next day, I went to a local department store and found the exact same products for half of what I paid on this so-called tour to show me the tips and tricks of shopping. I was very disappointed in this part of the tour and wrote the tour company about it. Their response was that the \"local team\" said the prices I paid were fair. Don't take this tour if you are planning to buy things. You will pay inflated prices and your guide will get kickbacks."

            "review": "One of the best meals we had in Morocco!. Karima took us on a tour of the market. We bought live chickens and picked out our own vegetables. All the while Karima taught us about customs and etiquette. Her home is an oasis in the center of the hustle and bustle of Marrakech. We were welcomed with a traditional sweet tea aperitif. We enjoyed the rooftop and looking over the city while we waited for our dishes to cook. We prepared ZAALOUK Salad, a deceptively simple but delicious tomato based salad, and cooked lemon chicken tangine, the best tangine we had all trip. Flavors were fresh and the company excellent.Karima spoke some about life if Morocco as a muslim women with a job. She was clearly cautious about sharing her views, understandably. Still, part of the excitement about this type of small group class is learning about how locals think. I would've loved to get a truer account of her thoughts on the world.One complaint: One person was late to the tour meeting spot, and we waited over an hour for them - that's too long and not respectful of our time. Turned out they overslept. Snooze you lose is apparently not a saying in Morocco!Thanks Karima - wonderful meeting you and thank you for inviting us into your home and life!"

Since I've been in Morocco the food hasn't lived up to expectations not spicy or flavoursome as I'd expected. It all was pretty bland but I got the real experience with Karima. We went to the market and bought a fresh chicken and vegetables we needed for the Lemon Chicken Tagine and Warm Maroccan Salad we cooked for lunch in her kitchen. She spoke excellent English. The food was fabulous it would have won rave reviews on Masterchef !! I am so glad I did the course and can re-create the dishes at home. No real secrets just fresh herbs and spices and preserved lemon which lifted the dish to great heights. A must do activity if you have a few spare hours in Marrakech."

She walked us around the souks and explained all about shopping for the food we would prepare. When we arrived at the Ryad it was very lovely and welcoming. All of the people there were friendly and most helpful. The cooking experience was fun and very enjoyable. This cooking class is very hands on unlike other cooking classes I have taken this one you chop and prepare all of the food which I loved. At the end of the class we told the guide we wanted to buy tagines and Hnida took us to a shop to purchase tagines and other Moroccan pottery. The store was VERY reasonably priced and not touristy at all. If you are interested in buying a tagine make sure to ask them to take you after the class. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!! Don't waste your money on tagines in the touristy shops you will pay 3x more!! I thoroughly enjoyed this tour and would recommend this to all foodies and people who love to cook!!!!!!!!"

The two ladies helping us were with us every step of the way, and were very personable and always making jokes and having a great time.

Mustapha gave us an enormous amount of information as we walked about the life and culture of Marrakech and Morocco, and answered every possible question we threw at him. The evening ended with a spicy tea digestif. Marrakech Medina is labyrinthine and this was a superb orientation with delicious food."

My friend and I met Karima in the main square, where she proceeded to show us the daily life of a local- a tour of the markets, buying the ingredients, and teaching us the names of the ingredients. We went to her family home and was served traditional tea, and afterwards we made a tagine and salad. Karima's family are lovely and made us very welcome. The food was delicious and afterwards we were invited to her Souq for a coffee. Karima is a fantastic teacher and made our holiday special. Thanks again"

I recently spent several days in Marrakech and did 4 tours with this company: Shopping Secrets of the Medina, Medina Palaces and Tombs, A Taste of Marrakech - Food Tour, and the Tajine Cooking Class.All 4 activities were really good, and I can highly recommend them. The group sizes were small (2 people on the market shopping tour, 6 people on the palaces and tombs tour, 5 people on the food tour, and on the cooking class I was the only person, but was pleased to see that the class still went ahead - with other companies I have found that if there is only one person then sometimes an activity will be cancelled).I did the first 2 tours with Mustapha, the food tour with Abdul, and the cooking class with Karima. All of these guides were friendly and knowledgable, and were accommodating to adapt the tour or activity to suit the group. They were happy to take questions and explain or expand on certain things of interest. Some of the sights and locations we saw on the tours I would never have been able to see on my own, such as visiting a local bakery in the evening to see bread being made on the food tour. Also, being with a guide in the medina meant I was hassled much less than when walking around by myself, and as a solo female traveller I appreciated this. The other benefit to me was that as I had booked my trip at short notice (only the week before!) I had not had a lot of time to read up on what to do or see in Marrakech, so doing the tours was a great way to make sure I covered a lot of the key things to see and do in a short amount of time.The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 was because on the first tour the guide had left with the 1 other tour participant without me, when I had been there on-time looking for them. My booking apparently wasn't on his list, despite booking through the website. I asked inside the cafe meeting point and the guy behind the counter was helpful and phoned the guide on the number provided on the booking voucher and he came back to get me. For the Tajine cooking class I had to wait about 15 minutes for someone to collect me from the meeting point, by which time I was thinking I had been forgotten again, but she was just running late. Also, the meeting point is a very busy cafe in the centre of the big square, and when you are waiting there you are an easy target for everyone who is trying to sell stuff, so prepared to be hassled while you wait. Once you are there at the cafe meeting point, it can be a little hard to find the guide and group."

We enjoyed traditional hospitality of tea and sweets, sights of the activity of the market, sounds of local music, fragrances of the spices and tastes of local favorites of olives, breads, traditional entrees. Our guide was engaging, knowledgeable, gracious and very accommodating. He answered all our questions. Throughout the week, we returned to some of our favorite vendors he introduced to us.

We booked online just about an hour before - so weren't totally sure if it would work! We found the meeting place and probably because of the last minute booking there was a delay in the starting time - but once we met up with the guide Mustapha we had a great experience walking around Old Marrakech. Mustapha is a great guide who knows the town and its history well as well as insights into Islam and the different aspects of it. He is very open to questions and even though he must go through the same information frequently it feels fresh and new - you sense he is interested in it and not just going through the motions. He is great for advice and tips on Marrakech and was very helpful. The walking tour takes in a lot of sights - the mosque, the Bahia palace, the photographic museum and the souks. There is no time to shop in the souks but you get an idea of where you would like to come back to. A good way to introduce yourself to the town and get a feel for where else you would like to visit."

My girlfriend is an economist and I'm in finance-investments, so we had a ton of non-standard questions that he was easily able to answer, 2) very friendly, 3) dealt with some of the more aggressive vendors who approached us well.

He is very knowledgeable and professional. We learnt so much about history, customs, habits, dos and donts, some basic arabic words and so on... He helped us buying some spices and offered a tea and Moroccan doughnuts on a pleasant stop in a local cafe as well. We have enjoyed the tour a lot and it was not only because we had seen so much but also because of Mustapha's comments, explanations and advises.

I appreciated Karima letting us know why she continued to do business with them year after year. You could also tell that they enjoyed interacting with her. There was only one other person in the class so we were able to talk and ask a lot of questions as we prepped. Karima is very easy to chat with and simply a lovely person - I'd love to be her friend in real life! I had a lot of tagines during my 2+ weeks in Morocco, and I can honestly say that this one was in the top 3. The preserved lemons really do add a special something. The class took the mystery out of tagine making, but certainly not the fun."

We visited the main mosque (but not inside), the Medina (old walled city), palace, tombs and the souks (old market dating back 400 years), which took a whole morning on foot.Mustapha was passionate about his work as a guide and explaining things very well, putting them into context in an interesting and factual way - including some history, economics and culture. The tour lasted over 3 hoursI would have no hesitation in recommending Marrakech Urban Adventures who Mustapha worked for, they are located in a number of Eurpean cities, including Athens."

Karima took us on a shopping trip not to be forgotten, she explained what each ingredient was needed for in the Lemon Tagine we were to be taught how to prepare and cook for ourselves. We were taken through the maze of Souks and eventually invited into Karima's family home which was quiet and serene in contrast to the hustle and bussal we had just left outside their front door.Nine of us were guided through to a very unique sitting room which was beautifully decorated, as was the whole house. Karima's family worked quietly and efficiently in the background making preparations for our Tagine cooking lesson while Karima explained how to make Mint Tea which was delicious. Once the chicken was prepared (which was alive one hour previous) we donned our aprons and started our lesson in how to prepare the perfect Lemon Chicken Tagine. Each person added more or less of which ingredient suited their taste. The result was nine very satisfied diners, it was delicious and unique. This was not an experience my wife and I would ordinarily have taken part in. Our friend and organiser of the trip suggested it and we happily went along with it. We are so glad we did. If you are looking for a great tour of the Medina and Souks and a way of experiencing Morroccan culture with lunch thrown in, this experience is a must. Do yourself a favour and give it a go, you won't regret it.Thank you to Karima and your family."

We booked the cookery trip via the website Viator, who in turn use a local business called Marrakesh Urban Adventures\u2019.It\u2019s a must-do experience in Marrakesh!We thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience. Our local guide Karima picked us up outside Caf\u00e9 Paris in the chaotic Djemaa El Fna (far right hand side of the square), and took us through the labyrinth of alleys and souks, where we stopped en route to her family home to purchase all the ingredients needed to each make our own lemon chicken tagine. The stops included a spice shop, mint stall, vegetable stall, olive shack and (not for the faint hearted Westerner) the live chicken counter. Don\u2019t worry, after she picked the ones required, and had them weighed we didn\u2019t stick around to see our fresh chicken prepared. You have to appreciate it\u2019s a way of life, and one we are very ignorant to, as we are great at disconnecting such thoughts, where we do our weekly shop in Asda! We stepped from the madding streets of Marrakesh into this beautiful tranquil home, and were made so welcome by the host family. Of course you have the obligatory welcome Mint Tea, and then set to work on making your own tagine traditionally over coals, where Karima taught us, with the assistance of her sister, and mother. The result was by far the best tagine we ate during our stay (and we weren\u2019t biased as we made it!).What a lovely family-ran business, it was both a privilege and the highlight of our holiday to meet Karima and her family and to cook the native dish synonymous with Morocco."

After that she taught us how to cook an authentic chicken tagine, which was the best I had in Morocco, as well as a salad. Karima was a lovely person and even emailed us the recipes she had taught us so now I can try them out at home. Thank you!"

We met our tour guide Mustapha, who took us on a brilliant tour around nighttime Marrakesh. During the tour (which had way too much food!) we got an introduction to all herbs and spices, pastries, olives, different meats and traditional dishes. We sampled each of these things, including slow-cooked lamb which was delicious. We were expecting just a little bit of each thing but there was so much food! By the time we got to the main meal at the end we were all too full to eat. I would really recommend this tour as a great introduction to the city, and its food. Mustapha was a great guide who was friendly, knowledgable and made you feel very safe if this hectic city!"

Walking around Marrakesh with him felt like being shown around by a long time friend. Thanks for the experience, we would definitely recommend it!"

We're foody types (my partner is a chef) so learning about a country's food culture is really important to us. My partner and I were lucky enough to be the only people booked on the tour the day we went which meant we had Mustapha's undivided attention and learned a lot. Mustapha's English was perfect and he was charming company throughout. We took the tour on our second day in Marrakech and it really helped us get to grips with the Medina and how food is ordered and served.The range of places visited is brilliant. We were able to visit cafes and shops that we might have been intimidated to approach alone, and try things we wouldn't have known to ask for. I discovered my new favourite street food - msemmen and tried some of the best lamb I've ever tasted. You need a very healthy appetite to take this tour, we were bursting at the seems by the end, and this demonstrated what excellent value for money the tour is. Not only did we have Mustapha to guide us for 3 hours the amount of food you get to consume is substantial.All in all, I can't say enough good things about this tour. If you're going to Marrakech don't miss it."

I had already been on a number of food tours through out the country but Mustafa's tour was by far best.Mustafa ensures that the tour is tailored to your interests, spending less/more time in areas that are of interest to you.The quantity of food is excellent (you will probably have treats to take away with you) and you will get the opportunity to try things that you may perhaps avoid (the medina can be overwhelming and some of the food sold is questionable). Mustafa has good relationships with vendors so you know you will be ok!I am so glad I booked the food tour with Mustafa in Marrakesh.

My friend booked the activity for us and I'm so grateful that she took the time to do this.We met Karima in the central square before walking our way around the souks, picking up our fresh ingredients for lunch, as we made our way to the riad for our class.Once in the riad, which happened to also to belong to Karima's family, we were made to feel very welcome by their generous hospitality and were given some traditional mint tea, which Karima then explained how to make (and pour) the moroccan way!We then continued our day by preparing our tagine, and a morrocan salad, using the ingredients we had previously purchased in the souk. As a keen cook, this was very exciting as know I learn how to make a traditional moroccan tagine, rather than copying a recipe from online or out a book.As our tagine cooked, the generous hospitality continued as we got to explore the riad and enjoy the panoramic views from the roof terrace.Now it was time to eat! WOW!!! One of the best dishes I have tasted, even better knowing that I made it myself!! The balance of spices and flavours were perfect.I would highly recommend that you take some time out while exploring Marrakech to spend the morning with Karima and her family, their generosity and hospitality are second to none. Definitely will be trying this recipe on all my friends and family in the UK. Shukran Shukran Shukran!!!"

I chose to do this on the first day that me and my girlfriend were in Morocco, and I couldn't have chosen a better day (YOU HAVE TO DO THIS ON THE FIRST OR SECOND DAY IN MARRAKECH, AMAZING WAY OF GETTING INTRODUCED TO THE MARKET!). This was suppose to be a surprise for my girlfriend because she absolutely loves cooking, and I'm glad I did it!We were told to meet early in the morning at 9am at a caf\u00e9 in the famous market of Marrakech, we took a cab from the location where we were staying at. At first when we arrived I was worried no representative was going to show up to pick us up because I've heard the horrors of fake tours in Marrakech, but as soon as I was approached by a young amazing lady (KARIMA), I knew this was no scam!KARIMA was extremely welcoming, she quickly introduced herself to me and my girlfriend, and introduced the other students of the cooking class (also wonderful people). The first thing we did was walk around the medina/souk/market and picked up our groceries/ingredients for the class. It was absolutely amazing because not only did she tell us what the ingredients were in English (fluent in English), she also taught us how to say it in Arabic. Walking around the market was great, she showed us around a lot, and I was very impressed at how everyone greeted her when we walked by thier shop. KARIMA is definitely respected and known around here.When we finished getting everything we needed, she took us to her family owned riad (hotel), which I encourage everyone to stay there because all the workers/family are extremely friendly and welcoming (let me mention that I did not stay in her riad, but definitely wish I did.As soon as we got to the riad we were asked to stay in the living room area and have cookies and famous traditional tea (she also taught us how to make this!) while she was in the kitchen cleaning the freshly killed chicken (you can ask to use fish/ vegetables if you are vegetarian) and washed all the vegetables.As soon as everything was done, we were seated at a table with our own individual traditional Tagine, cutting board, knife, chicken, ingredients etc.Needless to say this was honestly amazing, and again I encourage everyone to do this on their first stay in Marrakech because you definitely get a mini tour of the medina/ market. KARIMA was honestly amazing because the hospitality she provided was unlike anything I've seen. She even took time out of her free time, after our class was done, to take me to a specific shop in the market to locate for me pure honey. Only one shop in the whole medina had it, and the fact that she walked me over there afterwards, which again, she didn't have to do, was actually amazing."

We did it on the first morning, and met our guide Mustapha at the Caf\u00e9 de France in the main square at 9AM. It allowed us to get our bearings on the first day. The tour lasted about 4 hours and provided a fascinating first taste of the Medina of Marrakech. Our group was small, only 5 of us in all, which was great because we could ask questions. Our guide was very nice, with excellent English, and made the tour very interesting. He provided enough detail to keep us interested but without bewildering us. Among other things, we visited the Bahia Palace where you should watch out for the storks nesting on the pillars in front of the Palace! They provide a great photo opportunity. Inside, the palace there are some super friendly cats wandering around which I found charming. We also visited a bakery where locals bring their bread to be baked in a huge oven, and a pharmacy that sold spices and oils where we were given mint tea and offered a short massage for a few dirhams. A tour of the souks was particularly fascinating, as we watched tradesmen of all kinds making goods from leather and metal. The guided walk through the souk provided us with the only opportunity to go in there without being constantly pestered by the stallholders!! The tour finished up in the Museum of photography, where a lovely exhibition of photographs depicted Moroccan culture over the years. Overall, I would happily recommend this tour with its lovely guide. We all loved it."

For the price we are paying, surely we can each get a full sweet considering how small it is? The guide mention that his expertise was historic tours and this is not the normal tour that he will do.

We got to be hands on doing a lot of the cooking ourselves, then settled back to enjoy some mint tea while the Tagine cooked over charcoal. Karima was friendly and informative, the class was hands on and good fun, and we enjoyed a great lunch - and best of all we were provided with the recipe so we can attempt it at home! Highly recommended for beginner or intermediate cooks."

Shirley H. who was in our group of 6 has already given a detailed description. We not only learned how to properly make a tagine, and moroccan salad, we had the opportunity of spending time inside a family home (with various members of Karima's family helping out). Karima led us into the medina and then back out again, which gave us opportunity to see beyond the immediate touristic section of the medina.My husband made the chicken and said it was the best of his several tagine on the trip. I made the vegetarian tagine and it was delicious, unlike the rather bland vegetarian tagines I had at other times. I will be cooking.Recommended to everyone."

First select 2 live chickens then shop for the freshest vegetables while the chikens are prepared. It was good to be treated like a local and not a tourist. Then to her family house where we were welcomed with mint tea and snack. Karima explained about the ingredients and we each prepared our own tajine. The vegetarian option is available. It was the best tasting tajine of the whole trip. As a retired cooking teacher myself, I can thoroughly recommend this activity. Thank you Karima."

After Meeting Karima in the main square we were quickly led to the traditional markets to shop for the ingredients we would later use. This is something we take for granted in UK; Chicken slaughtered and prepared fresh for us, which although some of my family would prefer to look away, I found fascinating.We then took a short walk back to the family riad where we had traditional mint tea and cakes. Then the fun began!We all started to construct our own tagine from the ingredients just purchased. Fresh everything! The most fun I've ever had cooking dinner!The family helped prepare the coals which our tagines then went on. Once our pots were ready we had to make our Moroccan salad.This all came together for us all to sit down and experience the BEST food in morocco! The restaurant food is not a patch on what karima had helped us make.This tour is a must! So glad we managed to find it!"

It was without a doubt a highlight of the trip.Karima met us in the main square and we walked back through the markets collecting the produce for our lunch, buying where the locals shop rather than the touristy markets - smaller squares and back streets off the main drag. The class focussed on cooking a lemon and chicken tagine from scratch. Excellent fun and Karima was a superb teacher, patient, funny and teaching us little bits of Arabic along the way. We also prepared a tasty traditional Moroccan salad to accompany the tagine.Whilst the tagine is cooking you have spare time to relax on the roof terrace of her riad - take a book and soak up the sun, This is what holidays are all about.Lunch was set in the riad courtyard and was absolutely delicious. I cannot wait to try it on my friends and family. Karima has helpfully already sent across more recipes to try and I fell in love with Moroccan food during the trip, so these are going to be put to good use.Thank you Karima for a fantastic morning-I would not hesitate to recommend you, really enjoyed it."

Karima picked us up with a warm welcome and took us to the market to buy fresh vegetables for our cooking class in her home in the Marrakesh medina. We relaxed in her living room and learned the art of making green tea with mint including how to pour it. As we sat drinking a few glasses of green tea we discussed our interest in ethnic cooking. Karima's hospitality was gracious and her English was extremely good. In her kitchen Karima instructed us in the art of making Moroccan salad giving us tips about cutting, removing the tomato skin and seasonings. Then onto the tagine of chicken with olives and preserved lemon. She made it seem very easy and indeed it was. It was quite helpful to see how she worked with the tagine over the gas stove, letting the meal simmer in the juices. The layers of flavor blended deliciously. It was clear that Karima's extensive cooking experience in the restaurant business as well as what she learned growing up has served her well in her cooking school. During the course of our cooking lesson we met Karima\u2019s mother, her sister and then her father in the warm ambiance of their home. When it was time to sit down to our feast, we savored our Moroccan salad and chicken tagine at her dining room table. She prepared with ease a little dessert to accompany our last cup of green tea with mint. As she walked us back through the medina we saw how much a part of her community Karima is as people waved and called to her. We stopped by the riad of her fianc\u00e9, and if we had had more time in Marrakesh we would have had dinner there another evening. Our experience with Karima added so much to our Moroccan trip, not only was it an immersion to our interest in ethnic cooking but to the culture as she fulfilled our curiosity about the people.

The first tour was a tour of the souk, Bahia Palace, and Saadian Tombs - which proved to be a good orientation of the medina/souk area. The second tour was the evening food tour. Moustafa, dressed in a galabeya, escorted us around the old town providing lots of information about Marrakech's history and current events on both tours, but his real passion showed when we did the food tour and so we enjoyed this one much more. If you can, do both tours. If money is tight do the food tour..visiting the palace etc in your own town. The food tour allowed us to get up closer to the local culture and cuisine...sampling so much along the way in the souk and medina. We visited the spice market to see local spices and some black magic ingredients, took a seat at a street-side tea house to enjoy Moroccan tea with pastries, stopped by the local community bakery to see Eid biscuits being brought in by local children and baked in huge ovens. We sampled olives and Moroccan cookies in the souk, sipped Harira soup in the famous Marrakech food stalls in the central Jamaa el Fna square, dined on the most succulent lamb cooked in ovens below the streets of the souk and ended the night with sampling a stew (I cannot recall the name) and a spiced cinnamon tea that settled perfectly on a belly full of food. The evening was fantastic and we felt the experience was excellent value for money.My only criticism, was walking through the medina and souk was rushed and at times we had to run to catch up with Moustafa on both tours. Tourists in foreign areas like a medina or souk need a little more time to take it in and take photos, so I would feedback to slow down where possible. Both our tours ended earlier than the allocated time which suggests their is room to slow the pace. We also did the tours the week daylight savings finished which meant the palace closed earlier and we were rushed through as doors closed behind us. It would have been better to do the tour earlier to again take in more of the sights at a more relaxed paced.Nonetheless, I would recommend Moustafa and Urban Adventures to anyone travelling to Marrakech."

After meeting our teacher Karima our day began in going to the market to buy our ingredients (including a trip to the butcher for some extremely fresh chicken!). After this we walked to Karima's home to rustle up our lunch. While Karima got the chicken ready we drank mint tea and perused traditional Moroccan recipes, and then it was over to the kitchen to prepare a Moroccan salad and a beautiful lemon and olive chicken tajine (truly one of the best meals we had in Morocco!). Karima was full of information about this recipe and Moroccan cuisine in general, as well as being friendly and approachable in her manner -- she was completely unfazed by my boyfriend's last-minute request that his salad contain no tomatoes and improvised a tomato-free one on the spot. I now finally know how to use the tajine I have at home and will definitely be using it in future!A really enjoyable window into a Moroccan home and Moroccan culture, through its food. Highly recommended!"

Karima met us in the Jemaa el Fna at the planned time and took us through the souq to buy fresh ingredients at the local markets. Some of the ingredients were a little too fresh for our liking, but it was interesting to see the way of life and shopping for local people! A visit to a local spice shop was very informative, and we had time to buy some spices to take home. After buying the ingredients we went to Karima's family home where we learned to prepare mint tea, and then each learned how to prepare the ingredients to make our own tagines and a wonderful Moroccan salad. We enjoyed hearing about Karima's family while we worked, and it was also wonderful to meet her sisters and mother, and it was nice to have time to meet other travellers who were in the class. We are looking forward to receiving the recipes by email from Karima so we can try to recreate the meal at home."

We were met by our guide Hussein who after a short introduction and outline of the evenings plans proceeding to show us around areas of the medina that I have never seen before and a few I have but in those he showed us into some fantastic local cafes and restaurants that I would never have visited by myself or even with a small group. We tasted a variety of local dishes and delicacies... My favourites were the freshly cooked spicy pancakes (Msemen) and doughnuts that I forget the name of.On our journey through the medina we also visited some local businesses such as the community baker who cooks all the bread for for the entire population of the area. This gave us a chance to talk with some locals while learning more about the culture of Morocco. On top of this we had Hussein's wonderful knowledge and experiences to assist us in understanding Marrakech, Morocco and most importantly the medina which can be a little daunting.I loved my experience and would recommend this tour to anyone with an appreciation of good food and an appetite for understanding."

After travelling around Morocco for two weeks, eating tangines of all descriptions, I was excited to see how the tangines were made and whether or not I would be able to recreate my Moroccan experience when I got home.The class was great. Our instructor, Karima, met us in the square and took us through the markets to buy what we would need (included in the cost of the class), before taking us to her home. Shopping in the same areas as the residents and being invited into the home of the locals was one of the highlights of this class.The cooking itself was straight-forward and Karima explained not just what to do, but why things were added at particular stages and what to look out for (chicken drying out etc) which makes we confident that I would be able to recreate this at home. While we were waiting for our lunch to cook, we enjoyed mint tea (and learnt about the custom of preparing and serving the tea, which I had also seen from a distance in my travels, but hadn't understood) and flicked through recipe books, which we were able to copy from. Lunch was fabulous, the company was great (only three in the class) and all in all it is definitely an experience I would recommend if you have time while in Marrakech."

I turned 40 the day before my husband and I took the class and it was a birthday gift from my sister - it was one of the best gifts I've ever received!I love to cook and was very excited to learn how to create authentic Moroccan dishes at home. I wasn't dissapointed. Our guide and instructor Karima was absolutely fantastic. She guided us through the Medina and we learned some basic terms in Arabic and had a really enjoyable shopping trip in the souk purchasing everything we needed, chatting with shopkeepers and stallholders. Karima was really friendly and engaging. Armed with everything we needed we were warmly welcomed into her beautiful home where we were instructed in the art of making mint tea and given cookery and phrase books to browse while we drank it. Then we were taken to the kitchen (only the two of us in the class that day!) and the brilliant Karima guided us step by step through the preparation of a chicken tagine with olives and preserved lemon each and a moroccan salad. It was fabulous, she really knows her stuff- and she knows how to explain things really well. Then we had more tea and talked with Karima about other dishes we might make and about spices. Then it was lunchtime and I can honestly say it was one of the most delicious things I ate during my whole stay. We had oranges with cinnamon and a tasty coffee before heading back out to the souks as Karima kindly brought me to buy the spices I was keen to get to restock my cupboards while in Morocco. The whole experience was the highlight of my holiday and I'd recommend it to anyone - avid cook or complete beginner- Karima will look after you!"

The class with Karima was amazing - starting off in the Souks and visiting her local market where everyone knew her made it a very friendly and joyous experience. We then went back to her family home and were introduced to her mother and sisters which gave it an authentic feel. Karima was so helpful and a great teacher and we succeeded in making some very very delicious tangines that were simple and easy to remember (we still remember our Arabic numbers Karima!) I couldn't recommend this more, a must when visiting Marrakech!"

We learnt a lot from Karima about Marrakech and the Moroccan way of life.We had such a fantastic ,relaxing and enjoyable time with Karima.It was like Karima had all the time in the world to spend with us, nothing was rushed.We would highly recommend this tour if you are interested in moroccan cuisine and wish to learn more about the culture."

Quick note to Urban Adventures though - if you number on the voucher says 'for any problems please call', it would be a great help for it to be answered..! Luckily we didn't wait long, and it was interesting just people watching at the Jemaa El Fenaa as the orange juice stalls were set up, so not a problem.I enjoyed Karima's interaction with her friends in the market as we purchased spices, vegetables, chickens and allsorts of other goodies. It was interesting to learn the arabic phrases and understand some of the cultural nuances so important for travel - why on earth would you parade around a muslim country with your shoulders on display?! Weird.The cookery course was fun, Karima's riad home was beautiful, so calm and tranquil and her family were friendly and enthusiastic in showing us the local produce. Who knew prickly pears were so delicious. The tagine was very tasty, spicy and saltier than expected but a real earthiness that was more authentic than any restaurant. The laid back interaction and cookery style was well suited to the group, and I had fun.A big shout out to my fellow cooking mates who were on a larger Intrepid trip - it was brill to meet you all and onward safe travels.I would recommend this as a a light hearted way to experience Marrakech."

He elegantly showed us all the main points of interest of Marrakech by telling a big story through connecting all these 'dots'. Even asking the simplest of questions was responded with a lot of enthousiastic telling and was very much appreciated. Asking about the culture of islam (we discovered that we were very under-educated about this topic) is something I would really recommend as this will enhance your understanding of the Moroccan way of living (and beyond that; will elaborate further on). Furthermore, at the main points of interest he tells the most interesting stories of how these came into existence.Elaborating on the culture of Islam and why I recommend it; Mustapha was keen on elaborating the different 'ways' of living as a Muslim and, in our case as Western-oriented people, it gave a good understanding of how other Muslims as well live their lives around the world.Overall, great well-spoken English guide with a lot of stories and patience!"

My boyfriend and I traveled from Switzerland and Spain to Marrakech, Morocco; and of all the natural and architctural wonders we enjoyed along our vacation - our Urban Adventure with Karima was by far our favourite. She was extremely punctual meeting us in the medina outside Cafe France on a Monday morning, lucky us we were the only two in our class! Karima took us through the souks, which we had already explored, but this time with her local instincts. She took us to buy the ingredients for our Moroccan dishes, while teaching us Arabic words along the way. She brought us back to a beautiful ryad, which we decided we would stay at during our next visit to Morocco! We felt right at home cooking in Karima's kitchen, and she encouraged us to explore the grounds while we waited for our delicious tagine chicken. The Moroccan mint tea and salad were to die for! Karima was so lovely and hospitable, when we inquired about the cost of certain pottery items, she offered to bring us back into the souk to help us shop! She brought us to an incredible shop stacked from floor to ceiling with pottery. After we picked our items, she was so kind as to barter for us and get us a great deal on some of the best quality pottery you can get in Marrakech! Karima is such a sweetheart, and I would encourage anyone and EVERYONE to jump on this experience with her. We honestly feel as though we had made a new friend!"

The menu of the day was a chicken & preserved lemon tagine and a beautifully simple moroccan salad.

The stories behind the food, the rituals, the details of preparation from foods prepared only by men, to black magic, to the spice/meat/fish markets to hidden public ovens, cooking pits and early evening mint tea with pastries (savoury & sweet) were truly memorable!We were also able to talk and learn about aspects of Moroccan history, Muslim traditions and faith, as well as foods, and we particularly appreciated this chance for such open discourse and Mustafa's willingness to answer all our questions. He was a true Ambassador for Morocco!The time simply flew by, we just can't recommend Mustafa's tour enough. It is an absolutely essential part of any trip to Marrakech- even if you are only stopping for one day. A sensual, colourful delight without any hassle.

We sampled so many varieties of sweets, olives, cactus fruits, pastries, savories, fresh bread from the community oven and street food that we might otherwise not have felt comfortable approaching. We learned so much about the culture of cooking in Morocco, what women cook and what men cook. A highlight was seeing men make filo dough ( we had no idea what went into it!) we thought we knew a good amount about food and cooking but we're stunned by how much we learned on this tour. There was also great culinary and culture conversation along the way.

Our guide for the day was Karema. She was friendly and very helpful. The tour of the local markets is a bit of a joke because you just follow her around to where she buys the meat and veg from. Its a lot of walking and not much to see. The cooking class itself was really good although they can invest in some proper knives in my opinion. We had a lot of time to hang around and go to the rooftop for a view over the city. Karema made us some traditional Moroccan mint tea which was delicious! The staff at the riad was very friendly and we felt at home. They even sang my wife a happy birthday song! We were taught how to make a traditional Moroccan salad and we had some oranges and cinnamon for desert and they presented us with a nice sponge cake for my wife's birthday! All and all very good till now. Earlier in the day I asked Karema where the nearest shop is because we were all in the mood for some Coke of Fanta. I know we walked past a shop about a block away. Anyhow, Karema said that she will send someone to get us some drinks. Nice! Really good service, or so we thought. We were all set ready to leave and we asked Karema to direct us to a good spice shop. She volunteered to take us to her local spice shop but before we left she said we must remember to pay for the drinks. I was thinking 'what the heck'. The drinks still had the price on it. It was 5 and 6 Dirham each. We were 5 people and the charged us 60 dirham! That's a profit on top of something I asked her where I can buy it myself! What a cheek! I had 200 Dirham as a tip for her in my pocket. I took 50 out and kept 150 in my pocket to giver her later. So she was walking us back to the spice shop. She took us into a very small but nice shop where a friend of her was the owner. We got a nice explanation of what all the spices did and he asked what we wanted to buy. This was the first time in Marrakesh and we didn't know what the spices should cost. My cousin paid 500 Dirham for a mix of spices and tea that we bought the next day for 120 Dirham at another shop. What a shambles! As we were leaving the shop we saw the guy giving Karema a bag full of goodies which we didn't see her pay for. Nice commission I guess! So my advice is. Do the cooking class. Its a really really nice day out and you get to see what a read riad looks like. But don't ask for extras unless you're willing to be stung later. In her defense, we did get a cake and a song for free! HAHA. She could at least tell us upfront that she is going to charge us for the sodas. Its so unfair that tourists get ripped off by people like this. We are more than willing to pay for things if you tell us upfront how much you are going to charge us for it. So, we still tipped her because her hospitality earlier that day was exceptional. (PS. haggle your bums off in the markets! We never paid more that half of what they ask and we even got a bowl priced at 400 for 80!!)"

His English and diction are clear and he tries to ensure that you get a broad understanding of Moroccan culinary culture, and where specific foods play a role in everyday life. We visited a local working bakery, the medina spice market, the underground cooking vats for multiple lamb carcasses, sampling many olive types, sweet and sticky coffee / desert morsels. Mustafa performed a Moroccan tea making and serving ritual, much to the delight of the \"locals\". Also, we ate dinner outdoors at market tables bustling with locals and tourists, followed by the ginseng tea at an outdoor caravan. Wear comfortable shoes, and secure your personal things. You will feel very safe there. This tour is not suitable for children as one could get easily lost amongst the chaos, shoving and side-stepping of the immense market area at night. It is not for the faint hearted, and involves considerable walking. My view, 3 hours of pure education, culinary gratification, and non-stop entertainment, especially for the \"foodies\" or those who don't care for drives in the desert."

Informative, enthusiastic, funny with clear diction. He guided our group through the crowds in the markets and explained everything about food as it pertained to Holidays, family , history and culture. He went out of his way to get special food for us to take. For me he got a mixture of dates, almonds, chickpeas and small baked cookies that Moroccan mothers make for their children. i brought this back to work and shared it with my coworkers....everyone thought it was very interesting and they loved it. If not for Mustafa, having it made while we were standing at the food stall, i never would have had such a unique gift to share. Mustafa's tour was booked through Peraguine on 4/1/14. Wonderful tour guide."

Our guide and chef, Karina (Karema) met us in the main square, took us shopping for fresh ingredients in the souk, and then walked us to the Dar Salama Riad to learn the finer points of preparing chicken tagine. The whole experience was very relaxing, fun, and informative. There was just the two of us but Karina has worked with groups as large as 18. The meal we produced was delicious, very rich in layered flavours. We highly recommend this opportunity to learn about Moroccan cuisine with a talented, engaging young Moroccan woman."

Mustafa met us and told us what we'd be doing and more importantly eating.We criss-crossed the city, sampling M'semman (like a pancake) donuts (Marrakech style), olives, dates, nuts, pastries,Tangier - completely different to a Tangine, Harira Soup and of course bread and Mint Tea; we finished with a digestive drink, but I've forgotten what it was called but it tasted ok.Mustafa gave us a really interesting insight on the food aspect of Marrakech; and the local culture. Highlights included the visit to the communal bread oven, the local food market, spice market and the peek inside the underground ovens which lamb is cooked in.We ate in various places from a cafe on the pavement to a stall in the main square. Mustafa was full of useful information and obviously passionate about Marrakech. I would really recommend this trip, as this will give you the confidence to try the food."

It was informative, interesting and tailored to what we wanted. The guide was interesting and tried to meet our needs. Yes he did take us to a herbalist but it was fun and if you don't want to buy you just say no! Unless of course you wish to go Bang Bang ALL night!!The other tour we went on was the evening tour Inside the Medina, this was our favourite. It was informative but relaxed and we had an experience and saw things that we wouldn't have just going around on our own. It was lovely and finishing in the Medina at night gave us a great introduction to the food stalls for other evenings. People were very welcoming to us."

In just over three hours we walked all over the medina - we learned about the spices, saw mechoui being cooked in a pit and bread being baked in a communal oven... Along the way we tasted olives and preserved lemons, pastries and sweets, savoury doughnuts, ate tanjia and drank Berber tea (all food is included in the price). Mustafa is charm personified - all in all a fantastic evening and I came away feeling I'd had proper insight into Morocco's culinary culture. Highly recommended if, like me, you're a foodie!"

The tour began in the heart of the medina where we met our friendly guide. After a brief talk on Marrakech's food culture, we proceeded to a local produce market. After the guide explained the variety of vegetables and spices needed for the Tajine, it was time to gather everything together before heading to the class. When we arrived at the Riad it was time to prepare our ingredients. After an hour or so preparation and cooking time our cuisine was ready to eat. I would definitely recommended this tour to anyone who enjoys food and wants to learn something new.

At $65 USD it is fair to assume at the end of the class you would feel you had learned something and enjoyed four hours of informed teaching about Moroccan food. Unfortunately that's not the case. My advice? Save your money and buy a book!To be fair, there may be other riads and other cooks teaching under the Urban Adventures banner that provide a quality experience, but the one we attended at Dar Salama was an absolute rip-off.Where to start?- The knives were crappy, cheap and blunt. - There was no overall instruction or knowledge sharing about specific spices or typical Moroccan ingredients.- The cook must have been employed because she spoke very good english - it certainly wasn't because she was passionate about, or knowledgeable about cooking. (as an example the tajine we prepared used preserved lemon, which is very salty, but she still had us add salt - at another class by a different riad it was made clear that one should never add salt to a preserved lemon tajine as it would result in a salty and tough dish - it did!)- There was an inordinate amount of time wasted while we waited for her to set up what should already have been prepared for us. We were to watch Moroccan pop music on loop while waiting. Not much fun.- The organisation was poor - three people who had received confirmation emails were apparently a surprise to the cook- There were no notes, recipes or a menu plan provided. (At another class we received all of this AND the gift of a tajine pot to continue our practise)I know this is a harsh review. If the class was $30 or $40 I might not have minded so much, but it was the sort of money which indicated a professional approach, and this is not what we got. (*If you want a suggestion of an alternative cooking class which I did enjoy, have a squizz at my other reviews - I don't want to directly promote it here as that's not the purpose of this post.)"

For USD$65 I had the expectation that the class would be run by a qualified food lover who would be knowledgable. This was not the case. The guide, whilst very friendly, didn't know much about Moroccan cuisine. She didn't suggest we do the food buying in the market and mostly did it herself without us interacting with market vendors or giving us guidance on how much we should expect to pay if buying ingredients ourselves. After shopping we went to Riyad Dar Salama and after a mint tea were left alone for nearly an hour whilst the staff presumably prepared the ingredients. This was very strange as at *other* cooking schools I have done we were given printed recipe cards to review before embarking on the food preparation (plus have a takeaway reference) but on this occasion we were not given anything and left to make small talk with other participants for an hour. Once the cooking began it was enjoyable but it seemed like the guide only knew about this recipie and couldn't make suggestions for how it could be varied, reinforcing her lack of food knowledge. My food tasted good but only because I improvised with ingredients based on my knowledge of flavours and spices... Not based on what the guide prescribed.I tried another cooking class at La Maison Arabe which was almost the same price but 100 times better and set in a beautiful purpose built venue for cooking schools and with amazing hosts. This absolutely reinforced that the Intrepid/Marrakech Urban Adventures cooking school is absolutely overpriced compared to alternatives in the city."

In all fairness, there was a slight glitch with the local company confirming our hotel pickup. I included our hotel information in the booking, but the instructions on the voucher said that we needed to contact the company to confirm our pickup time. I contacted the company on multiple occasions, and no one returned any of my emails. Because the company never confirmed our pickup, my friend and I met in their central \u201cmeeting spot.\u201d As it turns out, though, they had been waiting for us at our hotel while we were waiting for them in the meeting spot. Slight hiccup! However, other than that, the class was very well executed. There were four people in our class that day, and our instructor, Karina, was absolutely phenomenal. Once we all finally met up, we went shopping for ingredients in the market. Karina taught us how to say certain words in Arabic, and we had a great time walking through the market and seeing how locals interact with each other. When we arrived at the Riad, we were served mint tea while Karina gathered all of the ingredients for our lunch. We first made individual tagine chickens. While the tagines were cooking we made a Moroccan salad. Both dishes were delicious and inspired my friend and I to purchase our own tagines to use back in the States. Karina was a great instructor and very patient. At the conclusion, she provided us with all of the recipes and walked us back to the main square. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone visiting the area."

We were brought to a square holding Marrakesh's first mosque and the attached remains of an earlier mosque. After a few minutes explanation, we began a long trek down a series of uninteresting, empty and dirty streets. The guide inevitably chose the sunny side of the street and offered no commentary along the way. (I noted that he is the only guide we had that never explained the use of the hammams (public baths) we passed or anything about the tradition behind the Moroccan doors we saw along the way. When we finally arrived at the Saadian Tombs and the Badii Palace, he did an okay job of explaining them, but at no point was he anything more than an uninspired, humorless drone and not once did he inquire into the comfort of his guests or give us time for a bathroom break or to purchase water. After the Badii Palace, he strode off once again choosing the sunny side of the street, through another long stretch of uninteresting, shuttered streets. He then plunged into the market, saying this was only a walk-through and not pausing for us to even look around and grasp what we were seeing. When one disgusted guest asked where she could find a taxi and leave, he criticized her for not asking sooner! When we finally arrived at the main square, Jmana el Fna, hot, tired and in need of a restroom, he briefly explained the square's use, told us photos of the snake-charmers cost 10 dirhams and pointed us in the direction of public transportation. After paying @$40 for the tour, I felt I had learned little and had wasted my time and money. I recommend others buy a guidebook and do the medina on your own schedule. Guide was useless."

We only had two full days in Marrakech so thought this would be a good introduction as it included a tour of the food market, some arabic lessons and the cooking in approx 4 hours. 'Tour' of the market was basically following the woman do the shopping without much explanation of Moroccan cuisines or tips on bartering. She told us some arabic names for fruit and veg but it would have been sensible to give us some cards with pronounciation if anyone was going to retain or try and use the information. We did not shop for ourselves and were not expected to speak to the market stall owners. We weren't given a choice about what we would like to cook. Only chicken tagine where as i would have much preferred to do lamb.Once back at the riad we sat there for nearly an hour while the staff i can only presume washed up the veg and cut up the chicken. Some arab tv was put on and we were given mint tea. The staff kind of vanished and when they were around didnt really try to explain anything about Moroccan cooking or anything else of interest.We were given the food already cut up except the onion and garlic and just added what was given to us to the pot. We then waited for it to cook, and boy do tagines take a while! We were given some tea while we waited and chopped ingredients for tomato, onion and charred green capsicum salad. The interesting bit of charring the capsicum she did for us and away in the kitchen... we got to peel and chop it. So dull.All in all the food was of course yum with the fresh ingredients and spices, but the morning went on forever and I didn't learn anything during the lesson that I couldnt have just googled.Could be a good choice if you are on a trip with elderly people who find walking difficult and just want a nice sit down..."

Our hotel staff clued us in how badly we'd been ripped off- quadrupled prices for things our guide said was \"a great price. they're doing you a real deal because business is so bad.\" This was the entire reason we hired a guide: to show us a variety of things (nope) and to keep us from getting hosed (nope).

We were a bit disappointed with this tour as our guide for the market tour gave us the impression that he almost didn't want to be there and was thoroughly bored. After a short preliminary chat he marched off into the market and we struggled to keep up for most of the tour. Indeed at one point we lost him completely. He took calls on his mobile as we walked which also didn't give the best impression and did very little to give us aditional information on the history and different areas of the market. We took up his suggestion of visiting a herbal pharmacy which was interesting. Our tour began at 3.30pm and was supposed to last 3 hours including the hammam. We were slightly irritated to discover that the hammam booking had been made for 6.30pm so there was about an hour to kill between the market bit and the hammam. He showed us where the Hammam was and we agreed to go back on our own at the appointed time. The hammam was Les Bains de Marrakech and we enjoyed that part very much although it bore very little resemblance to the description in the literature for the tour. It was more like an upmarket hotel spa than the authentic experience we were expecting from the blurb.We booked this tour in avance of our departure via Expedia and I don't think it was value for money."

Firstly, he was very knowledgable and there was no single question he couldn't answer. Secondly, he was extremely flexible and adjusted the tour to our wishes and areas of interest. Marrakech is an amazing city. And it's fun to wonder around without any plan, to get lost in its colourful streets and markets... But before doing so, in my opinion, one must get a real insight into the culture and everyday life of the people. Traveling is not just about seeing things, it's much more about understanding them. And having someone local helping you understand is extremely valuable.Thank you guys for a wonderful experience!"

Marrakech is an amazing place to visit but you really have to go in and be prepared to meet it at it's level of energy. As a woman traveling alone, I was giving all sorts of advice before leaving home and decided it best to book a days orientation tour with a local guide. I was lucky enough to have Youssef all to myself to guide me through the contrasts of culture, city scapes and architecture of Marrakech. Yousseff was knowledgeable and friendly, open to explore some tea and spice stores with me - even though it wasn't part of the agenda nor particularly his interest. We covered a lot of ground strolling through the new town, the medina (great for orientation around the at first disorienting souks), Jewish quarter, monuments and riads. I had a wonderful day, which felt much like hanging out with a friend. Having a local guide in invaluable to get a real view of the place and an understanding of everyday life in the hearts and minds of the Marrakechy's. When I returned a week later, to meet friends, I was able to be the tour guide, renacting Youssef's tour. Thanks Youssef for your great perspective and hospitality."

We roamed the local fresh fruit and veg souk searching for the best produce we could find. I liked the way Karima bought things along the way making sure that not only one person benefited from our custom. To me this is a great example of resonsible tourism.Once we got to the dar we entered a very unassming door we were inside a gorgeous dar. The cooking was well paced and simple to follow. All of the instructions were clearly explained and it was a very hands on experience. As a vegeterian I thought it may be a problem. That was not the case, I made my very own delicious veg. tajine for one. The meal was accompanied by a delicious salad we prepared and a sweet desert.

He was highly knowledgeable and showed us places we would never of found, gave us lots of photo opportunities and his english was excellent. Our 3 1/2 hour tour ended up being around 5 hours and Jamal would happily have toured for longer if we had wanted to.Day 2 we were met by Aziz at our riad and made our way to his jeep with bottles of water supplied for us. Within minutes you feel like you have known him for years, he was so friendly and knowledgeable with a fabulous sense of humour that had us laughing all day long. He took us to a traditional berber market, followed by a visit to a berber house where we had mint tea. Both were an amazing insight into the berber way of life. We also visited an argan oil factory and then went on up the mountain where we were guided up the rocks to the waterfalls and back down for a late lunch sat by the river. Aziz was happy to pull over on many occasions for us to take photos and he is clearly well known and liked at the locations he took us to. His passion for Morocco is so infectious he has made us realise there is so much more to see and do, not only in Marrakech but also the surrounding areas. He has certainly wetted our appetite for day trips to the beach, overnight safaris and climbing Mount Toubkal!! Hopefully we will be back in the not too distant future and Aziz would be our one and only choice to tour with again. Thank you Aziz for making our trip such fun."

The Atlas Mountains were amazing and should be a must for anyone who visits Marrakesh/Morocco. We had lunch at the Kasbah Du Toubkal which was absolutely delightful. It was so relaxing to just sit, after lunch, with coffee in the complete silence of the mountains where your worries just disappeared. We could have spent the whole day just at the Kasbah just relaxing and watching the world go by. On the way back Aziz also took us off the \u201cItinerary\u201d so we had a different trip back and therefore saw a different part of Morocco than the one we saw on the way out. He also took us off road to a beautiful lake where my wife and I got some lovely photos before heading back to the city. I couldn\u2019t recommend Aziz and his company more highly.

We would recommend it to everyone to book a tour with Aziz. You won't be dissapointed!"

The first day was focused around the city, some of the key historic sites as well as a cool camel ride. We had a great time and took him up on his offer to head up to the mountains and experience Berber life the next day. That was really amazing. Awesome views and a gorgeous and tasty lunch in an authentic Berber house, plus a couple extra stops. Thanks, Aziz!"

We learned and experienced their culture which made us love Morocco more. We've been to different places with mesmerizing views, and restaurants to try their specialties. You'll never be lost when you are with your Moroccan hosts but enjoy every single part of your trip. With their enthusiasm, you will surely be delighted to discover and explore Marrakesh. They are the best tourguides and they will always look after you. Definitely coming back again!"

We were recommended Marrakesh Keys Travel through the riad we were staying at (also really wonderful - Riad Chayma) and Aziz was the person to collect us from the airport. He was so welcoming, helpful and informative, so nice to meet someone so friendly after all the travelling and the queuing! We wanted to go into the Atlas mountains during our stay and Aziz had also been booked to take us on this, we were really pleased to find out that it was him again. The trip into the mountains was fabulous and the cooler temperatures up there were a welcome relief from the heat! We learnt so much through Aziz about the area and history and saw some interesting places on the way. The transport was really comfortable and it was nice to know that we were on safe hands on those roads!Aziz stopped so we could take photos at various points, the mountains are stunning. We had then also pre-arranged to do around an hour's trek in the mountains which was fascinating. We were expecting to stop for dinner somewhere but Aziz had so kindly arranged for us to have dinner in the mountains in the traditional Berber guest house, such kind and generous hospitality and one of the most amazing settings (on a terrace in the mountains), if not the most scenic place we have ever eaten! Delicious food and drink, so much better than we could have ever hoped for.Aziz also took us back to the airport at the end of our stay, he even carried out luggage all the way to the check-in desk at the airport. He couldn't have been more helpful. We would recommend Marrakesh Key Travel to anyone for a safe, comfortable, knowledgeable and really fun time. Our day in the mountains is one we will never forget."

Usually a separate guide will take you down to the bottom of the falls, but as I can't walk up slopes, Aziz kindly took us on a walk around the top of the falls and took some photos for me.

From the beginning of the day it was a pleasure to be in his company, he collected us from our Riad and immediately was so accommodating. We approached his modern and spacious car for what was a brilliant journey, great conversation and immense knowledge not only of Morocco but general too. We chose the Ourika Valley trip which included a visit to a local Berber Village, even being hosted at a locals house before heading into the womens cooperative where they produce various argon products. This was also fascinating and interesting. I must say Aziz was very helpful, especially when helping me deal with a very irrational fear of chickens - not once did he make any issue of checking the path before we approached various points of the trip. The valley was excellent, I could describe the whole day to you with a range of superlatives to really communicate the excellent service and value you get from this trip but I don't think words can do it enough justice. His whole trip is like a well oiled machine, he is very well known in the villages and seemingly respected by the locals. His knowledge and genuine passion for the area made this the highlight of my whole trip. I would happily endorse this trip and also more importantly Aziz to anyone wishing to visit Marrakesh."

Our driver for the afternoon tour was also good and was happy to wait whilst we ate lunch and swapped some money. The day tour to the Atlas Mountains with Kamal was fantastic. We stopped at a Berber market and a women's cooperation to see how Argan oil is made before starting a drive up the mountains on a lot of windy roads. Kamal's driving was excellent and he gave us a lot of information en route. We then met our guide, Sayed, who took us on the hike to see the waterfalls. It was challenging at times (definitely wear good shoes!) but Sayed was so helpful and even carried our bags! He was happy to take lots of photos for us and the stop at the top to have a quick drink was much needed and provided a great view. Overall great tours at a reasonable price with friendly guides- would definitely recommend!"

This company is affiliated to the Riad we were staying at (Riad Chayma) but this is not an exclusive arrangement This as they also work independently from their website etc.. We first met Kamal our driver, on our pre-arranged transfer at Marrakech airport. He was very pleasant and was more than happy to divert to a bureau de change on the way to our Riad, to help us out. The next time we met Kamal, we had booked the half day \u201csee the sights of Marrakech\u201d tour, by this stage we had already started to understand how crazy the road users are over there. At no time, did we ever feel in danger, in fact he was very calm throughout. We had an excellent half day, he took us to numerous places, asked us if we wanted to go in or not (you pay your own entry fees, although not expensive at all) and always waiting within a few yards of where he dropped us. There was never any time pressure like \u201cbe back in 20 minutes\u201d or the likes. As we drove around he did offer information about the various areas and their history and how the culture of Marrakech has changed over the years and would always answer any questions asked, no matter what they were. We think this is a must-do tour, which helps makes sense of the layout of Marrakech and its landmarks.We also booked a full day tour to Ourika Valley in the Atlas Mountains. This encompasses a visit to see a Berber house and its family, and an Argan oil cooperative and also on the right day a Berber market. At the Berber house we were there alongside other tour groups of a much larger size, this was where we really saw the value of a personal, not group, guide. Kamal really knows his stuff and is always happy to check for any specific requirements that his guests have. He took us around the Berber market, which was quite an experience, pointing out various traditions and customs on the way. We then went on to the mountains/riverside where we had lunch at a real hidden jewel riverside restaurant. This is the point where you are handed over to a local guide for the trek up to see the waterfalls. Note \u2013 whilst we saw all sorts of people in all sorts of footwear, please do make sure you are attired appropriately and are up to the trek!! If you can make it to the top it\u2019s worth it, there are the inevitable local craft produce stalls on the way. This was a fantastic day, with so many differing experiences, that will stay with us for a long time. Kamal is a very engaging chap, very polite, incredibly knowledgeable and accommodating and had a good sense of when we just needed some quiet time for reflection during the various journeys.Finally, Kamal took care of our transfer back to the airport, where he escorted us right up to the check in desk. As usual there was no fuss, no dramas, no lateness, and therefore no worries. This was consistently our experience with Marrakesh Keys Travel. Thanks. Delighted customers."

This trip is available as a 2 night/3 day tour or a 3 night/2 day tour, which we opted for and we are so glad we done this. There is so much to see and cram in during this time that the 3 night tour gives you the best opportunity to take in all the beautiful scenery in at your own pace. Aziz, our tour guide, was amazing! He is so knowledgeable and passionate about his country it is hard not to get caught up in the spirit and the culture. He makes you feel comfortable and no request is too big. As keen photographers he was happy to make detours/extra stops to capture the best shot. The trip started off with an amazing drive through the Altlas Mountains (stopping off for lots of photos!), over the Tizi n'Tichka Pass into Ouarzazate for lunch before reaching the beautiful oasis town of Skoura for our overnight stray. Here we had time to explore the area before an amazing tradition Berber meal back at the guest house. The second day was onto the desert stopping off at a breathtaking gorge and for lunch before heading out to the Sahara for a sunset camel trek into the desert. Amazing! The third day was an early start watching the sunrise then a camel back to the car before heading back a different route to Skoura stopping off at another beautiful gorge for lunch with an amazing view!The last day we headed back towards Marrakech stopping off at the stunning UNESCO world heritage Kasbah of Ait Benhaddou where many movies have been filmed. Aziz also took us to a traditional BBQ Berber cafe where we tasted the best lamb of our holiday!We honsetly can not reccoment Aziz and his tour enough. There are many places in Marrakech offering similar tours like this to the desert but we heard on the grapevine they are usually poor quality coach tours with no flexibility with stops and poor customer service. With Aziz it is a private, comfortable, air conditioned vehicle offering a unique once-in-a-lifetime one-to-one private experience were you get to see the 'real' authentic Morocco."

We had a traditional Moroccan dinner in a beautiful restaurant and walked through the markets and saw snake charmers and a zillion little stalls. We visited a museum full of beautiful mosaics and art. I remember vaguely visiting a kind of natural remedy kind of shop, where we tried out natural herbal remedies for coughs, headaches etc.we also visited the tombs which to me were quite eerie but very interesting. Definitely a place to visit, and I wish to return one day with my fiance. A lovely place full of history and religious monuments."

Starting our visit in Marrakesh on Sunday 11 jan 2015 we took this tour which gave us a perfect introduction to our one week stay in this wonderful city. We could not have had a better guide than Mr Aziz who showed us the most interesting parts (fashionable and less fashionable) and adapted the tour to us in a very professional and personal way. There seemed to be no questions that Mr Aziz could not answer about the city and/or Morocco. We recommend Marrakesh Keys Travel to every visitor to Marrakesh.//Annika & Rolf, Stockholm, Sweden"

The trip was very pleasant and the entire family enjoyed the holiday trips in several places of Morocco.. We enjoyed the camel ride in the desert and we stayed in the Camp inside the dessert. The staff made our desert holiday with pleasant entertainment and music also in the desert night. We have been provided with strict vegetarian food also according to our preference. The Driver and Aziz were very helpful and they also carried our children on their shoulders to help us several times. We felt it is great way to experience the countryside of Morocco. All the site seeing places were covered and we had an opportunity to see the Film production studio Hollywood branch in Morocco. In the end we came to Riad Chayma in Marrakech. That riad is an excellent place well decorated with luxury of comfort. We felt this a wonderful and memorable experience in our life and we highly recommend other tourists to contact Aziz to get help and support for their holiday in Morocco. We enjoyed the hospitality of the staff of Riad Chayma. We celebrated birth day party for 3 people and the staff arranged excellent food and birth day celebrations to our group and they made our trip a memorable holiday and they were all very kind and helpful. and provided entertainment and music during the Birthday celebrations time. also and in Desert Night camp also..We find Mr Aziz is knowledgeable on wide variety of subjects and he and his staff provide music entertainment also and support us in carrying all our luggage smoothly when we are all moving from one place to another in his 16 seater van.He stopped the van for us to see the natural scenery in several places on the rout and allowed us to take video and still pictures. We had group of people from India and also from Boston USA and they all amazed and satisfied with the arrangement of the trip organised by Rochelle of Riad Chayma and Aziz .Rochelle reserved the entire Riad Chayma for our group and arranged the birth day parties and also arranged our group to see the places also. All our friends appreciate the services of staff in both Riad Chayma and Aziz and his driver during our 16 days tripDr MDR Gupta UKSharada Ramakrishna. and group"

He is extremely knowledgeable on a wide variety of subjects, knows his way around everywhere we go and is not the type of guy that takes you to all kinds of shops or businesses where you feel forced to purchase things you don't need. This time we went with one of his staff to Amizmiz and Tnirte, 60 kms (but a three hour ride) away from Marrakech. In Tnirte you experience the same authentic atmosphere as in the Medina but now in a remote village with not a single shop and nature as your primary companion. We spent our Christmas day in the only hotel in Tnirte, had a very simple meal and no other beverage than water and yet had an absolutely great time. Thanks Anas for your pleasant company!"

My wife, daughter and I visited Morocco in August 2014 for the first time and were introduced to Aziz by one of our daughter\u2019s friends who recommended him, having enjoyed a memorable vacation in Morocco with Aziz as their Guide. We were provided with his telephone number and proceeded to contact him for advise and guidance on making the most of our 10 day trip. From the moment Aziz answered the phone, his warmth, knowledge and professionalism were apparent. A few more calls and emails soon began to crystallise what we felt would suit our aspirations, holiday duration and budget, and between us our itinerary was in place.On our arrival in Marrakech Aziz was there to meet us at the agreed place and time, with a charismatic demonstration of the warmth and friendliness reminiscent of our previous phone calls, plus a striking and film star like initial entrance in his traditional Moroccan Djellaba. From that point on and throughout our vacation, our experience with Aziz was more like being in the presence of a life long friend.Within the cool comfort of his air-condition SUV, designed to match the impending terrain and 40 degrees plus August Moroccan weather, we were chaperoned through all of the areas on our list and some which we had not even anticipated, with constant recommendations of what was the best option and those to be avoided. Some of the experiences that were off the beaten track were extremely memorable including The Tannery on the outskirts of the Medina, one of the best camel rides in Marrakech at The Palmeraie, Bahia Palace, Majorelle Gardens, Koranic School Marrakech and an Excellent City Carpet Merchant (Les Nomades de Marrakech).A truly memorable experience was a visit to Essaouira, to soak up the unique culture and cuisine of this unique seaside town. On our return to Marrakech once again the local insight of Aziz enabled us to experience visiting an old traditional, small Berber Market Place out side of Marrakech.Another memorable day was spent in unique and picturesque Ourika Valle, followed by an unforgettable drive into the Atlas Mountains, on a route only ventured by someone with the know how and experience of Aziz. Even now the thrill of that trip is relived vividly each time I watch the breathtaking videos we took.These are just a flavour of the things and places we experienced in the company of Aziz from \u201cMarrakesh Keys Travel.\u201d The fact that in addition, throughout our stay our conversations enabled us to further explore each others cultures, personal experiences and families stories, provided an addition level of fun, knowledge and insight that would be difficult to match. Our new friend Aziz and our family still correspond and his details and that of Marrakech Keys Travel have been given to our family and friends planning to visit several other locations in Morocco, about which Aziz is equally knowledgable.We look forward to having Marrakesh Keys Travel and the fabulous Aziz as our guide on our next trip to this wonderfully enchanting country."

He was so friendly with us and the children, we got on really well from the start and throughout the day.We stopped at an Argan Oil Women's Cooperative and a Berber house, it was all very interesting and the children really enjoyed experiencing a different culture.The Ourika Valley was beautiful, it is very busy but definitely worth a visit to escape the craziness of Marrakech.We were taken off road both on the way there and way back, it was really exciting. We also had a wonderful guide who took us up to the waterfalls, which was quite a hike but great fun, especially paddling in the icy cold waters ideal to cool us down on another scorching day in Morocco.I would definitely recommend Marrakech Keys Travel for any of your excursions in Morocco, we hope to be able to fit in a trip to the desert next time!"

We booked Marrakech Keys to take us to the Ouzoud Waterfalls and also to Imlil to see the Mountains and I have to say it was the best part of our holiday! From the outset the company were efficient and professional, we had almost instant email confirmation and help planning which trips to do on which days depending on what markets etc. were going to be open on specific days. We were collected by Aziz\u2019 brother Kamal who was a really really nice chap, happy to answer any questions we had about the trips or just about life in Morocco in general. I should also say that his English was also very good. The car was comfortable and clean with more than enough space for the two of us but a family could also comfortably fit in. The trips themselves were really really good. The company have links with local tour guides who will take you round the locations. The local guides were also knowledgeable and certainly worth the small fee. Both the Imlil trip and Ouzoud waterfalls require decent trainers but nothing more hardcore than that.I did a lot of shopping around before choosing this company and am absolutely sure that they are offering one of the best packages available at a very very reasonable price!We just want to thank Kamal and Aziz again for such a terrific holiday and we are definitely planning to come back next year to do the desert safari!!"

My friend and I took a day trip to Ourika Valley during our time in Marrakech with Aziz and it was one of the most amazing and fulfilling experiences I've had. My friend and I had a great time learning about the Berber life, but we especially enjoyed hiking in the mountains to reach some beautiful waterfalls and breath-taking views. We are really glad we chose to hike past the first waterfall. It was challenging at points,but as someone who has never climbed a mountain before, it is definitely manageable and our guide was fantastic. He knew the mountain well and we felt secure in his knowledge of the mountain and climbing. Lunch in Ourika Valley may have been the best thing I've ever tasted, not to mention very relaxing after climbing the mountain.I highly recommend this tour. Ourika Valley was also a nice escape from the summer heat of the city. It's definitely something you have to experience and see for yourself."

In fact, I booked him myself because of the reviews here.I visited Marrakech with my teenage daughter and he collected us at the airport and took us to the hotel for about 1/5th of what the hotel quoted me for a transfer!We did a day trip to the Ourika Valley, stopping off at the Berber Market (fascinating \u2013 everything from recycled tyres to live rabbits), stopped for tea at a Berber House and also visited an Argan Oil cooperative. When we reached Setti Fatma village, Aziz introduced us to another guide and we climbed with him to the 2nd waterfall. Luckily we were wearing runners as it can be tricky in places.Worth the walk though.Aziz is a fountain of knowledge and happy to answer any question on anything from religion to politics. We also did a half-day city tour and he took us to some of the sights \u2013 Jardin Majorelle, Bahia Palace, Saadian Tombs, the Palmeries, The Tanneries etc. For us, it was perfect to be driven to the sights and then we explored on our own and he was waiting outside to take us to the next place.He also arranged a guide to do a walking tour of the Medina and his brother picked us up at the hotel and dropped us back. Like the other reviewers, I can\u2019t praise Aziz highly enough. He is just a really nice person, very genuine, huge knowledge, clearly loves what he does and genuinely wants his guests to enjoy the experience. We found him to be the perfect guide. His brother actually took us back to the airport and he came in with us, found the departure forms for us to fill out and made sure we knew where everything was etc. It\u2019s worth noting that even if you\u2019ve checked in online, you still have to get your boarding card stamped at the airline check-in desk before you go through security.Thank you Aziz."

I took my 66 year old father for a long weekend and booked Marrakesh Keys Travel for two days out to the mountains and the coast based on research and of course reviews on Tripadvisor. Visiting Marrakech during the mid summer and during Ramadan was a bit of a challenge so it turned out that it was the best decision we made to take the trips out of town. As a travel writer (Wanderlust, Business Traveller, Lifestyle and Travel) I am used to a high standard of service and it's in my nature to nit-pick over bad service, poor communication and perhaps not getting good value for money. I could not fault MKT. Aziz turned a hectic, hot and exhausting trip to Marrakech into one that was filled with tons of cultural, religious and historical insight, at a pace that was relaxed yet efficient, and at all times very comfortable. He knows the country and the politics back to front and loves nothing more than to share his passion with his clients. He also went out of his way to go beyond what we paid for in terms of service, making sure that from the moment we were collected to the moment we were dropped off everything was organised, authentic and interesting. I would even go as far to say that I found Marrakech only worth a day or two at most - get out of the city and see the best that Morocco has to offer. You won't be disappointed. I am already contemplating my next trip out (maybe a few nights in the desert?), and I couldn't think of anyone I would trust more and would like to spend time with whilst touring through Morocco. Thanks Aziz! David and family."

We simply could not have done such a big trip without a guide and Aziz was much more than just a guide - he was like an old friend showing us around his country. Aziz was patient with our big party, giving us plenty of time to wander around and take in the sights but never losing track of anyone. He has a wonderful sense of humour and showed a real interest in what we wanted to do, see and know, stopping at one point to ask some farmers what a crop was when one of our group wanted to know what it was, and administering natural medical remedies for those with an upset stomach. Our tour took in the high Atlas Mountains, ruined Kasbahs, abandoned well irrigation systems, gorges, a night in the desert and camel ride, a Berber market, Fez, Chefchouen and finally, a personalised delivery to the ferry terminal in Tangier. Accommodation throughout was good, with many of the meals included. I would highly recommend Aziz for any day trips from Marrakech, or longer tours in Morocco. We stayed at Riad Chayma and when Aziz was not available, his brother Kamal took us on a day trip to the Atlas Mountains. All was organised through the Riad with ease.

My girlfriend had a bad car-sick and Aziz took us to the closest pharmacy to get pills. How sweet and caring. He knew the people and the place so well so if you want anything you can just ask him. I also asked him a lot about some history of Marrakesh and again he knew it perfectly and he spoke perfect English.We went to a day excursion to Atlas Mountain and Ourika Valley. Before we started, we took an optional camel ride around some lovely palm trees! It was fun and if you have children travelling with you, he/she could ride a donkey! After that, we then moved on to our journey. The journey was amazing as I could enjoy the sunshine and the landscape of ourside Marrakesh. Before reaching the mountain, Aziz brought us to the berber village as well and you can see how people barter and trade goods in the old days! It was one of the most memorable and interesting markets I have ever seen. We did not go to the top of Atlas Mountain as we only had limited time to go to both places. But Aziz knew where was the best spot for scenery and we stopped and enjoyed. Then at the Ourika Valley it is lovely as well, Aziz took us to a lovely place to have lunch with people playing music. It was outdoor so I enjoyed the waterfall and the tagine! Up the Valley was a bit of a challenge but the whole experience was amazing.In the past I joined quite a few different tours and excursion in different countries but I generally found them bad and expensive. However, Aziz surprised me and the experience was great!Thanks a lot Aziz I will find you again if I visit Marrakesh in the future. Johnny & Natalie"

He made us discover a real Morocco. We really enjoyed the days we spent with him, and hope to meet again in another visit to Morocco."

We were with Aziz on two days - the first a half day tour of Marrakech, which helped us to get our bearings, and the second a full day trip to the Atlas Mountains where we had lunch (pre-arranged) in a small hotel/restaurant in the middle of nowhere. Apart from being an excellent driver (Aziz had to be this as it snowed in the mountains while we were eating lunch, about 2.5cm), Aziz is great fun to be with. He has a great sense of humour and is extremely helpful, going far beyond what one might normally expect of a driver/guide.Next time we are in Morocco we plan to travel with Aziz into the desert and will really look forward to it. It is people such as Aziz who make their own country special for visitors and make us want to return, which we certainly will."

We spent a very enjoyable day with him travelling to the Atlas Mountains. He is a good driver and very considerate of his guests interests. He took us through a Berber market on our way to the mountain. Which was truly fascinating and not to be missed by any first-time visitor to Morrocco. Since English is my first language, I was very grateful to have such a fluent speaker who was willing to converse on all topics, quite important in a guide, I think. Thank you ever so much Aziz, we had a really lovely stay thanks, in part, to your kind attention. Katy & Gary."

We were staying in Marrakech for a few days and wanted to see the Atlas Mountains and Ait Ben Haddou (where many films such as Babel, Gladiator and Lawrence of Arabia have been filmed). We contacted Aziz (the owner of this company) and he arranged an amazing day trip for our family of 4. He collected us at 8am in his new 4WD and drove us to Telouet. Upon learning that my husband was a geologist, he then drove us along a 4WD road to Ait Ben Haddou via a salt mine which he arranged for us to go into. It was an incredible experience and a day that we will never forget. He arranged private tour guides for us in Telouet and Ait Ben Haddou and lunch in Ait Ben Haddou. It was a long day (we only got back to Marrakech at 7.30pm) but it has been the highlight of our travels in Morocco. I would certainly recommend Aziz. He speaks excellent English, is an excellent driver and is a very knowledgable tour guide."

Even so, Aziz is a local Moroccan and has an extensive knowledge of Marrakesh and all the nearby destinations that are ideal for a day tour. I thoroughly recommend a trip to the Atlas Mountains - Ourika Valley (including Berber market, which was amazing) and the Moroccan coast - Essaouira. Aziz is informative about all aspects of Moroccan life - geography, history, politics etc. - which makes for a facinating time even when travelling to & from destinations - He also offers good, honest tourist advice - what to see, where to buy, where to eat, what to pay etc. These tours are excellent value for money. I wish we had spent more time in Morocco to do more of them."

Communication was excellent and we booked two tours with him. the first was to the sights of the city and a walking tour of the Medina. We did a half day first with Ali in the medina he has grown up in the medina and everybody knows him. He took us places i would not have walked. He took us to see the handicraft goods being made,locksmiths making the huge locks for the riads very interesting. He also took us to a place to buy real spices. Worth a trip. Had a drink at a riad with Aziz then did the city tour in his vehicle. Went to the tanneries (Very interesting) the palmerie (old marrakesh) Gardens etc. Aziz is a wealth of Knowledge and his english is first class as he spent time in England.The second trip was into the Atlas mountains. A visit to the Berber village was nice and as Aziz has berber blood his tour and information was very good. Take books pens pencils etc for the children. We where asked not to give them money as it doesnt teach them that they have to work for money. The mountains are spectacular . Lunch was in a valley after visiting the waterfalls. (Take good shoes with plenty of grip with you ) A really nice day and a welcome change from the city.I would highly recommend Aziz for the trip cost was about \u00a3100 per day but didnt inc lunch,drinks or entrance fees."

When our inbound flight to Marrakesh was cancelled due to the French air strike and the only other flight we could get was to Fez which is 240 miles away from Marrakesh and a 5 hour drive :( This was no challenge for you. You greeted us at Fez airport on time with a big friendly smile and wave, even though you had just made the 5 hour and 240 mile drive from Marrakesh to collect us in a private air conditioned vehicle. You made the long journey back interesting by pointing out locations and sharing information about the cities we passed, Rabat, Agadir and Casablanca. You not only delivered us safely to our riad but you arranged a late reservation at a hip local restaurant and a personalised birthday cake for my sister delivered to her by singing waiters. This was lovely touch and an excellent service. You even refused to let us catch a taxi back to the riad, you came back for us in the early hours of the morning to drop us back to the riad safely. You are a true gentleman.We really enjoyed the day trip to the Atlas mountains you took us on, to meet some Berber people and buy some pure Argon oil from the women's corporation along the way...these are memories which will last a lifetime and we're so grateful we met you.

Having looked through trip advisor we saw that Aziz stood out from the rest as having the best reviews and his trip sounded awesome. 3 days doing the mountains gorges and a night in the desert. He came back quickly with all the information I asked for by email. The night before we departed he came to the hotel where we are staying to meet us and to make sure we were happy with the plans. This personal service eased any worries that we might not get picked up as I have read on other operator\u2019s reviews. His 4 wheel drive was clean and new and very comfortable (important for the length of the journey). Aziz had a huge knowledge on Morocco, and both Barbour and Arabic traditions which he was happy to share. We were worried by the distance to travel but with regular stops at either historic sites great views or just somewhere to good to have some food the miles flew by.We visited a huge mix of sites including Kasbahs, underground water courses (awesome), gorges and fossil collections. Each place we arrived Aziz had phoned ahead and arranged an excellent guide who new the site well. This meant we got the good tour without the hassle of haggling over the cost of a tour. We gave each a tip for the tour and we were on our way happy. The only time we tried to sort our own tour we were asked for 10x as much. There were a couple of bit we wanted to buy while we were with Aziz and he was great for giving us tips on where to avoid (staying away from fakes and high prices).The night in the gorges was brilliant just such a stunning setting (cold though so bring warm clothes, in April). The night out in the desert was the real highlight for us. We had asked about how many people would be at the camp where we would stay and I had intimated that few would be good just in conversation, Aziz in usual style had managed to change the company we were using and when we arrived we were led to our camels (which for camels were amazingly friendly) and with our guide rode out into the desert just the two of us. Within 500m we found the first \u2018desert\u2019 camps which were really just about in town. We were very pleased to continue on for an hour during sunset and into the moonlight out to our camp. The camp was very comfortable and the food was great. Our camp was again just the two of us which was perfect. I climbed to the top of a dune with my girlfriend and came down with my fianc\u00e9e. The perfect setting.On the final day we rode out after sun rise (spectacular) and back to a hot shower and breakfast. We had a lot of miles to do as we were going beyond Marrakesh all the way to Essaouira. Aziz had again been brilliant by having his brother speak to our next hotel and warn them that it was going to be very late when we arrived so they were ready for us. We still don\u2019t know if it was him but we arrived to an upgrade as well.Sorry for this diatribe but we had a brilliant trip, I have travelled the world and this is one of the highlights (getting engaged not mandatory). Aziz makes it, I cannot recommend him more highly. Enjoy."

We travelled with Aziz to Ouarzazate, Ait BenHaddou and through the Atlas mountains. it is a long day, a real trek (the best part of 12 hours there and back) which without the right guide could have been tough going, but luckily we had Aziz, who delighted in telling us all about Berber culture and stopped us off at lovely places so that i could get some wonderful panoramic shots of the Moroccan countryside. Nothing was too much trouble for him, and it was a joy from start to finish. I can't praise him highly enough. If you are going to do any trekking from Marrakech then ask for Aziz!"

Our 1st visit was to visit the Atlas Mountains which took us in to Toubkal National park with pick-up and drop off for just our private party to and from the Riad. Along the route we stopped at a couple of Berber villages, a waterfall and a market and an Argan Oil Womens Cooperative. For lunch we ate besides a river some delicious traditional food. The trip lasted the full day and we were well looked after at all times. Aziz is very friendly. He was passionate and knowledgeable and able to answer all manner of questions that we threw at him about Morroco and its culture.Our 2nd trip, this time as a couple, was to Essaouira, which is a wonderful port and fishing town. We took the opportunity to ride on camels on the beach. Along the way, we came across goats sitting in Argan trees. My only disappointment on this trip was it took 2.5-3h to travel there, a little longer than described in the Riad brochure, but nevertheless it was again well organised and we really enjoyed the laid-back town as a retreat from Marrakesh."

This trip as well as our airport pick up was organised through our Riad who described Aziz as a smiling driver, that he certainly was! He was polite, courteous, informative and overall great company. Throughout our day he showed us amazing sights and panoramic vistas of the Atlas Mountains, he gave us a real insight into life in Marrakech and of the Berber people. Aziz was always keen to share his knowledge & was always game for a laugh. We will certainly use him & the company again when we return to Marrakech."

He is also eager to ensure that you get value for money in any activity you wish to do (and if you ask him where to do a certain activity he will certainly give you honest advice that you can rely on). When we come back to Morocco we will definitely be getting in contact again with Aziz. Someone you can trust. We were also impressed by his useful facts everywhere we went.

We booked Aziz after seeing the trip advisor reviews and couldn't be happier. Aziz turned up on time in a comfortable, air conditioned, 4 x4 and from the moment he arrived we felt comfortable with him. He speaks perfect English, is polite, knowledgeable , friendly and humorous and a very good, safe driver. We were taken to the berber market which happens on a monday and a thursday and was truly amazing like stepping back in time 1000 years, nothing at all like the souks and amazing . We then went on for tea with a berber family in a traditional house and visited the oulrika valley and climbed the waterfall, an exhilaerating experience. We finished our day with a camel ride. Aziz knows everybody and we were never hassled and got the best price for things we wanted. A whole days trip for an amazing 40 euros each ( guide to the top of the waterfall 1000 dirhams and camel 150 dirhams) but all so much cheaper than thompsons and fantastic one to one service. Was by far our best day out and when we return we will be hiring Aziz once again"

They were aware of every good spot & locations which were worth stopping for a break (Berber houses / Mint Tea) & photos (beautiful scenic spots)...very flexible in the sense that we did change our plans with a few places & they were quite responsive to adjust the routes & make up the travel times.*** Infact,they went out of their way to help us to remember this trip more so > when we forgot our camera when we visited the \"Comptoir Darna\" (one very good food + belly dancing hotel in Marrakech) - they were so kind to nip to the Riad (The Luxurious Riad Chayma) & get the camera so that we could still continue with the dinner & the party -:) we really cherish those photos & can't THANK enough for Marrakesh Keys travel's extraordinary service...there is no second thoughts that we will surely book their services whenever we visit Morocco !!!"

On day one we were picked up from our Riad by the lovely Youssef, who brought us to our private 4x4 and introduced us to our driver Omar. We then set off on our journey to the High Atlas Mountains. The road up the mountains is full of corkscrew bends which were a bit of a challenge for my friend as she gets carsick but Omar was a very considerate driver and took the bends slowly. The views enroute were spectacular. In the afternoon we reached the Ait Bin Haddou Kasbah which was amazing. It dates from the 11th century and has been the setting of many Hollywood movies. From here, we travelled to Ouarzazate and spent the night in the Dar Chamaa hotel which was very nice and the food was tasty. The second night was spent in the desert. We rode to the camp by camel which was actually great fun, even though getting on and off the camel was a little bit daunting! Watching the stars late at night from the top of a sand dune was just beautiful. The next morning we woke early to watch the sunrise and then it was off to a hotel by camel for a shower and some breakfast. The third day saw us visit the amazing Todra gorge amongst other places. We had hoped to spend the night in the Auberge Chez Pierre but unfortunately it was fully booked. Hassan, the owner of the company kindly arranged for us to have dinner there though and the food was wonderful. The Auberge itself looked lovely so it was a wrench to go back to the accommodation that we were booked into that night. We had an attic room and it was very shabby. It was the worst room in the building from what I could see through the open doors into the other rooms. The mattress on my bed was well past it's sell by date and we did ask to change rooms. They were full and couldn't accommodate that request but they did change the mattress for me. The door lock was dodgy too. The curtain at the window was too small and the breakfast was the poorest we had during our entire trip. This place was the only disappointment of our tour. To be fair though, I only booked the tour around six weeks before our holiday so maybe it was the best they could do at short notice. Our guide Youssef was excellent and kept us highly entertained with his terrible jokes. We had lots of laughs and he was very informative and knowledgeable too. Omar was an an excellent driver and between the two of them we were very well looked after indeed. If you're planning a road trip in Morocco, do yourself a favour and book with Sahara 4x4 Tours. I wholeheartedly recommend them .You really can't go wrong."

We are a family of 5 (2 adults and 3 children ages 12, 10, and 5 years old) and just returned from the 3 day Marrakech to Merzouga trip. It was simply amazing and the highlight of our week long trip to Morocco! Hassan was so helpful and prompt in answering all of my questions before we arrived via email and really made me feel comfortable about doing this trip which is a bit outside our comfort zone... First, let me tell you our driving Mohammad was fantastic! He was so friendly and the kids loved talking with him. We all fit comfortably in his car (luggage tied on the roof) and he was very knowledgeable and friendly. We enjoyed his company so much we always asked if he wanted to dine with us during lunch and snack stops. His English was super and he knew the good areas to stop at for the best pictures, where the bathrooms are (with kids we had to stop often), and where the best (somewhat hidden) places to eat are. I don't know if all the guides are like Mohammad, but if they are, you are in excellent hands! He also always volunteered to take our family picture, which rarely ever happens we are all together in the photo. The first night at the gorges was at a beautiful, small hotel with exceptional service. The chef stopped by all the tables and made sure we enjoyed the food which was so delicious. The breakfast was the same. The views were stunning from our balcony. The night in the desert was by far the best night of our week long trip. We all very much enjoyed the trek on the camels out to the amazing Nomad camp. The kids had so much fun \"sledding\" down the sand dunes and just running around. The sand is so clean and doesn't stick to anything and the kids were content digging holes which their hands. The \"tent\" was way better than I expected, it fit all 5 of us comfortably and was huge. The door even had a lock! The flushing toilets were so nice to have as well. And I will honestly say the dinner was one of my favorites. It was the best chicken Tagine I had ever had, so tender and the spices just right. After dinner, we enjoyed listening to Hassan and his friends play music and dance around the campfire. This was by far the best adventure and tour company we have ever used. Hassan and Mohammad were excellent and we loved every minute of it. A wonderful adventure for our family we will never forget!"

During the planning process, Hassan was great to deal with and quick to response to any questions I have especially as my parents are elderly and I was concerned about safety due to the crazy things that have been happening around the world.We were picked up from Casablanca airport by Hassan's brother Said for our 11 nights 12 days trip around Morocco, our first stop being Chefchaouen (one of our favourite city along with the desert).Said was a very patient, excellent driver/guide and gave us the insight of his berber life, family and culture. We have been on many private tours but this would count as one of the best and most memorable ones. I don't think we have laughed so much during the trip (Mohammed \"couscous\"). We felt Said was like a member of our family by the end of the trip.The tour covered the middle and high Atlas mountains, Imperial cities, desert, gorges etc. We have met really kind and friendly people during this trip. The Riads booked for us were nice and clean, breakfast and dinner were also included and the food provided were plentiful and amazing! Not to forget the welcoming mint tea at each of our Riads.Merzouga desert was such an incredible experience especially the camel ride and glamping (ensuite inside our tent) in the middle of the sand dunes. Watching sunrise is a must and the quietness and serinity were surreal.The drives between each cities were approximately 5-6 hours with the longest being from Fes to the desert. However there were many stops along the way to stretch our legs and for snacks, coffees, toilets and of course photos.This trip was such an unforgetable experience of a life time not to mention safe. There were many police patrolling the highways and we felt very safe in Morocco. I would not hesitate to recommend Sahara 4x4 to other travellers wishing to go to Morocco!  "

The country has done a very good renovation of its roads, but still they are narrower than my standards, so I was very relaxed to have Josef as the driver, as he with great care took my family and me in such a delightful trip. Sahara is mystic, you can even add some extra excitement by going for a walk in the night and get far enough away from the camp so that the dessert and the sky become one without any light distracting you. Don't miss the early sun rise at the top of the dune!Every two hours there are stops which always have a small country touch: the wild monkeys, the incredible landscapes, the well preserved fossils, the forgotten mud cities, and of course the food stops. So the long trip becomes doable even for children (8 & 10 in my case). The dinners in the hotel/Sahara are delicious, and breakfasts are abundant, the lunch stops on the way were good and ok at the lowest rating.Overall, I highly recommend making this trip."

We learned a lot from him he is well informed on everything, he always has an answer for everything , more than just getting to know someone in Morrocco we made a friendship that could last a lifetime with Boussou Alto highly recommended!Hassan will be there for you all the time and will answer all the tons of questions you have about your trip, if you can make sure to chat with Hassan he is super nice. Thank you Hassan for the hospitality and making one of our dreams come true, we had an amazing experience that we will never forget!"

Hassan handled our booking perfectly \u2013 responded timeously and gave us all the info we required. At the time of booking we had a problem with Paypal to pay the required deposit, and therefore worried that something might go wrong. Hassan assured us that they are trustworthy, they met us at our Riad on time - exactly as promised, and followed the itinerary as planned. Our driver, Mohammed, was friendly, helpful, patient and tried his best to satisfy our needs. With our pronunciation and Mohammed\u2019s limited English we unfortunately could not always understand eac hother \u2013 this we found somewhat frustrating, and feel that we could have learned more about the area if there was not such a big language barrier. We think Hassan ( the owner of the business) got the message from Mohammed that there is a language issue \u2013 Hassan came to our hotel, met with us, and between him and Mohammed arranged for an upgrade to a lovely suite at our last hotel. We appreciated this gesture very much. Mohammed is a gentle soul, an excellent driver, always on time, the car was comfortable, and he cleaned the car every morning before he collected us, put petrol in e.tc \u2013 all not to inconvenience us.We enjoyed the trip very much and can highly recommend them as a reliable tour company \u2013 the only tip is to make sure that the tour guide/driver is 100% fluent in your language.Thank you Mohammed and Hassan for the great service!"

We saw so much beauty and parts of Morocco we would not have seen any other way. The 1st night in the hotel was really good with a clear nights sky and lots of stars! Then the night in the dunes was magical. Lovely food and beautiful sky. We could not believe we were in the Sahara! Omar and Josef were really good guides, very accommodating and always answering my questions!The tip I would give is to make sure you have 10 / 20 dirhams on you as some of the stops along the way are with families, crafts people and shops and it would be good to be able to give them something.Would definitely recommend."

He dealt with the 5 of us with grace and enthusiasm! He was always happy and welcoming. He even dressed up on one of days with us which made for great pictures! He helped us in any way he could. His driving was very good and we felt safe all the time. The camel trek and night in the desert was the best part! Dinner was prepared for us and the food was great! The tents and toilet situation was way more than we expected! We wished we had a little more time in the desert while the sun was up. We did the camel trek during sunset so once we got to the camp site it was already dark. Then we left before 7 am so we didn't have much time on the dunes. We had requested sand boarding when we emailed about the tour but somehow we didn't get to do that. That was our only disappointment. Otherwise, I highly recommend this tour! Hamid, if you see this message, we just want to thank you so much for everything you did for us! You were awesome! Shukraan!"

To me the highlight of the tour was the night in the dunes, a very special experience. If I may recommend something ?

Hassan was so welcoming that we did not think twice . Moha was our guide young and enthusiastic and ensured that we feel at home . He took us to all the wonderful spots throughout the mountains and panoramic views and was indeed very very helpful and courteous. We were put up in the best hotels that Hassan arranged for us and we met him in Merzouga before we started our camel ride and night camp in the Sahara desert. Exceptional arrangement amidst the desert and comforting and tasty meals throughout . We were picked up at 8 am sharp from our hotel in Marrakech and dropped in our hotel doorstep in Fes. We would recommend this tour with Sahara 4x4 tours and Hassan to anyone visiting Morocco ."

In February 2016, my husband and I visited Morocco as part of a few week trip including Paris, Amsterdam, Jerez/Rota, etc... Our time in Morocco was the highlight of the whole trip, much due to Sahara 4x4. Hassan was professional and efficient setting up our trip and communicating with us on our plans. He also made wonderful recommendations for riads to stay at in Marrakech and Fes. Our driver and tour guide, Youssef, was amazing - knowledgeable, friendly, excellent driver. He took great care of us. Also, he went \"above and beyond\" when a snowstorm in the Atlas changed our plans and our route a bit and made our adventure a little more adventurous. ;-D Youssef was a pleasure to travel with!We did the 3 Day Marrakech - Merzouga - Fes tour. February was a very comfortable time of year to go. The scenery was fabulous; the Moroccan food and the accommodations along the way were great; and we really enjoyed talking with Youssef and other locals and other tourists we met along the way. (We are not big on doing touristy things, but the camel trek overnight in the dessert was really a lot of fun and quite romantic. Also, the stars and the sunrise out there were breathtaking.) Having the private car tour was so much better than an arranged tour bus. I would highly recommend visiting Morocco and also taking a tour with Sahara 4x4. Thank you Hassan and Youssef!"

            "review": "Overall good first time tour of the Sahara. This is the first time that my mom and I travelled to Morocco and seeing the good reviews for this tour Company, we decided to go with it. The tour guide/driver that we had, Mohamed, was very professional and punctual. He came and picked us up at 8AM sharp at our Riad in Marrakech. He is also very knowledgeable and patient in explaining to us the Berber and Moroccan culture as well as any other questions that we may have had about geography, climate, history, etc. Very safe driver as well --- always made sure we had seatbelt on lol. The only negative that I could say is that he preferred to have the windows down for most of the trip, which was not really comfortable for us (we much preferred to have the AC on given that it is still quite hot during the day in September). The first night's hotel accommodation (Chez Pierre) in Dades Valley was very nice, which we were surprised about given that it is in the middle of nowhere. The hotel serves a five course French-style dinner which is included in the tour package and was very delicious. The only thing to keep in mind is that if you come in the summer time, it will get hot in the room as it does not have AC and the windows are small (but the hotel has a pool lol). The second day was the camel trekking and the Berber camp stay. This has to be the highlight of the trip as we got to ride a camel for about 30-45 minutes to the camp and we saw the sunset on the way. I think mid September to early October is the best time to come as it is cool at night in the tents otherwise you will have to sleep outside on the sand if you come during summer. The morning of the third day, we woke up and saw an amazing sunrise as well. The tour package does not include lunches, so I would recommend telling the tour guide upfront if you want a more authentic experience rather than going to hotel restaurants that seem like only tourists would go there. You likely would get more variety of food rather than just tajine and grill meats for three lunches in a row. Overall, this is a good tour to go with if you do not want to rent a car or take public transportation yourself to the desert (note that it is not a cheap trip, but very carefree trip as we did not have to do any planning. Also note that there is A LOT of driving (probably 50 percent of the trip --- which is unavoidable)."

I booked this company to do a 2 day tour of the Zagora portion of the Sahara desert with a camel ride and an overnight stay at a Berber camp. It wasn't too pricy - 100 Euros per person, which didn't include lunches or tips, but did include one dinner and a breakfast. We were part of a wedding party and had a group of 7 people, several of which who hadn't travelled much prior to the trip. This was, hands down, the best tour I've ever been on. Our guide Ahmed was essentially a saint. The drive was long, but he was extremely knowledgeable about the culture, the land, the history, and answered every question we had without complaint. When I say every question. . .I mean it. We had someone with a social disorder (someone with no social awareness/filter/sense of personal propriety) in our party and Ahmed was patient with questions about his religion, his salary, his relationship with women, and his parenting style. I don't think I've ever encountered someone so patient. I was so impressed. His English was terrific and he was willing to translate and give us real talk about what was/wasn't a good price on goods or services.Not convinced yet? We we having a lot of trouble getting change back from dirhams from the locals. No one would take larger bills (they wanted exact change), which made it hard to buy small items and tip people. He took our larger bills and exchanged them with the local vendors in the city and then caught up to us after running around to several people. This was a no-pressure kind of tour. He stopped at a few touristy roadside attractions, but he didn't say anything about buying anything and asked us how long we wanted to stay and if we wanted to stop for things. If I go back to Morocco, this is the only tour company I'd even consider. At the end of the tour, I felt like we had totally gotten value out of the trip and it's an experience I'll never forget. "

I had looked at and contacted many different tour companies and I am so glad we went with this one. We enjoyed all of the sights and experiences. The first hotel, Chez Pierre was beautiful, but our room was not great.

It was clear from the start that Sahara tours and Youssef genuinely wanted us to enjoy ourselves and after spending much of 3 days with him, we felt looked after and safe at all times.The tour itself was fantastic, the Berber musicians in the camp entertained us with night time drumming and an amazing vibe, while being very hospitable too.

Mohammed was friendly and kind and very quickly it felt like he was an old friend. He drove safely and politely. This is the perfect tour to see the Sahara and have incredible experiences along the way that would simply not be possible on your own using public transport, plus it takes care of getting from Marrakesh to Fez. Accommodation and included Meals were fantastic. You MUST have the Berber Pizza at Cafe Nora - Mohammed will take you there. Nothing is too much trouble for Mohammed and he is full of information. The Camel Ride and sleeping under the stars in the Dunes was phenomenal. Hassan and his team are great and all communication was excellent. Thanks Mohammed!"

Mohammed was informative, drove very safely and took us to so many special and wonderful locations. We strongly recommend the 4 day trip (rather than 3 days) to give yourself more time to enjoy the Sahara. The hotels and meals were first class. A highlight was the camel ride out to the Dunes and sleeping under the stars. Climbing to the top of the dunes for sunset and sunrise was an amazing experience. Highly recommend booking this trip. Mohammed made everything easy for us so we could enjoy the experience to the fullest."

I chose the 2 night/3days of Sahara tour going thru the Andes. We toured with the guide, Said, who has been the best tour guide of my entire life. The first night hotel stay was incredible and amazing. Such a nice accommodation and dinner with African traditional music! This made us cry as we felt sooooooooooooooo happy =) Camal ride at Sahara was also nice and after Sahara night, they provided us a quick shower time in nearby hotel. I would never forget every single moment in Morocco. I don't usually leave a review after my trip. Actually this is my first time to leave the review. I really loved it. Some people visiting Morocco look for cheap tours. This trip was worth enough for what I have paid for. Said has been a guide, friend, and brother to us during whole trip. P.S. Hassan, please keep the promise with me ;) Thank you to all!(We are four Asian girls, for your reminder)Monica"

The private tour was beyond what we expected. We felt comfortable with our guide instantly. He was so warm, kind and accommodated every request we had. The tour covered so many beautiful sights, and important highlights of Morocco. We truly felt we got a full sense of the culture, history, customs, food and sights. We LOVED engaging with the warm and charming local people of Morocco. The Riads we stayed in were very clean and comfortable. We chose to reserve 2 rooms for the 4 of us at each location, which made our stay even more comfortable. We were warmly received at each Riad, welcomed with traditional mint tea and local pastries. Our daughters were treated with such love and kindness by each host/hostess at all the Riads.The tour was extremely well-organized, from comfortable and new SUV's, to perfectly timed drink and snack stops along the drives from one city to another, to having the local guides in Fes and Kasbah Ait Ben Haddou ready and waiting for us in the morning of the tour, to a well-coordinated excursion to the Sahara by camel trek, etc. There was no wasted time waiting anywhere, which is important when travelling with children, and especially in hot weather.The tour was totally customizable and accommodated our day to day needs and moods. Chefchaouen was a beautiful city, and camping overnight in the desert was a truly unforgettable experience.Exploring Morocco with Sahara 4X4 tours, and especially with our guide Said was an amazing experience for our family. We would highly recommend it for anyone and for any family."

            "review": "A great way to see Morocco. My girlfriend and I visited Morocco knowing we wanted to visit the desert and we could not have been happier with the tour we booked! When booking, Hassan was very quick to respond to all our questions letting us know exactly what we would be doing over the 3 days. Our tour guide Mohammed picked us up promptly from our hotel and we began our trip towards the Atlas mountains. Mohammed was very chatty and informative throughout the trip, what surprised me the most was that timings were very flexible and we could stop as and when we wanted. Driving through the mountains was an unforgettable experience and it was great walking around Ait Benhaddou where so many films have been shot.We stayed at Chez Pierre for our first night which was absolutely stunning! The owner could not have been any more accommodating, the food and entertainment was great. I would have happily stayed there for a few nights.Our second day started with Todra Gorge which was simply breathtaking and a good time to cool down with a quick dip. We then continued towards Merzouga stopping off along the way to take in the panoramic views. Riding a camel was an interesting experience, but one I thoroughly enjoyed, my girlfriend maybe not so much! It was amazing looking out and just seeing sand dune after sand dune. We didn't really get much sleep due to the heat so we decided to sit outside our tent and look for stars. The sunrise the next morning was so peaceful with just enough time in the morning to sledge or sandboard down the dunes. The hospitality from the staff at the camp was truly comforting and it was amazing hearing them switch from English to Arabic to Spanish.Overall this was an unforgettable experience and I highly recommend it, I was skeptical about the price at first but for the amount we did and saw it was a bargain!"

I would definately recommend travelling out of the cities/resorts like marrakech and go on a tour like this. We opted for the 2 night/3day tour which was enough time to see the main places of interest in this corner of Morocco. You will explore the countryside, landmarks, valleys, gorges, mountains and of course the sahara desert whilst meeting the welcoming berber people. These are private tours with very experienced and knowledgeable guides/drivers who will accompany you during your time, Youssef was ours, couldn't have hoped for a better guide and would recommend you ask for him. I look forward to visiting again possibly a longer tour to fez.I\u2019m wishing Hassan, Youssef and the rest of the team all the best and much success for the future. Mike"

Our guide Said picked us up from our Riad in Marrakech, and was an absolute peach right from the get-go. When he dropped us off in Fes, we felt like we were farewelling an old friend. We also had the pleasure of Hassan's company during our time in Merzouga, and found him just as friendly and helpful as he had been via email when I was planning this holiday. The accommodation was all excellent, and of a higher quality than we were expecting. During our first night in Dades Gorges, we kept pinching ourselves to check we weren't dreaming. The view, the quality of the service, the room, and the five course meal were all totally unexpected, and made a welcome change from the noise and grit of Marrakech. Our second night in the sand dunes outside Merzouga was so magical I can't even put it into words. We ended up sleeping under the stars, and even saw a desert fox! Our second night in Merzouga was a blast, and again the room, service, and meals were of higher quality than we were expecting for the very reasonable cost of the trip.The vehicle was new and very comfortable, and Said was a very safe and considerate driver. We had plenty of stops for photos and restrooms, and Said was happy to accommodate our special requests (e.g. \"Said, can you take us somewhere we can eat Camel meat?!\"). The only regret I have is that we didn't plan to do a longer tour. I will definitely be coming back to Morocco, and definitely plan to travel with Sahara Tours 4x4 again. I have no reservations whatsoever in recommending them to other travelers."

Making a travel film was easy with the great knowledge and hospitality afforded to us by our guide and friend, Mohammed.Nothing was above the call of duty and we required a lot of extra assistance whilst on the road - not to mention Moha's vast knowledge of the area being pivotal in our finding the most scenic locations.Even last minute arrangements to extend our stay were arranged for us, we really felt everything was taken care of. The camel ride through the desert was incredible. As we were filming part of the experience we required extended time on the camels and an alternative route to the desert camp. The guides were more than happy to oblige.The facilities in the camp are great, the food plentiful and delicious and the guides following the trend of everyone else we met during our time in morocco - being extremely warm and welcoming, each one going above and beyond to accommodate our needs.Thanks to Moha and everyone at Sahara Tours!We hope to see you all again soon!Billy"

When we started our initial research, we emailed and talked to several tour companies. Out of all the responses I received, Hassan's responded first only within a few hours of my email (other companies would email be back 3-4 days later). In addition to their fast response was the thorough explanation and description of the entire tour. Everything was planned out. We booked the private 3 night sahara tour.Our guide Said picked us up promptly as planned from our Riad in the Medina. I knew after only spending 5 minutes with him that he treated us very well. After only a couple of hours, he made us feel like family. Said was extremely knowledgeable and was able to answer any question we threw at him. When it was time to eat, he knew exactly at which restaurant to stop on the way. We were never disappointed with the food. Said was very easy to talk to and joke around with. Did I already mentioned that we felt like family? Our first night we stayed at a BEAUTIFUL hotel that was carefully chosen. Honestly, this hotel was such a gem, i'm going to have to receive it separately. The food was incredible and the hospitality was beyond anything we have ever experienced!The second night we stayed at our desert camp. We stopped at a hotel at the edge of the desert where we could relax, freshen up, get a drink or have a swim in their pool and/or shower before heading off on our 1 1/2 hour camel ride to our camp where we had our own private tent.A traditional dinner was served followed by some live berber music that the camp hosts (3 guys that looked after us) played and encouraged us to join in by playing drums and other instruments.Just a heads up, we went mid-july, temperatures were extremely high and the desert camp does not have electricity. The tents did get really hot inside, but we were able to move our mattress outside and sleep under the stars which was quite a treat!The following morning we woke up to coffee and the sunrise over the desert, after that we took a camel ride back to the hotel we went to the previous evening where we freshened up and relaxed and were served a beautiful breakfast. After taking a shower and a little relaxation at this hotel we began to head back to Marrakech, this time taking a different route with many beautiful stops and terrific food on the way.This was honestly one of the best tours we have taken. We also met other groups that were taking the same tour (with Hassan) at the desert camp and they were also raving about their experience. This is a fantastic tour and really a great way to experience Morocco. I would HIGHLY recommend this tour to anyone seeking out a little adventure in the desert and see the Moroccan countryside and all the beauty it has to offer.Worth every penny!!!!!!THANK YOU HASSAN AND SAID!!"

Although their 2nd language is French, their English was great & we were able to get lots of information & history etc... from them both. They were great fun & made us feel welcomed & safe. Driving through the Atlas Mountains we had several superb 'photo' stops, but the guys would stop at any stage if you asked them. There were lunch stops for us (even during Ramadan) - 1st one at Ait Ben Haddou - highly recommend a visit to this Unesco site. Something very unique. (For information, the lunches & site guides are not included in the Sahara Tours price, but are not at all expensive.) The camel ride was an experience! but the main reason we did this tour was for the overnight in the desert. As they say, these are not the high dunes, but you still very much in the desert, & the camp far exceeded our expectations!. We joined about 10 other people there which helped make the evening. The tents were beautiful with proper beds, towels & soap. There was a toilet block including showers, sinks & European style toilets, & a restaurant tent where they served a lovely meal - as good as you would get anywhere in Marrakech!. Then they entertained us with Berber music & an open fire. the Berbers advised is when sunrise was which again was something to be seen - stunning! In the morning, after a great breakfast, the options were camel ride back or join the 4x4 directly. I advise you take the camel - when else are you going to do this type of thing? Again several stops en route including Atlas Studios (Gladiator, Cleopatra etc...) Ouarzazate & a very impressive Kasbah. At no stage were we left 'hanging' not knowing what was happening - Mohammed & Youssef ensured we were always looked after, happy & enjoying ourselves. Back in Marrakech about 5.30pm right outside hotel. A MUST DO WHEN IN MARRAKECH! Many thanks Mohammed & Youssef."

He was super accommodating, helped us take photos and provided great commentary as we explored the different regions - definitely made the trip awesome for us! We really enjoyed Chez Pierre, which provided us with the best food that we had in Morocco, and the desert experience was incredibly awesome - we slept outside beneath the stars.All in all, this tour was very worth it for the price (even though we initially thought it seemed expensive!)"

Not only was Hassan super responsive and helpful via email, we booked very last minute and they accommodated us immediately. More importantly we really lucked out with our guide Youssef - he is everything you could possibly ask for in a travel host: professional, knowledgeable, accommodating, kind, funny, and an absolute blast to be around! (trust me this matters so much when you spend 4 days straight in a car with someone)Youssef adores Morocco and does everything in his power to enable you to see his country through his eyes. He immediately set the precedent that we were able to ask as many questions as we wanted without feeling silly, and provided commentary along the way with a great sense of history, culture, and humor. He turned what could have been an average tour into a priceless experience by being an absolute dream to travel with - going out of his way constantly to make sure we got the most well rounded experience by taking us off the beaten tour path to show us anything we wanted to see along the way as well as places and experiences that he loves! Not to mention he made sure we stayed hydrated, made frequent stops at interesting places to stretch out legs and accommodated our picture taking antics to the nth degree :) Could not recommend more - book with Sahara 4x4 and request Youssef!!!"

My family and I looked at a number of different tours doing a 3-day trip from Marrakesh to Fez, and I am very happy that we settled down on Sahara Tours 4x4. Our driver, Rachid, was a very respectful and safe driver who possessed a great amount of knowledge on both the Moroccan landscape, its people, political climate, and every other subject you may think about. While the road-trip may be long (you will average 6-8 hrs of being on the road, no way around it) the sights are incredible. You get to see the landscape transform from mountains to flats, desert to forest. If you're looking for any desert tour in Morocco, I highly recommend this one."

Overall, it was a unique experience! To begin with, our e-mail communication before we arrive in Morroco was very effective, as Hassan proved very responsive and informative in helping us organize our trip. When we landed in Marrakesh, our guide Mubarak was waiting for us and we started our tour with a big and comfortable Toyota Land Cruiser. We are grateful to Mubarak for the four wonderful days we spent in the Moroccan south. He was an excellent guide in every respect. We learnt a lot from him about the country and its people, he was never tired to accommodate with our wishes, yet he was descreet enough to leave us room for privacy when needed (very important, as we spent so many hours together). Every detail of our trip was wisely taken care of: we stayed in nice traditional auberges, we visited diverse places of awesome beauty (mountains, gorges, valleys, casbas, an oasis and, of course, THE DESERT!), and we met with wonderful people. It felt like traveling with family!"

Throughout the trip, Mohammed was the best: informed, courteous, organized and punctual, helpful in small details and large transactions, always able to bridge cultural differences graciously, and always with a sense of humor. A really wonderful, helpful human being to help make a great itinerary a memorable, safe vacation. Ask for Mohammed as your guide and you will not be disappointed."

            "review": "Great tour, wonderful guide!!. We did the 3 nights, 4 days Sahara tour from Marrakech to Fes. Our guide Said was great! After a little while it felt like travelling with friend. We felt that we could ask him / talk with him about anything, and he was very happy to tell us about local culture. He has also a good sense of humour, so the atmosphere was fun. He had no problem of stopping for extra photo stops whenever we wished for one. Hotels Sahara Tours 4x4 use, were really good. Car was very good with nice aircon. The 3rd day, when we drove around Sahara was a great day. Went driving offroad and met some nomads which was very interesting. No other tourists were involved so it was really authentic experience. Merzouga days were especially interesting as Said is from a village nearby. He really knew what he was talking about. So if you have a chance to take this 4 day tour, I would recommend to do it, instead of 3 days. Our only little critique is that the camel boys that they used that day (who took us to Sahara to stay overnight), seemed very unenthusiastic. Didn't even try to talk to our group and it felt like it was not about language barrier, more like motivation problem. Also other guests felt that way. But I guess it is not something this compay can affect too much to, as the group was collected from various hotels and the camel boys came from another service provider. When I told our guide Said about this, he took the feedback very well and understood the importance of it. So they might have even done something about it. Didn't really influence our overall feeling about this company. We highly recommend it to others too! Which I want to give extra good feedback about, is that I have about 20 food allergies for vegetables/fruits etc, and I am also vegetarian, and I still had no trouble with food on this trip. It was always possible to get (good) food to eat. Hassan (the manager of the company) replied always very quickly and helped us with all the questions we had beforehands. Also the price of this trip seemed very competitive after a little research. Thanks Said &co! It was a wonderful trip! Want to go back!"

He was cheerful and funny. Be sure to ask him for some Berber jokes! All of the stops along the way were beautiful and serene. Mohammed knew all the optimal photo opportunities and took great pics too! I loved Chez Pierre, as it's nestled in a canyon wall, very picturesque and the food/service was top notch! Mohammed took us to the Nomad Depot, which is very close to the start of the camel tour. I purchased two exquisite Berber rugs and had them shipped home, which was an extremely easy process and actually arrived just yesterday! The products there all have a story and you can learn about the tribes and people that create and produce the items. Worth going for the real deal stuff.The camel trek, what's not to love? The camels were sweet and an easy ride. Hassan and his team were helpful and a fun group of guys. They picked a great \"golden hour\" photo stop so we could take selfies and what not, obvi! Then we hopped back on the camels for a short trek to the camp, where we watched sunset from a dune. Now we can say, \"ya, I watched sunset and sunrise over the Sahara desert!\" The food at the camp was delicious and plentiful, as was water to quench the desert thirst. Camp even has a western toilet.I could go on forever, basically choose this tour and ask for Mohammed!"

It is like visiting a friend in Morocco who will show you all the best things Morocco has to offer, so you will not take the touristic tour like all those tour busses, but really get to experience the most beautiful places. Also, whenever we saw a beautiful view, Said did not hesitate to stop the car so we could take a picture. We were also glad that we did not spent a lot of days in the touristic city's as Marrakech and Fez, because there is really not so much to see as our guide already told us. The desert and the mountains on the other hand, are very quiet and beautiful places where you might want to add a day to relax.

We prefer to plan everything ourselves and avoid the big tour buses and tour guides yelling into megaphones. So of course we were skeptical of the idea of being trapped in a car by ourselves with a driver for a 3 day 2 night tour... But along came Mubarak, our driver and guide. He made believers out of us and took us on an adventure of a lifetime!Compared to other Sahara tour companies, we found that Sahara 4x4 had the best price for a private tour. Don't worry about the private tour part! Having the freedom to choose where you want to stop and take as many pictures as you want is wonderful. Mubarak spoke excellent English, respectful and attentive, entertained us with so many stories (we loved the one about how he met his wife!), and went above and beyond for us by helping me buy a SIM card recharge and helping my girlfriend buy some Moroccan stamps. Mubarak has been a driver/guide for over 6 years and speaks French, Spanish, Arabic, and Berber too!Best of all, Mubarak was an excellent picture taker. It is so rare to have a guide who knows how to perfectly frame a photo with both a DSLR and mobile phone, it makes it that much easier to treasure the best moments.If you are doing the 3 day 2 night tour, ask Hassan if you can spend the first night at Chez Pierre. Just read the other reviews, you won't regret it.Once you get to the Sahara and get ready for your camel ride, you will be joining some other people from other private tours. It's actually quite pleasant and picturesque to all come together and form a camel caravan to the desert camp. It was great to have a different group dynamic and to meet such nice travelers.On the way back (if you eat meat), ask if you can stop for a Berber barbecue lunch. It was the best meal we had in all of Morocco.Just make sure you ask for Mubarak!"

Hamid was polite, fun, and knew the route like the back of his hand. He made the drive so much fun by his interesting stories and by pointing out places of interest and the history behind them. His music playlist was the best - and he did an excellent job of stopping at places that we wanted to, and skipped the ones in which we were not interested. He also stopped and the best local restaurants for some delicious food. He understood that at times we just wanted to sit in silence, while at other times we wanted to chat and learn more about Morocco, about the people, the places and the culture. Hamid is also an excellent musician and singer, and on our first night at the hotel in the Dades valley, sang some traditional Berber songs with his fellow guides. It was just beautiful.

He was friendly and took the extra step to make sure we had the best time on our trip! The camel ride in the Sahara was fun but camping under the stars in the Sahara was the best part. I highly recommend Sahara Tours and especially Mohammed! He is the best and he was a pivotal part in making my trip amazing!"

Let me tell you, our tour guide, Mohammed, was one of the most personable and informative tour guides EVER. Mohammed picked us up directly from our riad in Marrakech in a spacious and clean SUV which fit five perfectly. We made several stops throughout our drive to the Merzouga Desert while Mohammed made sure to explain each stop annnnd ask us if we wanted a group picture (how nice!). Our first night, we stayed in a quaint B&B like hotel (almost in the middle of nowhere) with the most amazing views and service. The food at this B&B was ON POINT! The second day, we made it out to the Merzouga desert where we rode camels and spent the night in tents (in the middle of the desert!). It was a bit chilly at night but the weather was the least of our concerns as the sand dunes and views basically made up for everything and anything! I would 100% recommend booking this tour (ask for Mohammed!) for anyone looking for a nice 2-3 day excursion into the deserts of Morocco. Thank you so much for an amazing time!"

The first was that it already had stellar reviews. Secondly, Hassan, the owner, was very patient and helpful in allowing us to customize our itinerary so that we spent more time in the areas my family was interested in. And the tour itself was wonderful. Our driver/guide Mohammed was great. He was fluent in English and many other languages and was very experienced with all of the sites we visited. He was knowledgeable and would readily answer all of our questions, including those about his own life and customs. If he did not know an answer, he would work to find the answer. He was also a very safe driver. Additionally, the locations he (and the tour company) recommended were all either beautiful scenically, or informative. When researching companies I had read reviews of companies bringing groups to locations with high pressured sales pitches for items such as rugs. We only visited locations that provided information about local production, such as argon oil, but did not pressure us to purchase those items.We also felt that the level of accommodation was excellent, especially considering the cost of the tour (relative to some of the other companies researched)."

For our 3-day, 2-night desert tour, our driver was incredible: very friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful. We got to see a lot in a short amount of time, and were glad we got to see cities, the Atlas Mountains, and the Sahara desert on our trip to Morocco. It was an experience we couldn't have created on our own, and we're appreciative of the work of Sahara Tours 4x4 for making this experience affordable and possible. In addition to coordinating our desert tour, the company's owner also helped us think through other day trips we wanted to take and arranged transportation for that. They went above and beyond in calling hotels for us to confirm reservations, helping us think through what itinerary made sense, and making sure we got a ride to the airport for our departing flight. Overall, a great trip and a great company!"

After using many different drivers and tour guides throughout my travels, I have to say Yidir was the best. He was funny and engaging and totally got us thus making the several days we spent with him very fun and entertaining. We couldn't have asked for nor received someone better. The camel ride out to the desert was certainly a highlight. It was so much fun to ride the camels and then watch the sun set and rise over the Sahara. We were fed and entertained by a great group of guys. The following morning we rode the camels back to the hotel to shower and enjoy a buffet breakfast. I would highly recommend this tour. It was a once in a lifetime experience."

We did a private 4 day tour with our guide Mubarek and it was worth every single penny! His English is excellent and had a great sense of humor which made the 4 days fun and relaxing. I would suggest to book the 4 day tour as there is a lot to see and there is a lot of driving. Mubarek was very informative about all the places we went to and let us stop anywhere to take photos. He was always checking with us to see if we were ok and if we needed to stop anywhere. The riads and restaurants that he took us to were great especially Auberge Chez Pierre which was a riad built into the gorge. The views were spectactular! Our absolute favorite thought was our stay in Erg Chebbi which is the Sahara desert, it was something we will never forget. If you are looking to book a private tour, this is the company.

The trek through the desert is definitely something not to be missed and is something we will always remember. Overall great time. As others have mentioned there is a lot of driving involved and while Omar was great about stopping so we could walk around the nature of trying to pack in all of the stuff we wanted to see in three days means you need to spend a lot of time on the road.

We would definitely recommend this trip however for anyone wishing to venture into the Moroccan countryside and desert who can only fit in a 2 day 1 night trip.

We went out over the High Atlas Mountains, stopped at the famous Kasbah - Ksar A\u00eft Benhaddou , saw the Dades Valley and Gorge, stayed at Hotel Chez Pierre in the Dades (great food, really interesting and comfortable place), walked in the Toudra Gorge, did the short camel trek and camped in the beautiful dunes in the desert on the second night near Merzouga and Rissani. Mohammed was an expert and very safe driver, and a guide who went out of his way to make sure we were comfortable and to offer us what we wanted and most suited us. He got us into some authentic Moroccan food and market scenes as well as the important tourist sites. He was happy to stop whenever we needed a bathroom break or wanted a photo stop. There was lots of driving (the third day especially) and the Toyota Land Cruiser Prado was a very comfortable way to go. Mohammed made sure we were in the hands of our Riad hosts in Fes before saying goodbye. Hassan was very good to deal with by email, adjusting our tour plan as our travel plans evolved.

When booking, we didn\u2019t specify if we wanted a private tour or not, but ended up getting a private one .We were picked up at our riad in Marakkech by Mubarak, who was our driver and guide for the tour. He drove a very comfortable Toyota Landcruiser 4x4. Mubarak was very friendly, and we really enjoyed our three days with him. He was very knowledgable about Morcocco in general and the places we visited and drove by, and gave us lots of insight in Moroccan culture along the way. The tour was very well planned. Mubarak had planned lunch stops in great places that offered genuine Moroccan food, and that he knew were clean and used bottled water so we would avoid getting ill. He also provided us with plenty of opportunities for toilet breaks along the way, at places he knew specifically to be clean and with western-style toilets. We really appreciated all the effort Mubarak had put into planning all the details of the tour, it meant we could just sit back and enjoy it. Others have commented that the tour felt rushed, but we did not feel that it was. We even did the tour in December, meaning the sun sets early and rises late, so we had to get to the desert early and leave later in the morning compared to other times of the year. Being on a private tour gave us a lot of flexibility with regards to stopping along the way for photo opportunities etc. in the places we were most interested in.To sum things up the tour was fantastic, and without a doubt the best part of our trip to Morocco. I cannot recommend it enough if you want to see a lot of Morocco in a short time, and would highly recommend that you request Mubarak as your guide."

If you want a trip packed with adventure and adrenaline then this is it. Also very safe for families. Note for those interested:Journey can be tiring as there is a lot of distance to cover so get plenty of rest. Bring a USB or aux cable and some entertainment for the long drives. Lastly a big shout out to Muhammad who could not have done enough. Very understanding and always polite. A true gentleman.

I was traveling with my wife and three kids, ages 13, 11 and 9. If there's any downside to this trip it's simply the significant amount of time driving. However, we knew that's what we were getting ourselves into so that's not a knock on Sahara Tours 4x4. Unfortunately for us, there was excessive rain in the Marrakesh area which meant that the typical 4-hour route from Marrakesh to Ouarzazate was blocked due to mud slides and bridge damage. Because of this Hassan helped us arrange another night stay at a riad in Marrakesh and then since the route was still blocked the next day we ended up taking a much longer route (8 hours). But we made it to Ait Benhaddou and then the Sahara the following day - all I can say is that the ride into the desert on camels is an experience my kids and I will be talking about 30 years from now. There were NO complaints from my kids about having to spend so much time in the car - they all agreed the night in the desert was TOTALLY worth the effort of getting there. The rest of the trip was great as well. I would highly recommend picking dates (if possible) that allow you to see a 'market day' in Rissani. For us, it felt like a step back in time - my kids are still talking about seeing a real blacksmiths shop, the donkey 'parking lot', and all of the sights, sounds and smells of walking through this real, local market. Two more things - the riads we stayed at were all great and the beds we slept on in the middle of the desert were the best! I only wish we had more time to really enjoy them (next time we'll have to extend our trip). And as stated by other reviews - Said was an OUTSTANDING driver. He was very safe and went out of his way to make sure my kids were always comfortable. Thanks again Sahara Tours 4x4 - hope to see you in Merzouga again!"

From the second he picked us up at our Riad in Marrakesh, he was so accommodating, helpful and an encyclopedia of knowledge about the country. I definitely felt like I got a solid Moroccan history and culture lesson from him. My girlfriend and I are filmmakers and we wanted to avoid touristy hangouts and see some of the more remote untouched parts of the country. Mohammed told us from the beginning, \"This is your tour, if you want to stop somewhere, just let me know.\"We had an amazing time together, and became great friends with Mohammed over the 4-day journey. The first day, we hung out on the side of a mountain with a shepherd, petting and holding sheep and running around through the herds on the mountain side. We explored the wild bustling markets of Mohammed's home town, where he frequently goes to shop himself. We were even so kindly invited into his home for a classic Madfouna, a sort of Moroccan pizza dish, but way better than what you're thinking. And of course the camels, incredible, graceful, peaceful creatures - like no animal I've seen before. The Sahara desert is an ethereal other world that will take your mind so far away from home or anything you've ever experienced.In short, if you're thinking of going to Morocco, you need to take this journey. I would highly recommend SaharaTours4x4 and Mohammed. I plan to come back soon and will be requesting Mohammed as my guide on the next pan-Moroccan journey I want to experience."

My daughter and I booked a 1 day tour to Essaouira, our tour guide was Mohammed, he was very friendly, helpful and and knowledgeable guide. Next was a 3 day tour from Marrakech to Merzouga, Hassan was our guide to our amazing adventure to the desert! He was very responsive on email and with making arrangements.We felt comfortable, safe and very well guided throughout all three days.Hassan was warm, entertaining funny and very knowledgeable of his country and culture. The tour lead us trough several sities and to numerous view points where we stopped. We enjoyed the scenery on the way to the desert, the changing landscapes and especially the colours of the atlas mountains. It's fascinating. The selection of sites were just great! The Hotels chosen to our trip were exceptionally clean and beautiful, even the tent in the desert was like being in a hotel. Breakfasts & dinners included were absolutely delicious! Vehicle was a very comfortable Toyota Prado 4x4. Our camel guide into the desert was friendly and very nice. Our dromedaries \"Jimmy Hendricks\" and \"Bob Marley\" were waiting for us to take us to the Sahara! We loved the sunset and our wine for dinner (you have to request it at the Merzouga Hotel, before getting to the desert) and looking to a sky full of stars. Our trip to the desert was a fabulous and unforgettable expirience! On our way back to Marrakech we met Said, he made our way back enjoyable and comfortable. Thank you Hassan, Mohammed and Said for the chance to meet you and your country in that style. You are wonderful people!If you're going to Morocco, this is the trip you need to take. You won't regret it! I would definitely recommend Sahara tours 4x4 to anyone. Am glad we chose this private tour instead of the group type. Two happy venezuelans! Un tour \"Chever\u00edsimo\" !!Nelly M."

Everything from booking to being picked-up by our guide, Mohammed was seamless, great communication throughout. The trip itself was incredible - and such a great look into a wide variety of the country. The hotels we stayed in along the way were beautiful, 4-star, and had great food. Even the dinner in the desert camp was fantastic! But the best part was Mohammed, I'm terrified of winding mountain roads, but he was a great driver, extremely patient with all of our requests (we are filmmakers and wanted a lot of stops along the road to shoot, as well as to skip some of the more touristy sites) and even held a camera for us a few times! He also seemed to have an answer for every question we had (such as how much does a camel cost?) All-around amazing guy that I was happy to spend a solid 4 days with. Only notes - it's a lot of driving, even with 4 days and some of the areas are very difficult roads. If you're sensitive to cars, prepare yourself, or allot more time. But no one can be faulted for the distance. I'm already looking forward to returning to Morocco again and taking another tour with Mohammed!"

All look reliable but their answer in perfect Spanish (they do speak also English perfectly, and a bit of french and german) and their professional approach convinced me to join them. Once in Morocco, I had the pleasure to join Ibrah as my tour guide, and I loved it. He's a lovely guy with loads of energy and really friendly. On top of that, he is constantly asking if everything is perfect (if not they'll change anything you ask for) and if you want to do something different. In my case, I don't like very touristic restaurants so we had lunch one day in a village, purchasing food in a local shop, meeting the locals (really friendly by the way) and eating outside of the touristic route. I also met the rest of the Sahara crew and they are all great... Hassan (the owner) was really keen on teaching us local stuff and in a really friendly way. They also take you to the Draa valley the last day, trip not all the agencies do.At the beginning I though it was a bit expensive, as is not the cheapest option for a solo trip, but then I realised that it is worth every penny I spent... if I do it again, I definitively will do it with them."

Our guide Mohamet was excellent, very accommodating, always asking do we want to stop, do we want to take a little walk, do we need a little break, etc. We loved touring Ait Ben Haddou, the mountains and the gorges. Overall this trip provides a lot of dramatic contrasts, from snow covered mountains to barren deserts to green valleys, plus so many different cities, towns, and kasbahs. If you take a 4-day tour leaving Friday (highly recommended) you get to visit the Sunday market in Rissani which is a real country market, not a souk for tourists. How can you tell which donkeys are for sale and which are just \"parked\" while their owners are shopping? Ask Mohamet - he lives in Rissani and gave us a wonderful tour of the market and kasbah nearby. The desert tour was fun, there were about 12 people staying at the tent camp and we were a very sociable group ranging in age from about 20 to 83, from the US, UK, Australia, Italy, Germany, the Dominican Republic and Columbia! The guides prepared a wonderful meal and then played drums and sang around a fire pit. One very special thing about this tour is the riads and the places that Mohamet finds for lunch. Our first day at Ait Ben Haddou we ate at a place that had only been opened for a few months but served a meal that would rival any fine French restaurant, but with a Moroccan flair. The riad that evening was also new - brand new - had a great view, pretty courtyard, and wonderful food. It's nice to know that we are helping a new generation of entrepreneurs. Lunch on the last day - near Midelt - was the best grilled meat we have had in Morocco (and the least expensive!). Berber hospitality is truly exceptional! Be forewarned that there's a lot of driving, go for the four-day tour if you can because you get to spend some casual time visiting local places, not just tourist stops. Thank you Hassan, and many many thanks to Mohamet!"

The first night we stayed at a lovely riad and so enjoyed the gorgeous atmosphere and delicious dinner. The second night we stayed in the desert at a Berber camp set up for tourism. We had a fantastic experience. We rode camels to the site - they were quite comfortable- enjoyed the views of the vast Sahara. At the site we trekked up a huge dune/hill to watch spectacular sunset. We enjoyed a lovely social dinner of tajine with fellow travelers and sat by the campfire at night while the hosts played music. In the morning, we rose early to see the sunset and then our camels awaited us and we returned to our base, were given 2 hotel rooms to shower, and then set off with our guide to return to Marrakech. It was a lot of car riding 6 hours back to Marrakech, but manageable. Also, my son is very allergic to camels and Hassan managed to bring him to the tents in a vehicle, which was very nice for him to accommodate us!"

He was an excellent driver. Our first day was a bit of a rush to see the sights because we started a bit late at around 8:30am. It would have been better if we could have spent more time at each sight we visited. The dinner at Chez Pierre on our first night was great, remember to save room for this meal. Hotel room was fine and the next morning breakfast was the best we have had in our 15 days in Morocco. Everything was delicious. Very impressed and happy with that. Great service too. The highlight of our trip was definitely the camel rides. Absolutely amazing and such a wonderful experience to see the gorgeous sunset and sunrise in the Sahara desert. The vegetable tagine we had in the tent was also pretty good. What we didn't know was that we were eating with other people. Not that I minded but would have been good to know that in advance since the tour we booked for was called a private tour. Camel rides were also with other people which I enjoyed too. Had a lovely chat with them. The third day was relaxing. Mohammad took us to his hometown and we visited the Sunday Market which was very delightful to see. Great to have a local with us and it made us feel very relaxed for sure. The Berber pizza we had was delicious, Thanks, Mohammad and his mum. We saw quite a bit of Rissani and would love to go back and see more of this lovely town. We spent the late afternoon at the hotel relaxing by the pool, reading and listening to the birds. It was very peaceful. The dinner we had on our third night was quite good. Romantic ambiance and the guy who served us was super friendly and happy. We got to see a lot of different sights on our last day. We enjoyed everything we saw. Stopped at many places and took lots of photos. It was snowing in Ifrane. Beautiful and managed to feed the wild monkeys. Had lunch at a local grilled meat place which was interesting. No tourists there apart from us, of course. :) We arrived in Fes around 7pm. Loved the tour and would do it again. The 4x4 was very comfortable."

Process from the start was professional and easy. We had a party of three and a fifty euro deposit was required to reserve.On the day our guide Mohammad arrived right on time at 8am in Marrakech. Impressive given our Riads tricky location. The first day was great, we stopped wherever we wanted for photos. The views through the Atlas were amazing. Also haddou was great, the food stops were relevant and good. We ended the day at good accomodation. Power went out due to excess power usage with everyones air con being on. Couldnt moan though as it opened the night sky up where the stars were awesome.Second day started with breakfast and we left around 8.30ish. Had a good day seeing the local gorges and also the markets in Risani. Arrived at the dunes around 3. They very kindly gave us a room to have a shower before departing around 5 ( lower temperature). Glamping in the dunes was good with the sunset great.Overall the trip was good and I would recommend anyone to book them. Our driver Mohammad was awesome, he helped us at every stage. Lastly we paid Hassan the remaining balance upon leaving the hotel at the dunes. Trip back is long so be prepared for a long drive.."

            "review": "Fantastic 3 day / 2 night Sahara Desert Tour. We were overwhelmed by the number of tour companies offering similar 3 day / 2 night Sahara desert tours and finally ended up booking with Sahara Tours 4x4 and are very glad we did. We chose this company due to the prompt response and detailed replies from Hassan, favourable trip advisor reviews and median price. Our guide (Mohamed) spoke fluent english and french and was from Merzouga and extremely knowledgable about all the places on our journey. He also had a great sense of humour and made the long drive enjoyable for our 8 year old son. Our driver (Saiid) was also fluent in English and was a very capable driver on the extremely windy roads. Both were very patient with our frequent requests for photo stops and bathroom breaks and made the long drive as enjoyable as it could be in the clean and comfortable air conditioned 4x4. The first night we stayed at the H\u00f4tel Babylon Dades which was not one of the two hotels originally promised, but the accommodations were clean and comfortable and the food and service was great. The only surprise was when we got to the desert, we found out that neither our guide nor driver would be accompanying us to the desert camp, which we assumed would be the case. We were however, well looked after by our Berber desert guides and this ended up being the highlight of our tour.Warning: The roads through the atlas mountains and Dades gorge are extremely windy (I get car sick just looking at the photos) and the drive back to Marrakech is very long for both adults and kids (10 - 11 hours). The sites are worth the drive, so if you are prone to car sickness or traveling with kids, plan on extra time to make additional stops along the way, or better yet, spend an additional night along the way or return back through Fez.Also, bring warm clothes as we were unexpectedly snowed on overnight in Dades and it was colder than we expected at night in the desert."

            "review": "Fantastic Tour. We were a group of four travelling to Marrakech during the week of March 9th -17th, 2016. When we were planning our trip, we soon discovered that Morocco offers a huge variety of interesting places we wanted to see. After some thoughts and discussions about whether to take a few day trips from Marrakech or go on a longer tour, we decided to take a 4-day trip to the High Atlas Mountains and the desert. We discovered Sahara tours 4x4 on Trip Advisor, and decided to contact them after reading their reviews. Hassan was very helpful and answered all our questions regarding the tour promptly \u2013 how it was organized, what places we would see and what to pack, which was quite handy when visiting a new continent and environment that is totally different from what we are used (e.g. the camel ride and camping in the desert). Our driving guide, Said, picked us up at our Riad early morning as planned. We had a great time with Said during this 4-days trip. He was very nice and friendly and informed us about the colourful history of his country and the daily life of the Moroccans, while taking us from one interesting place to another. Said was also a careful driver, which is important on the windy roads of the High Atlas. He also made sure to stop frequently so that we could explore interesting sites by foot, and pointed out the best places to take pictures of the breath taking landscape.The trip was very well organized by Sahara Tours and every day was filled with new experience and different landscape and stories.The night we spent in the desert was unforgettable, with its dark night sky filled with stars and a beautiful moon. The barber tents were cosy with big comfortable beds, clean sheets and warm blankets. After sunset it got cold, but since we had our winter clothes, as recommended, we were comfortable outside, enjoying the bonfire and the magnificent sky. Dressed in wool for the night, we did not feel the cold inside the tents and had a good night sleep until it was time to watch the beautiful sunrise early next morning.Hotels, dinners and breakfast included in the trip was of good quality and all the people we met were friendly and helpful.This trip is quite intense, with an early start each morning, long drive and many places to see. Because of that we were able to explore, learn and enjoy much more than expected. We highly recommend this tour and the service of Sahara Tours 4x4."

We were greeted by a friendly driver cum guide, Omar, on the first day who patiently waited for us to finish our breakfast at the raid. Omar did beyond what was required, by making us comfortable throughout the entire trip. He drove safely and keenly explained the culture and landmarks of Morocco. When we were tired, at moments he cracked jokes to liven the mood and at other moments he remained silent to allow us to sleep and rest. When I was feeling unwell midway during the trip, he constantly made sure if I'm feeling better. Moreover, at the end of the trip at Marakesh, he brought us to the train station to buy train tickets and to a cyber cafe to print out our flight tickets despite it already being rather late at 9pm. All in all, we had an enjoyable time at the tour, especially with our friend Omar."

            "review": "One of the highlights of our 9 years traveling the world. The hardest part of traveling non-stop for many years is that it's a real challenge for us to be blown-away by experiences. We've seen so many incredible sights and met so many beautiful people around the world. My husband and I both wondered if our Morocco/desert tour be worth the time and money involved. Thankfully, it was more than amazing.When I booked the tour with Hassan, I was definitely impressed with his prompt replies. As a long-time entrepreneur and business coach, I notice these things closely. He provided me with answers to my questions and he was prompt in answering the emails.We decided to do the 5 day, 4 night trip and it was everything we hoped for and more. Mohammad picked us up at our riad in Marrakesh and was our guide for the tour. Siad was our driver. These two young Berber men were a wonderful example of hospitality, respect and sincerely cared that we were happy every step of the way. We loved that they didn't talk to us all the time but we had long periods of silence which allowed us to process everything we were seeing and just enjoy the scenery.I am also an avid photo taker and they caught on to my needs very quickly and were excellent at stopping whenever it was appropriate and safe. Siad was an incredible driver and we felt totally safe 100% of the time. That was a huge bonus in a country where driving habits are a bit on the wild side.Mohammad provided us with enough information to keep us interested but didn't bore us with tons of details unless we asked more questions. It was just what we wanted.The hotels exceeded our expectations. Having traveled mostly to developing countries, we have had our share of adventures in accommodations not being quite as advertised. We both felt that the hotels were great and the breakfasts and dinners were more than satisfactory and adequate for our needs. We usually ended up eating more than we originally planned - the food was so tasty.It is alot of time in the car so thankfully the vehicle was very comfortable and the scenery is so beautiful, the days passed by quickly. On the other hand, it seems almost impossible that we saw so much variety and so many things in such a short period of time.The time out at the desert was amazing and an absolute highlight of our trip. However, as we had the extra time, we were able to spend an additional day in the desert and we saw how the nomads live as we literally drove across the desert, meeting some of the nomads and having an experience we will never forget. It felt much more isolated than the desert camp we had spent the night at. A few things I would suggest. Take the longest tour you can afford financially and time-wise. You won't be disappointed. There's a lot to see and it is tiring so by spending an extra day, you will enjoy it even more. Secondly, when you go to Dadas Gorge, ask if you are staying at the hotel Chez Pierre. The food at this hotel is amazing but we had eaten a larger and later lunch the day we stayed there and we weren't able to fully enjoy it. The food is so good, you will want to arrive at the hotel very, very hungry. So check with your driver on the day you are heading to the Gorge.The desert is cold at night but they provide blankets that weigh about a hundred pounds! Seriously, your head may be cold so we were glad we had brought scarves because our bodies were toasty warm, but the head needed some protection and warmth. A knitted wool cap or something similar would also work well.My husband is 67 years old and he was worried about the camel ride. His legs don't do what most people's legs do - he could never sit cross-legged, even as a child. However, he was able to do the camel right in and out of the desert with no problems and actually enjoyed it! I was concerned that I would have a feeling of being out in the middle of nowhere which can be a bit freaky. But you are really not that far from the hotel, they have a quad out at the camp if there was an emergency or you needed something, so it isn't like you are dropped in the middle of the Sahara desert. There was a nice feeling of reassurance about that.Overall, it was definitely one of the highlights of our many years of traveling the world and we are really glad that we found Hassan and his great team through Trip Advisor. When I saw all the fabulous reviews about them, I felt confident that they would be great and they were. As we are now wrapping up our time in Morocco, we are so thrilled with every place we have been, the people and the country. The entire experience here has been far beyond what we expected and we are so glad that we didn't listen to the naysayers about traveling to Morocco. We have absolutely loved it and this tour was a big part of us having fallen in love with the country."

I also got to try shisha. Mohammed also has a keen eye for good shots and always pointed them out. It felt you had a good friend showing you around Morocco rather than someone who just goes through the motions. Rather than a tour we got an experience to remember. Great company."

Just yesterday, my husband and I were driving back home in rainy and cold Seattle and we were instantly transported to warm Zagora while discussing about our trip. We have booked tours with guides and drivers during some of our past trips all over the world but nothing has ever come close to the quality that Sahara Tours 4x4 provides. This might be a long review, so please bear with me. Zagora was a last minute plan for us as we were thinking about other options. So my husband sent an email to Hassan just one day before the trip. Hassan responded immediately with the important details and quotes. While discussing our plans with the hotel manager, we mentioned about our plan for Zagora. She told us that the price was fair and that it was a good deal. Our guide for the trip was Said and Yousef was our driver. They made our trip amazing. They were super friendly, knowledgeable, trustworthy, punctual, super cool, accommodating, chivalrous and went above and beyond every single time to make sure we were comfortable and were having an amazing time. The guide/driver is what I believe makes or breaks the trip. When you are in the car for 8+ hours, spending it with the right kind of people becomes really important. I suffer from motion sickness and I started feeling sick even before we started driving up the Atlas mountains. Said and Yousef assured me that I could ask them to stop the car any number of times and at any place. In fact Said even gave me a couple of tips to avoid the sickness and it worked like a charm! The 4 X 4 was really comfortable and spacious. Said shared information with my husband and I about the Berber community and tirelessly answered all our questions. We also connected over our love for Bollywood songs! Our first stop was at the Kasbah and Said told us about the history and patiently took our photos at all scenic spots. He never tried to push us to buy anything and even made sure we avoided the usual tourist traps. After lunch, we headed back on the road and Yousef drove smoothly to ensure I was not feeling sick. Said also recommended us to buy tasty dates on our way. I was a bit scared of the camel ride so made sure to ask Said on how to climb camel like a pro. Thanks to him, the camel ride was awesome and way too much fun! Since Zagora is the start of the desert, the sand dunes are not big but they are still good. We reached the camp and were greeted by the berbers. Hot tea, peanuts and Moroccan cookies under the starry desert sky! The tents were huge and had comfortable beds with warm blankets. They provided us with towels, soaps and shampoo. The bathrooms were clean and functional and the shower had hot water...I mean its the desert, what more can you ask! We freshened up and went for dinner. Dinner was a delicious tagine with tea and dessert. We all gathered around the campfire and had a wonderful time listening to traditional Berber songs accompanied by the drums. Oh what an experience! The next day we ate breakfast and we headed back on our camels to get to the cars in Zagora. The Berbers even helped us in tying our cheches. We drove to Ouarzazate for lunch. We skipped the Film Studios and Kasbah and headed straight to the Argan oil cooperative. We were short on cash and Said and Yousef graciously offered to lend us some cash to buy the oil. Said is the best tour guide we have ever had and Yousef is an excellent driver. I can't wait to come back to Morocco and take the trip to Merzouga! Everyone at Sahara Tours 4X4 is doing an awesome job, keep it up guys!"

Mohammed was kind enough to share his insights on this culture, his country, and the Moroccan way of life. On the first day we went through the Atlas Mountains and he made sure to stop every time he thought we should take pictures of the view. He was kind enough to even take us to his home and introduced us to his wonderful family. By going on this trip we got to see how Moroccan people actually live, including the villages, and tribes instead of sticking to the tourist areas in Marrakech. On the last night we slept in the middle of the Sahara desert, and it was one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen. I definitely recommend this trip and Mohammed as your tour guide.

Mohammed was our guide and he went above and beyond many times over during our 4 days with him. He understood what we needed from our trip, even though it probably was slightly different to what the company would cater for. He was excellent at suggesting locations for us to use for our shots, driving anywhere we wanted and stopping and waiting for us to shoot whenever we needed to. He even became my honorary assistant a few times! The tour itself started from Marrakech, driving though the Atlas Mountains which were incredible. Mohammed took us to a small village where we were introduced to a workshop where women produce Argon Oil. We were given a tour and ate in the accompanying restaurant. From here we continued onto Ouarzazate where we stayed in the nicest Riad for the evening. The next day we continued on, arriving at the Dades valley and enjoyed a walk though a gorge and viewed an amazing forest of palm trees. From here we drove onto Merzouga where we left the car and continued our journey on camelback into the Sahara desert which is an experience I will always remember. The sand dunes of the desert are rich in colour and like nothing I have ever seen. We watched the sunset from the dunes then got back on the camels to our campsite where we stayed for the evening in comfortable double beds. The food we were served in the middle of the Sahara desert was fantastic Moroccan food. I was incredibly impressed. The next morning we woke to see the sunrise over the dunes which is an absolute must. From here we began to make out way back to Ouarzazate traveling through the amazing Moroccan landscape stopping often to take in the fantastic views (and to take our photos) We went though Ait Saoun which Mohammed called Morocco's Grand Canyon which was spectacular. We arrived back to Ouarzazate to stay again in the riad. The next day we traveled back to Marrakech though the Atlas mountains again and completed our trip. Its impossible to write in a review all that we managed to see in just a few days and that was thanks to Mohammed and even though we were working, I think I can say for us all that we got to enjoy Morocco and all it has to offer. I am really excited to go back to Morocco as a tourist and take another trip with this company!"

This was a really amazing experience and I can't speak highly enough of Mohamed and the experience we had. As a westerner it's a bit of a scary idea to think that you're going to pay a total stranger to pick you up somewhere in Morocco and take you through a multi-day road trip through the country, but the trip was so marvelously planned that I would encourage you to do it if you are there.Mohamed picked us up directly from our Riad in Marrakech and we drove through the Atlas mountains. On the way we stopped at an argan nut collective where rural Moroccan women worked to produce Argan oils and products. We stopped at Ait Benhaddou Kasbah as well. We spent the night in a hotel in the Dades Valley which Mohamed had fully arranged for us. The next day he took us to Ouarzazete where we smoked sheesha with him and then visited his family's home to share what he called Berber Pizza, our maffoud rissani. I mentioned that I liked to cook and he took me to a local shop that sold authentic Moroccan tagines, spices, and many more. He also took us to another shop to prepare for our camel trek into the Erg Chebbi desert. Both of these shops were authentic, not touristy, and very inexpensive by western standards.Our tour into the desert was incredible. Nomads took us into the desert on camel, and we arrived at a camp site that was bordering on hotel room. Huge canvas tents furnished with carpets, queen size beds, and lights. We ate wonderful tagine meals under the stars with other travelers, and when we asked for wine/beer, the folks organizing the desert trek radio'd back to have someone on an ATV come out to serve us. They entertained us with traditional Moroccan music in the desert and even brought a snowboard (!!) to ride down the sand dunes.The next day we rode camels back to town, where Mohamed met up with us yet again and took us to our final destination of Fes. On the way we saw many more sights in Morocco including a park that had wild (but tame) monkeys. Ever fed a baby monkey a tiny banana?The whole experience was incredible and we really owe it to Mohamed for making it such a good trip. The Tripadvisor reviews we saw seemed too goo to be true - hundreds of all 5 star reviews? But it's legit, for anyone visiting Morocco I would HIGHLY reccomend Sahara 4x4. If you don't have a \"Muslim face\", getting around Morocco can be difficult, but this tour made it easy to see an incredible amount of countryside."

Mubarak was our driver and he took great care of us. He didn't push us to buy things or force us to make stops at random stalls, but he has preferred places for the various things you may want to buy (spices, textiles, argan oil, etc.) and can advise on pricing. Mubarak was incredible.Because this is a shorter tour, there are long stretches of driving with short restroom or coffee breaks. You pass by some beautiful sites and this gives you a chance to see outside of Marrakech. We stayed at a camp in the desert that was a notch below \"glamping\". It had beds, running water and was quite clean. Everything is set up for you. Bring some snacks, tissue packs, cash for tipping and meals and most importantly, your camera. I would highly recommend Sahara Tours for whatever excursion. Pricing was fair, Hassan's organization and response time were perfect despite having only communicated over email.

Hassan was amazing in answering all of my emails and super professional. Our tour guide, Youssef, made the trip even better by being knowledgeable, spoke great English, didn't take us to any tourist traps where people were going to try to bother us into buying stuff, and knew all the best spots for pictures which he helped take for my husband and I. Definitely go to the Merzouga desert over the Zagora desert, if you can, it is an extra day to get there but it is worth it! The sand dunes in zagora are definitely not as breathtaking as the Merzouga desert. I'm not a super outdoorsy kinda girl but it was amazing and you still get a bed and running water in the middle of the desert! The lunch spots along the way were cheap prices and good food. Everyone we met was incredibly nice and friendly, including the berbers we hung out with at the camp. It's definitely the most memorable thing we did in Morocco. For two people, including breakfast and dinner, tour guide, a very nice 4x4 private car, camel ride, all sleeping accommodations, price was 650 euros. Probably more expensive than what you would pay if you did a tour bus, but we got to go places with the 4x4 car that the tour bus couldn't go, the service was AMAZING, and the privacy of being in your own car when you have to make such a long trip is worth it. The drive back to Marrakech on the 3rd day is pretty long and tiring but again, it is worth it to do something off the beaten path that will stay with you forever and the mountains and sites you see along the way are also absolutely beautiful. I just took naps in between the site seeing, it was perfect."

The trip was superb- a very long day, but well worth it. Mustapha was a calm, courteous driver, so the drive was excellent, and he was very knowledgeable, but never boring. The 'comfort stops ' chosen were pleasant and clean, and included was a lovely, typically Moroccan lunch. The journey itself is as interesting as the destination. The Kasbah in Ouarzazate is really spectacular, but not all parts are accessible as it is being restored by Unesco. Excellent value, and a really memorable day."

            "review": "Very nice 2-day/1 night tour!. We booked the 2-day tour to Zagora desert, with 1 night in the berber camp. We had a very good time. Our guide Said was nice, helpful, and a good driver on the winding, narrow mountain roads. The berber camp was amazing, with good food and excellent easygoing atmosphere.The only setbacks were: 1- This is a lot of driving. We basically spent the 2 days on the road. Of course, this is necessary to see a bit of country. We generally like to be more active, that is just personal preference. If you don't mind sitting all day in a very comfy car, there's nothing to worry about!2- The lunch on the first day was ridiculously expensive (65 dirhams for a tajine when you get one for 30 in Marrakech).3- The camel ride was somewhat frightening. We were left with the camel guide (our tour guide left with the car to meet us at the camp) who spoke neither french nor english, which was OK I guess... But after 5 minutes on the way, he doubled back, brought us to another path, called someone and then stopped. Then we were joined by a 8-10 year-old boy, our guide left us with the boy, who took control of the camels. All this without any explanation... It seems a bit silly now, but on the spot, it was a bit unsettling. Of course everything went fine, the boy even noticed I was scared when we went down dunes (my friend's camel almost fell at some point) so he brought us through the most flat road possible. We arrived at camp just before dark, and enjoyed the sunset during the ride. ------------------We were warned that the sand dunes were not the big ones we see on TV, but they were nice anyway and still felt like a nice desert experience. The berbers were very friendly and welcoming and we had a good time with them and the other tourists.All in all, I do absolutely recommend!"

Myself and my mother just finished the two day Zagora tour with our wonderful guide Mubarak and it was just perfect for our needs and time frame. Correspondence over email was stress and hassle free through hassan and he was good enough to make a last minute change to our plan the day before. Our guide Mubarak arrived the morning of the tour exactly on time and straight away was warm and friendly with absolutely brilliant English! The 4x4 car was very spacious, comfortable and clean and Mubarak was a very good and safe driver the whole way. We stopped where we wanted on our way and he was always patient and ready to answer any questions we had. He even helped us pick out some good dates in a local market and we also got spices and visited a women's Argan oil co-operative. At no time did we feel we had to buy anything or feel rushed. The night in the desert was perfect and watching the sunset and sunrise was wonderful. 2 days was perfect for us but next time I'll make it a 3 or 4 day so we can experience even more! Mubarak you are the best tour guide we've ever had! Thank you so much for sharing your knowledge and love of Morocco with us. Susie and Sally :)"

Youssef, our driver, was professional, an excellent driver and guide, and incredibly nice. We saw so many amazing sights along the way, and the camel ride and tents in the desert are fabulous. The tents have a bed, and there is a bathroom, so it's way more comfortable than one might expect. We loved every minute of it. If I had to do it again, I'd do the 4 day tour, because the Sahara is so amazing, and it would be nice to have more of a break from the car rides. This tour, in any case, was one of the highlights in fabulous Morocco."

            "review": "Great Experience! Three days: Marrakech to Fes. My girlfriend Natalie and I booked a three day, two night tour from Marrakech to Fes in mid December. During the booking process, Hassan was extremely responsive and helpful with answering our questions, which is one of the reasons we chose his company rather than the others we were considering. On the morning of our first day, Mohammed, our driver, came exactly on time and we started the adventure. Mohammed was very welcoming from the beginning, and we enjoyed sharing bits about our own culture while learning about Morocco, his background, and his family. Mohammed always encouraged us to ask questions, tell us what our interests were, and let him know if we wanted to pause along the way to take any pictures outside of our designated stops. Throughout the duration of the trip we asked dozens of questions - everything that came to mind, whether trivial or large, and Mohammed was able to answer all of them. It was generally more common for us to ask questions than for him to share openly along our journey.It was clear that Mohammed felt personally responsible for us and constantly looked out to ensure our safety. At one point, Natalie and I walked farther into the Todra Gorge than I think Mohammed expected, and when he couldn\u2019t find us for five minutes (even after asking multiple guides and shop owners in the area) he was genuinely worried. Mohammed was also an incredibly good driver, expertly navigating the busy streets of Marrakech and Fes and only passing on the two lane rural highways when absolutely safe. We appreciated his invitation into his family home, where we enjoyed eating the Moroccan pizza his friends cooked before heading into the desert. The camel trip into the desert was a unique experience and climbing the sand dunes for sunset and sunrise is certainly worth it! We knew when booking that the three day tour encompasses a lot of driving (the third day in particular), so if we had the time on our vacation through Morocco we would have done a four day tour. However, the days never seemed rushed, and we were able to experience great sites and better understand the culture and history of Morocco thanks to Mohammed and Hassan's planning. We would certainly recommend SaharaTours4x4 to other travelers!"

We travelled as a family (with our 10 year old son), plus our very good driver Ibrahim, and our great tour guide Ali :) They showed us all the important sceneries and Ali was very knowledgable in explaining the history of each of the places we went to and we were given a lot of time to stop and take photos if we wanted. The hotels that they picked on the nights we spent on the way to Merzouga and back were very good as well. Both had clean and comfortable rooms, and served us great food, especially the last night on the way back to Marakech. We also stopped and had lunch at Rissani, we tried the \"Rissani pizza\" and it was fabulous! Then we visited the local markets, and had a quick look at the goats, sheep, cows and even to a place where the farmers \"park\" their donkeys while they are in town! There we also bought some djellabas with the help of Ali. In Merzouga, we met our camels. The 30-minute camel ride to and from our camp in the desert was fantastic. My son squealed with delight and had a blast rolling in the sand dunes, climbing up the hills until it got too dark to do anything but wait for our dinner and watch the stars near our campfire. We have travelled over 2 days each way and 4 continents to reach Morroco, and truly being in the desert in the middle of nowhere was the highlight of our trip. Thank you Hassan for organising this trip for us, and thank you Ibrahim and Ali for your company. We will never forget this wonderful experience!"

The level of communication from start to finish is exemplary. Hassan, along with his brother Said and dedicated Berber guides emanate nothing but pride and knowledge about their Country and Culture. We spent a wonderful 6 days with Sahara Tours 4x4. Our first day Rashid took us to Ouzard Waterfalls. My husband was sceptical about the wild Monkey\u2019s, resident primate meeting tourist primate is not normally a good combination. To our surprise, the Monkey\u2019s actually equalled the breath taking scenery, gently taking nuts from your hand along with an amazing display of polite manners. Rashid was a great guide, keen to tell us about his Village, people and obvious love for his culture.The second day we commenced our 5 day tour with Said.I am a keen photographer, as you can imagine Said was being repeatedly asked to stop at what I can only describe as mind blowing scenery, the interaction of dwellings, their colour integrated into the landscape, stunning! The highlight of the trip was Said\u2019s & Hassan\u2019s home turf, The Sahara, Villages and Nomad families. Said became even more animated and beaming when we reached his home town. We brought an extra suitcase full of children\u2019s clothes and shoes. If you can, please bring something for the Berber\u2019s, unlike our Western culture, nothing is wasted here and families will greatly benefit from such a gesture. Our trip into the Sahara was just amazing. My husband chose the traditional form of transport, Camel. I suffer from a chronic lower back problem taking a modern mode of transport to the Desert camp, Quad bike. Hassan, my Quad driver noticed that I am photographer \u2013 to my utter delight, he took me to camp, we dropped off bags in tent (Tent had electric light and King Size bed!!). Then we went over the sand Dunes where he stopped when I wanted to take a photograph. The light was just right casting shadows giving me the photos you see in books. If you are a keen photographer, the ones that travelled by Camel, did not get to see the Virgin sand dunes or, obtain anything near the images that I did. My husband had a wonderful experience with his Camel ride \u2013 as a photographer, I picked the best mode of transport for images (tip your driver well!!)All the hotel accommodation, food was 100% satisfaction. The food, OMG, the Moroccan Cuisine. Said took us shopping in Rissani market for Spices, Morocco is a delightful, pure onslaught for the senses.I could write loads, I think you get the gist that we had an amazing time.Thank you Hassan, Said and Rashid \u2013 I\u2019ve already emailed you about a trip I\u2019m planning for later this year!"

The introduction to the history of Morocco through the stops and conversation gave a true picture of the country. The recommended hotels were excellent and the lunch stops introduced us to local places and the best food during our stay in Morocco. The Sahara was the highlight for our two teenage sons (18,16) who really enjoyed driving buggies in the desert along with a camel ride to experience the sunset over the Sahara. They even considered this worthy of publishing on their Instagram accounts. Thanks for the a great trip. Highly recommended."

He knew a lot about the country and was able to communicate in English and French. He even took us to lunch in his own town close to the desert, and we got to experience the real Moroccan way of life!The drive was absolutely beautiful. The landscape changed from the busy streets of Marrakech into the beautiful mountains into the desert and it was an superb way to see a lot of the country within a short day. We spent a lot of time in the car, but it was definitely worth it since there are many great stops on the way and because you get to see so much of the country. In the desert, we rode camels to our tents. While we only got a glimpse of the enormous desert, it was a fantastic experience and we would recommend it to anyone. A must do while in Morocco!

Mohammed also played some music for us, and encouraged my boyfriend to join in. It was so much fun!The second day we made it to the Merzouga Dunes. This was the HIGHLIGHT of the trip. Mohammed took us to a hotel where we could store our luggage before sending us off to ride camels into the dunes and stay in a Berber tent. The whole experience was lovely and the dunes were beautiful. In the morning, we saw the sunrise and then went back to the hotel for breakfast and a shower. The third day, Mohammed gave us a tour of his hometown, Rissani. This was truly INCREDIBLE. We have traveled a fair amount and have never experienced such an authentic cultural experience. We visited the local markets. These markets where not the kind that sell trinkets to tourists. This was a place that sold fresh fruits and vegetables, along with spices. They even had a donkey and goat market. Without Mohammed, we never would have had the opportunity to visit a place like this. The last day is alot of driving...mostly a full day of driving but there were a couple good viewpoints.  I would definitely recommend Sahara Tours 4x4!!! Thank you Mohammed!

I am a 30 year old American female who travelled alone to Morocco for the first time and booked with SaharaTours 4x4 based on the rave reviews on TripAdvisor, and they did not disappoint!I was nervous as a western woman traveling alone to Morocco but was in great hands with this tour. Said was my driver and guide and took me on a 4 day, 3 night trip from Marrakesh to Ouarzazate to Merzouga to Dades Gorges back to Marrakesh with several stops in between. I had several questions before I booked and Hasaan replied promptly and thoroughly to put me at ease and bolster my decision to book the tour. After I booked, Hasaan was very helpful in providing guidance for which lodging to select for my night before the tour and providing information on public transit (the train) I opted to take from Casablanca to Marrakesh as it was easier to fly into Casablanca from the states. Said picked me up on time on the first day of my tour and the next 4 days were absolutely incredible. I didn't have to worry about a single thing. Everything was arranged and organized for me from there on out and I was just along for the incredible ride! Said's English was excellent and he provided thorough information on all of the sites we saw in addition to answering the million questions I had about Moroccan culture & life in the Berber territories. He also was very kind to offer to take so many photos and videos of me, as I was traveling alone. They're a LOT better than the \"selfies\" :)Riding through the Sahara on camel and the night camping in the desert was the highlight of the trip for me. You can barely call it camping! I was very surprised to see I had my own tent...with a door, 2 beds, a bedside table, a chandelier, a light switch & very comfortable beds with a floor mat even. There was also a working toilet and sink! In the middle of the desert!! I believe this should be called \"glamping\" it was so nice. Breakfasts & dinners included were absolutely delicious! The meal we had in the desert was equal or better to the ones we had in the hotel restaurants! The hotels selected were very nice, clean, quiet and comfortable after long days of travel.If you're going to Morocco, this is the trip you need to take. You won't regret it! I'm going to post several photos as well so people can see ...I took about 1000! If you have any questions, I'd be happy to answer. This was the trip of a lifetime!"

We were picked up promptly at 8am at our riad by our driver and guide Youssef. Youssef was an excellent driver and great guide for our 3 days. Our hotel included in the trip the first night in the Dades Valley was Chez Pierre and was excellent (both accommodations and food). The scenery throughout the trip was spectacular, and our camel ride and overnight in the Sahara was as good as everyone else says. I would not hesitate to use Sahara Tours again on our next visit to Morocco."

This tour was the best way to explore Moroccos beauty, its friendly people, its fantastic hospitality and another world than you might have guessed. We felt convenient, comfortable, safe and very well guided throughout all four days and stops of the trip. Mohammed our guide was warm, patient and contributing to the overall atmosphere with his positive energy. All riads were exceptionally clean and beautiful, even the tent in the desert was like a 4*hotel:) Nothing left to say than: Thank you Mohammed and Hassan for the chance to meet you and your country in that style. I already recommended you to a friend who immediately started to consider the same trip! Still happy regards from icy Berlin!"

We were 4 people and went on the 4 day trip from Marrakech to the desert and back and experienced a great tour from start to finish.Responsiveness by the operator was quick, uncomplicated and friendly from the first mail on. Our guide Mohamed picked us up at our Riad on time and was with us the whole 4 days. He was always there when needed but also gave us enough privacy. During the tour we have been in the car a lot (~5-6h a day) which can be a little exhausting with 5 people but the good thing was that Mohamed always drove very carefully and stuck by the rules so that we always had a good feeling even if there was a lot of traffic or when we passed smaller roads in the mountains.The tour lead us trough several cities and to numerous view points where we always stopped for a few minutes if we wished for. Additionally, we visited some shops which the tour operator seemingly always visisted. However we did not have the feeling to get pushed into them. If we did not want to buy anything we continued quickly, if we were interested in something, we took the time - very easy-going.Highlight of the trip for us was the day & night in the desert. Truely an unforgetable experience. In addition to that we were very impressed by the choice of accomodations and food that the operator had organised for us for the tour. Everything (incl. the camp in the desert) was clean and tasteful and ranged from very good to great! If you want to do the tour we will you have to take into consideration a quite long time in the vehicle. So check beforehand the hours that you will spend in the car and check what vehicles you drive in. For us (2 men, 2 women) the SUV was fine but more than 4 days would have been a little bit to much. For 4 men the SUV would have been a little small. Also you should make sure to always communicate with the guide what you want in order to get the most out of your trip. We felt that was also one of the strengths of the tour operator as our guide Mohamed was very responsive and really did everything to make us feel comfortable in every situation (while driving, in the accomodations, on the markets). No matter what happened, he always was in good mood and tried to help as quick and as uncomplicated as possible. That really was perfect.So thanks Sahara Tours for the great organization, the perfect work and 4 great days in Marocco. We will highly recommend you guys."

Hamid was very accomodating and made sure we are comfortable on the trip; asking us if we need to stop for a tea/toilet break or if we are hungry. We were thankful that there were no touristic stops for purchasing of items. The highlight of the trip would be the desert. The accomodating is surprisingly comfortable and came equipped with flush toilets! The dinner by tent is most delicious, followed by a night of drumming, singing and star gazing... I would definately recommend saharatours4x4 to anyone. Am glad we chose this private tour instead of the group type.. In fact, we were so happy with the trip that we signed up for a day trip to essaouira. Our guide was Ahmed this time. And we enjoyed our time/conversations with him tremendously as well.

Hassan was diligent throughout our trip and during the actual trip never left anything to chance. Even with our camel ride and desert camp, he made sure everything was right with us on the camels, that we were comfortable and confident with our Berber camel man, before waiving us off. Nothing was a problem for him.The three of us travelled with Hassan in a 4x4 which had on-board internet access.The only hiccup was the first night accommodation where 3 of us were booked into one room (husband and wife and a father of one - just not appropriate). This was half our fault for not making it clear and half Hassan's fault for not asking. We assumed that we would have two rooms. Hassan did try to rectify but could only offer us a larger room. So make sure you communicate well all your requests.Accommodation itself was reasonable for what we paid, 2 1/2 star. The whole trip was very well priced and Hassan's suggested stops for lunches were all great and very well priced.We all agreed that this was one of the best, well run, and affordable trips for what you got, we have done anywhere in the world."

When you do a tour booking over mail, thousand kilometre apart, and that too at a place you never visited before, there is scepticism and trepidation. Nothing of that happened with this tour - the booking from India and the advance payment went off smoothly and our cabbie -a Berber called Mohammed - was there to pick us up dot on time.It was a tour where everything went off perfectly. Mohammed was extremely knowledgeable about the good restaurants where we ate lovely local cuisine. He was knew local history and the right places to buy stuff from (read: scarves for the ladies).The arrangement at the Berber tent was excellent too - superbly cooked food, nice beds and warm running water. The food at dinner was one of the best we had in our entire Morocco trip. The camel ride to and from the tent can be a little difficult for the uninitiated, but an experience nonetheless.The actual tour - we took the two-day small desert tour -- was also well planned, interspersed with mountains and drylands and finally, a nocturnal stay at the tents at the gateway to the desert was truly an unique experience. My wife had done it at Jaisalmer, at Thar desert in India, but it was a first for me and my daughter. I must mention that Mohammed helped me to find a bank to convert euros into Moroccan dirham - went out of his way actually. A lovely trip accentuated by reliable guide and driver. "

Our driver, Mohammed, treated us like family. In fact, he actually took us to his home in Rissani for the most delicious couscous prepared by his mother! This was such a special experience, and one that we will never forget. Mohammed was an excellent driver, guide, photographer and dj. I'm a vegetarian and he made sure every place was aware in advance and had some delicious alternative waiting for me. The camel trek was so special, the animals were well cared for and the Berber camp was spotless. We did a lot of reading and we're so glad we picked this company. Everyone on the staff is friendly and wants to make sure you have the best trip possible. Thank you, Mohammed!!!"

Prior to heading to Morocco we spent a lot of time researching into all the various tour companies and eventually chose this company based on the TA reviews to do a 3 day 2 night tour from Marrakech to Merzouga and back to Marrakech. Having just completed the tour I can say we were both 100% satisfied with our choice. Hassan and his team are fantastic guides, speak great English, drive new cars (2 years old or less) with air conditioning, are safe drivers and totally accommodating with any request you may have. As part of the tour we stayed in great accommodation and ate very good Moroccan food (both at the hotels and the stops for lunch on the way at good quality and hygienic restaurants). Trip was everything we could have wanted and just wanted to say thanks again to Hassan for the wonderful experience."

I looked through TripAdvisor and chose this group, SaharaTours4x4. Good call, TripAdvisor, good call. We went on the 3-day/2-night Marrakech-Merzouga tour.I coordinated everything through email and Hassan was always quick to reply. Once we reached our tour day, our guide\u2014Hamid\u2014was at our hotel promptly and ready to go. He even had a cooler of drinks in the back of the Toyota SUV, a nice touch. His English wasn't perfect, but it was perfectly acceptable and wasn't an issue throughout the tour. He was friendly and took the time to explain what we were seeing and the story behind it. My group was three guys and sometimes dudes can just sit in a car in silence watching the scenery go by\u2014not because we're upset or anything, there's just nothing to say. Hamid got this and didn't try to fill the gaps with idle chit chat or anything. He alerted us to potential photo-ops and stopped when we wanted to, kept on when we decided we'd rather keep driving. He's got an infectious enthusiasm about Morocco and that includes his hometown, Merzouga, as part of this tour. He probably got a good laugh at seeing us sweating it out in the foreign heat, but he was a good sport for sure and kept the Toyota at a nice comfortable temperature, even if he wouldn't have minded it a bit warmer for his desert sensibilities. Hamid took us around a Merzouga a bit and that gave us a sense of \"real Morocco\", outside the tourist track. I was definitely glad to have him lead the way. This was a great tour and I'd easily take it again."

            "review": "Great time!. Last March we had a 3 days-2 nights tour from Fes to Marrakech visiting the desert, and it was the best choice to travel through Morocco. Our driver was Mohammed, who picked us up at our riad in Fes and drove us through Middle Atlas. How nice was to see the snow at Ifrane, the Switzerland of the desert,we did not expected it! In those days it was very cold and the main road was closed because of the snow. Thanks to our 4x4 we were the only ones allowed to drive through that road, while the other drivers with their clients had to wait for hours or choose longer ways to cross the Atlas. At the end of the same day, we reached Merzouga, from the snow to the desert in a few hours! We left our luggage in an hotel at the beginning of the desert, and we had a camel ride at the sunset at El Chabbi desert. Great experience. Then we had time to enjoy a starry sky by our own, and had dinner in a Berber tent, followed by our Berber hosts playing music and singing typical Berber songs. We spent the night in a tent, and in the morning after we had another camel ride, this time at the sunrise, which was lovely as well. Then we went back to the hotel, where we had the chance to take a shower and then we had a very good breakfast with a great choice of food. Then we went to the Todra Gorges and the Dades valley, where we stopped at the very very good hotel \"Chez Pierre\". At the restaurant of the hotel we had the best dinner of our whole trip to Morocco. Breakfast was delicious as well. On our third and last day we went to the Rose Valley and to Ourzazate and saw the kasbah of Taourit. The great highlight was the visit of the Unesco site Ait Ben Haddou, which is overwhelming. In my opinion it is worth the whole tour together with the desert. Eventually Mohammed drove us to Marrakech in the afternoon. We had a great time, and we learned a lot about the culture of the Berber people. I recommend Sahara 4x4 tours, our tour was good and we paid the right price. In the car we had AC and wi-fi, but just at the beginning, because soon the available megabytes expired. Advice: we stopped at an Argan factory to see how it is produced, and we bought some items. Later in Marrakech we saw the same products which costed pretty much less! I suggest either to skip this stop, or not to buy anything."

The resident chef there prepared an amazing French-Moroccan dinner and breakfast. The camel trek and sleeping underneath the stars in the Sahara desert was unforgettable as well.It's a family run business (Hassan and two others) and you definitely feel the personalized attention.

The tour itself was very enjoyable and we enjoyed the stops on the way to the desert. A few practical tips: The stops for lunch are always at \"tourist\" restaurants and cost about 100 dirhams per person. Also, they follow a very \"Spanish\" eating clock. As Americans, we were very hungry when we ate at 8:30 the first night and 9:30 in the desert, so be sure to pack snacks if you are use to eating early. The desert trek is amazing. An hour on a camel, hanging out on the dunes, and sleeping on a mattress under the stars. The tangine we had in the desert was the best we had in Morocco."

Hassan was our guide and he was fantastic for the whole 3 days. He spoke fluent English as well as a number of other languages! We could stop and take photos wherever we wanted. The Atlas Mountains were stunning with amazing views and particularly enjoyed the Todres and Dades Gorges which were beautiful. We got to see Berber villages, kasbahs and also stopped at an argan oil co-op. On the first night of the trip we stayed at Chez Pierre which was a gorgeous hotel and we had a really lovely meal there. The staff were very friendly and accommodating. Wish we could have stayed for another night! On the second day of the tour we traveled to Merzouga in the Sahara desert and did a camel trek out to the camp where we stayed overnight. Hassan had arranged for us to leave our belongings at a hotel in Merzouga for the night and when we returned the following morning we had breakfast and well needed showers there before our journey back to Marakech. The last day of the trip involved a lot of travel (approx 800km I think so 7-8 hours driving) to return to Marakech so we were very tired. Most of the journey is through the Atlas mountains so windy roads and I am not the best traveler so didn't feel to well on the way back! I would recommend doing the 4 day trip so that you do not have to spend so much time in the car on the last day of the trip. Thank you so much Hassan for sharing all your knowledge and for being an excellent guide. We really enjoyed our trip!"

The company responded to every question we had in a timely manner and accommodated us in every way possible. We had the worst luck with flights getting to Morocco from Chicago, IL. Our first flight was cancelled and our second flight was delayed. This caused us to miss our remaining connections to even get to Morocco. We ended up landing in Morocco one day later which made us miss our scheduled tour. But Hasan from Sahara 4x4 kept in contact with us during our entire journey to Morocco and emailed us in a timely manner. He assured us that we will have a tour guide available any day we ended up arriving to Morocco. Our tour guide was Mohamed. He arrived at our Riad on time and was one of the most kindest and humblest person we had met during our visit to this country. We ended up choosing a 3 day-2night tour to the High dunes. It was a private tour so it was only my boyfriend and I in Mohamed's 4-wheel drive. This allowed us the luxury of A/C, off road touring, and stopping whenever we wanted to. The first night we spent at Chez Pierre in the mountains. It was UNBELIEVABLY BEAUTIFUL. The service was 5-stars and the dinner provided was exceptional. The second day Mohamed dropped us off at a hotel where you're able to securely store your luggage in your own room. A different guide from the hotel guided us with his young son as we rode camels into the dunes of the Sahara desert and slept under the stars. The company sets up Berber tents with mattresses and a very clean bathroom for using. We enjoyed a delicious dinner and participated in playing the instruments as they sang to us for entertainment. After dinner you have the option to pull your mattress into the open desert and sleep without a roof. Sleep without tent! IT IS A MUST DO. YOU WON'T REGRET IT. You'll be able to see shooting stars. Then right before the sun rises you and the rest of your small group climb to the top of a high dune to watch the sunrise. This was the best part of our trip to Morocco. You then return back to your hotel room to shower and have breakfast. Then you're back on the road. Sahara 4x4 was a great company to use. They accommodated us in every way possible by choosing the best places to sleep and best restaurants to stop to eat at with great picture opportunities. Our tour guide, Mohamed, was very helpful. He was our photographer the whole trip and knew the best places to take a beautiful picture. He also made sure that we were attended to right away at every restaurant or place we stopped to visit. Mohamed was also very informative about any cultural/historical questions we had during the trip. But most importantly we felt very safe with him and he advised us where to purchase souvenirs with the best prices! If you're not planning to stay very long in Morocco this is the best company to use in order to make your trip worthwhile. You won't waste any time! You will be able to cram a lot within 3 days and everything is included in the price, except lunch and souvenirs! Everyone we met through this company knew enough English to hold a conversation and were more than grateful for any tip we gave them for their service. We left more than satisfied with this company! We highly recommend them."

Long story short, they were fantastic, and when my gf got sick they went above and beyond to ensure we were comfortable and that she was well taken care of.My GF and I took a 3 day trip from Marrakesh to Fez with Ibrahim as our driver and tour guide. From the moment he picked us up we knew we were in good hands. It was clear throughout our three day tour that our comfort and happiness was their top priority and he was more than willing to adjust our itinerary to ensure we were happy. Where they really went above and beyond was when my girlfriend caught a stomach bug (bad kafka at a restaurant for lunch, not the tour's fault). She ate the bad kafka at lunch however it didn't hit her until our night in the desert where she became severely ill. Due to the remoteness of our location there was no other choice but to ride it out. However, our desert hosts were very helpful providing soothing teas and other Berber remedies (kinda like pressure points) to help ease her symptoms. They basically stayed up the entire night helping us.The following day we were supposed to leave the desert and drive 8hrs for our drop off in Fez, instead, they helped us adjust our schedule adding in an extra day to ensure she had the time necessary to recover. During this unplanned extra day they provided us with a luxury room at the hotel in the Berber town for her to rest and recover. During this, multiple people checked in on her status and expressed genuine worry. While she rested, Ibrahim and Hassan worked with me to change our schedule letting us stay an extra day, they helped us cancel previous reservations and make new reservations at a hotel half the distance to Fez. Ibrahim then drove us both to the halfway point and then to the airport the next day in time to make our flight out, all with no extra charge. They really looked after us and it made what was a tough situation, infinitely easier.Morocco has an abundance of beautiful natural scenery and historic cultural sites and there is no better way to see it all then with Sahara tours. They provided an unprecedented level of customer service and even when things got messy they were right there doing everything in their power to clean it up. You are in very good hands with Hassan and his team. Thanks Ibrahim!!20/10 would recommend!"

            "review": "Four day, three night tour to Fez. My husband and I recently did a four day, three night tour from Marrakech to Fez. I'm going to describe the itinerary first, and then talk about the little extras that made the tour very special. On the first day we were picked up from our riad in Marrakech at about 8:30 and then drove through beautiful scenery through the Atlas Mountains, where we stopped for tea and coffee. Then we continued on and got to see small villages on the way to Ait Ben Haddou, a famous film location, and Quarzazate. We ended the night in the most gorgeous valley, the Dades Valley. The dinner we had at the hotel Chez Pierre in the Dades Valley was one of the best dinners we have ever had in our travels. It was truly top notch. The second day, we drove through the Dades Valley, the Toudra Gorges, and then arrived in the dessert. When we got to the desert we were given a room where we prepared a small bag for an overnight stay in a camp in the desert. We were able to leave all our luggage in this room while we went to the desert. Then we were escorted to the camels where we were taken on an hour camel ride into the camp. On the way we got to watch the sunset while sitting atop our camels. The Berber guides were also willing to stop at any moment to take fabulous photos. When we got to the camp I was shocked at how developed the camp was . The tents in the camp had beds with sheets and blankets. The camp also included a functioning toilet and a table with benches. When we got to the camp we got to drink tea, while swapping stories with other travelers. Then we were served traditional Tanjine and fruit for dessert. At night we got to gaze at the stars from atop the dunes and listen to Berber music. The night was hot, since we were traveling in June, but not unbearable. We were awakened at 5 AM to watch the sunrise atop the dunes and then rode the camels back one hour to the hotel. Once at the hotel we were given breakfast and transferred into a nice room in the hotel. We were then picked up at 11 AM that day and got to see the irrigation system in the desert, a market depot with all original Berber items, we got to listen and dance to music with the people that immigrated hundreds of years ago from Mali, and then had very delicious Berber pizza for lunch. We then went back to the hotel to relax and swim in the pool and enjoy a delicious dinner on the terrace. On the last day, we left the hotel at 8AM and drove to Fez, stopping along the way at Ziz valley, a nice hotel for lunch, and driving through the Cedar Forest all the way to Fez.The cost of the trip was 400 euros a person and includes two nights in very nice hotels, dinner all three nights, and breakfast all three mornings. This may seem pricey, but for all you get it really is a good value. Don't forget you have a private guide and air conditioned vehicle for four days and a paid for excursion into the desert. You might be able to find a group tour a tad bit cheaper, but I enjoyed being able to relax and spread out in our own vehicle, stop when we needed to go to the bathroom and listen to our music the whole time. It was like going on the most beautiful road trip, but neither of us had to do the tiring work of driving. Our guide Muhammad was also the nicest, caring guide you could ask for. He made sure we were comfortable at all times and spoke good English. He explained everything we were seeing, but also was just fun to hang out with and relax with. I would definitely recommend him. You are in great hands if he is your guide because he will make sure you have everything you need and throw in a little bit of fun along the way. I know there is a lot of companies that do these tours, but this company provides quality service at a good value, which is why I would chose them. If you're like me, this is probably something you've been waiting to do for awhile and you want to make sure you make a good choice."

He was amazing, always willing to respond to all our questions and happy to make as much stops as we wanted for pictures, he showed us wonderful places and treat us like friends. We love the night at the dessert! It's a life time experience!!!! What a fun and fantastic camel ride and then enjoying the beautiful dessert and the night under the stars, was priceless!. They had all perfectly organized, so the 3 days trip was smooth and unforgettable. All the places Mohammed took us, and the hotel on the road were just fantastic.I want to also thank Hassan for doing my planning and reservation worry-free. We made contact by email, he made the reservation process very simple and also replied to all my questions quickly and kindly. We had the opportunity to meet him as well, and like all his crew, he was friendly and very nice. They really like to show the beauty of their country and the warm of their people. We have to go back, because there are still lots of places we have to visit and of course with Sahara Tours 4x4.Thank you Hassan and Mohammed for doing our trip wonderful!"

While the journey is long you can stop wherever you like and your driver will accommodate any request. We were fortunate enough to have Mohammed accompany us on our tour. You will see countless mini-vans and busses packed with tourists along the way, don't be alarmed. Just as we arrived in our private transport we were privately escorted by Yusuf and our two awaiting camels. Despite passing many clusters of tents, we were happy to find our camp was a little further out and more secluded than the others. As for food, amazing! Traditional Berber tagine and Moroccan salads for dinner. As for breakfast, what an amazing spread. You will never be hungry once there, trust me!!! Highlight of course is the beauty of where you are. A night sky with has more stars that would leave Carl Sagan speechless. Your alarm clock is the sound of a gentle beat of a drum. Watching the grace and beauty of the sun rising atop a solitary dune is one you can't miss! Thanks to Mohammad and everyone we had the pleasure to spend the journey with!"

Ali was a great tour guide: very knowledgable with a strong command of English, but also kind and flexible to our preferences. Our driver Ibrahim was equally as thoughtful and patient. There was a lot of driving over the 3 days of our condensed tour but it was all worth it for the experiences we had. Our night in the Sahara was of course the highlight of the trip. While it was not quite as expected (hot and stuffy in the tents when we expected it to be chilly), the camel rides and waking up in the dunes was unforgettable. The only thing to set this company apart from others with a similar tour is the people and for that I would highly recommend Ali and Ibrahim."

            "review": "3 amazing days!!!. Said picked us up on time at our riad in Marrakesh to start our 3 day trip through Morocco up to F\u00e9s. We saw so many things that our review could easily fill a book, but here are some of our favorites: -the magical old kasbah Ben Haddou (gladiator, game of thrones and many other movies were shot there)-monkeys in a forest (who are not scared to hug you)-the highest point of whole Morocco in the Atlas mountains-huge rock formations called \"mighty fingers\" that look so amazing its hard to believe they're not man made- Dades valley in the Atlas where we stayed in a beautiful hotel and got served a fancy 5 course dinnerWe didn't mind all the driving because there were many other things to see along the way, sometimes its a complete change of scenery, sometimes its just an endless valley and Said's 4x4 was also comfortable enough for a quick nap when we got too tired. Said was an amazing guide who explained a lot about Morocco, the culture, religion and answered every question we had. We felt safe with him every second and had a great time together.The best part was our trip to a desert camp in the Sahara, where Mubarak and his beduin friends guided us with a caravan of his camels. When the sun set we had the best tajine of our whole trip, drank mint tea and played the drums together and later chose to sleep under the stars out in the dunes instead of inside a tent. Early in the morning we climbed the dunes and watched the sun rise. A moment full of magic. We returned to the hotel on our camels backs and continued our trip to F\u00e9s where we arrived in the evening of the third day. To sum it up: it was a great experience and we would recommend this trip to everyone visiting Morocco and who is into a little adventure! We loved it!"

We knew we were going for a reputable company but were still thoroughly impressed by their professionalism and desire to maximise customer satisfaction.On the first day, we met Said, our tour guide and driver who were as excited to meet us as we were to go for the tour. His enthusiasm continued throughout the 4 days we were with in and he was incredibly warm towards our questions and queries. We learned plenty of African culture, the Moroccan people and life in the desert. Said was always helpful and were willing to accommodate to all our requests. He was patient, punctual and incredibly friendly. The fact that he had friends in many places we visited was a testament of how well connected the company was. We felt Said was humble, genuine and always willing to teach us more about Morocco.We felt that the prices charged were very fair given the quality of our accommodations and food that were provided for us. Both exceeded expectations and really did give us a perfect combination of comfort and experience in the desert. Despite these outstanding arrangements, it was Said's service that was truly impressive. Said was extremely proficient in English, which was a tremendous plus for the tour.10/10 would strongly recommend to anyone who wants an experience in North Africa!"

The second thing that you need to know is that it is worth it with the amazing things that we experienced! The trip was easy to arrange with Hassan (who met us in Merzouga half way through the trip and seemed like a nice guy). I did a fair bit of research beforehand and Sahara 4x4 seemed to be the best value - cheaper than lots of others but still the same quality/itinerary. Youssef came to our Riad to pick us up early on the first morning. His English was pretty good and he was a really nice guy - very genuine. There were two of us and Youssef in the large 4x4. Plenty of room and the car was in very good condition. Four people or more would be to many in my opinion. Youssef was keen to please us and stopped off often at great vantage points or interesting places. We visited all of the sights on the itinerary. Youssef even drove us off road when we saw some nomads so we could meet them! What an experience! We stayed at a lovely hotel (Chez Pierre) on the first night in the Dades gorge. The dinner was exceptional. On the second day we visited Todres Gorge (staggering!). We arrived in Merzouga in the late afternoon and were taken to our camels and off we went into the desert. There were 6 of us on the desert trip. A Berber took us into the desert. It is difficult to describe how beautiful it was. After an hour and a half we arrived at the camp surrounded by huge sand dunes. We watched the sun go down and had a delicious meal - the best in our entire holiday! I chose to sleep on a blanket on a dune, which was quite surreal (the tent was fine, if not a bit warm inside). The next day it was up early for sunrise before going back to the hotel on the camels. Then a long drive back across the Atlas mountains and back to our Riad.The range of landscapes we saw was breath-taking, the desert trip was really authentic and our guide was excellent. We were in complete control of the itinerary, and it was an amazing experience we will never forget."

We scheduled a three-day, two-night trip beginning in Marrakech and ending in Fes. We especially appreciated the visit to Ait Ben Haddou (with a family-type meal arranged by Mohammed), the visit to to the Dades Valley (hotel provided a six-course meal!), Todra Gorges (wonderful scenery here as well as in the Dades Valley), and MOST OF ALL the camel ride, night in the tent in the desert. We were fortunate that the night we were in the desert there were no moon and no clouds. When I got up to go the bathroom in the middle of the night (after all lights were off), the stars were truly wonderful with the Milky Way visible. The hotel (fully booked) was not able to provide us with a room for a shower the next morning, but instead gave us \"outdoor private accommodations.\" Although my daughter's shower seemed to work well enough, mine had intermittent heat and pressure. The drive to Fes was long, but it was still interesting and helped us with our schedule."

The vehicle was a Mitsubishi Pajero (Shogun) with nothing written on the side to embarrass you. Clean, comfortable and in good order. Mohammed, our young Berber guide was respectful and caring from start to finish and we totally trusted him. He spoke good English and was happy to answer all of our questions about life in Morocco and life as a Berber. Special thanks, Mohammed for helping me to understand more about the Shias and Sunnis. I have now got a much better grip on what is going on in the Middle East!The whole trip is so well organised and we did not encounter any problems. We stopped at pleasant places for lunch and the 2 hotels en route were high quality, modern and stylish. The unforgettable spread of gourmet food at the hotel at the Dades Gorge deserves a special mention. Mohammed took us to meet his family in Rassini where we enjoyed an authentic Berber pizza. We were unsure about the night in the desert, but we need not have been. Even though we were handed over to a different set of guides, we were taken care of with respect and everything was again well organised. What an experience! Don't miss it. It is worth every mile that you drive to get there.The mountains, the high passes, the valleys, the colours, the absorption of life in Morocco, the desert. It was a stunning experience that I would recommend to everyone. And at the end of it all, Mohammed saw us back safely to our Riad in Marrakesh.Thank you, Mohammed, thank you Hsain. You have a brilliant company that deserves all the good reviews. We were impressed with everything and your attention to detail and your care and respect shines through. We wish you great success."

It was an excellent experience, giving us a quick overview of the amazingly varied scenery in Morocco. As everyone says, the trek into the desert is an amazing experience. The scenery in the mountains reminded my wife of Colorado. Most of our trip was driven by Mohamed, and we really enjoyed hearing his stories of growing up in a Berber, nomad family. It was also interesting to visit his home town of Rissani, for a view of a city tourists would not normally visit. His friendliness and kindness were exemplary. For the final half-day, we had Omar as a driver, and he was also wonderful, going out of his way to make sure we got to our riad in Marrakesh ok. This is an excellent company to support, and very reasonably priced. Our only suggestion, given also by many others, is that 3 days is a bit rushed to see so much, and there is lots of driving. If we had more time, we would have booked a 4 or 5-day trip. It would have been great to have another day, spent in the Dades Gorge (to do some walking) and to have some time in Ouarzazate. In the Dades Gorge, Chez Pierre was an excellent place to stay, with dinner and breakfast that were among the best on our trip. Thanks to Hassan, Mohamed, and Omar."

Breaks and meals were also set up well to break up very long drives. These guys started out leading camel treks in the desert (they grew up in Berber villages around Merzouga) and truly bootstrapped themselves up with this business - they learned numerous languages (including excellent English) purely from interactions with tourists, then eventually started this business and expanded, car by car (yes, Moroccan-owned, not French or other European). An inspiring story of hard work, entrepreneurship and good guys winning. Please give them a try!"

Our guide Mohammed was about our age and super friendly (he took us through his hometown Rissani, and he has lots of friends - \"Hey Mohammed, you're pretty popular!\"\"Yes, of course!\") and totally open to stopping and alternating from the set stops if you'd like. The accomodations are very very nice and all the meals are excellent. When we booked this tour we thought mostly of the dunes and the camels, but I think our favorite views were on the way - you drive through 5 or 6 distinctly different landscapes; from the snow covered Atlas mountains to the deep Todra Gorge, the vast expanse of the desert to the forests of Ifrane. Be aware, when ending in Fes the last day is a lot of driving, but the views are amazing. Suggestions: do at least 4 days! But if you must do only 3 for scheduling then this is the best there is: book with safaritours4x4, relax and look forward to a great adventure.Thank you Mohammed!

With the limited amount of time my wife and I had, this tour definitely worked perfectly and was by far the highlight of our Morocco trip thus far! I had done my research and picked SaharaTours4x4 based on the price offered in conjunction with accommodations and features as well the professionalism in the communications.Owner Hassan was prompt with his e-mail replies and our guide Mohammed was extremely professional and made us feel safe and satisfied with every aspect of the trip, adding a lot of personal touches along the way which was awesome. The tour itself was amazing and we packed a lot into the 3D2N time frame. In between taking in all the wonderful sights we also spent a night at the beautifully designed Chez Pierre which featured 2 fantastic meals (though the hotel could certainly use better in-room heating). The Sahara desert excursion also deserves mention, as the Berber guides were very friendly and hospitable and made us feel very comfortable. We were prepared to be roughing it out in the desert and were pleasantly surprised to be greeted with comfortable facilities after a long camel trek.If you have time though I would definitely recommend going for 4D3N to maybe have a bit more time in the desert and avoid a long 9 consecutive hour trip back on the last day. All in all, SaharaTours4x4 definitely gets my highest recommendation for a flawless journey and great value for money. I'm sure you're reading this Mohammed, so hope to see you in KL someday!"

The first day me and my mum were picked up from our Riad in Marrakech promptly on time, by our driver/ tour guide Mohammad. We then travelled through the high Atlas Mountains stopping at beautiful sites along the way recommend by Mohammad much to our delight. In the afternoon we drove through Berber villages which were intriguingly pretty and visited the Kasbah in which films such as the gladiator, the mummy and jewel of the Nile were shot. The hotel for the first night in Ouarzazate was clean and beautifully decorated. The staff were very friendly and willing to cater for every need.Day 2 was the day of the desert. The journey from Ouarzazate to the Merzouga Desert was nicely laid out with stops along the way to visit Draa Valley which houses one of the longest rivers in Morocco and to admire Berber villages and kashabs to eventually end up desolate but stunning desert. The camel ride into the desert was roughly one hour to reach the Berber tent in which we spent the night. The tent was charming although don't expect the warmth of a hotel, as the desert is bitterly cold at night! So bring thermals! The \"camel men\" were the hosts for the night in the desert and they entertained us with drumming, learning each other's language, traditional singing and friendly banter and comparing names of the stars in each others language, all whilst sat around a campfire.After admiring sunrise and leaving the desert by camel. We freshened up and had traditional Moroccan breakfast at the hotel we left our belongings at the previous night. We then visited the Rissani Market which was Mohammad's home town and he proudly showed us around all the items it had to offer including a donkey, sheep and cow market! After a while driving again we stopped at Erdoud Fossil place, the tour of the site was not something I was particularly interested in, but it was informative nonetheless. We then ventured to the scenic Todra Gorge which was a towering cliff sided canyon, it was breathtaking to walk through and to capture photos. Once finishing at the gorge, we proceeded to the Dades Valley which housed our hotel- Chez Pierre, the food was outstanding and the room pretty but fairly cold despite having an extra duvet. On the final day, it was snowing and the conditions for appreciating the view was limited. We drove through the roses valley and enjoyed the beauty of the snow throughout the journey and especially In the high Atlas Mountains. The main purpose the the day however was to get back to Marrakech before the predicted snow in the afternoon which could potential close the roads in the mountain.Overall the trip was an amazing experience, the communication before the trip was efficient. Mohammad was an excellent driver/host/tour guide and a really safe driver. The hotels were impeccable, lunch stops were reasonably priced and good food. And the trip to the desert was a highlight and made my holiday!:)Thank you!:)"

Professional, polite and prompt. Not only that, but the prices were competitive too.We were greeted by our charming driver/guide, Mohammed, at 8:30am from our Riad, as arranged. His polite, gentlemanly manner was present immediately, as he carried our bags up the cobbled streets of the medina. An endearing characteristic that was present for the entire trip.The vehicle (Pajero) was new, clean, comfortable and well maintained.We had initially been tentative and anxious being lone female travellers, however we needn't have worried. Mohammed ensured we felt at ease and was very attentive - frequently checking that everything was ok.The itinerary was well structured, so as not to spend too many extended periods sat in the car - however you do need to appreciate that in order to cover the distance, in the limited time, that there is a LOT of time in the car. Regular stops were made to visit attractions or for photo opportunities which helped break the days up.Lunch breaks were taken at restaurants that seemed to cater for tours like ours! They generally offered a set menu costing 100 dirhams (\u00a37 approx) - this you needed to pay for (however breakfast & dinner were included).The accomodation was spot on - exceeding our expectations. The hotels were well presented, staffed by welcoming and friendly Moroccans and also provided great food. Particular mention needs to go to the hotel for our final night (Chez Pierre) - the food was exceptional.The highlight of our trip had to be the trip to the Sahara desert (Erg Chebbi - Merzouga). For me, this was what all the hours in the car had been about. Late afternoon we dropped our bags off at a hotel (taking one small bag with us) and had a short wait for two other guests to arrive. We were then met by the 'camel men'. They spoke very little English - we spoke very little French...yet somehow we gesticulated and babbled enough that we understood each other! The camel ride was not as unpleasant as I had been led to believe - in fact I thoroughly enjoyed it! The desert was so tranquil and charming. The evening was rounded off spent under the stars, around a camp fire with the 'camel men' singing Berber songs and playing drums...then (much to our embarrassment) passing the drums to us \"your turn\". \"Play English song\"!! Our minds went blank and we all ended up in fits of laughter! This frivolity continued when one of the Berber men produced his phone with an app for learning English - he demonstrated phrases such as \"the button has fallen off my bosses overcoat\" or \"my sisters boyfriend has a dog\" \"my boss has a computer\"!! Again we were in fits of giggles! The night was spent in a traditional Berber tent. I'm not going to lie, despite wearing thermals and snuggling up under 3 layers of blankets + sleeping bag (provided) - it was freezing. I knew this would be the case as I had done my research... But even though .....bbbbrrrrr!!!Also worth noting was the visit to Rissani market. This is Mohammed's home territory and he was illuminated (and proud?) showing us around the tantalising and intriguing sights of the various items on offer (spices, fruits, veg, dates, donkeys, sheep, iron works, wood, shoes....and more). We really enjoyed the experience of having him guide us around, explaining what was on offer.As you can probably gather - we thoroughly enjoyed the trip and highly recommend using this company."

Seeing all the changes as you leave the city was fascinating, the Berber villages in the mountains amazed me. Every stop was brilliant, including super views of snow capped mountains! The Kasbah of Ait Ben Haddou is just fantastic and the real highlight of the tour. Our guide MOHAMMED was very helpful, really friendly and very patient. Giving us time to take photos when ever and time for tea, always worth the stop for tea! Lunch was great, and all included in the cost. A great day totalling almost 11 hours.

The desert and the many other places we stopped at were incredibly beautiful and breathtaking. Although there was a lot to see and do, we did not feel rushed at all.

The tour course was unique and excellent. Long driving was never bored because of spectacle landscape outside. Of course Sahara was really something unforgettable. However the rest palces we visited also took impressively big part of the tour. Mohammed was kind and made our journey easy and comfortable all the way. Special thanks to Moha!Onething to prepare for winter tour is real winter cloths for nights. Lodging facilities are mostly prepared to avoid heat rather than cold. So better being prepared."

We had a fantastic experience. Booking was really easy - we submitted a form online and heard from Hassan right away. He was very responsive and was on top of everything. Our tour guide Said picked us up from our hotel in Marrakesh - he was absolutely fantastic. Said was a great driver and tour guide, giving us explanations along the way. The car was spacious and nice, which made the long rides comfortable for us. Said stopped at various points to allow us to take pictures, and it was nice because he fended off some annoyances of people trying to sell us things along the way as well. Throughout the whole trip we felt safe and taken care of. The Kasbah we went to where all the famous films were shot was really cool and we really enjoyed our tour there. It was great exercise going up the stairs as well after many hours in the car. The hotel in Dades Valley was nice - the rooms were nothing fancy, but the meal was delicious and it was nice to be in the gorges. The camel ride and camping in the desert was really nice and an experience we will not forget. The Berber people sang for us at night and told us various jokes under a sky full of stars - we had never seen so many stars ever and it was so romantic. The next day we rode a camel back to a hotel where we took a shower and had home-made breakfast. It was a really nice breakfast. On our way to Fes, we stopped at various points, including an area where we saw a lot of monkeys. We were dropped off at our hotel in Fes at night. It was a fantastic tour and we highly recommend!"

Hassan was extremely helpful throughout the booking process, replying very promptly to my first email with a full itinerary and then later explaining why the 4D3N tour was preferable to the 3D2N one (less daylight in the middle of winter!). The itinerary was also adjusted according to what we wanted, so it was a real personal tour. Said was a wonderful guide too, introducing us to culture, food and language, and he's also a talented photographer! The one caution I would give is that there is a lot of driving, usually about 4-5h each day, some of it through windy mountain roads. But really, it's the best way to see the country - just think of it as an road trip with friends! And sitting by a makeshift bonfire, gazing at the stars in the night sky of the Sahara makes the drive completely worth it."

Saeed was full of insights and able to answer all our questions, drove carefully and expertly through some difficult terrain, had lined up accommodation which was great, and his taste in music even better with Tinariwen as our soundtrack through the desert right to the Atlas mountains. If we didn't feel like stopping at a co-op or wanted to pull over to enjoy a view Saeed was more than willing to accommodate with a smile.

We found 4x4 Sahara Tours on Trip advisor and chose them because of brilliant reviews and reasonable price (about a third cheaper from what we had been quoted elsewhere) We have picked a 4 day tour from Marrakech to Merzouga with a night in Quarzazate and Dades gorges.We have booked and agreed everything via email a few weeks before we went to Morocco and send 100 EUR deposit by paypal. Everything went really smoothly from beginning to the end. Good communication via email before the trip, Said, our tour guide picked us up in our hotel in Marrakech on time as agreed. Said was a very polite young gentlemen, he was a good company and a careful driver. The tour involved quite a lot of driving each day but the scenery in Morocco is amazing so we were happy watching the world go by whilst chatting to Said and asking him hundreds of questions which he patiently answered and of course there were stops on the way to take photos and see some interesting places. Our favourite part of the trip was staying in the camp in the sand dunes in Merzouga and the camel trek (I wish we stayed there for 2 nights, it was a long way to go and the desert scenery is breathtaking). It was my birthday that day. What a shock when the team in the camp came out with a birthday cake for me all completed with candles and it was very tasty too. I was so surprised, I would never expect a cake in the middle of the sand dunes, but these guys just really appreciate visitors and pull out all the stops to make your holiday special. It was definitely a birthday I will never forget, spent with the wonderful, hospitable Moroccan people. We were singing and dancing to traditional berber music and chatting to each other till late. By the way the camp was very comfortable, tents were massive with 2 double beds and there was a chemical toilet in the camp.The food throughout the tour was very good too and there were some surprises on the way, wait and see for yourselves, it's nice not to know every detail of the itinerary. All in all we had an amazing time on the tour and would recommend 4x4 Sahara Tours and visiting Morocco to everyone. Next time we bringing the kids...."

They drove us to our gorgeous riad in Marrakech where we had the chance to explore the city ourselves. I won't go through the whole 9 day itinerary because we covered so many places! Said and Ibrahim were always willing to give information about the history and culture and took so many photos for us! Highlights included all the amazing Moroccan food (included!), the lovely riads we stayed at, the Dades gorges, the night in the desert and the camel ride in and sandboarding, the guides playing music for us in the desert, the gorgeous blues of Chefchaouen. The Sahara desert in particular will go down as one of the greatest travel experiences of my life. I really can't put into words how beautiful the trip was and how glad we used Sahara tours.

The tour includes a lot of driving (the last day consists of a 9 hour drive from Merzouga back to Marrakesh) but the car was spacious and comfortable.The Moroccan landscape is colourful and varied; mountains, valleys, deserts, gorges, trees and oases in relatively close proximity. On our first night of the tour we stayed at Chez Pierre in the Dades Gorges. We would definitely recommend this hotel; the food was exceptional and it's hard to beat the view. For the second night we had the actual desert trip. The desert experience was definitely the highlight of our holiday; riding camels, sleeping in a Berber camp, watching the sunset, stars and sunrise is an experience we will never forget! Facilities at the Berber camp were far better than expected; including toilets, running water and individual camps. Food and entertainment were provided.

We were in contact with Hasan both before and after our booking, and Hasan was always very forthcoming with his responses.

I wrote to many different companies and went for Sahara Tours 4x4 because Hassan was very quick to respond and offered a good price and his suggested itinerary was exactly what I wanted. I have to say that for the same itinerary by different companies, the prices can be very different, so it is worthwhile to compare before you choose. Ahmed was our driver and he was an amazing guide. He was polite, professional, always keen to explain about everywhere we were going or passing, and drove tirelessly for hours everyday for us. I know these qualities are not the case with every guide out there, as we met other people along the way of this tour, and we could see that the other guides did not possess the kind of professionalism and courtesy that Ahmed had. We are from Thailand and we get pretty much everyone in Marrakech shouting \"Japan Japan!\" at us all day long, whether it was in effort to sell something or just to have fun at our expense. Even another guide, who we kept running into, (Ahmed knows him so they chat when we stop in the same places) was trying to crack jokes about us being Japanese. So we were very appreciative that Ahmed was a lot more professional and more thoughtful than that. Hassan should really be proud that his guides are so much better than those of his competitors. We saw some of the most stunning scenery along the way and would suggest that it is definitely worth getting out of the big cities in Morocco, because the best and most eye-opening places of this country really belong in the countryside. Looking at the photos from this trip, the most amazing ones were all from the 3-4 days we spent with Sahara Tours 4x4, so again, I thank Ahmed and Hassan a hundred times for an unforgettable experience that was the highlight of our Moroccan holiday."

Even before our adventure had even begun, Hassan had arranged for our guides to pick us up from the airport and drop us off at our riad before our excursion actually started the following day. Mohammed and Ibrahim were two of the most amazing guides we could have ever asked for. They made us feel so comfortable throughout the entire trip and went out of their way to make us happy. Mohammed even left my wife sit in the front passenger seat for a leg of our drive so that she could take better pictures of the scenery! Even though we only booked a quick 3 day trip to the Merzouga desert, our guides patiently took us to stops along the way that allowed us to see amazing sights and meet amazing people. I loved that they stopped at a few women's co-operatives for them to demonstrate how they make argon oil products and rose plant products. It's always re-assuring to experience such a progressive country. They stopped along so many landmarks and expertly explained the significance of each place. Mohammed's English was amazing and we had great conversations with him throughout the trip.We had a short stay at Chez Pierre - which was such a beautiful stop over. The food was absolutely amazing. We then arrived at Merzouga, where we went given a room to leave our luggage and shower before our camel ride into the desert. The desert itself was one of those life experiences that you will talk about forever. All of the Berber guides that gathered there were so friendly and cheerful. They played some songs for us during dinner and were very entertaining. We had a 12 hour drive the following day back to Marrakesh and our guides got us there, safely, while we napped for most of the trip back. We consider Mohammed and Ibrahim family and can't thank them enough for sharing their stories and time with us. Even after our long journey back to Marrakesh, they dropped us off to the airport the next morning at 5:30am so we could catch our flight. Even with our short meet up with Hassan at the Merzouga desert, he was incredibly friendly and his only concern was whether or not we were having a good time. Didn't even mention the fact that we still owed the balance of our money! I hope he and this company continues to succeed. You will not find a better company to take care of you and show you the sights and sounds of Morocco."

We were a group of 4 students from PUERTO RICO, ages 21-22. Hassan assigned us M'Barek. We took the three day desert tour from Marrakech He was the best tour guide ever, i cannot describe how good he was. He spoke very good English, not perfect but understandable if you listen, also Spanish. At first we didn't have money because hard to find atm machines in the Atlas lol s he lent us money. For us that was like a good sign of trust. He took care of everything, explained all and was very funny. The last day he invited us for lunch to a picnic, i was asking for a watermelon the whole trip and always forgot to buy it. He was so nice that he bought one for the picnic. To be honest I've travelled around and not a fan of tours because how constricting they are but this tour has been the best of my life, we had de liberty to do practically what we wanted. Its a lot of car ride but if you are mentally prepared for it you should do fine. Beautiful scenery and also a lot of time to talk to the tour guide. M'barek was really fun to talk to, ask him about his religion his early life and everything. Learned a lot about culture in this tour."

From the Atlantic ocean in Essaouira, to the crazy cacophony of Djema al Fn'aa, the solitude of the oasis near Ouarzazate, the mighty Todra Gorges, the haunting Sahara at Merzouga, the mystical cedar forests of Azrou, the chaos of Fez's medina and the blue magic of Chefchaeoun....

Ahmed definitely knows so much about every part of the country we travelled for - he is like a walking Morocco encyclopedia. We travelled in a Hyundai van which he expertly and safely navigated through all different types of terrain. The hotel we stayed at near the gorges was better than I think was pictured on the website called Chez Pierre and it was very comfortable with great food! I think the highlight of the trip was definitely the Sahara/Erg Chebbi dunes. Riding out on the camels was an experience itself (I love camels!) and we spent the night out under the breathtaking blanket of stars (not even sleeping in the tents.)Note when booking, I was a little concerned about the deposit through Western Union but don't worry, it is all legit and Hassan answered any questions I had promptly. This was really a great and affordable tour and a good way to get to see more of Morocco."

Quite a lot of service for just two people on a day trip! The excursion is well planned, but we were consistently asked about preferences so Said could make adjustments for us. They did a good job picking stops, including lots of opportunities for pictures and a very nice lunch. Said graciously answered my husband\u2019s endless stream of questions on Moroccan culture, politics and religion as we drove, so it was truly a great overview of Morocco. Said speaks 5 languages, including the excellent English he spoke with us. This particular tour is an extended day driving with stops in the film studios and kasbah near Oarzazate. It passes through the green area outside of Marrakesh, winding through to the top of the mountains and then heading into the desert. There are stops in the film studios near Oarzazate. We particularly wanted to see the landscape outside of Marrakech, so the drive was exactly what we were seeking. If someone wanted a shorter, more active tour they should look at a different excursion from Sahara."

We arranged this tour through email prior to out trip to Marrakesh, they were very professional and quick to respond making the booking process extremely straight forward. Our tour guide met us outside our riad where we walked to the square and drove from there. Both the guide and driver were very friendly and professional in addition to being highly knowledgeable about the city and surrounding areas and were welcoming to any questions we had. The drive to ourika provided incredible views and there were several routine stops made for us to take pictures, additionally our guide insisted that if we wanted to stop at any time to take a picture then all we needed to do was to say so. Once at the Berber village we began a hike up to the waterfall which was absolutely incredible. Expecting there to be some sort of path it came as a shock to us when we discovered that we were literally climbing up the rocks but this is what really made the trip the incredible experience it was. Despite the trek being quite challenging at times our guide made us feel safe by leading the way and stopping whenever needed. The hike went right up into the mountains which provided unbelievable views before heading back down into the Berber village where we stopped for lunch. Overall the experience was absolutely amazing and if you are planning to see Ourika Valley I cannot recommend a better way to do it than through this company!"

The climb to see the waterfalls was brilliant and the tour guide was extremely friendly. He answered any questions we had and also educated us about the Berber lifestyle and Morocco in general. The tour guide reccomended a restaurant which served traditional Moroccan/Berber cuisine, and left us to have lunch before meeting us for the drive home. We arrived back in Marrakech at 5pm so we had a full day out! We paid just under 1500 dirham (just over \u00a350 per head!) for the two of us for the private tour so it was excellent value for money! If you are planning an excursion when visiting Marrakech then I highly recommend Sararah Tours!"

We emailed LOTS of tour companies and found that Hassan was extremely responsive over email and helped us coordinate a perfect 3 day/2 night desert trip from Marrakech to Fez. In regards to the logistics, we made a small deposit via western union and paid the rest in cash on arrival to Fez at the end of the trip. We never used western union before but it went very smoothly. Hassan was in contact right up until we left for Morocco and we were picked up at the door of our riad in Marrakech without a hitch to start the tour.Our guide was Said and our driver was Ibrahim, who were both very engaging and knowledgeable. You get to know your guides well over the course of the trip and they give you great insight into Moroccan culture. A private tour is definitely the way to go (we had friends who did a similar tour with a large group and found it to be very impersonal and misrespresented online). Anything we wanted to do they would help to coordinate. Just be prepared to do a lot of driving, but plenty of stops for sightseeing and stretching your legsDay 1 was spent driving through the Moroccan country side with plenty of photo ops. The first night was a stop in Dades Gorges. One bit of advice: when they give you the option of where to stay in Dades Gorges, choose Riad Chez Pierre. An unbelievable place literally nestled in the gorge with private terraces and spectacular views. Plus you\u2019re served a gourmet 5 course French meal included (a nice break from cous cous and Tajine). The highlight of the tour was the desert. The camel ride was fun, and the sunset/sunrise views were fantastic. Tons of stars at night. There were actually 4 other people on simultaneous Sahara 4x4 tours that met up with us for the desert portion of the trip, which made it fun to have other people to hang out with (even if none of us really spoke the same language!) The tents were actually more comfortable than expected, just make sure to bring a warm change of clothes because it can get cold at night. Said and a couple others were our guides for the desert portion. They served as our guides, photographers, chefs, and entertainers (playing berber music under the stars was pretty cool). Day 3 was spent driving to Fez, and seeing the Moroccan landscape literally change before our eyes. We made a quick stop in Azrou to feed the monkeys and checked out Ifrane before continuing on to our Riad in Fez. From the first email I sent to Hassan to our drop off by Said and Ibrahim in Fez, it was a truly professional process and the trip of a lifetime. We would highly recommend SaharaTours4x4 to anyone.Thanks again,Jon and Karissa"

During this time we wanted to go to the desert so we contacted Sahara Tours 4x4. we chose them because of the excellent reviews and the competitive prices. Communication by email before our arrival in Marrakesh was very good and rapid. They offered us a transfer service from the airport to our riad. This let us avoid the pressure of the taxi touts at the airport and the hassle of finding our riad. Hassan who was our guide offered us a really professional service. We discussed our requirements with him and he explained the differences between the tours he offered impartially. We decided to book a trip to Zagora. Hassan went out of his way to meet our needs. He was happy to tailor the trip to our requests. He is a very easy going and sociable person. He is also a great promoter of his country, proud of his culture and ready to response to your questions with enthusiasm and with a good knowledge. Although being a short trip it allowed us to see many beautiful places and amazing Maroccan landscapes full of contrast. It was a great experience to see other sides of Morocco as opposed to the hustle and bustle of Marrakesh. We were so impressed with our first tour with Sahara Tours 4x4 that we decided to take a further one day tour to Essaouira which was also fantastic. Next time we go to Morocco we would definitely book a trip to Merzouga or a circular tour around Morocco, of course through the same company. Choukrane!"

The snow blocked the pass in the Atlas Mountains, so we had to make a detour to Ouarzazate which made the driving way too long the first two days. It was frustrating but luckily, our guide Hamid was so awesome and the accommodation was fantastic that we still had a great time. He is really nice, thoughtful and helpful. We were totally spoiled. He offered us water, bought us lunch, prepared turbans for us for camel trekking which was not only practical but also made us look fabulous in photos. Moreover, he proposed taking us to the bus station in Fes to get our tickets for our trip in the next few days before dropping us off at our riad because he knew our riad was in the medina and it would be a trouble for us to get to the station. We didn't want him to work more, after all he'd been driving for about eight hours and had to drive to Marrakech right after, but he insisted. We would always remember how nice he is. Besides, Hassan, the boss is wonderful too. I'm glad I picked this tour."

The tour was the highlight of our two weeks in Morocco. Our guide, M'barek, told us on the first morning that we were not just \"visitors,\" but rather \"friends\" of Morocco. This statement personified our experience with SaharaTours4X4. Throughout our tour, M'barek was intent on providing the best experience possible. He provided deep, interesting insight on Moroccan culuture, family life, living conditions, as well as the tour sights. The ever-changing landscapes that we drove through were incredible (we have a picture of snow-capped mountains behind a foreground of palm trees). M'barek was so polite and kind - he opened the door for my wife every time we got back in the car after making a sight/picture stop. Despite the fact that the tour cost significantly less than the quotes we received from other companies, we made the same stops (and even some more) than the other companies we saw. The accomodation was very nice, including the Berber tents that we slept in under the stars in the Sahara. The restaurants we ate at served some of the best food that we encountered in Morocco.Overall, we could not have been happier with our experience. We highly recommend SaharaTours4X4 as well as M'barek as a guide."

We saw a couple other tour drivers who drove dangerously but we always felt very safe with Hammad. He always had a smile on his face and was a joy to spend time with. He gave us the option eat at a more local, less touristy restaurant in Ouarzazate, which we appreciated.The accommodations during our tour were excellent, as was the food they served.

We were wanting someone good with children ( i travelled with my partner and 2 children aged 14 and 11 years), a good driver, a comfy reliable vehicle and someone who could share their knowledge and love of morocco. Hassan provided all of these. We also needed someone flexible with the itinerary. Hassan was always ready to hear what we needed and then work out a plan for us. Hassan helped make the trip so easy and memorable. His ideas for stops and activities along the way were great and he was open to our needs as we wanted. We learned so much from Hassan as we drove along. The desert was particularly great - the dromedary experience, the dunes were quite spectacular and the Bedouin tent experience was uniquely special. ( Going down a sand dune on a camel takes a bit of getting used to!)Hassan grew up in the desert and has much to share of his experience and love for the desert. Hassan is a gentle, knowledgeable, patient and reliable guide who I would recommend to anyone wanting to take tours in morocco. We will always remember our trip with him and how we got to have a window into parts on morocco. Thank you Hassan!"

We travelled with Hassan from Marrakesh to Fes, through Ourzazate & Merzouga. Hassan is very informative and super fun throughout the journey. He sometimes didn't let my husband sleep in the car which was a good thing as the scenery of Morocco is very beautiful. Our time in the desert was even more amazing, Hassan's brother Said is an intelligent man who was very attentive to all our needs. Hassan knows the best places to stop for photos and also took us off the beaten path. There was a slight mix-up about the detail of the booking which I suspect was due to our last minute contact. I recommend that you confirm everything before the trip. However, our time with Hassan was the best and most memorable during our trip to Morocco. Thank you Hassan..."

He put us at ease from the beginning, speaking perfect English and arriving in a very comfortable landrover. We took the Quarzazate tour of the high atlas mountains since we only had one day and had a great time. If we would have had two days, we would have taken the 2 day overnight and stayed in the desert tents. First class trip."

We had friends who were also in Marrakech at the same time and went on a different tour, who warned us how bad their tour was but ours was the complete opposite. We had a very professional, friendly and attentive tour guide, Hassan with us who couldn't have been more helpful. He constantly made sure we were happy and adapted the tour to suit us. Hassan was very interesting and informative and unlike most tour guides took us to many places off the usual tourist tracks. Compared with our friends experience on a bus full of tourists we had a comfortable 4x4 vehicle to ourselves. We also stopped at many places that we wanted to along the way but never felt pressured to buy anything. We would definitely recommend this tour to our friends and anyone wanting to get out of busy Marrakech for the day. We would love to return one day and take one of Sahara 4x4 Tours out into the desert."

Our trip was made more lively by Hassan, he knows lot about Marrakech and used to explain about each region on the way to merzouga desert in detail. I being a vegetarian was bit worried about the food but Hassan took us to some quality hotels which were definitely worth the money but more than that we got good vegetarian food.We were very lucky as we had very good weather, there was no storm in the desert.

Since we were limited on time, the 3 day desert tour seemed like the best way to see a lot of the countryside. Hassan was great at communicating with us and accommodating us last minute. I wrote many tour companies and picked this one on pure instinct and I was not disappointed. Hassan met us at our hotel and assured us that everything was in place. Said, our tour guide/driver, was extremely nice and informative. He almost made driving in Morocco seem safe. The hotel was as promised and the camp in the desert awesome. We did not see another person on our way there or back. And the tagine made by our camel handler was one of, if not the, best we had in all of Morocco. I feel that Hassan and Co. were flexible and willing to make our experience as unique as we wanted. Also, when we compared prices with others who had booked similar trips with other agencies, it was clear that Sahara Tours prices were more than fair. I would definitely recommend this tour company as well as use them again."

Personalized, and better priced than the rest that started flowing in the next day. We checked TripAdvisor, and we saw nothing but good comments for Saraha 4 x 4. They are actually ranked far away from the first positions because they have few comments and opinions. Hassan is the owned and tour operator. He's got so many stories and knows his way around. Also, he's really profesional so you just relax and he will sort out any need that you may have. My wife was pregnant at the time of the journey, so he made everything possible so she would be fine. All I can say, is that the tour was by far the best experience of all Morroco. Thanks Hassan. (who speaks like 5 languages by the way!)"

He's a kind and authentic dude that does this job because he loves to share his country with travelers. The trip is a well curated journey that never feels manufactured or exploitive. I think the routes change slightly from trip to trip, but the terrain is stunning and the stops are well considered for their historical/cultural impact. Said is also always on hand with interesting bits of Moroccan history, anecdotes, local folklore and advice. One of the best parts of the trip was listening to his stories. The company is very good at communicating pre-trip, in our case we were talking directly with Said from the get go. They were able to arrange pick-up, hooked us up with veggie meals wherever we went, and thoroughly answered all of our questions about the excursion. I've heard some of these tours can be manipulative in terms of their stops and hidden charges/route changes along the way, but there's not a shred of that going on with these guys. There's really just a strong sense that they want you to enjoy yourself and have as authentic an experience as possible. Can't recommend this company enough, by far the best part of our time in Morocco. Thanks again Said."

            "review": "A trip worth a thousand and one words. This was our first time visiting Morocco and we definitely made the right choice by choosing this tour. I picked this one specifically because I didn't want a tour company that had seen so many tourists that they start to not care about taking people around their country. Where it\u2019s more a money-making business, where you are part of a big group and you will not receive any sort of bespoke individual experience. We were so lucky to have Said as our tour guide as he was a genuine and nice person, who loves his country. From the very first email Said was extremely polite and helpful, more than any other tour company I'd spoken to. We ended up travelling with just him, my husband and me. We went from Marrakech to Ait Ben Haddou, to the Todras, Atlas Mountains, several Oasis and obviously to the Sahara desert. It was still a whistle stop tour as we only had 3 days but it was definitely the way to go. Having stayed in Marrakech for 2 days I was very much ready to leave the hustle and bustle (and generally being harassed at the souks) to explore what Morocco was really about. At Ait Ben Haddou, you can ask them to organise a tour for you if you want to hear about the history and get taken around. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too expensive. We didn\u2019t because we weren\u2019t that fussed. But Said couldn\u2019t take us because only specific tour guides are allowed (stimulating the economy I guess!)Todras gorge was really lovely. There had been some rainfall so you could walk into some of the water. Really nice. It was quite busy though, but no more than the other big landmarks like Ait Ben Haddou. My favourite place was actually Skoura, one of the little Oasis on the first night. The place we stayed was run by a family business and you can really tell. It was remote, but stunning. Not at all touristy, and very authentic. The food was the best I\u2019d had in Morocco, just divine! Just as an aside, although I love tagines, you do want some change, so this was the one that stood out as it felt a little more authentic. Most of the food you\u2019ll get in Morocco (not just in the tour) is very similar \u2013 varying types of tagines, wraps or kebabs, with rice or salad. Not a huge amount of variety unless you really look for it. We loved Nomad in Marrakech, this restaurant has amazing food! The trip to the Sahara was amazing, albeit short. We set off on camel when the sun was quite low, maybe 6-7pm and then arrived at the camp by nightfall. We had dinner with a few other people on the tour, and the locals did a song and dance for half an hour or so. We then ventured out to the desert to see the stars, and although we went back to the camp around 1am, the moon was so bright you could have slept under it for sure. The temperature was perfect. However we had to leave at about 5am to catch the sunset, so thought we\u2019d better sleep in the bed. The camp was extremely clean and nice given it\u2019s in the middle of nowhere, so if you\u2019re a clean freak like me, you\u2019ll have no problems! There\u2019s good toilets and running water. You sleep in a type of metal room, which is probably ventilated but still quite warm. The beds aren\u2019t exactly comfy, quite hard really, but there\u2019s electricity and sheets, what else do you need!One thing to keep in mind if you do this tour, which they\u2019ll tell you anyway, is that it is a LOT of driving. The journey from the desert back to Marrakech was around 10 hours. And obviously getting there is the same distance but broken up, which is still hours in the car. I guess if you want to go all the way down to see these amazing places it\u2019s the only way. But if I had a choice it would have been nice if I had more time so we could spread out the drives. You can see more of my adventures and what I experienced from my pictures. All in all, what you see is what you get. The tour speaks for itself. You visit all the places on the itinerary and you\u2019re greeted with nice people and go to places that are really quite unique. On top of that, you\u2019ll be with a guide who knows a good deal about Morocco and will work hard to make sure you have a good time. We were even privileged enough to see Said\u2019s home, meet his family (they were very shy!) But an insight into how Moroccan people actually live? That is something you can\u2019t buy.Also want to point out that the value of this tour is by far the best compared to all the ones I looked at on Tripadvisor. Offers more and doesn\u2019t charge all this other random things like other companies do. One thing to keep in mind is that if you do meet people and speak to them for any service (like visiting a site and getting a brief history, or going to the toilet, or just at restaurants), generally they expect a tip. Same goes for places you eat at, just a good idea to keep change around. I would think about 10% each time, but it\u2019s at your discretion. Really enjoyed my time in Morocco, so thanks to Said and the team at Morocco Desert Trips for being so accommodating!"

My wife and I traveled to Morocco for the first time in September and decided to book a two-day private trip to the Zagora desert, as we were only staying for one week and only had limited time. Said informed us that larger tours move a bit more slowly and we would probably have more autonomy if it was only us. This trip was the absolute highlight of our entire week in Morocco. Said arranged our transportation, meals and site visits, but also engaged in very interesting conversations about the history, politics and future or Morocco while taking us off the beaten path to really experience the country.We drove through the high Atlas Mountains, stopping frequently for pictures, snacks and a bit of shopping. All of the locations he recommended were top-notch, and would have been difficult to find without him.We always felt safe, informed and engaged in the country and culture.Morocco Desert Trips took all of the guesswork out of the journey, and allowed me and my wife to relax and take in all the beautiful sites and experiences of Morocco. Said is a great guy who I feel fortunate to have met, and will definitely call up the next time we travel to the area.I only wish I had known more about what they offer before booking. These guys can pretty much tailor fit a package for you to fit your specific needs, so be sure to send them an email with what you are looking for and they can create something perfect.Said showed us a part of Morocco we never would have seen without him, and for that I am immensely grateful."

He was on time to get us at our Riad. We traveled with another couple so we got the tour cheaper. We had the 3days, 2nights tour to the desert and we didn't regret it. Despite the long travel, there were lots of coffee/toilet/picture breaks. Said showed us picturesque views along the way, occasionally stopping for some photos. He was a very good driver too. On day 1, we saw some Berber villages along the way and visited 2 very old kasbahs, where some famous films were shot. We slept at a beautiful and quiet hotel (Dar Panorama-it's small but clean with a very nice view outside) in Skoura Oasis. On day 2, we passed by valley of the Rose and Dades Valley, with breathtaking views of a village with some greens. We arrived at another hotel where we freshened up/took a shower before heading to the desert. We had a camel ride to the desert and stayed overnight at a Berber tent where there was Berber music and some Moroccan food/tea. The bed was comfortable enough at the tent. There were toilets outside. Early the next day we headed back to the hotel again (via camel) for shower and breakfast. Then back to Marrakech via Draa valley and Atlas Mountains, again a very scenic ride. Said gave us lots of interesting informations about Morocco along the way. He gladly answered our questions and brought us to good but affordable resturants. At the end of the journey Said asked us on how they can improve their service. He patiently waited until the Riad owner picked the other couple and brought us to our own Riad. He even gave us his no. so that we can call him if there was any problem during our stay in Morocco. He is like a friend you can trust when in Morocco. I highly recommend this tour if you want to see Morocco in a different non-touristy way. It's worth all the money, time and energy\u00fc"

My initial thought was to plan everything on my own (as I usually do) as this cuts down on costs and leaves us with the flexibility to do as we choose and to change plans on the fly. This has worked for us in the past and I figured that it would be ideal for Morocco.However, I did have worries about safety and security and with wanting to see more than the typical tourist sites. I corresponded with many different companies before settling on Morocco Desert Trips and in particular, Said. Said was always prompt and helpful in his replies. He was honest in his assessment of our proposed itinerary and made suggestions on how it could be more efficient. He even suggested possible ways to spend less money - I appreciated his honesty and feedback and this was ultimately why I chose him and his company.We basically spent our entire time in Morocco with him. I am skeptical by nature but our entire tour was absolutely amazing. He gained our trust almost immediately and there was never any concern about our safety or getting value out of our trip. He set up a fantastic itinerary that allowed us to visit the wonders of Fes, Marrakech, Chefchaouen, Skoura Oasis, Merzouga and camping in the desert. One thing to note with Said is that you are always in complete control of your itinerary. If you need to make revisions and slight changes on the fly, he is very accommodating. It sincerely is his goal to make you happy and to ensure that you are getting what you want out of the trip. As a result, we enjoyed an absolutely perfect week in Morocco. We got to see what we wanted to see and we never had a worry about our safety, our security and whether or not we got full value for our money. We travelled in comfort in his air-conditioned 4x4 and all of the accommodations that he booked for us was first-class. I was a little hesitant about having someone else book our accommodations without first doing some research of my own but we had absolutely no complaints. In fact, in doing some checking up after the fact, all of our accommodations were highly rated in TripAdvisor and all of the booking websites - these were places I would probably have booked on my own.I know that I am missing much, much more in this review but suffice to say, we were extremely happy with our trip and with our decision to go with Said and Morocco Desert Trips."

The 4x4 was great and had a wifi hotspot. We left and explored all the way to The Dad\u00e8s Gorges where we slept for one night in an Auberge/hotel. The next day we met our second and last guide Mustapha who brought us through Merzouga and the desert where we slept in a Berber camp.

For the last day we travelled to our final destination F\u00e8s.Overall this was a great experience, the guides are friendly and speak proper english/french/spanish/arabic (from what I've seen). Throughout the trip you visit several places where you can buy souvenirs however you are not harassed to do anything. Be prepared for a lot of traveling because it is far from main cities obviously but worth it in the comfortable 4x4. What's great about this trip is you can ask the driver to go where you want as it's a private tour. Mustapha was a very interesting guide we were with him for the most part he knows the place and was interesting to travel with. The one thing I would like to see improvement has nothing to do with the company it's about the Nomad palace which was partially in construction and offered minimal services.It was an excellent trip thanks to Morocco Desert Trips."

Due to some last minute travel glitches on my end we had to depart for the excursion a bit later than we had originally planned, and Said was super accommodating the entire time. Of course the excursion was absolutely amazing. It was so authentic compared to other proposals we received, and it ended up being one of the most beautiful parts of our trip. (Our quote was also extremely fair and reasonable compared to others for much lesser quality excursions.) My friends are still raving the experience, which is hard to even put into words. We rode camels and enjoyed traditionally-prepared tea at sunset in the middle of a stone desert with no one around for miles. It felt surreal. And they brought a few baby camels who were \"learning\" which obviously was one of the most adorable things imagineable! Don't hesitate to book with Said. He's a true professional (along with the other guides who accompanied us) who genuinely cared about making our experience amazing. He succeeded 100%!

It happens sometimes that a particular phrase, which you would hear from a complete stranger without any obvious reason would stuck in your head and would stay there as a tantrum for a long time. This is what has happened to us in the very first hour of arrival to Morocco. A lady - owner of the small hotel in Marrakesh (I understood she migrated herself to Morocco many years ago from France) told us that Morocco is like a Closed Castle (Kasbah) with quite reserved culture and traditions; and if you are lucky enough to open the doors of this Kasbah you would understand the Sole and Heart of Morocco; however if you won't succeed in doing so - you would be just wasting your time there. We've had an unbelievably wonderful trip with my wife starting with the city tour in Marrakesh, 3 day desert trip to Merzouga, and returning back to Casablanca; and for the whole journey from the very moment our plane landed in Marrakesh and till the time it took off in Casablanca, we were accompanied by Said, from Morocco Desert Trip, who helped us to break the spell and to \"open the doors of this Castle\"; not to say that the majority of stigma we had as those people who previously experienced Africa only through the National Geographic Channel eventually disappeared. Great thanks to Said and Abdul (our driver) whose help with we succeeded to open up the True Moroccan Oasis, which initially we were erroneously looking for somewhere around Scoura or in many other similarly beautiful places; we are really happy that finally we found this oasis within the hearts of simple Moroccan people..."

We did the 2 night 3 day merzouga tour with camping one night and stop over in a hotel the other night. Can't explain how amazing it was to see the inland of Morocco. Felt incredibly safe and welcome in this humble country with our driver and tour guides. Had stop in many beautiful famous locations to take pictures, eat and explore. Would 100% recommend this to anyone as it is a must see if you are heading to Morocco. The camels are gorgeous as well!!!"

We absolutely loved the tour, and would thoroughly recommend it to anyone who would like to experience the desert, visit Berber villages and enjoy the many Kasbahs and oases along the journey. The sights were stunning, food was delicious and everything was well organised from start to finish. What made the experience even more enjoyable was our exceptional guide and driver Said. He is both extremely knowledgeable and friendly, and goes out of his way to ensure you have a wonderful experience."

Said was very quick to answer all our questions about the trip before hand and we knew straight away from his swift and detailed responses that we had picked the right company.We were picked up from our Riad in Marrakech by our driver Larbi. Larbi was very friendly, forthcoming, great english and even let us put our own music on in the car. He was also a very safe driver and we felt completely at ease with him on the road. Throughout our drive Larbi would pull over so we could take pictures at various points of the amazing scenery that was encountered along the journey. Due to adverse weather conditions we were not able to take the regular route and had to to go via Midelt in order to get to the Sahara. Larbi made sure that the longer journey was broken up as much as could be and we stopped at some great places for lunch! Once we had arrived at the Sahara it was an experience that we will never forget, the camel ride to the camp is a great experience and the staff are very funny and friendly. The food at the camp was lovely and staff did there best to talk to all guests and get people involved when it came to the traditional music! Waking up to see the sunrise on top of the dunes is something definitely worth waking up for.The drive back to Marrakech was again a long one but Larbi stopped at several interesting places on the way to make the journey fly by.Overall an amazing trip and made possible by Said and his team at Morocco desert trips. If looking to book any trip or tour in Morocco then Said and his team should be the only people you use!ThanksArchie and Gina"

A trip to the Sahara is the ultimate Moroccan experience and my three day tour to Erg Chebbi with Said as our guide did not disappoint. From the very first email he was attentive and helpful. He is a wonderful, warm person and one of the things that impressed me immediately was how proud he was of his country. He is educated, speaks excellent English and is very knowledgeable in just about every subject connected to Morocco, including painstakingly trying to explain the Western Sahara to me. On a lighter note we greatly enjoyed hearing about Moroccan wedding customs, Berber history, including their alphabet and even visiting (from afar) what will eventually be one of the largest solar power stations in the world. We also appreciated the beautiful roses he bought for us in the valley of the roses. Just one of the little personal touches that made this tour special. The drive over the Atlas Mountains was breathtaking, and our two excursions into the exotic Ait Benhaddou and Taourirt Kazbahs were very educational. Everything on our tour was well organized down to the last detail and included a wonderful meal organized at the last minute with a local Berber family, who served us the best couscous in Morocco (recipe appreciated)."

Said was wonderful: our conversations touched on everything from politics to wedding customs to the history of the Berber alphabet. About five minutes after he left us in Marrakech we were already talking about how we missed him, and all of us want to come back and take a longer tour next time! The restaurants, the hotel, and the desert camp were all fantastic - we were never in places with more than four or five other tourists, and each one was interesting in its own right (for example, the hotel we stayed at had spectacular panoramic views so that we could drink tea and watch the sunset; one of the restaurants was a village cooperative serving camel tagine). One of our favourite experiences came on the final day when, since we'd been talking about our interest in Moroccan cooking, Said arranged for us to have a home-cooked meal with a local family. The food was delicious and we all felt genuinely welcomed. I'd expected a booked tour, even an excellent one, to feel 'touristy', but Said made everything feel like a road trip with friends. I can't recommend this trip highly enough!"

After browsing through different web pages of companies that organize different tours, I came across \"Morocco Desert Trips\". After reading through the reviews on Trip Advisor I thought to give it a go and write an e-mail to Said asking about different tours and hopefully receiving some important information about how to make our stay memorable.I didn't had to wait long and I already received my first mail from Said. After that I think we exchanged a few dozen mails because of the the \"few\" questions I had. For every mail that I wrote I received a response very quickly. It did not take to long before I decided that Moroccan Desert Trips would be ideal for us. So here it goes:We booked the following tours with Said:Two day, one night desert tourHalf day Marrakech tourTransfer from Marrakech to CasablancaAs you can see we pretty much relied on Said almost our whole stay in Morocco and I have to say that it was the best thing we could do!First we started with the half day tour in Marrakech. In the morning a man named Kamal came to pick us up. I did not know then that Kamal was one of the best drivers we ever had on our tours. Simply put he was friendly, forthcoming, patient with a great English and a good sense of humor. He was also our personal Dj and put on some nice tunes for the road!! I want to add that he is also a professional driver and we were never afraid with him on the road.We have seen many things in half a day but the tour was not rushed at all. After having one day off we started the 2 day desert tour. Fortunately we had again Kamal as our driver. We already knew from the start that it will be great. In the meantime I was always in contact with Said through e-mail so if we had any questions he was also there for us.After a few hours into the tour we had a nice surprise of meeting Said as he was also driving another couple who booked the same tour. After that almost every time we had our break we got the chance to sit down and have a talk. Said is a great person, very friendly and helpful so it was a great pleasure to also meet him in person.Of course, the two day tour went great and we had absolutely nothing to complain about!We can say that having booked the two tours and the transfer with Said, we could not be happier about the professional service we received!All in one I have to say that I would encourage everybody traveling to Morocco who is searching for a trustworthy and professional company to contact Said. After the first mail you will most probably feel at ease and book a tour with him!! ;)Thank you Said and Kamal for the great and unforgettable Moroccan experience you gave us!!!!Regards,Ervin"

            "review": "Perfect. Before coming to Morocco we thought long and hard with which company we should book our 1 night/ 2 days trip to the desert. Based on reviews we chose to contact Said and \"Morocco Desert Trips\" for this purpose. Now after going with Kamal, our driver, to this trip I consider that the reviews don't do them justice. The trip was perfect; Not amazing, not good or other attributes - it was simply perfect. Said was very easy to talk to and very friendly. After he arranged the tour he also suggested a half day tour in Marrakech which we also accepted and also helped us with the transfer from Marrakech to Casablanca. Lets go on to the half day tour:Our driver, Kamal, found our address, picked us up without delay and showed us what was most important in Marrakech. Although unplanned he gladly gave us some time to have breakfast, took us to the best spices shop and much much more. When we asked where we could find a supermarket to buy water and some beers we thought he would show us the place on the map - we could not have been more wrong. He drove us there, waited until we finished buying things and helped us carry them!Not to mention the fact that Kamal had to pick us up at 8:30 am for the desert trip but we arranged with him to start at 7:30am in order for us to get \"a breakfast with a view\"Now, for the fun part:2 days later after we met Kamal, he again picked us up and we started our journey to the desert. As promised he drove us to a place to have breakfast which was at least breath taking. You would expect to pay at least 50% more for food when you book a tour because of the deals that the guides have with restaurants right? Well WRONG! Amazing food, amazing coffee and breathtaking view at a decent price - even low compared to other places. During the whole trip Kamal answered our questions, told us facts about everything in Morocco, was our personal DJ and drove at his best because one of us was car sick. I'm not going to go on about the views and landscapes because it would be to much but I am going to say this: Kamal managed to keep us on track time wise whilst stopping at every beautiful thing so we can take some photos and learn something new. The desert itself was beautiful, the camp and people there very nice, the food and tea were awesome and the music was authentic. After our night there, Kamal gave us the bad news: because of the rain, a bridge in the Atlas mountains (our only way back) collapsed. That meant we had to go to Agadir first and then to Marrakech to literally go around the mountains. The way back was awesome. We saw new places, ate BBQ goat and beef and had the most amazing time!I can go on and on about this trip but I don't want to spoil it for you.To sum it up I will say this:1. It was easy to organise and very fun to take part of2. Kamal and Said are amazing people3. Our trip wouldn't have been the same without themIf you decide to visit Morocco I most definitely encourage you to contact Morocco Desert Trips for the perfect holiday!"

            "review": "Mostly good but with some problems. We booked the 3 day, 2 night trip to Merzouga from Marrakech by e-mail with Said. As others have mentioned the communication was clear and efficient. Kamal was our guide and was very helpful, knowledgeable and kind, especially given that I was unwell during most of the trip (travel sickness on the first day crossing the Atlas and upset stomach for the remainder of the trip). It was great to see such diverse, beautiful landscapes and get to know Morocco better. Also we enjoyed lots of the shops we stopped at (such as in the Valley of Roses where we bought rose cosmetics and in Merzouga where we bought scarves and spices). We were lucky to experience a snow storm on the return journey to Marrakech which completely transformed the landscapes and gave us a different view of the Tichka and the Atlas mountains.Unfortunately there were a few issues with some of the trip:-The restaurant we visited on the first day for lunch (L\u2019Oasis D\u2019Or in Ait Ben Haddou) was a total tourist trap-poor quality, overpriced food, very limited menu and terrible service. We were not given a choice about where to eat and I think that people doing the tour should be given the option to choose where to eat. The restaurant we had lunch at on the last day (Cafe Almanadir) was also distinctly average, at best. -Before visiting the desert we were brought to a shop to buy scarves for the desert to protect us from the sand. It's not a big deal but this was a separate expense that should maybe be mentioned when booking.-The desert was, overall, a disappointing experience. Firstly the guide who took us into the desert on the camels spent almost the entire 1 hour trip on his mobile phone. He completely ignored us and we got a very bad vibe from him overall. The camp itself was a disappointment also, mainly because there was no music provided (as described on the website- \"amazing Berber music show\"). When we mentioned this to Said he told us that we should have requested this ourselves in the camp- this was never mentioned to us by Kamal or Said at any point so it is an unacceptable excuse. We were really very disappointed about this. -The guide spoke to us only after the 1 hour trip back to the hotel the next day when he stopped us before getting there, made us get off the camels and proceeded to try to sell us some (vastly overpriced) soap dishes/other handicrafts. At the hotel where we had to shower in the morning after the desert unfortunately the showers available in the little outhouse were not working- one was completely broken and the other had only scalding hot water so we had to travel 650km back to Marrakech without showering.Despite the above there were also some highlights such as the Dar Panorama hotel in Skoura which was very calm, clean, friendly and welcoming. The food for dinner there was also very good. The restaurant where we had lunch in Erfoud (Cafe-Restaurant des Dunes) was great- surprisingly tasty food with reasonable prices. Overall we enjoyed the trip but would recommend that certain aspects be revised, especially the restaurants visited and the camp/guides used."

The Sahara trip is one of the most important reason for us decide to go to Morocco. I have been asked around 5 companies, with different reasons I was not satisfied, then I found Said through Trip Adviser. Because the reviews about him and this company was really good, so I sent Said an email, we started contact, Said was not just friendly with patient. But mostly importantly he gives very good suggestions also options which not in the point of view as businessman but friend. I have never been to Morocco so had lots of questions, I believe before we arrival Marrakesh, he have replied me at least ten emails with all my necessary and unnecessary questions.The day we arrival Marrakesh, Said came with us for a half day City Tour, he was very on time, and we did enjoy Marrakesh so much even the time was limited, but he really tried to let us have the most of it. Also he explained us the whole plan for the following day Sahara trip. The Sahara trip started really nice, because one of our friend normally have car sick, we thought with mountain way will be really difficult for her, but Said\u2019s driving skill was really good, so my friend was absolutely fine for the driving trip. Everything for Sahara trip was perfect, we reached on time for sunset, was beautiful , we have been treat really nice, and enjoy the night spent in Sahara.

As we passed by his family home, we stopped in to have tea with his mother and see how rural Moroccans live. After I showed an interest in their farming, he arranged a friend of his to guide us around the fruit groves and small holdings. Best of all, after discovering I had arranged the night's stay in the dessert to fall on my birthday. He traveled through the dessert in the dark to surprise me with a birthday cake! That really was a fantastic night, celebrating in the tranquil dessert with friendly strangers, dancing to traditional music.For all of this, he expected no more than the originally agreed, very reasonable price. Said really does believe in delivering exceptional service.Throughout the trip we felt safe and achieved everything we had set out to do and more. I would definitely recommend this company, and Said, to fellow travelers."

            "review": "Once in a lifetime desert trip. My boyfriend and I took our first trip to Morocco for seven days and wanted to have a desert experience. We emailed MDT and they got back to us straight away with recommendations and options to suit. We chose to go to Zagora for a two day, one night trip with a camel trek to the edge of the desert and overnight stay in a Berber camp. From the outset the guide was extremely friendly and professional, advising us of exactly what to expect all the way. He was an excellent and safe driver, had a modern 4x4 (it was just the two of us and him on the trip), which I was relieved about as the drive over the Atlas Mountains is very windy. While the trip to Zagora and back is a long drive (8 hours each way), we didn't notice it so much as the guide had so much knowledge about the region and culture to share. He also stopped for photos and coffee, and lunch. We were very lucky to be taken to his house to meet his family on the way home. To see inside a local family's home was a real treat. We're very grateful. But most of all, the guide was very punctual as we needed to be at Zagora by a certain time to make the camel trek to the desert before sunset. The timing was perfect. He left us with a Berber guide who led us for just over an hour to a desert Berber camp. The sun was setting as we made the trek and it was magical. Other people doing a similar tour arrived to the camp late and had to make the trek when it was dark which wouldn't have been a great experience. At the camp we had a private tent, lots of blankets, our Berber hosts were very friendly (we weren't sure what to expect), they speak 3-4 languages. They cooked us a wonderful turkey tagine, we drunk tea (whiskey of the desert) and sat around the campfire beating drums. The sleep in the desert was strangely quiet except for the moaning of the camels! The camels are all beautiful, well looked after and the Berber people clearly have great respect for their animals. For sunrise we made the trek back out to meet our guide and stopped at various places on our way back. We got back to Marrakech about 7pm. It was a long day driving, but worth it. Because of all the knowledge of our guide, we felt much more able to understand Moroccan customs for the rest of our trip - tricks of the trade etc. Tips: tip the Berber guides at the camp, try to learn some Berber/Arabic, don't give money to the Berber children when your guide drops you off, get to Zagora before sunset, take warm clothes."

Said was very helpful and accommodating and helped to arrange the trip for us at the last minute via email.Said collected us from our Riad and we were driven in his 4x4 to Agafay. We then went on a camel ride across what are like sand dunes and the view is amazing! There is nothing for miles and it's so peaceful and serene. I was a bit worried that the camels would be tired (carrying us for a whole hour) and at one point mine starting to veer off in the wrong direction when he saw the hill he was going to have to climb! But the man who owns them and guided them across the sand dunes with us was kind to them and I think they are well cared for, so it put my mind at rest.We then arrived at a spot at the top of a 'sand dune', where Said and his colleague had set up an area for us to watch the sunset with Saffron Tea and Dates. It was beautiful!We relaxed for a while and then drove back. I had asked Said if we could see the stars and he did try and stop at a spot for us to view them, but unfortunately the moon was too bright at the time. We then asked if he could drive us past the New Town (newer part of Marrakesh) and he drove us there on the way back to our Riad so we could see the shops and Casino etc. Very helpful and accommodating!We are now considering going on a tour with Said to the Sahara in the future.The trip is a little expensive compared to some offers but it is worth it as the experience is private and a lot of effort is put in by Said to make sure you are comfortable and happy."

First of, Said was very efficient in getting back on my emails and ensuring the booking was made with all the correct details. We were taken on the tour by Kamal, who is an absolutely lovely guy with very good knowledge of the county and great driving skills. He took us through the Atlas mountains and into the desert, all the while being open to anwering any questions we had and stopping for photos. We were taken to nice restaurants for lunch on the way, and the oasis we spent the first night at was absolutely charming, with Ahmed (the host at the oasis accommodation) being one of the nicest people we met on the tour. The dinner that night was superb, to say the least. The next day was the camel trek into the desert, with the night spent at the camp in Merzouga, the views of the sand dunes were wonderful. The Berbers who were hosts at the camp were very friendly and cooked us a lovely tagine for dinner.We did not know what to expect when we booked the tour, but I will say that we were not disappointed. Would recommend Said's company 100% for anyone looking to book a tour/excursion.. It's a great way to see the countryside and get a taste of the desert. Our guide Kamal looked after us until the last possible moment when he dropped us off to our riad in Marrakech at the end of the trip - a huge thanks to him. I will say that it's not cheap, but it's definitely worth every penny for the overall quality if you're looking to do a tour like this.We look forward to coming back to Morocco!"

My husband and I were up at sunrise on January 1st to drive through the Atlas Mountains; by lunchtime, we were enjoying a terrific feast with a mind-blowing overlook of the desert oasis; a few hours later, we were riding camels through the desert witnessing one of the most incredible sunsets I've ever seen in my life to the Berber camp where we would spend the night. We spent the first night of the new year huddled around a fire staring at the most incredible expanse of stars we have ever seen in our city-dwelling lives -- an absolutely unforgettable moment. The Berbers we met were so friendly, funny, and charming -- as were the other tourists staying at the camp with us. We made genuine new friends for life. For all of this, we are incredibly grateful to Said. We booked an overnight tour of the Zagora with Said after our previous booking fell through -- and I couldn't be more pleased that we ended up with Said. Our tour with Said was cheaper and included more than the previous tour had. Said was extremely quick in responding to my inquiries. Our driver Kamal was so friendly, helpful, informative, and cheerful -- not to mention an absolutely top-notch, fantastic driver! We had such a terrific and enjoyable experience with him. Said's trips are 1,000% worth the money, and I would recommend Said without hesitation. We have not a single complaint, just extreme enthusiasm for our wonderful experience. We left Morocco incredibly eager to come back and explore more of the country, and we will undoubtedly use Said's company for all our future adventures. If you're on the fence about companies, choose this one for an absolutely incredible, unforgettable, remarkable experience!"

From when we first made contact with Said to when we were shaking his hand goodbye, we had a wonderful experience--we took a three day desert trip (we should have gone for longer--Said did try to warn us!) and a half day tour of Marrakesh. I wouldn't have learned a quarter of the things I discovered about Morocco if it weren't for Said's willingness to answer my constant questions about the way of life and culture of the places we visited (as a former philosophy teacher he has a wealth of knowledge and endless patience). We're sure we saw some attractions off the beaten track that most tour companies would not have taken us too (would every tour guide climb date palms to throw to you the best, ripest fruits?), and everywhere we went we felt like Said ensured we were well taken care of--he clearly chooses his partner businesses discerningly. After three days on the road, we even had the honour of meeting his family and having his mother's cous cous for lunch! If we ever go back to Morocco, we'll definitely look Said up again--we can't recommend him enough if you want a private/small group tour of this amazing land."

From the very beginning when booking this tour, Said went out of his way to ensure we got the trip we wanted and the best value for our time. We wanted to do 2 day desert trip and our time in Morocco was limited, and Said was very honest about how far into the desert we would get within 2 days, leading us to decide perhaps a mountain day trip would work better for our schedule. His honesty and dedication to giving us the best tailor made experience for our time was very impressive and the reason I chose to tour with them. The day trip was seamlessly organised and tailored to us, Said arrived perfectly on time as promised, despite our riad being new and difficult to find. His knowledge of marrakech and Morocco is vast and his english incredible. e learnt so much from this philosophy graduate about his country that he is so passionate about, it was incredible to learn from him, one of the highlights of our tour. We drove to three different valleys in the Atlas mountains during the tour, visiting a berber house, argan oil producer (at my request), a small farmers market and the Ourika valley waterfall. We stopped off for photos whenever we liked, despite being grey and overcast with a forecast of rain and storms, the views were spectacular and the smell of pine and fresh apples will stay with me forever. Though sometimes I am nervous passenger in steep mountain roads, Said is an excellent driver and his car so comfortable and well maintained that I never felt anxious once. Even though it was a long drive with lots of ground to cover in one day, the stops were frequent enough that it never felt too much, and we had a great walk up the waterfall in the middle of the day, perfect to build an appetite for lunch. Said has gotten these tours down to a fine art and was always charming, patient and ready to answer any question we had. I would not hesitate to book another tour when I return ext time and look forward to learning more from this well educated, passionate tour guide. Many thanks again Said!"

Morocco Desert Tours is well-run and a great value. Based on tripadvisor reviews we booked a three day private desert tour from Morocco not really knowing what to expect. From the start Said was quick to respond and lay out our options. He met with us at our riad in Marrekech prior to our tour to go through the agenda, to answer any last minute questions and to collect payment for the tour. He has a number of drivers that he uses. Our tour guide was Larbi. Larbi is a nice, friendly, chill, professional man who speaks great English (as well as many other languages). He picked us up at our riad and drove us over the Atlas Mountains to Ait Ben Haddou and then on to Skoura - stopping at various places along the way for pictures and lunch and other interesting places and kasbahs. The valley on the southern side of the High Atlas is a magical desert dotted with beautiful oases. Skoura is the best thing ever. The next day we headed to Erg Chebbi, stopping at the Todra Gorge and other interesting sights along the way. In Erg Chebbi we road camels for an hour across the dunes of the Sahara and then camped under the stars in a comfortable tent with a mattress. On the final day we trekked back to town and then drove through a savannah landscape back to our riad in Marrekech. Larbi was a great guide. He was very flexible and happy to make any stops that we liked. All of our accommodations were arranged by the company, including breakfasts and dinner and were included in our fee. Fees for admission to points of interest and lunch during the day were additional (though not expensive) so bring some cash (Larbi pulled over for us to get some more cash from an ATM at one point). All in all I give MDT 5 stars and recommend then without any reservation. They are flexible and can customize the tours to fit your preferences/schedule. Thank you Said and Larbi!"

I must admit we had been expecting he would be our actual tour guide for our three days and were a bit disappointed only because that had been our expectation, however, it turned out fine and we did get to have Said for a further 1/2 day tour of Marrakech after we returned that we booked on the spur of the moment. He went out of his way to make that happen for my daughter and I. Said's customer service is outstanding. The actual desert trek we did was three days; we were met right on time on the first day of the tour at our Riad by Larabi - he was very professional, quiet, but helpful whenever we needed it. He answered all our questions and was very good at making sure we knew what the plan was for each day, and where and when we would be stopping etc. The Riad they chose for us to stay at the night before we headed into the desert was lovely and very welcoming. Our guide, Omar, who took us on camels, into the Desert for the night was fantastic - he made that part of the trip really enjoyable. Riding camels was definitely an interesting experience as was sleeping in the desert - a definite must do once in one's lifetime. We highly recommend it!

I had lots of email communication with Said and he offered us some great advice which helped us decide which tours to take in the time we had available. As well as airport transfers, which were fantastic, we did two tours with Morocco Desert Trips. The first trip was the 3 day 2 night tour to Merzouga (the Sahara). We really enjoyed the two day drive to the desert which included driving through the Atlas Mountains, Berber Villages and visiting the Ait Bed Hadou Kaspah amongst other sites. Our driver Mohamed was great and stopped for photo opportunities and was able to tell us lots about Berber life in the villages. The B&B we stayed in on the first night was a real treat, it was very traditional and the hosts were extremely welcoming - highly recommend it! I became quite ill with a dodgy stomach and after several emergency stops in less than an hour Mohamed was very good and brought me to a pharmacy, translated for me and seen to it that I remained hydrated. He insisted I ate only rice for my meals that day and this was just what i needed, I could not thank Mohamed enough for the amazing care he showed me. The camel ride to the desert was a real experience and a must; prepare yourself for a sore bum! The desert is something that everyone should see and experience. We saw the stars before it got too cloudy but unfortunately we could not watch the sunset as it was still cloudy in the morning; this did not stop us climbing a massive sand dune and running around in the dunes at 6.30am in the morning. The nomad camp we stayed in was a little disappointing as we were the only people at the camp and it was really lacking in atmosphere. The trip is sold with dinner, traditional music and dancing which was not what we got at our camp. We had dinner which was wonderful and then we were walked over to a neighbouring camp for 20 minutes for the music and dancing. This was nice but we did feel very left out as this camp was full to bursting everyone had gotten to know each other there so we felt very much like we were tagging on. This definitely had a negative impact on our desert trip and I would recommend you ask Said to book you into a bust camp if you are going. There is not much to do in the desert without the music and dancing! The final day travelling back to Marrakech is a long days driving (around 10 hours) but these are the sacrifices you have to make.Do also note that there are charges for tours/entry at all the stops along the way to the desert. This came as a shock to us as there was not prior mention of it. be careful not to overpay as some tour guides certainly took advantage of us.We also went on a one day trip to Essaouira with this company. Our driver Larbi was EXCELLENT! His English was fantastic and he taught us lots about the various places we passed on the way to the coast! Essaouira has a beautiful fishing port, beach and medina and is definitely worth a day trip. While there you must go to the fish market and have your fish grilled for you while you wait....I have never tasted fish with such flavour!!These tours are fantastic, they are really well organised and the drivers always come on time. Morocco Desert Trips is a professionally run company and goes over and above for it's clients. I highly recommend them."

We booked an all day tour to the Atlas Mountain as well as the Half-Day tour in Marrakech. In short, touring with this company was a wonderful experience! I communicated with Said via email prior to the trip (about 3 months in advance) to arrange the tour and iron out any details. Said was very responsive and helpful through email and described what we should expect, where we would visit, as well as any pricing for the tours. No monetary transactions were done online and everything was taken care of in person when meeting with our guide. Upon our arrival we communicated with Said and met with our great guide, Larbi! Larbi's English is great, my family and I felt very safe with his driving, and he was extremely attentive throughout the tours. When visiting the Atlas mountains it was clear that he knew the area well and was able to show us beautiful locations for photo opportunities! For lunch he took us atop a mountain with the help of a local guide onto the home of a Berber family who welcomed us with a delicious home-made meal, which we enjoyed with an amazing view. It was truly an unforgettable experience for the 5 of us!The next day, during our Marrakech day tour, Larbi met with us at our Riad once again to begin our private-vehicle (similar to Atlas mountains) tour of the city. It was another fun-filled day with Larbi as he showed us the Bahia and Badii Palaces, Medina wall, short tour of the new city, and Majorel Garden (breathtaking!). We also visited the Palmerie, and had the opportunity of dressing up in traditional clothing to have a half an hour camel ride around the Palmerie. Larbi clearly had great relationships with all the local guides who helped us, and we received excellent service wherever we visited. Both nights for dinner, Larbi made reservations to excellent, prestigious restaurants, where the food was absolutely fresh and delectable. We truly got a taste of the traditional Moroccan cuisine, thanks to this tour! Our 2nd day of the tour, we asked Larbi if he would recommend a restaurant where we'd experience a belly-dancing show, and not surprisingly, he did not disappoint! The tours with the help of Said and Larbi, was by far one of the best experiences we had during our 10 day trip around Morocco. Said and Larbi, thank you for making us feel welcome from the very beginning. We truly appreciate all your attentiveness, friendliness, and knowledge during our tours. It wouldn't have been the same without your help--you made this trip very worthwhile and if given the chance, we would definitely choose your company again! Forever grateful!! Cheers from New York!"

There were four of us, (me, my wife and our two sons 11 and 13). We took the 4 day 3 night tour and Larbi was our chauffeur/guide. Larbi had very good English, was very interactive with our boys (and especially helpful when our youngest fell after lunch one day and had glass stuck in his arm), was responsive to all of our questions and seemed to enjoy his job.Probably the best part of the trip was the locations they picked for us to stay\u2026.some very out of the way, interesting places with excellent views and to a person the places they chose were staffed by happy, friendly people. They clearly have very strong relationships that they have built up over time with the local vendors. Some of the roads Larbi took to get us where we wanted to go would never be found by a tourist driving on his own (but absolutely safe). His local knowledge and rapport with everyone provided us with an \u201cin\u201d everywhere we went.Our time overnight in the desert is one our family will remember forever; this is a must do. These four days showed us more of Morocco than we could ever see on our own. The enjoyment, sights and value for money were excellent. I highly recommend them."

Well what to say, i was very happy with the trips Said had organized for us, the first day we went around th Souk here in the Medina, we went to some spices cooperative and a carpet one too, it was a lovely day exploring this beautiful place, on the second day we had, again an amazing day, we went up to Oulrika vallee, we visited the waterfalls, rode a camel, had lunch on the river bank, went to a barber house for tea and saw an amazing sunset, we were picked up at 9am and though the trip was supposed to finish at around 5pm we didnt arrive back at the hotel till around 8pm, we were not rushed and even stopped at a few spots we saw on the way, such a great day! Then on the next day we went to the dessert not too far from here, we got to climb a mountain and see the most breathtaking views, then we drove in the 4x4 to another spot in the dessert to watch the sunset, Said and his two colleagues brought cookies and made tea for us while we watched the amazing sunset in the dessert. Ive really enjoyed my trip and Said has made it even better. Thank you. I highly recommend these trips!"

Said took our rather large group in two 4x4's on an adventure into the Agafay Desert the eve before Ramadam started... The journey itself was an adventure zooming through the desert up and down at times rather hairy inclines/declines, but at no time did we feel unsafe at all, or in any danger, it was fun. We stopped off on the journey for some of the party to climb this rather step hill where breathtaking views were to be had.. A couple of men came by on their donkeys, on the way to their very remote hamlet in the middle of the Agafay Desert. We then arrived at a flat plateau where carpets were laid out, a fire built and moroccan tea brewed, lovely morrocan nibbles and cakes were served while we watched the most magical sunset in the peaceful silent desert. Wow!!! Said is the best guide, so natural and comfortable doing his job, he felt like part of our family. Can't recommend him and his tours enough."

Following an outing to the Ourika Valley with him, we opted to visit the Agafay desert to watch the sunset two evenings later with Said also.As a guide he is well-informed and speaks good english (one of 5 languages he speaks) and no question is too much trouble.We were collected from our Ryad in the medina at 5:30pm as promised, and driven in 2 comfortable, modern, AC 4X4 into the desert. Driving over the rough terrain was so much fun. And on arrival to the ideal spot to watch the sunset, Said, Larbi and Abdul set up a seating area and built a small fire. they provided us with delicious snacks and fresh saffron tea. It's most certainly an experience none of us will forget. We all had plenty of laughs, including the guides who kept interaction throughout the trip. If you're looking for a great, trustworthy, knowledgeable guide for Marrakech and indeed the rest of Morocco (he has far flung tour options), don't look any further.We will see you again when we come back to this beautiful country!"

As a family party of 10 we opted for a day trip to the Ourika Valley and were so pleased that we chose Morocco Desert Trips for this adventure. Said picked us up promptly at 9.0am from our Ryad in a very comfortable air conditioned Mercedes Mini Bus with separate driver, leaving Said free to provide us with a very informative and interesting commentary on every aspect of our experience - in very good English I should add. Apparently before guiding tourists he was a teacher. We had a really full day which included a camel ride, a visit to an Argan Oil Co-operative, the Monday Berber market which was amazing and a real eye opener, lunch in a great location on the riverside, a trek to the famous waterfalls, finishing on the way back to Marrakech with tea in a typical Berber family home. We were not hurried at all and although originally expecting to return by about 5.0pm we didn\u2019t actually get back to our Ryad till after 8.0pm. We\u2019d thoroughly recommend Said who was great and for whom nothing was too much trouble. What a wonderful time we had and what a different world we all experienced that day."

Though he had become a father just a week before our trip, on our insistence he ensured that he was our guide for the trip. He took us through a different route to the desert and a differentr route on the way back to Marrakech. Hence we were able to cover different parts of Southern Mexico. He let us spend time at leisure at the various fascinating stops on the way. He was great with my kids. He took us to visit his family home & took us around to see his cattle & farms. It was like being with a family member.My husband fell sick during the trip & Said was very helpful with helping out. I would highly recommend making this trip with this company. Everything was taken care of so well..The Hotels we stayed at each night were fantastic picks.Thanks Said for a great holiday.Smitha"

We set off early in the morning. Kamal picked us up from our hostel and was very patient while we finished up breakfast. On our first day we visited the High Atlas mountains. We stopped to view a local Argan oil cooperative. Kamal was very knowledgeable of the best sights to stop at and take pictures and to tour. We visited the famous Kasbah where they filmed part of the Gladiator. Kamal arranged for us to have personal tour of the Kasbah by a local resident. We ended our first night at the Skoura oasis at a magnificent hotel that clean and full of charm. The second day Kamal took us to the Gorge's where we took amazing pictures. Kamal always has surprises and along the way to the desert we stopped at several places for pictures and tours. We later arrived at hotel that is right outside the Dunes where we would be camping for the night with local Berber residents. We rode camels to the campsite. We spent the night eating traditional Berber and listen to Berber music. We woke up early the next day to catch the sunrise and headed back to the hotel. Kamal was there to great us and got us on our way. We thought this was the end of the trip but Kamal took us to a local village to listen to Gnawa music. We stopped at another oasis and took in other sights in the way back to Marrakesh. We had a great time with Kamal. He was excellent and went the extra mile to ensure we enjoyed our trip. We highly recommend Kamal and Morocco Desert Trips!!"

We were only in Morocco for 3 days, so a day tour to get in as many sites/attractions as possible was a must! I checked out the day tours at Morocco Desert Trips and instantly discovered countless rave reviews on not only this company, but on one tour guide, Said, in particular. I immediately made contact with him and was glad that I did. From the very first point of contact to the final second of the tour, Said did NOT disappoint! His professionalism, his wealth of knowledge, his amazingly down-to-earth and friendly attitude and his willingness to make our tour as comfortable and enjoyable as possible all made for an unforgettable trip! Said was a gentleman in every way and even accommodated a last-minute request to change a minor portion of our tour. We went to the Agafay desert (definitely FUN times in his 4x4 up steep sand dunes!) where we also saw a movie being filmed, we had lunch at the stunningly beautiful Lake Lalla Takerkoust, drove through the lush and breathtaking scenery of the Atlas mountains and Plateau du Kik, drank tea at the home of a charming local Berber family, visited Argan oil cooperative, and Said was even kind enough to squeeze in a bit of the Medina for us to view because we would have left the following day without seeing it. And all this at a price of 40 euros per person was unbeatable! We definitely recommend Morocco Desert Trips to anyone wanting an EXCELLENT experience - whether short or long stay - in Morocco! Don't forget to ask for Said! :))"

We were offered an airport pickup and transportation to our Riad, which was great as we arrived late in the evening and Marrakech was a little overwhelming at first. From the very beginning our guide was very welcoming and informative as we drove towards the medina. Not to mention his great sense of humour automatically putting us at ease!Although there were weather issues that caused complications with our plans Said did his up most to tailor our tour in order to give us the best possible experience. Each and every place we stayed in was friendly, beautiful and provided amazing homemade Moroccan dishes. Our favourite Raid was in Skora, the food was amazing, the view was breath taking and the hospitality of the owners made us feel right at home. Another obvious highlight was the overnight stay in the desert. The sunset and sunrise camel trek was a unique and beautiful experience, as well as sandboarding under the stars! All in all our Moroccan experience was absolutely amazing and this wouldn't have been possible without the help our of guide. Always friendly, striving to better our trip and giving a great insight not only into the way people live, but also the history and politics of Morocco."

Fun, relaxing trip that gave us a chance to get outside Marrakech and see some of Morocco\u2019s beautiful countryside.Said was a great guide, communication before the trip was very good, he took time to answer all the questions we had (including questions about whether their would be vegetarian food available) and gave us a detailed itinerary of what the day would include.On the day itself, Said met us at our hotel and drove us out to Ourika valley, stopping off along the way to visit an Aegean Oil producer and to cross a rope bridge. He stopped the car for photos of the Atlas Mountains whenever we asked him to and we both enjoyed the drive, he gave us lots of information about Moroccan life and made sure we were happy throughout trip. Once we reached the valley we were introduced to the local Berber guide (the cost of which was included in the fee) and he took us hiking up a waterfall. On the way we were able to stop and look at all the beautiful things created by local artisans.After the hike we had a Moroccan lunch, which wasn't the best meal we had in Marrakech but was fine, it's worth asking Said beforehand if you have particular special dietary requirements. We were then being driven back to Marrakech with a short stop off at a traditional Berber house overlooking the valley. The day lasted 8 hours and was an truly unforgettable experience.A few tips if you're taking the tour, wear comfortable shoes with good grip for the walk up the waterfall and bring a big bottle of water as it can be difficult to pick some up along the way, all costs are included in the tour fee but we did feel a bit of pressure to spend money from the local merchants - if you want to avoid that then maybe mention it to him before you set off."

My wife and I were on our honeymoon in Marrakesh in April this year and were keen to get the balance of a chilled holiday following the excitement and stresses of a wedding. We opted for a day trip to the Atlas mountains as one of our excursions - and were extremely glad that we did! Our guide Said was absolutely superb. As well as being extremely knowledgable about the area and the people, he was exceptionally engaging and personable. He was also very much on his guests' side when it came to visiting tourist attractions - he has a policy that if he finds out a shop or attraction has charged his guests too much, he will not take guests there in the future. When a passing tradesman stopped on his moped to sell us fossils - Said spoke with him and told him that he 'does not bring tourists up to the mountains - only friends' and that he would only accept a fair price from him. Trained in philosophy, Said is a real gentleman and his top priority on an excursion (and it seems in life) is that his guests enjoy themselves and take away a positive experience of his beautiful country. I can categorically say that both my wife and I did - thanks to him. The day trip itself is ideal for those who are not staying in Marrakesh for too long (we were only 7 days). It was only a couple of hours drive to get up into the mountains. It is not a strenous day and you are in the vehicle taking in the sites for much of it (and they are stunning sites!) but there are plenty of opportunities to get out and the trip takes you through authentic, old settlements - with time to peruse around. The day culminates in a late lunch at a great cafe with stunning views over the river - followed by a small excursion up to a couple of waterfalls (about an hour and a half trek up and down). We found that it gave us a real flavour for the area and a desire to go back for more (hopefully in the future we will go back to do some proper trekking in the mountains). We booked Said in person - as he was driving us into Marrakesh from our hotel (the highly recommended Sirayane Boutique Hotel) as part of their free shuttle bus service - but you can book him directly through http://www.moroccodeserttrips.com/ One things for sure - when we do make it back, we will be in touch with him to go on one of his longer trips!!"

My wife and I booked a tour to the Atlas Mountains and were welcomed by Said (pronounced, Sayeed), who is the best tour guide I have ever had - full stop!This gentleman speaks several languages (very good English), and is very knowledgeable about his country. We recommended Said to another couple we had met at our Hotel, and I can see by what they have written - they enjoyed their tour.My wife and I plan to return to Morocco to do a more extensive tour, and would love to have Said guide us.If you are interested in Berber rugs, pottery, and other pieces of art, you will have the opportunity to purchase them whilst on the Atlas mountain tour. By the way - the prices are very reasonable!"

Our guide Said (who just happens to speak 5 languages and did philosophy at university!) arranged the day with a fascinating tour of a traditional Berbere house, short camel (dromedary) ride (with two guys who were brilliant with my son and dressed him in Touraeg clothes) and a quick tour of an Argan Oil co-operative. He also booked a fantastic guide who took us to the main Ourika valley waterfall and then up a sheer rock face (via a rock ladder) to an amazing little cafe high above where 90% of the other tourists turn back! A must do! Bonne courage pour la marriage! A+O"

When we arrived we had started talking to another couple staying at the hotel, they recommended us to do the Atlas mountain day tour and to do it with Said. We were not disappointed he picked us up at 9.15am in a private car and we made our way to the mountains. He was very good at explaining everything about morocco that we had to ask. He even stopped off a few times on the way for us to look in some local side stalls. When we arrived an hour later firstly at the place where they make the famous argan oil we had a small tour around and had the opportunity to buy some oils and spices. We then carried on making our way up the mountains. We arrived and started our walk up the mountains with a separate tour guide. It was beautiful! I would say take some comfy shoes as the rocks are a bit big to climb and it's uphill but the views are beautiful. Once we got to the top there was an amazing waterfall, a good opportunity to take some pics. We made our way down and stopped to have lunch on a roof top terrace over looking the river and mountains. Then made our way to a local Berbers house to see how they live. Defiantly an eye opener. We then made our way to Marrakech while Said told us more about the local people and the beautiful country of Morocco. I would recommend this tour if your staying in Marrakech for a short while as it's not too long and defiantly a tour to remember. Don't forget to ask for Said! He was very professional and friendly."

More importantly, instead of advertising a popular tour, he gave us all the available options along with pros and cons, and let us decide for ourselves. The tour went exactly as described, but given that I didn't have any other guided experience in Morocco, I got to ask all the questions I had - history, culture, economy, political, tourism, religion, berber language, and any detail about Morocco and Said welcomed them with answers. It was more like traveling with a friend from that region than with an organizer. Thanks Said, and as I had said that day, I look forward to coming back for a longer trip and I wouldn't think twice about who I'll tour with. Said, unfortunately I don't that picture we took together at Imlil valley stop, but I was looking forward to attaching it here. I will share that privately later."

We have got some amazing pictures even better memories and our legs weren't even aching by the end. Our lunch stop was great overlooking a river and the mountains and the food was good and fresh. We saw some berber villages and children and then we started our small trek to see the waterfall. Its about a two hour part of the day and some negotiating with rocks but my word well worth it for the views. Just make sure you have sensible shoes on, some people we saw were trying to do it in flip flops. When we come again we'll be contacting Said again for a desert trip. He spoke really good English and this trip really made the holiday. If you want a similar experience look no further."

I I am travelling with my wife, two children aged 5 and 9, elderly parents in law and my wife's siblings and their respective partners.We were collected from our hotel reception by a well dressed, punctual (can be a problem in Morocco) and extremely polite and well spoken man - Said. We travelled in comfort towards the Atlas Mountains and en-route stopped for a tour (booked by Said) of an oil, herbs and ointments production place where we were shown manufacture of cosmetic oils and were able to purchase spices, soaps and cosmetics and a fraction of the UK retail price.As we arrived at Atlas we were introduced to a local guide of Said who travelled with us to see a waterfall in the Ourika valley.At the end of our climb and descent, Said seated us in a restaurant arranged a very reasonably priced meal and even assisted with the ordering.Unfortunately, as we had young children everything was delayed on our part - but Said was an Oasis of calm, did not rush us, and instead built up a rapport with the kids who were delighted by the breadth of knowledge Said possesses and were addressing him as Uncle Said by the time we returned.I now have one point of confusion: whether I was impressed more by the breath taking waterfall or the immensely talented Said! Over the past decade my family and I have travelled through Europe, Turkey, UAE and Arabia. I have met plenty of tour guides but have never met anyone as warm, kind and professional as Said. This chap makes the excursion a memorable experience and allows tourists like me to have peace of mind as he takes all the headache, pressures and pit falls of being a foreign country on his shoulders. Anyone travelling to this part of Africa should contact Said as he is not only a gem of a host but a very respectful young man who gives peace of mind, value for money and is an asset not only to SPH Tours but Morocco itself.In terms of rating the Atlas Mountain excursion is 5* - Said is 6* if there is such a rating!Thank you Said."

Kamal was great to work with to plan an itinerary that worked for us in the months leading up to the trip and he was very patient with the many, many emails I sent him to make revisions :) Everything went off without any problems. The car was very comfortable and our driver Anwar was great. If you are interested in visiting Morocco (which you should!) and covering a lot of ground, I highly recommend working with them to plan it."

            "review": "Three day tour with overnight Desert stop.. We spent 16 Days in Morrocco and this culminated in a 3 day tour with Morrocco Discovery Holidays. The tour was well worth it. Up until that point we had just relaxed and seen the occasional site. Our driver and guide Mustapha was fantastic. We learnt so much as we drove along. He would stop so we could take shots whenever we wanted but also took us to places off the beaten track so we could see certain locations away from the tourist heavy areas. Unlike a lot of guides he speaks very good English, although he doesn't think he does! I would recommend asking for him. He is very relaxed and good fun. The trip involved an overnight stay in a tent in the desert, a two hour camel ride out. Unfortunately we didn't get to enjoy the stars but did see the sunrise which is something I will never forget. I'll also have difficult forgetting the camel ride as it was very uncomfortable. I ended up walking the last 40 mins each way, which was an experience. I would say to grab around 8 litres of water when you go in and take a rucksack, nothing larger. They can store that and your water bottles about the camel. It was also very hot at night which surprised us. I guess it is season dependant but we went at the end of August 16 and we did not need our jumpers. For us It was a 9 hour drive back to Marakech and I wish we had budgeted for a couple of days after to relax but we had to head home. Overall it was well worth it and when we return to Morroco we will be looking to catch up with Mustapha and hopefully some home cooked food!"

We had a fantastic experience. Our driver, Mustaffa, made our trip! We really enjoyed his company and his knowledge. He was gracious and very fun to be throughout our trip. We did Casablanca, Rabat, Chefchaouen, Fez, Marrekech, Essaouira, and back to Cassablanca. They customized our trip based on our needs and adjusted things as we went along per our request. I would highly recommend their services. I even had a brief illness that landed me in the hospital and they went above and beyond to make sure I was safe and healthy.Normally, we travel with a car ourselves and explore a country independently. This would not have been possible in Morocco. It is essential to have your own driver and it made the logistics of the trip easy and enjoyable. We found their services very affordable.Book your trip through them. You won't be disappointed!"

We have Mohammed as our tour guide, who spoke English eloquently and has a english and history background. Mohammed is so kind, knowleagable of the areas and knew where the locations of vendors to take us. I was shopping for poufs, carpet, local painting, spices and teas and there was no wasted time since he knew where to go. We had Yassin as our personal driver and very friendly, kind, and gave us history of Berber family during the ride. Our itinerary includes: Highlights of City of Marrakesh, Museums, City Center, Restaurants, Beach and Medina and Atlas mountain. This is definitely a memorable experience for our family. Thanks to Said, Mohammed and Yassin for making this a wonderful vacation. Marrakesh is definitely a place we will return in the future. It is so colorful, magical, beautiful people, great food and full of surprises."

All of the riads were excellent, the tours set up in advance made it easy to quickly see each city and our driver, Mustapha was very kind, knowledgeable and helpful throughout the trip - making stops for us at the grocery store so we could eat (everything was closed during the day because of Ramadan) and making sure we had everything we needed when he dropped us off at the riads each evening.

We are 15 friends from Serbia, and we booked this amazing adventure-trip through Morocco Discovery Holidays, which was the hight of our 10 days stay in Morocco - we had a great professional driver, our Mercedes 17-seater wan was more than comfortable, and the journey to and from the desert around the city of Zagora had just enough stops to keep us excited, relaxed and amazed along the way - beautiful Atlas mountains and its high pass of Tizi n'Tichka, kasbahs of Ait Benhaddou and Ourzazate, and the amazing Draa river valley. Our experience in the Berber tents in the desert also suppressed all our expectations - we had a great traditional dinner, had the chance to listen to the local percussion music and also to learn how to play Berber drums. our deluxe tents had proper beds, electricity... we also had toilets and showers provided on the site of our desert camp. The sunrise in the morning was amazing, breakfast also, and we had such fun riding the camels to and from the camp back to the \"civilization\". Also - we had a great time with our companions from Germany and Australia, who were also staying in our camp.We'd strongly recommend booking this trip with Morocco Discovery Holidays, we are sure you'll be amazed in the same way we were."

A friend of ours used the company last year based on a recommendation from their friends. We signed up and they provided a detailed itinerary that started in Marrakech with an overnight stay at a Riad on the way to the desert followed by a camel ride into the Sahara and overnight tent stay. We ended our trip with an overnight in Fes before heading to our next destination outside of Morocco. We absolutely loved the 3 day excursion - it was the highlight of our trip. Coincidentally, we had the same guide as our friends a year ago, Mustapha, who was absolutely incredible for a number of reasons: 1) excellent english, 2) fantastic knowledge of Morocco and the local areas, 3) highly pleasant to be around. You'll be spending a lot of time with your guide in the car and touring if you do the condensed 3 day tour so it's important you have a good once. Mustapha was excellent. If you only have 4-5 days, you can absolutely make the most out of seeing morocco by doing their 3 day tour. Just know that you'll be spending a lot of time in the car, however, the scenery is absolutely breathtaking, and not something I was expecting. At every turn, there was the incredible Atlas mountain range and historical towns embedded in the hills. A photographers dream. The desert tour is a must. If you have 4-5 days, I would highly recommend a longer tour with them so you can spread your time out a bit. The Moroccans are also incredibly skilled in crafts. If you weren't planning to shop going there, you will when you see all of their hand made art and clothing. It's incredible. Lastly, don't be afraid of Morocco. It's a completely safe place and not to be confused with other Arab countries where there is risk to tourism. I don't think the people of Morocco are going to allow radicalism affect their lives. They won't have it."

The tour was wonderful - myself and my wife only in a SUV - Tangier, Chefchaouen, Meknes, Volubilis, Fez, Marrakech, Casablanca, Rabat, Tangier . Our driver Mustafa was the best. He had a jovial and pleasant personality, a good command of the English language, very knowledgeable about the various points of interest, always punctual, his driving habits were superb and we always felt safe with him. The local guides,,each named Mohammed, were excellent in Fez and Marrakech. We were very pleased with the itinerary that Kamal designed for us - 8 days out of Tangier, arriving at the ferry terminal and departing from the airport. The choice and location of the accommodation was excellent , however if you are a first timer hoteling inside a medina you may find the arrival at the first riad intimidating, sometimes surprising, but always dramatic and always safe - however we agree that this is the best way to experience the real Morocco and its daily lifestyle - staying in a riad (a riad is generally a large former medina residence of a wealthy family which has been converted into guest accommodation, almost invariably accessed via quaint narrow winding cobbled stoned pedestrian alleys) . The staff at the riads were extremely hospitable and each accommodation had its own charming atmosphere - special mention to Riad Dar Sultan (Tangier), Riad El Noujoum (Marrakech), and the crowning jewel Riad Fes Al amine (Fez). The Riad Fes Al amine was absolutely beautiful and exceptionally spectacular inside, the social hostess and other staff were superb and the owner a gem. By comparison the staff at Riad Dar Chaouen (Chefchaouen) were inattentive and sloppy which is unfortunate because the room was well appointed and the view was spectacular. All in all, Kamal and Mustafa created a delightful holiday for us, and we are convinced that their company is amongst the best to organize a Moroccan holiday. We shall certainly recommend Morocco Discovery to our friends who may be considering a visit to Morocco. Communication, finalizing an itinerary, arranging a rendezvous and payments was very simple and responses to tour questions were always prompt and clearly explained. They even provided the cell phone number of the driver before hand so as to minimize any anxiety at the meeting point to start the tour.(We are prolific travelers and have visited scores of countries, have been around the world many times - we have seen the best and the worst of accommodation, service and tour guiding and therefore do not give a good review unless we figure that it is well deserved.)"

The 9 day itinerary (July 1-9, 2015) prepared by Discovery for me and 3 of my travel buddies, was perfect to experience, live and enjoy Morocco. We were able to see the most important cities of the country, immerse ourselves in their culture and way of life. We went from the Coast (Casablanca) to Inland (including an overnight camping at the very hot but extremely interesting Sahara Desert) and back to the Coast (ending our trip to visit a much cooler city of Essaouira before heading back to Casablanca). The TRANSPORTATION that Discovery provided (Hyundai 7 seater Van) was comfortable and big enough to accommodate 5 people. We were on the road most of the time since we were travelling from one city to the next, so leg room was very important and most importantly, the Air Condition worked perfectly! This was very important as well since it was the height of the summer season when we went. The DRIVER \u2013 We were lucky to have Mahdi as our tour driver. It was love at first sight! :) His caring personality was just what we needed. He made sure we were comfortable, he made sure he endorsed us properly to the hotels/Riads before he leaves for the day, he made sure we see all that we needed to see and experience in Morocco, he always came on time and spoke very good English. He always have a good story to tell. It felt like we\u2019ve been friends for years! The ACCOMODATION \u2013 Discovery picked the best Riads for us. We were very impressed with the Riad at Fez (Riad Salama) the rooms were big, the food was great, service was exceptional, we requested for beef with prunes for dinner which was probably the best beef with prunes I\u2019ve tasted. The Riad at Dades Gorges, in Marrakech, and Essaouira did not disappoint. For the price we paid for the tour \u2013 I think we got a very very good deal for all that was included \u2013 beautiful Raids, we were fed well, and service was great!My travel buddies and I have been to a lot of places \u2013 but we all agree that our trip to Morocco was one of the best and probably one of the most memorable. Thanks to Discovery for allowing us to experience the best of Morocco. At the end of the tour \u2013 we all agree that our experience in Morocco was not only food for the eyes, and the tummy\u2026but also, food for the soul."

Too bad, I only had 6 days but eveyday is a highlight - tagine food, stroll at the medinas ( best one is in Fes - surprised to see dried lavender flowers around and only costs $3 for 250g, would have cost a fortune in provence, france), divine road trip from Casablanca all the way to Marrakesh ( the landscape is one of the more amazing i have seen - every new city/town is a different flavor - from erfoud to marrakesh is when the best of the high atlas view - rained for a bit and then breeze smelled like cinnamon! Road trip was more enjoyable with Mahdi entertaining us with his wit about every city - all over the world + his perfect playlist of classical music - he's just one great companiom! Peak of the trip is our sahara desert adventure - camel ride - awesome sights of the sand dunes, overnight at the camp, seeing the moonrise, sleeping by the strarry starry night. Just be ready with the camel ride, its at least 1.5 hours one way - can cause butt blisters and muscle soreness all over. LOL!I can go on and on but bottom line, its one trip i will remember for life and since i only ha a few days, i will surely make some plans to come back and see more places i missed like Essaouira, Tanger, Dades Valleys....

Morocco was fascinating and exceeded my expectation from its varieties of landscapes, beautiful nature, lively culture & architects, colourful handicrafts, good spicy and healthy foods, and friendly people. We visited more than 10 tourist cities. The resting points of each day in hotel, Riyad, Kasbah, and luxury tent in Sahara Desert, all were spectacular and beyond our imagination.The journey across Morocco was well planned and taken care by Morocco Discovery Holidays. The coach of 48 seats was comfortable. It was always clean as Chahid, the bus boy, did his job well. It was driven by a great driver, Mr.Rachid, whom we had to give big hands for, as some of the driving in Morocco were challenging. Mr.Said, the tour guide, was superb. He spoke excellent English. His knowledge made the tour in-depth. His friendliness, service mind, and kind heart took care all of us as if we were family, all of which made this trip a memorable one.One small advice for whoever is planning a trip to Morocco, if possible, spend the night in the Sahara Desert on a moonless night to enjoy the rare spectacular views of uncountable stars."

Highlights were the kasbahs we visited and Dades gorge which was beautiful. Our hotel in Dades was great. We then headed to the desert ready for our camel trek and night in the Sahara. This was a fabulous experience even if the camel was a bit uncomfortable. The camp was great and very peaceful. We were then dropped back at our hotel after two nights away, exhausted as we had seen and done so much. I would recommend booking this tour with Morocco discovery tours, can't fault them."

We got picked up at our hostel, had a big private bus for two days and enjoyed the filmstudio's, Ait Benhaddou, the camelrides and the night in the desert. All the guides, food and facilities were already arranged for us so we had to do nothing else but relax and enjoy the beautiful Moroccan landscapes!

Drive to Marakech took us about 3 hours where we met our guide knowledgeable Said, who spoke English very well. He managed to get us passed some queues too. We saw the Majorelle gardens, Palace Bahia, the big square and souks. We had lunch in a very good local restaurant (Oscar Progress) for an amazing price. On our way back to the ship, our driver stopped by the Hassan 2 mosk in Casablanca on our request, so we could take some pictures there.

The one regret was that we didnt spend more time in essouria and in imlil. At least 1 nights stay at the berbers house in imlil is well recommended. They offer many activities including making berber mint tea, which is an art in itself and cooking tagines all in their kitchen. The family has a2 storey house and rhey have made their second floor solely for guests. We were lucky to have the place to ourselves which has hot showers, flush toilet, large lounge, a comfortable double bed, beautiful views from their outside terrace and their own mule available to carry your luggage up the hill from the main road to their house whilst you walk the 15 mins up to where they live. You really feel like your getting away from it all and living with the berber tribe, without roughing it! Great walks in the valley and if your feeling energetic they can arrange guided walks, or just go exploring on your own. Essouria was also lovely, with old portugese ramparts and a real french feel to the town. Nice compact medina great for exploring with lots of cool boutique shops. Its also has a nice hippy feel to the place. Lots of kite surfing and windsurfing on offer too.Marrakech is more expensive than all the other places and is very touristy, but is worth coming to explore. We had 3 days but you could extend to 5 as theres lots to explore. Highly recommend staying in a riad, a small hotel often with only 5 or 10 rooms, in the centre of town, very personal and friendlier than a large hotel which are located on the outskirts. Can get clean and comfortable rooms from 50 euros per room per night incl breakfast in most towns."

The tour that Kamal put together gave us a taste of how varied and fascinating a country Morocco is. Plus, the price was very good and we stayed in welcoming family-run places that were comfortable and well-located. The trip was planned with most dinners and breakfasts pre-paid at the riads and inns, and we loved the food, which was varied and delicious.Our driver and guide for the entire trip was Ibrahim Babbaia. I can't say enough good about him. He was excellent company, had a great sense of humor, and also was fantastic at logistics and timing. We never felt rushed, yet everything seemed to happen on time. There were a few long days of driving, but he found ways to break it up with interesting stops at viewpoints, coffee shops, cultural points, etc. And he was creative at keeping us on schedule with a fairly ambitious itinerary. For example, one day we spent an unusual amount of time deciding what to buy at a desert co-op. When we finished, it was long past time for lunch. Ibrahim installed us in a small roadside cafe and appeared shortly after that with take-out Berber pizzas--delicious. I also should add that he is a great driver (which you appreciate when you see some of the challenges of driving in Morocco). And spoke perfect English and was happy to teach us bits of Arabic and Berber when we asked.We visited all the imperial cities and each is fascinating. But for me, the smaller places we visited were the highlights. Chefchauouen and the Rif mountains were beautiful, the Sahara is haunting and wonderful, as were the small towns on the way there. And Arghen, the Berber village near Mt. Toubkal (we stayed at the Authentic Toubkal Lodge) was unforgettable. The second night we had a cooking lesson where we made bread and tagines over wood fires on the deck with a beautiful sunset over the High Atlas mountains. We left most of the details of the itinerary to Kamal and Ibrahim, we decided NOT to try to micro-manage the trip, and are very happy that we took that approach because it meant that we had many great surprises. My husband and I both love to travel, and this was one of the best trips we have ever taken. One note: before we arrived in Morocco, there was not a lot of information provided in advance about things like payment terms, accommodation details, tipping, what to take into the desert, etc. But when we asked for information, Kamal provided it, and there is a lot of information available on other websites."

Marrakech > Casablanca > Rabat > Chefchaouen > Fez > Sahara Desert > Ouarzazate > Marrakech + Day trip to Ourika Valley:: DRIVER :: Our driver, Abdul was young (like us!) but very professional and friendly. He was always smiling and answering our touristy questions. We really enjoyed having him. He was always willing to stop anywhere. I asked him if there was a good photo outlook for the mountains and he literally stopped right there for us. He always took care of us even when unexpected things occurred eg. the van blew a fuse. He got a mechanic while we saw an amazing city view and waited at nearby cafe. We called him a few times randomly to pick us up or give us a ride somewhere and he was always willing to do that for us. He also helped us with luggage, making reservations or suggesting a good local restaurant. He was ALWAYS on time and never rushed us through any sights. Keep in mind though, he isn't a tour guide so don't expect him to give you details and history everywhere you go! :: HOTELS :: The hotels we stayed at were very nice, clean and well reviewed on TA. Kamal gave us about 2-3 options per city to choose from. He also looked at higher rated hotels too but the price of the tour would change accordingly. :: CITY TOUR GUIDES :: We had Said in Marrakech and Ibrahim in Fez as our guides. They were VERY knowledgable, friendly and spoke excellent English. :: FOOD ::For the most part, breakfast and dinner is included in the tour prices from the raid/hotel. The food was overall decent or good. You and your driver are essentially on your own for lunch... Find your own spot or ask your driver for recommendation. The best spots were the local roadside spots that our driver recommended. Be vary of the lunch place at Fez the guide takes you. It's tasty but very expensive because it's gear to tourists. The pastille was $25! :: OVERALL ::It was great! There were some mix-ups with the included meals in the itinerary and bed setups but those were quickly resolved by our driver/booking rep. They really try their best to accommodate us and meet our requests, just make sure you have you itinerary clearly outlined (with all the details, meals/room types) and ask questions if something doesn't align. Be open-minded too, we did have some unexpected delays (car troubles and pulled over for speeding hahah!)."

We had our driver, Mustafa and tour guides in Fez and Marrakesh. Mustafa could not have been more helpful or considerate, he thought of everything from where to buy safe lunches, to arranging trolleys for our luggage and arranging a cooking class in Marrakesh. He ensured we experienced lovely Morocco, he is a very safe driver and he speaks excellent english. We highly recommend this company and Mustafa, if you want a personalised and comprehensive tour of Morocco."

We were on a fast-paced trip that included Casablanca, Fes, Marrakech, Rabat, Meknes, Chefchaouen and Tangier. We had a great time and our driver, Hassan was a blessing. He was humorous and patient and we enjoyed every moment with him. We also had two local guides, Aziz and Said. We especially liked Aziz in whom we found to be knowledgeable, flexible and accommodating. Said was also very knowledgeable but a little too rigid at times.We loved Morocco and were greeted warmly wherever we went. The shopping was great and we loved staying in the Riads. I was surprised by the diversity of the landscape and the beauty of the land. I would highly recommend a trip to Morocco and certainly with Morocco Discovery Tours, and Hassan of course!"

My partner and I did the day tour of Marrakech the morning we arrived in Morocco and it was a great way to acclimatise and get our bearings, as well as see many of the sights.Our tour guide was very friendly and spoke perfect English, he also gave us a lot of insight to the various places we visited. He also adapted the tour to our interests and was flexible with timings on where and what we would like to eat.We had a lot of interesting conversations and we even got an impromptu 'lesson' on how the arabic language is written, and the meanings of various words (interesting for a geek like myself!)After the tour we felt we had practically seen all of the highlights in the city, so we could spend the rest of the time just enjoying the souks, cafes and sights.One slight complaint is that a couple of times on the tour we were unwillingly thrust into awkward situations where we had to purchase various things we didn't want or need; one of these ended with a local cloth vendor pretty peeved that we didn't buy a scarf. That said - this is par for the course in Marrakech and you need to prepare for aggressive selling from many of the vendors who will rope you into their shops by whatever means possible."

            "review": "What an amazing journey!. My wife and I love to travel. However, we have always traveled independently; I love to drive in different countries and we love to be immersed in different societies, without \"tourist restrictions.\" When we decided to travel to Morocco, I did a lot of research and found that Gate 1 Discovery Tours would give us sufficient free time to enjoy some independence, but also provide a wider breadth of exposure to Morocco, its people, culture, food and traditions. We opted for the Moroccan Allure small group escorted tour which had a maximum of 22 travelers for 15 days.Gate 1 provides a very customer friendly website to book the trips and opt to include airline reservations along with the tour reservations. I opted to include the airline reservations which made the travel experience very smooth and glitch free. We had the option of choosing our airline, departure city and flight times to ensure that we would arrive in time for transfer from the Casablanca airport to our Riad in Rabat.Once we arrived in Casablanca and cleared Customs and Immigration, we were met by a Gate 1 representative who escorted us to our driver who drove us to Rabat. From the moment we arrived in Casablanca, we knew that this was going to be a special trip.At Villa Mandarine, we met our Tour Guide, Ibrahim Aghraz who introduced himself to the members of our group and later led a very informative orientation meeting. Throughout the tour, Ibrahim was a phenomenal guide who had an encyclopedic knowledge about Morocco, its cultures, food and traditions. Ibrahim always graciously answered questions any of us had whether on the bus or during the walking tours.One of the aspects we loved of this tour were the Riads and Kasbahs we stayed at. With the exception of the Kenzi Tower in Casablanca, all of them were located in medinas or in areas where we felt we were not staying in a corporate chain. In addition, this tour allowed us to see quite a bit of Morocco; Rabat, Fes, Meknes, Ourzazate, Marrakech, Essouira, the Atlas Mountains, ancient ruins, mosques, shrines, royal palaces and many other sites and sounds in the various medinas, souks and food stalls we explored.Meeting a Berber family over tea, eating fresh bread from a bakery in Fes, enjoying mechoui (roasted lamb) and snails in the Djemaa el Fna in Marrakech, visiting Ait Ben Haddou as well as all of the mosques are only a fraction of the highlights that made this journey so special and created so many memories that will stay with us for a lifetime. Particularly in Marrakech, and Essaouira, my wife and I enjoyed the extra \"free time\" that allowed us to explore the souks and sample the food in the Djemaa el Fna and the fresh fish grilled to perfection in Essaouira. You will become addicted to the mint tea!!!!!!The one mother nature created disappointment, was an freak rainstorm that resulted in our overnight stay in the desert being cancelled. However, Ibrahim handled this masterfully. We were able to drive out to the dune and enjoy mint tea, nuts and cookies while the rain subsided and stopped. Almost as if Ibrahim (and all of us excited travelers) had willed it, the rain stopped long enough for us to ride the camels, enjoy the dunes and even can a sunset. To his credit, Ibrahim had wisely reserved our same rooms at Xaluca for another night so that we were not inconvenienced. While a disappointment, I believe that how an organization handles glitches reveals the quality of the organization an its personnel. I was very impressed at how Ibrahim made certain that we were all safe and were still able to enjoy the camel ride, the dunes and still retained our rooms at Xaluca.I was also impressed with our driver, Hassan and the Tour Guide Assistant, Ibrahim who assisted in making our daily ventures safe and comfortable. I must note that I would not have wanted to participate in a tour with a group larger than this. Based on the size of 22, we were able to venture into areas that would have been prohibitive for a larger group. I should also note that we had a good group of travelers with no personality conflicts which could have put a damper on the tour.Based on this tour, I would definitely consider Gate 1 Discovery Tours to visit certain countries in the future. In particular, I look forward to returning to Morocco with Gate 1 and look forward to enjoying a night (or few!) in the desert this time!"

First I would like to thank Kamal for his patience while putting this trip together. He was always polite and replied quick with the right answers. Our driver was Mustapha, as you have read in previous comments he is simply excellent, he is not only a great driver but also knowledgeable of the history, its people and customs of his country. We visited the Sahara, stayed one night and I have to say we will go back for at least two nights. From the camel ride to the scrumptious dinner, everything was fantastic. We reserved the deluxe camp with a full bath in a beautiful decorated tent, the extra expense was definitely worth it. Dinner was at another tent, spacious and airy. We were the only guests that night so we enjoyed our peaceful dinner and a full moon night. After that we sat by the fire and watched the time go by. The next morning a delicious breakfast was waiting for us while we watched the sunrise. Bread, Moroccan pancakes, jams, cheese and yogurts were part of the menu that morning. We had mentioned we would like to ride quads so right after breakfast we jumped on the quads to return to the hotel for a nice shower and a bit of relaxation. All the hotels the company booked for us were excellent, exceeded our expectations, dinner was always included and the food was great. The villages we visited left a mark in our souls, our kids enjoyed this trip not only for the adventure, but for the human part also. Being exposed to a different culture, to see many people living in a way they had only seen on TV was a positive and learning experience for all. Rest assure that Said, Kamal and the rest of the team will take care of you and will help you plan the trip of your life. Thanks Said for coming to say bye to us, what a nice surprise when Mustapha stopped the car to greet you.....We will definitely be back....Thanks for an awesome time...Diego already wants to see you :)"

We were collected from our accommodation in Marrakech and driven through the Atlas Mountains to Dades Gorge. Along the way we made a number of stops to see spectaular scenery and some of the sights along the way. Our driver Mohamed even took us beyond our final destination of the first day to show us the sunset from the top of the gorge at Hotel Timzzillite which was spectacular. We spent the night at Hotel Xaluca Dades, which was excellent. They had an outdoor swimming pool and hot tub, and we were welcomed by eight traditionally dressed singing men and women on our arrival! The food was superb and it felt very luxurious.On the second day, Mohamed drove us on to Merzouga via a small local fossil factory where we saw how natural fossils embedded into rock were machined to make table tops, sinks and many other ornaments, which had been extracted from the surrounding plains which were once the Arabian Sea. We reached Merzouga around 15:30 and then boarded camels to ride out into the Sahara Desert. We spent a night camping in tents, which were extremely comfortable and even had electricity! Just remember to take warm clothes as the desert is extremely cold at night! The camel ride was the highlight of our trip. We returned back to Merzouga the following morning by camel after trying our hand at sand-boarding(!), and Mohamed drove us back to Marrakech via a different route with even more stunning scenery of the Atlas Mountains. Many thanks for a wonderful adventure!"

I typically plan all trips myself and never take tours so I was a bit hesitant initially to do a \"tour\" but a private tour is definitely the way to visit Morocco. Kamal was extremely helpful with planning our trip and gave suggestions for what to see and what was feasible given our time there. We stayed in charming Riads and an Kasbash (highlights by far were Princess du Desert in Marrakech and La Perle du Dades in the Dades Valley suggested by Kamal-there was a choice of two for each location which was perfect as this allowed us some choice but not too much time to research. Our guides Aziz in Fez and Saed in Marrakech were truly outstanding-knowledgeable not only about the imperial city they were showing us but about history, religions, language, culture and literally anything we asked them. I felt after the trip I understood the history not only of Morocco but of adjacent counties over the centuries. Our driver Brahim was very professional and helpful with whatever we needed particularly when our son got sick and was a pleasure to be with which is important as you spend a lot of time together. One thing to be aware of is that if you want to see a lot as we did it can be quite a bit of driving (8 hrs on some days) and even with the planned stops it can be tiring so I'd recommend knowing the driving times when you are planning (this would be helpful to have listed on the itinerary actually ) as we ended up canceling a Berber Family stay last minute to have an extra night and day in the Valley just as a \"rest day\" This is of course the beauty of a private tour-not only do you tailor the dates and places to your interests and energy but you have the option to alter it somewhat once you are there. I compared group tours (many of which were similarly priced to our private tour amazingly) and other private tours and felt Morocco Discovery tours was very fairly priced particularly given the quality of the trip. Highly recommended, you won't be dissapointed."

We spent 16 days going from Casablanca to Rabat to Chefcheuon to Fes to Desert and to Marrakesh. Our driver Mustapha was very accommodating and thoughtful. We were a group of 4 who are fairly into photography, therefore, a site that takes normal tourists 45 mins sometimes takes us up to 1.5 hours. Mustapha always waited patiently, and never complained. On the third day he was already able to plan out the next day according to our pace, yet still making sure that we wouldn't miss out on any important sites. We were impressed by some of the accommodation arrangements that MD was able to make for us. Partially because it is off-season, we were put into very nice rooms in the hotels/riads for no additional cost. We also made some last minute arrangements, ie. While we were in Ouarzazate, we decided to head to Marrakesh 1 day earlier and Kamal was able to arrange that for us right away. Overall a very good experience and reasonably priced.

We were interested in a desert tour departing from Marrakech. As many people, we have relied on TripAdvisor reviews to find a tour operator according to our needs. After writing to multiple agencies, we realized that everyone proposed basically the same route with a few variations on the theme . Finally we chose Morocco Discovery Agency, we did a 3 day tour departing from Marrakech and arriving to Erg Chebbi Dune passing through Ouarzazate and Dades gorges.It was really the best choice!!Our guide was Mustafa and he was much more than a driver or an attendant. It seemed more a person interested in helping us to discover culture, land and beauty of his homeland. The best guide that can happen, a person who understands what you are interested of and brings you to places and meet people even outside the usual tourist circuit .And so we visited a kasbah still inhabited and went shopping in a typical Berber market, we understood the meaning of the words of the muezzin and learned how to behave in a hammam.Given the distances, before leaving I imagined spending hours in car and wondered how we would have spent time. Instead, the hours are flown because Mustafa got ideas from each person, construction or situation to talk about features and beauty of his country.Our questions did not seem to bother him at all .Even when we had our specific requests, he made sure to meet them.His attention to us was perfect. For example, I like to take pictures and I always had my Canon with me. During the trip I was sitting next to him and it was enough to lift the camera because he would slow down trying to understand what I was interested in and when it was possible, he placed the car for the best shooting. Actually, raise the camera was like pressing on the brake ! :)First night we stayed in a beautiful hotel (Xaluca hotel): luxury room, nice pool and very good food.The second night we slept in the camp of tents in the desert: nice and with all the comforts (othen than the best tajine we ever eaten)This was an unforgettable experienceWith Mustafa and Morocco Discovery we discovered the true essence of this country and we can not thank them enough ."

Don't try to pack too much of the country in too little time- otherwise you will spend a lot of time in a bus [which is still awesome-looking at Morocco's beautiful landscape but a little difficult on the bum]."

And if you can get the two Abduls, that\u2019s an added bonus! What a joy and honor it was to be in the presence of such an amazing team!"

            "review": "Well organized 3 day trip across High Atlas to desert with excellent guide.. We booked a 2 night/3 day trip from Marrakech across the High Atlas to include a 2 hr camel trek to the desert for one of the nights. We are a family of 3 and we had our own comfortable minivan and driver/guide.Our guide Moustaffa was excellent: friendly and very helpful, knowledgeable, spoke good English. He was able to tell us about life for the younger, educated more modern Moroccans, as well as about more traditional Moroccan life and culture.Very importantly ( especially when traversing the High Atlas) Moustaffa was a very safe and skilled driver. There is a lot of driving in this trip and the road over the mountains is very windy- two of us needed anti-emetics for car sickness.We visited many interesting sites and features. The camel trek at sunset was a great experience- 2 hrs was enough though as it gets quite uncomfortable for the legs and backside. The tents we slept in were warm and comfortable and dinner was delicious. Moustaffa chose good local cafes and restaurants for stops.In retrospect it would have been better to return direct from Merzouga to Fes, instead of driving all the way back to Marrakech then getting the train on to Fes as we did. This was our own fault for not asking advice from the company before booking the trip.Altogether a very interesting and worthwhile trip, though it is a lot of distance to cover in 3 days.I would highly recommend this company."

Our driver, Lahsen, was extremely reliable and accommodating. We became good friends. Said, one of the owners who also was our guide in Marrakech was wonderful -- generous and knowledgeable. Our English-speaking guide in Fez also was fantastic. We learned so much from them. All of the riads and hotels Morocco Discovery booked for us were lovely and fantastic. I booked the trip over Christmas/New Year's only a week before and didn't know what to expect. Morocco Discovery Tours did not disappoint. It was perfect in every way at an affordable price!"

            "review": "Highly Recommended. I traveled to Morocco in October with a large group of people. I have never traveled with a large group of people before.Mustapha and Said greeted us at the airport in a most welcoming and friendly manner ~ from the beginning they created a warm, engaging atmosphere for the group. I was amazed at their constant ability to manage such a large group with unfailing positivity and patience! We spent a lot of time in a large bus and the driver Abdul was one of the best drivers I have ever witnessed. The itinerary our US guides planned was, according to Lonely Planet's guidebook, an itinerary recommended for one Month of travel, and we did it in 11 days, so we covered a lot of territory in a short amount of time. From very narrow alleys and gates to mountain passes, Abdul's skill as a driver was nothing short of amazing.It's difficult to make an experience unique when one is dealing with 30 people, but we visited some excellent restaurants and had some uniquely Moroccan experiences ~ from having an incredible meal at a remote inn in the mountains, hearing Bedouin music, visiting sacred sites, to a night in the Sahara ~ they orchestrated a wonderful trip. Mustapha and Said went far above the call of duty, from finding and delivering lost luggage, helping people with hotel rooms, laundry, medication, dinner etc. to catering to the petty demands of some of the more needy individuals on the trip. They really took over for the weaknesses of the people who had organized the trip in the US, and created a wonderful trip for us.They worked hard to learn about us as individuals ~ we shared our lives, and I am still very touched at their consideration of me personally. I'm a musician, and I was given cd's and at the end of the trip, I was given a handmade drum, a gift I will cherish for the rest of my life.These guys all had inexhaustible stores of energy, kindness, awareness and patience that went far above the norm. Plus on our last day, which should have been a day off, Said took me and a few other folks to the market in Marrakech, and hooked me up with the best places to buy shoes and gifts for my friends and family ~ while Mustapha did the same for other people. After Morocco, we went to the Canary Islands, and I don't even remember our guides' names there!I guess the true testament to Said and Mustapha's success as guides lies in the fact that I feel I made lifelong friends in Morocco. I know I will see them again, and I look forward to my next trip (with only 2 of us at most!!) to take my Moroccan experience deeper ~ and I will Definitely hire Said and Mustapha again. Definitely."

From acquiring a replacement camera battery to purchasing special foods and creating fascinating diversions on long bus rides, they were graciously, expertly and indefatigably serving us. The selection of places to explore, experience, sleep and eat was wonderful, and how great to have the logistics smoothly managed. Our experience of Morocco as fascinating and beautiful was no doubt enhanced by our expert guides and skillful bus driver, Abdul."

The answer to our questions and inquiries was as quick as we expected from Mouna and Kamal. The driver was excellent. His name was Hassan. This man was fabulous and funy driver/guide. he took us to some beautiful places beyond what we had in the itinerary. Our tour covered the best parts of Morocco. It was a tour of 10 days. We started from Casablanca (the economic capital of Morocco). Then , the expert driver/guide Hassan took us to the bride of the North \"Chefchaouen\" which a little town but its beauty is so fascinating. Then, the tour continued into Fez (the medieval city) where we spent two nights and had a guided tour with an excellent knowledgeable guide. Afterwards, we crossed the big South with its Mountains - Valleys - Sahara Desert with its immense dunes of Erg Chebbi & Erg Chigaga , the gorges of Dades and Todra, the Draa valley and Rose valley , zagora and its Kasbahs and then the best spots of Marrakech as being the pearl of the Atlas and Essaouira as being the capital of the Atlantic Coast beaches. We really would like to recommend you Morocco first as a gorgeous Travel destination and to use Morocco Discovery Holidays as a professional Tour Company."

I was in a group of about thirty people whose leaders had contracted Mustapha and Said to organize our tour and to be our guides. They were both so warm and gracious throughout the trip that I cannot say enough good things about them. Besides their normal guide \"hats\" they were always at the ready to help any of us meet our needs or answer our requests. They went out of their way to be of wonderful service. Our driver, Abdul, did an excellent job of maneuvering our big bus safely through narrow and winding roads. We were shown the very best experiences possible throughout the country, including an overnight in the Sahara where we danced to the rhythms of the nomad people and slept either in tents or under the incredible starry sky, as I chose to do. The love and knowledge these men had for their country and shared with us was contagious, and I especially enjoyed their mutual love of music as they sang and drummed our way through the countryside when we requested it."

He took us to the places you usually would not be able to see in a larger tourgroups, and with his humour and knowledge even long traveltime in the car was enjoyable. The local guides in Meknes, Fes, and Marrakech were also good. We have travelled a lot around in the world, but to us this is the best way to see and experience a country the first time.

All of the Riads and hotels that we stayed at were unique, comfortable and in excellent locations. Our Fez & Marrakech city guides have been chosen to have wonderful and caring personalities and a true love of their country and the ability to go above & beyond normal service...we felt that everyone was a friend that we had known for quite some time. In fact, the company knows what it is doing and they convey their love of Morocco to all whom they meet. The staff work very hard at giving the best customer services I have had ever experienced.

At fairly short notice, I contacted Morocco Discovery Holidays, about a 3 day camel trek in the desert from M'Hamid.They replied straight away & were quick dealing with any questions that I had about the plans. To avoid the complexity of locating their office in Marrakech, they came to my hotel while I was staying there to pick up the deposit for the trip & run through more details of it.In the end, it turned out that the trip had to alter slightly, because of the excessive temperatures in the desert, which meant that we couldn't trek at all during the middle of the day, but we had a great time. Both our guides spoke good English & pointed out all kinds of aspects of the desert & desert life that would otherwise have passed us by."

Marrakesh is fascinating, as always.The reason to go was to take us to explore and discover some of the world that went beyond the usual travel destinations in Australia - Europe and USA.Hassan is an excellent and safe driver, always taking care of his passengers. He taught us a lot about his culture and the history of his people, never being \"pushy\". We stayed in very good hotels and riads along the route. He played a major role in making us so pleased without choice of tour operator and destination. Extremely beautiful nature, interesting to see the film making industry, people living in caves, etc, etc. In conclusion: Top personal service, superb value for money, fascinating destination, and we are ready to go back and use the same operator again. Highly-recommended to anyone thinking of visiting Morocco as a treasure."

I was a bit nervous about going to a country in which I knew nothing about. The only thing I knew was what I had read on the Department of State website which made me paranoid. From the minute we all arrived Said was already waiting for us (Marrakech), he waited patiently for us to change our currency and then off we went with the driver he had waiting for us and Said of course. I went with my two betsies, the betsies hubby and the hubby\u2019s mom. From day one until the day we left, Said was there. Said made our stay in Morocco unforgettable, I will treasure every minute for the rest of my life. It was truly amazing to learn so much about a culture that I knew nothing about. We experienced the culture, the food and the people. We went to different parts in Morocco and they were all fantastic. We also did the Camel Trek, which was by far an experience I will never forget. I recommend to everyone to stop looking and go with Morocco Discovery, with some many agencies out there it is hard to choose. But if you want someone that will take care of your specific accommodations that fit your needs, go with Said. I felt like I had known Said forever that\u2019s how pleasant, accommodating and welcoming Said made us feel. Also our driver Driss was awesome.

On this particular trip I was just a tag-a-long as my wife and one of her best friends put the whole trip together. There were 5 of us which consisted of my wife, 2 of her friends and my mom (74). I didn't want to do a lot of research on this trip as I wanted to just take it in as it happened. I was very pleased the way everything turned out. Mr Said with Morocco Discovery Day Tours is one of the most exceptional people I have ever met. His dedication to his business and country is of excellence. From the moment of our arrival to our departure, he made our group feel welcome, secure and was always available, night or day, for us. We were in Morocco for 6 nights and Said pre-arranged everything online for us. We had the same driver and Said for the whole trip, We were met at the airport and whisked off to our Riad. We received a briefing, unpacked, hit the Djemaa el Fna Square . Day 2 we covered Marrakech in great detail, Day 3 took us to thru the high Atlas Mountains, to Ouarzazate and the Dades Gorges. Day 4 was to the Todra Gorges and to Merzouga for a camel ride into the West Sahara to sleep in a nomad tent at a desert camp at Erg Chebbi. Day 5 took us from the desert camp back to Marrakech via Skoura and the high Atlas Mountains. Day 6 was a day trip to a waterfall area in the high Atlas that was most beautiful. Day 7 was to the airport and off to Madrid. Without going on and on, this trip to Morocco was most pleasant, the people were very warm and welcoming and the expertise that Mr. Said offered was of excellence. I highly recommend to anyone, a trip to Morocco is a MUST and a MUST is using Morocco Discovery Day Tours for your total trip arrangement. The food in Morocco is exceptional. We ate everything which was presented to us. Go for it !!!"

But from the minute I contacted to this company via Internet, my worries disappeared, thanks to Said. Said answered all my questions and was very professional. He even met us at the airport to discuss our future trips with no charge and made our arrival very comfortable and stress free. Said is very, very professional, and his English is great. He also was our tour guide in Marrakech Site tour, and I was amazed with all his knowledge of history and how passionate he was about his work. It was a really stress free tour. And Said made this tour memorable and we felt being in good hands. Our second tour was on Ait Benhanddou Hasbah and Mohammed was our driver on this tour. It was unforgettable trip through High Atlas Mountains with beautiful scenes and real cultural experience. This tour is a long drive, but we loved every minute of it. We wish we\u2019ve had more time with Mohammed to explore more about culture of this country. The conversations were very profound and we asked a lot of questions. There is so much to explore. And it was a heavy rain in the mountain at the end of our trip, and we were impressed with Mohammed\u2019s driving skills. He made our trip very safe and memorable. We highly recommend this company. Their professionalism and wiliness to meet your every need creates an unforgettable experience. Thank you, Said and Mohammed!"

            "review": "Morocco- Gate1 Guided Tour. Morocco was our 3rd guided tour through Gate1 Travels. We have done Europe and Turkey before it. We have enjoyed every one of the Gate1 Travel programs because they are so well planned. The guides are knowledgeable, courteous and helpful. We think everyone should take the Morocco tour to enjoy the worry free and hospitable people, monuments, history, henna tattoo, and food of Rabat, Volubilis ruins, the narrow streets, the leather tanneries, the agave cactus silk, woolen carpet and tile manufacturing locations are a must see in Fez. Fez is full of hidden palaces and street so narrow that only one person can walk through it. Marakkesh is a shoppers dream and kids loved the snake charmers, monkey acts and the night life in the Jamaa el Fna square. The souqs in Marrakech were colorful and stunning. Each day was unique in food, sightseeing and history. Ibrahim, our guide, along with coach crew helped us learn the daily greetings. The coach was comfortable and clean. The hotels were very clean and the breakfast refreshing and fresh. We took about 4000 pictures with two cameras and still feel we could have taken more. We all had a very positive experience and would love to go back to Morroco to see the hidden palaces. The farewell dinner with belly dancing was memorable."

We spent 2 days in this fantastic city, waiting patiently for the dream to come through. On Tuesday morning, we were picked up at our hotel by 2 Gentleman from Morocco Discovery. From this time, I knew we were going to have a fantastic time simply because of their punctuality, kindness & professionalism. Then we met our driver, Mohammed who embarked both of us on an unforgettable 3-day trip toward the South. We crossed over the High Atlas, started to shoot a long series of amazing pictures. We enjoyed our first lunch right after Ouarzazate, ready to drive through the Draa Valley. First Moroccan dinner & spend the hotel night in Mhamid. The next day, we rode camel for about 2 hours. What an experience!!! Unforgettable!!!! Cindy & I enjoyed the camel ride with 4 wonderful young people from Spain. Later on, we saw Mohammed, our so nice driver, waiting for us with his white 4x4. We drove through the desert for about 2 hours & finally reached our Destination: The Chigaga Dunes. The view of those yellow dunes & the blue sky stroke both of us. After listening to traditional music & dancing under the sky, we enjoyed our night by sleeping in a nomad tent. Another memorable experience. The next day was filled with new landscape discoveries. I will never forget all the detailed explanations given by our driver. Those 3 days will stay in my mind for ever. Since March, I have been constantly thinking of this trip & would love to repeat it exactly the same way\u2026.A dream came true! T.Y to the entire team who took care of us!"

Driver picked us up in the morning at our hotel i M Hamid and we went out over Hamada first, through the desert, which sometimes were only stones but sometimes even small dunes. On the way we made several stops to look around, we stayed in a small oasis (sorry not remember the name). The trip from M Hamid to Erg took approximately 2 hours with 4x4. There was a camp in the foot on the sand dunes. We went out to the dunes and admire the surroundings. The highest sand dune could be a little over 100m so there was, a little too high to climb:)Then we had lunch there in the camp, it was really good. After lunch we continued our journey back, but a different route than we came, so we had to go at the sand dunes. They were not so high but they were fine in all cases.Our impression from the trip was really good, driver talked good English and always showed us interesting things such as even a poor dead camel that was lying there full of sand. Driver also told different stories about the area so we got to know quite a lot.Back to M Hamid, we came before it got dark so it was nice to during our trip was light so we could see everything, so to speak.I highly recommend this tour company, they are polite, took care of us so we felt"

Hi,Just wanted to post a review for Said and the team at Morocco Discovery Tours who went out of their way to make our stay in Morocco a fantastic and memorable one!I always feel anxious when booking tours for an overseas destination as you really have no idea what sort of service or tour you will receive. We were arriving into Agadir on a cruise ship and wanted a day trip to Taroudant as we had heard it was a great destination. From the moment I contacted Morocco Discovery Tours I was impressed with their service - Said always emailed me back very quickly, was happy to tailor a tour to match the needs of my family (which is not easy as I have two small children and my husband is in a wheelchair!) and was able to offer a tour that met our budget.Closer to the time of our tour Said emailed with details about meeting location and name of our driver etc. And on the morning of the tour we had several phone calls to help direct us to the meeting point where we met our lovely driver (cant remember his name) who personally escorted us around Taroudant, made sure I paid reasonable prices in the souks, stopped for any photo opportunities we wanted and recommended a fantastic restaurant where we had tagine for lunch.We hope to return to Morocco for a longer tour at some stage and we will certainly be using Morocco Discovery Tours again. Thankyou Said and team for being a tour company that is actually interested in giving tourists a real view of their country and isn't just there to rip us off. Highly recommended!!"

Said from Morocco Discovery Holidays went above and beyond. Traveling with Said felt like traveling with a very knowledgable friend, not a tour guide. I don't think we could ask him a question he did not know the answer to. The transportation was clean and spacious \u2013 being in a van for a group was much better than any tour bus I've been on.Our Nomad guides in the Sahara were top notch. They were always upbeat, hard working and made our trek as comfortable as possible for traveling through sandstorms. Tip, do not go into the Sahara during sandstorm season (April). Maybe it's part of Moroccan culture, but our Saharan guides felt like friends \u2013 always hospitable.We did not have reservations for our last night in Marrakech. Said took his personal time to help us find a great riad through all his friends and connections. He even offered to pick us up at 5am to take us to the airport.If you're heading to Morocco, give Said a call. He will make you feel welcome and have the best experience possible."

Then we crossed the High Atlas moountain: wonderful views and landscapes (2000 mt). Passing through Ourzazate, we stopped at a typical Kasbah where we could visit the nicest internals and learn more about this structure. After we went into the Dades Gorges where we spent a wonderful dinner and night in a very nice hotel.The second day we reached the Todra's Gourges ; but in the afternoon we arrived at the most beautiful kasbah we ever saw just in front of the desert: we has some relax in the swimming pool and then we took the camels for a 2 hours ride by the sunset. We spent the night at the Erg Chebbi camp with a wonderful dinner cooked by the berberians under thousands of stars (impressive!).The third day we watched the sunrise by the camel and then we went back to the kasbah where we ate a fantastic breakfast (plus shower). On the way back to Marrakech, we visited the magnificient site of Ait Benhadou, where many holliwoodian moovies have benn shooted.The experience was amazing and the guides perfect!"

Our driver Hassan we can not speak more highly of. We became ill at one point of the trip and he went above and beyond to take care of us and showed genuine concern. Hassan was the perfect driver for us, he had a great sense of humour and we loved watching him interact with all the locals along our journey, it felt like he knew everyone in Morocco! We would definitely consider Hassan a friend for life for the way he took care of us! All the accommodation arranged by Morocco Discovery was nice, very clean and comfortable.

We decided to stay in Marrakech so we could visit the Souks etc. We had decided that we would like to see more of Morocco and looked into excursions that we could go on. If you are staying in Marrakech you will find a lot of different excursion companys - especially in Djeemma el fnna in the old town, but were very worried about scams etc. We looked on Trip advisor to get some guidance and found Morocco Discovery, it had a good rating so my boyfriend contacted the number provided. Said, the boss of the company was very helpful and arranged for someone to visit our hotel to speak to us about the different offers available. This was the first sign of great service that would be given, as we thought we would have to take a cab ride to the office.\u00a0The guide gave us lots of different options for what we had wanted and we decided to do a 3 day excursion \u00a0focusing a desert stay in Erg Shagaga. The excursion was planned so that we could see the Atlas mountains, different Kasbahs and sights, a camel ride and a nights stay in the Erg Shagaga desert in a Berber village, plus lots more.\u00a0My partner unfortunately was ill te night before we were due go (don't eat meat in Djeema el fnna!). we phoned the company and they were fantastic and said that they could rearrange, and also gave us some great advice on what medicine etc he could take. Said then phoned re next day to ensure my partner was ok, he didn't mention the trip or re booking at all, which made it feel like a really genuine check up call. We rearranged the trip later on.\u00a0We were picked up by our own 4 by 4 car and introduced to our driver and guide. They were very friendly and approachable from the start. This trip was a lot of driving but nothing was too much trouble, we could stop for photo oppourtunitys, coffee etc whenever we liked and if we had any questions our guide was fantastic at answering them and giving us lots of interesting info.\u00a0The sights were amazing, going to the highest mountain pass in Morocco and getting to see the magnificent views. We stopped at lots of different interesting places during our excursion.\u00a0Food is all included during the trip Inc breakfast, lunch and dinner - which comprised of starter main and fruit. You have to pay for your own drinks, but it is so cheap in Morroco it was hardly 60 Dirham (approx \u00a35) for two peoples drinks all day.\u00a0We stayed at a basic hotel the first night, with a lovely courtyard where we learnt Moroccan card games with our guide and driver. The room is very basic but has the essentials - shower toilet & a/c.\u00a0The morning came and after a nice breakfast came the camel ride, with a fantastically quirky and entertaining gentleman. This was great fun, albeit a little uncomfortable on the camel!\u00a0After this and some lunch we made our way to the Erg Shagaga desert with a stop to the most beautiful oasis - this is where they stop for lunch in cooler months but due to the high temperatures in July and august it is better to have it back at the hotel and leave a bit later to get to the desert when it is cooler, which I was definately glad about!\u00a0The Erg Shagaga is an astonishing sight, with huge sand dunes, you get some time to have a walk ( or a crawl at my pace) up and take in the views of a sea of dunes. If you have never been to a desert before this will amaze you, but make sure you have plenty of water and a scarf and glasses as it gets pretty windy.\u00a0You have the choice of staying in a room or you can sleep outside, in my personal opinion you would have to be mad not to sleep outside, the guides and village people make up raised beds for you and you can stare into a magnificent night sky, with not a sound around it was the best nights sleep I have ever had! And don't worry there are workin toilets and showers for those of us who aren't 'adventurers'!\u00a0The route back to Marrakech took us a different way to the beginning route. This meant there was plenty more to see and lots more fun to have. By this time we had got to know our guide and driver lots more, and had water fights and dancing in the car to keep us cool in the hot weather.\u00a0This was the best excursion we have been on during any holiday, the service was absolutely first class, our driver and guide, Mohammed and Said were professional but fun and informative at the same time, we felt like we had made two firm friends by the end of our trip. We saw amazing sights and got to know great information about Berber people, and Moroccan culture. The amount of stops and great food served was definitely worth the \u20ac250 each that we paid!\u00a0"

The desert was not only an amazing experience for its sheer, stark beauty, but for the healing it just does TO you. I don't know how to say it other than the sands suck the worry, anxiety, fear from your body. Three days later, as Youssef put me in the car to drive me to Marrakech, I told him that I now understood what he was trying to tell me.

Youssef was knowledgeable, friendly, funny and vigilant about our safety and comfort. We had so many questions about Moroccan culture, lifestyle and traditions which Youssef happily answered. I still believe that the best way to get to know another culture is through immersion with locals. Moroccans are hospitable and open-minded people, fiercely loyal to their families and respectful to other religions. One can read this in guide books but we know that now for ourselves.From the beginning we were very pleased with the itinerary and decided to stick to it. We traveled extensively in Morocco and visited ancient cities as well as small Berber villages. Morocco is the land of vivid contrast in landscape and cultures.The one issue we had was that 2 out of 4 riads we stayed at were different from the ones listed on the itinerary. While we were very happy with the substitutes it is something to keep in mind when planning your trip.Thanks to \u201cImperial cities tour\u201d our trip was flawless and exciting.

            "review": "Both day excursions were great - Ourika and Toubkal. We used click excursions twice: Ourika Valley Day Trip from Marrakech and Day Trip Asni & Imlil with Lunch In Kasbah Toubkal.Click were recommended by the community Facebook page run by customers of the hotel we were about to stay in so we booked it in advance. We were emailed the night before the excursions to confirm the pick up times.Both were whole day trips to different areas of the Altas Mountains and both involved a walk of about 2 hours in some fantastic scenery. The dearer trip included lunch at the fantasic Kasbah Toubkal where the set menu of morroccan food was fantasic. The Toubkal Fort is an amazing place and well worth chilling out at over lunch.Ourika Valley is fun,beautiful and great value for money, but the food in not included.We couldn't fault the service and at the end of the trip our driver handed his phone over so we could chat to his manager to make sure we were happy. Wi-fi had been available and all the staff were very friendly. We had worn trainers for the treks but if I had space in my suitcase I would have preferred to wear walking boots or shoes."

The next day our driver, Isham, was waiting at our hotel at 8.30 sharp. The car was comfortable and spacious and we were the only passengers. We left Marrakech and Isham gave great explanations about our trip, history, the landscape etc. He was also very accommodating to stop for pictures, a toilet break or buying fruit on the roadside. He is also a very knowledgeable guide so the drive really felt much shorter than the 2:45hrs.Ouzoud was fantastic, a beautiful set of waterfalls dropping some 300 feet. Our guide was Muhammed and recommended by Isham. He took a lot of pictures of us, showed me spots where I could jump into the water safely and showed us spots you will not find on your own. He is a very friendly local who knows his village!As we had a great experience we decided to book a trip to Ouarzazate with Isham on the next day. This time we left just after 7 and after a 3.5hrs ride with lots of amazing short stops for pictures and explanations from Isham we arrived at the village where we went into a museum and and a kasbah. Both nice but the best part was Ait Ben Haddouh where Isham arranged another local guide Yasin to show us around the old original kasbah where familes still live. It a was beautiful and experience never to be forgotten. Yasin was great he gave a detailed explanation of how the familes lived and who used to live where. Isham really took care of us. If and when we need breaks he would stop (even though we didn't need any). He would regularly check we was ok. He was completely aware of his surroundings and made both trips feel great and completely safe. Especially around the mountain roads."

            "review": "Excellent customer service. We booked click excursions for half a day of camel riding and quad biking. Communication was great from the start. Pick up was timely and our driver Zakariah picked us up in a clean 4x4. He was knowledgable and personable and really engaged with all of us! We felt completely safe (apart from using a phone whilst driving but hey each country has their own rules!) The camel ride was in the palmerie. This isn't the most picturesque of places and unfortunately a little barren and unkept. You have to wear the traditional dress and scarf on your head to protect you from the sun. It's quite amusing but I wouldn't enjoy wearing the outfit after someone else sweated it out. Luckily we booked our trip first so ours were clean.. They were passed straight on to the group after us! We bought our own scarves from the souk and the guides tied these on our head for us. They take you riding for about an hour on a track. The guide was pleasant and spoke English well. They stop several times for photos. The camels were well behaved! :) Afterwards we were driven to a dirt track for quad biking. I would recommend you where some old clothes as you get filthy. I'm a contact lense wearer and the grit that got in my eyes was really uncomfortable but that's because my goggles broke (they were flimsy) - the guide fixed these for me on the way back. The safety lesson isn't a proper safety lesson but we got the hang of it. You're then driven around a track.You stop mid way for mint tea - this was a little random! Apparently you're supposed to see how traditional Berber people live but we were literally ushered into a room given tea - left to it for fifteen mins and then we drove back. It was nice to have a break but some water would've been nice and a tour of the house?We were then dropped off to the hotel. We could pay the driver in any currency - we paid in GBP. I had a really bad headache and Zakariah our driver was so kind offering to go out to the pharmacy and get me some meds.All in all this was a really good excursion, with a reliable company,great driver and reasonable pricing. I would definitely use them again. Thanks click excursions and Zak for a fab day."

We booked a private day tour to the Ourika Valley specifically asking for a private tour only to the valley with no stops at Argon oil factories so we could spend all of our time at Setti fatma and then after a visit to the souk . We sent many emails backwards and forwards to make sure we got a tour we were happy with and got this confirmed The company then said there was a possibility there might be 2 more people on the tour but they would have the same itinerary as us . We agreed to this and asked for a 9am pick up. the Van was a little late but we were pleased it was just us. so off we went we had been travelling for about 10/15 minutes when the driver said we needed to pick up another 4 people, we explained we had booked a private tour with the possibility of 2 more people but not 4 more he even had our email on his phone saying this, he telephoned the office who basically said if we didnt go as 6 people then we didnt go at all we felt held to ransom as we didnt know where we had travelled to to meet the other 4 people (who were in another van) and we did want to go to the Valley . It ended up taking us 3 hours from pick up to get to the Valley and yes there was a stop at the Argon oil co operative because this is what the other 4 people had booked . Over all we did not get the day tour we had planned and booked and had confirmed so beware of this when booking . Only positive was we had a good driver who was very chatty and friendly ."

He was very friendly, fluent in English and had a great sense of humour. The camel ride took place in the Palmerie and lasted for 1hr. The camel walkers make you wear their scarf around your head and long gown before your put on the camel (It was very hot so you need protection from the sun, but their props are handed straight over to the next group of people). Luckily my friends and I wore our own scarves we bought from the Souks. He then drove us about 20mins out to a remote area for quad biking which lasted 1hr 45mins. It's a very dirty adventure due to the dusty environment (wear rough but comfy clothes as the quads get really hot). However, well worth it for the fun! Zakaria who dropped us back to our hotel, made the excursion more enjoyable because of his personality."

Make you read the end about the unnerving behaviour when taking us back to the hotel The communication was good and the emails I sent was responded to within minutes to arrange the trip. So we had high expectations of the trip and really excited. This is about the best bitThe drive there was pleasant and we shared the people carrier with another couple. The car was comfy and clean. The driver was also carful on the roads. He didn't really tell us much about the area or route No wifi onboard - this was advertisedAircon not really turned on, kept the windows down - again this was sold as a air con vehicle.This was the worst part. We was introduced to \"Mohammed\" who was not dressed as a guide should be. When we saw the other groups the guides looked liked guides and wore a uniform. Not one for judging people by appearance so gave him the benefit of the doubt. He didn't show us anything and it was just a bloke that took us around the path. Given this was a English speaking tour his English was not goodHe kept walking off when we wanted to take pictures and at one point my partner and I lost him. Being honest he was a waste of time so no loss.He overcharged us on the boat ride. The boats should have been 20Dh and when we tried to ask the boat people he interjected and said we would pay later. We then ended up paying 50dh... this was no doubt his commission.The restaurant we was \"guided\" to was again an obvious money making opportunity for him. We tried to Goto another restaurant and pointed us back to the one he showed us. We was told it was a set menu and it was 100dh for the chicken targine. We insisted on the menu and it took them 10 mins for them to bring it. On inspection of the menu it had a lot more than a set menus and plenty of choice. The chicken targine was 60dh and they tried to over charge us by 40dh. We walked off at this point and left the guide and tour to complete ourselves. Big telling sign was the guide didn't eat at the same restaurant and went to the one we wanted to eat at.The trip back was pleasant and the driver stopped when my partner had stomach trouble. However I was asked to speak to the company manager twice about the complaint the complaint I had made via email. As we approached our hotel the driver went past. I asked him why he had not dropped us off and he said he was dropping us last. This meant coming back on himself. Deciding to give him the benefit of the doubt. We then dropped off the other couple. When the driver got back in the car he then said something to us which we found rather unnerving. \"Do you want to know why I really didn't drop you off first?\" At this point this comment sent my partner into a state of panic. I then said \"I didn't know and just tell me\" he then kept repeating the same sentence and the situation was getting very tense, I was considering taking action to get out of the vehicle. I then strongly insisted he told us, he then said his company was offering us a free camel ride and mint tea. We flatly refused and said we wanted to get back to our hotel. He didn't take no at first and ask me to speak to his boss. I spent 5 mins on the phone to him.Whilst the gesture may have genuine the way the trip had gone and the way it had been offered was worrying."

We saw many different landscapes and sights of Morocco. My favourites were the nights in the Gorges du Todra, amazing and overwhelming, and the night in Merzouga in the dunes of the Erg Chebbi in the desert. To be honest the night in Zagora is disappointing, a show for tourists and so crowded that you never feel that you are in the desert, but overall we loved the tour."

Our main driver was Rabai, whom we spent only 1.5 days with, we felt like we knew him since forever. He was a great person to spend that time with and his customer service is brilliant. He made sure we were comfortable the whole time and that we were satisfied with the trip. His respect towards us and also more towards my mother was beautiful. He made sure the journey was comfortable for us and he was so personable we spoke to him about anything and everything. He was one of the nicest people we met. If we ever come back to Marrakech we will definitely be requesting excursions with Rabai again. He is a brilliant person with a beautiful heart and personality. I am sorry it has taken me so long to provide this feedback. The excursions and trips were really good experiences but the fact that we travelled with Rabai made it better as he genuinely cared that we had a good experience. He had so much knowledge about the Moroccan life and it was so nice learning of the culture from his knowledge. He also provided us with a guide for the waterfalls who charged 100 dirhams, Rabai assured us that we only paid the guide if we were happy with the tour, if not we were to refer the guide to Rabai and we would then pay accordingly. He was probably one of the very few people who weren't trying to rip us off on our holiday! Thank you ClickExcursions and a special thank you to Rabai!The quad biking was alot of fun to do, although you're out on dirt roads and you will get dirty and very very dusty. The Ouzoud waterfalls is beautiful, worth taking your time to go around and take in the scenery. Not very safe as you get higher up so have to be careful. Could have done without the tour guide and the information we were given was limited and very general but that might have just been our tour guide."

Both coffee and mint tea there was excellent.After just over two hours we arrived and were introduced to our guide Mohammed who once again spoke great English. He led us from the top of the cascades down winding dirt paths to the bottom. Make sure you have decent shoes trainers would be ideal.... Wish I had been wearing some. We stopped lots for photos and Mohammed took loads of great shirts. Once at the bottom you must go on one of the little boats to experience the spray from the main cascade we took boat to ourselves only 10 Durham. Again the chap rowing took loads of pics for us.Having made it down we took walk up more robust steps to cafe overlooking the falls. Had really nice lunch choice of tagging or kebabs with chips fabulous bread and salads too. After we were served sliced melon and mint tea with sweet Moroccan biscuits. Worked out 90dirhams each about \u00a37 which was great value.It was a pretty steep climb up although there are good stairs on the assent. The most wonderful thing was the monkeys we were lucky enough to see some and Mohammed knew all the tricks to attract them and they sat on our shoulders.Amazing day out great value and this company can't do enough for you"

Lovely scenery and calmness, great way to get away from the Medina Madness..Although we booked online before we went. I would suggest to book when you get here from one of the many travel agents. They all seem to use the same 'guides/drivers'.. and they're considerably cheaper than what we paid. There were others on the same tour as us who paid almost half what we paid. Just a thought for those on tighter budgets."

We also had to cancel our last booking due to it not fitting in with the time we had to leave our villa and reach the airport, they were very polite and completely understood. We were lucky enough to have the same driver for all three excursions that we completed, Hicham, he was amazing, thank you Hicham. We couldn't have asked for a more friendly and knowledgeable driver, as there were 6 in our party we all travelled in his car which was extremely comfortable with air conditioning. His English was excellent and we felt very well looked after by him at all times. Our first excursion was the 'Camel Ride & Quad Bike In Marrakech Palmeraie' we all had an amazing time, Hicham introduced us to the guides and checked on our experience at the end. The guides were very good, I found the quads difficult to manoeuvre though the rest of my family had no trouble at all and were completely in their element. But this wasn't a problem I rode with the guide who also encouraged me to drive again under his supervision! The camel trekking was brilliant, we were dressed in traditional attire and had baby camels following us. Our second excursion was the 'Fantasia Moroccan Dinner and Folklorique Show; we were so pleased to see that our driver was Hicham again, he showed us around the 'Chez Ali' site, advised us on the best viewing position for the show and checked on us before leaving us to enjoy the evening. Our final excursion was the 'Ouzoud Waterfall Day Trip from Marrakech', it was a long journey over 3 hours but we stopped for drinks and the toilet, Hicham made the time pass quickly by talking to us about the sights we passed and his culture. We met our guide and set off, it was a fair walk, not suitable for anyone with walking difficulties but we thoroughly enjoyed it and stopped for a three course lunch, with water (100 dirhams each) at one of the cafes. We also met the monkeys who sat on our shoulders while we feed them nuts. It was another amazing experience, the waterfall was spectacular though rather muddy on our visit due to some storms a couple of weeks previously. Hicham never asked for payment until the end of each excursion, keep spare change to tip the guides and toilet attendants. etc, I would definitely recommend Click and Hicham. Thank you for an amazing experience."

Met the FC Barcelona lover, Abdellah on day 1 and ended up using him to take us all over Marrakech; Atlas mountains, local restaurants, quad biking, camel rides.... He's on time, helpful and chatty.He's very knowledgeable of the local area and also tell you what is a good price to pay for souvenirs and take you to where you can buy genuine items - e.g Argan oil.Highly recommend! It's also cheaper waiting to reach Marrakech and booking with 'Click' directly rather than going through third party websites."

The owner was very friendly, supplying us with Mint Tea and asking us to choose our preferred evening meal. We then went to Waterfall and despite at times torrential rain our guide (at our request) on an hour plus walk to a more secluded swimming and diving area, away from the crowds. It was spectacularly beautiful. We then walked back to the main waterfall and subsequently back to the Road. Our evening meal was excellent, tagline, salad and kebabs. Red wine was great too!!Day 2 was a trip to the caves. Although a long drive, was well worth it with another beautiful walk through the cave. We finished off with a camel ride at Palmeraie, great fun for an hour or so.Our guide for the two days was Rabie and his company and knowledge about all things Moroccan hugely enhanced our trip.Fantastic trip, the extra time the overnight gave us was well worth it. Great guide, great hotel, great attractions. Booking with Click was simple and efficient and they tailor made the visit to our request rather than just an off the shelf package."

Our hotel served breakfast late so we made Abdul wait for around 20mins. He didn't complain a single time. He was so patient with me and my family. As soon as we got in, Abdul provided us with wifi and air-con. His service was brilliant. Despite driving for 3/4 hours to get to Agadir, he was willing to your us around and enjoy the beach with us. We felt like he was a member of the family as he bargained and haggled for us in Arabic/ French. We don't know the language so it was very helpful. He volunteered to show us around and drove us up the mountain, stopping at various stages to take photographs. He even volunteered to take photos of us and didn't complain a single time. He was also willing to dine with us at a restaurant of our choice. I'm not sure if he enjoyed it but it was so sweet of him. We wanted to leave late and therefore it meant we got home around 1:30am. We were exhausted by the end of the night but he did all the hard work - I can't imagine how tired he must've been! On the whole, we had a great day out in Agadir - thanks to Abdul. We appreciate his excellent service so much and highly recommend him!"

We used this company for a day trip from Marrakech to Ouarzazate and A\u00eft Ben Haddou.It was actually only a taxi service.On the way the driver spoke many times about his experience with his previous clients from different nationalities and was comparing the level of tip money he received from them, clearly a warming-up to what was expected from us later on.Ouarzazate was not worth the long drive, A\u00eft Ben Haddou did.Before arriving there we asked to stop to take a photo on the hill, no problem but our driver didn't even stept out of the car to join us or to take a pictures from us with the Kasbah, we had to ask other tourists while, in the meantime, he was on a long telephone conversation in his car.Arriving in A\u00eft, our driver repeatedly insisted to hire a guide which we found too expensive after hearing the price...350 Dirham (35\u20ac).When we told him we were not taking a guide, which surprisingly was already standing next to where our driver parked his car, he then suggested us an entrance to the Kasbah.Well...this was the wrong way ! We had to cross a dry river bed, climb upto the hill and there was only one small entree were we had to pay (only) 10 Dirham to visit one (1) Kasbah house and in the same time we were again harassed by the \"local guides\"to use their service.We returned to the starting point and, like very other visitor, we entered by the bridge.There was only one way to go up and come back down, so, no guide needed at all, besides, what could he have explained ? We already had so little time, just to go up, take some pictures and go back immediately.I'm pretty sure that, not using \"his\" guide, turned out to be pointed into the wrong direction.On the way back our driver received at least 8 telephone calls (stopped counting after 8), many were handsfree but other ones also \"by hand\".Another thing was the many times our driver took his water bottle to have a drink during driving, sure it was hot, especially in a car with aircon that wasn't the name worthy, but it much more save to drink during stopovers.Yes, we had a free mint tea at the end...\"we were such nice clients\"...It was rather cheap compared with other companies...that's why."

He was very friendly, spoke great English and was providing a lot of insight for our first trip to Morocco.

We were picked up at 0900 from our hotel by Abdulah - who might be the most passionate Barcelona fan I met in Morocco - and, along with another couple, were driven out in a modern a/c fitted minivan to the Atlas Mountains.We had a pit stop at Ourika to take in the the breathtaking views of the valley and another at an argan oil co-operative to see how it is made before heading off to meet Muhammad, a local who would guide us up the mountains.The trek took about 3 hours and would be quite challenging if you weren't in the best of shape, but the experience was an absolute joy as Muhammad was an excellent host with our safety his number 1 concern. He was chatty, highlighted points of interest & always reassured us that we could go at our own pace.Once down the mountain, we stopped for a 9 MAD 3 course meal by the river which was nothing fancy but was a welcome rest after walking up the hill in 30 degree heat and gave us a chance to dip our feet in the cool river.All in all, a fantastic day out which was well worth the money, but take water and make sure you have a decent level of fitness."

Camels appeared to be well looked after. Quad bike session was a bit tame, don't expect to be excited if you're an adrenaline junky, but a good experience nevertheless. Brief stop off for some mint tea and a cool down, nice authentic touch. All the different guides were friendly throughout the experience and our driver was very efficient too.

It was a private trip, therefore it was flexible and we could decide whether or not we want to stop at certain places.The only disappointment was that despite higher price (compared to group tours), Clickexcursions offers did not include (and we did not know that before hand) any guide services at the places we visited and felt more like a driver service rather than excursion. You have to be prepared to pay extra if you want a guide to show you around.Our driver Outhmane was an excellent driver. He was driving very professionally and made us feel safe and comfortable. Better English could have helped to communicate more easily but nevertheless he was nice and friendly.We also enjoyed a lot the place where we stayed on our way to Merzouga \u2013 Dar Ayour Guest House.

Our guide, Rabie, was open and helpful, when my sister wasn't feeling well he ran (!) to the next pharmacy to get painkillers. Wouldn't recommend doing this tour on a Sunday as it was very crowded. Wear good shoes, the ground is slippery."

We did three day trips while staying in Marrakech and each were extremely well organised with fascinating attractions and a nice restaurant spot for lunch.We actually had an interesting ordeal as we got stuck in a storm when the roads in the Atlas Mountains got closed and our guide Yuseen (unsure of spelling) got us into a restaurant for the night, gave us blankets, ensured we got a delicious meal for dinner and a restful sleep, despite all the chaos outside. I just want to thank him for taking care of us that night and driving so well across the roads covered in rocks to get us back to Marrakech! He really made sure we were comfortable despite the natural disaster occurring around us! He basically saved our lives out there! In terms of tours we did Imlil, Ouarzazate and Ouzoud Waterfalls and I highly recommend them!!"

The journey to these beautiful waterfalls from Marrakech countryside surrounding and long straight roads in the main, until you start to climb the mountains and stop in the village above the waterfalls. Our guide took us along the top and gave us an opportunity to take photos... The view looking down below was spectacular and took my break away. We then started walking slow down stopping occasionally to view the wares each shop was selling, generally much the same in each shop. All venders trying to ply for your trade but were not at all pushy, just friendly. We stopped and checked out the local wildlife part way down little monkeys who were quite friendly and happy to take fruit from your hand, though my Daughter-in-law went a bit too near one baby who tried to steal her cap!! I think they are pretty well fed by the tourists as they sometimes left what was given to them. They were quite funny to watch darting in between the trees. Just above where the monkeys were we had a good view point of what we were descending down to. from the advantage point you could see way down how beautiful the falls are. Further down again stopped at a view point this time quite near to the falls where you caught the spray, quite cooling on a hot day! Eventually after more shops and stops we reached the bottom of the majestic falls. Absolutely stunning. Myself and daughter-in-law went on what can losly be described as a riverboat - oil cans tied together to make a raft and dressed up with atificual flowers basically. You had to pay for this privilege of 5 min raft trip, but it was quite good almost going under the falls themselves. Some great views looking up to the falls. after desembarking quick photos opportunity we began the long ardious climb back up. I had to stop a few times to get my breath back but took my time and eventually got to the top shattered but glad I had made the effort - it was so invigorating and a beautiful sight. Well worth the boring journey. on the return we stopped off at some caves but I just couldn't manage to walk down to see the view through. Doing this however made the return journey not quite so boring or long. All in all we had a really wonderful day returning back to our hotel shattered. I would say this excursion is definitely NOT recommended for people with walking difficulties or medical issues relating to breathing."

Our driver from Marrakech into the mountains was Abdullah, a private driver who works with Riad Tizwa. He spoke great English and had wonderful stories to tell about his life growing up in a Berber settlement in the Atlas Mountains. Our hiking guide was Khalid, a very kind former English major who not only led us up the trail to the waterfall but helped a number of other hikers make their way up the slippery trail. The two guys, Abdullah and Khalid, could not have been nicer and more knowledgeable."

Marrakech shopping trip, Ouzord waterfalls and Essouria.Our driver Rabai is an asset to his country. He presented the country beautifully. Rabai always arrived 10 minutes before pick up time and was a careful, friendly and professional driver. We learned many facts, tips and advice from Rabai. This enabled us to enjoy our trip and make the most of it. Along the way we were able to use wifi to connect back home. The company prices are a lot cheaper than what our hotel offered & they are more organised. We stopped on the way a few times to buy things and take picture. Rabai always asked us to take our time and never rushed us. I would definitely recommend click excursions and Rabai. I will definitely be using the company again. Shukran for making our stay to Morocco so welcoming and enjoyable."

The trip to the sahara from Marakech lasted about 8hours and 40mins on camel to get to your tents. Once you get to your tents you are welcomed by Berbers who give you mint tea show you to your tent and make you confortable. Unfortunately we went during some bad weather and where unable to enjoy a fire outside, howeve the food they gave us for dinner was really good and after dinner they provided us with some music and singing and invited us to dance with them. It was an amazing experience and although we only had 1 hour sleep due to card games and mint tea I really enjoyed the night. Still got to see stars and beautiful sunrise in the morning. Unfortunately due to bad weather on our way back to Marakech the only bridge to take us through the Atlas Mountain was destroyed by the rain. Abdullah was great at investigating what was happening and called his manager to ask for alternatives. After waiting about an hour or so to swe if we could go through atlas mountain we where told it would take 2 days to fix the bridge and therefore we had to drive to Agadir and the Marakech which took about 16hours. Abdullah kept making sure we where ok, never complained about the 16hour drive he had to do, his manager paid for our dinner and Abdullah drove us safely back to hotel!Thank you for the amazing experience. Even with the 16hour drive back.Quad biking tour was also pretty good. Unfortunately i didn't catch our guides name, but he was really good and helpful. Not sure if my bike broke down or I was a bad driver, but I had to hop onto the guide quadbike and drive with him, still a very good experience and he took over on the hardest bit to make sure i got the full experience. We stopped for tea and bread where everyone was friendly and although their English and our arabic wasn't very good we still managed to understand eachother.Overall, I would reccommend Click Excursions if you are looking to book anything. They where the cheapest we found and both the experiences where amazing."

We couldn't pay with card when we booked which was a small problem but you pay the driver in cash (either Dirham, Euro or pounds) which is fine. Despite worrying as we couldn't get hold of the company by telephone; everything was arranged perfectly and our driver Hicham called our Rhiad to let us know he had arrived. There was 4 of us and we paid \u00a330 each (420 Dirham). The taxi was easy enough to find with the help of our Rhiad owner (strongly recommend a map) and we were pleasantly surprised to see the trip would be private. The car was a very comfortable 4x4 with air con and even wifi. We were able to eat in the car and Hicham stopped at a cash machine on request and half way through the journey for a toilet and drink stop at a service station. The drive took around 3 hours and was beautiful through the countryside and mountains. A perfect quiet retreat from the city. Hicham told us little facts along the way.When we arrived we were met by a guide - we had read that these weren't necessary and are still unsure if he was part of the package but he was very helpful and interesting actually and was very happy with the tip we gave him. If you can't afford a tip perhaps check with the driver if the guide is included. The waterfalls themselves are stunning. The walk is mostly easy with some slippy moments. It's long and hot but so stunning it's no bother. At the bottom we paid 100 dirham for the four of us for a boat around the waterfall pool, which was a great experience but there was no pressure from our guide to do this as there's also a small bridge. Half way on the walk up we stopped for food and the restaurant our guide suggested allowed us to eat our own picnic at their tables as long as we bought drinks. An amazing view of the falls and the food they were serving looked great. The walk took around three hours before we headed back to the car where Hicham met us and allowed us to sleep on the way home. A great journey well worth the money, and very easily arranged despite some initial confusion."

It felt luxurious to have a car to ourselves. Booking online was easy, and I loved that you could pay afterwards.

Me and my family visited Marrakech recently, and after reading certain reviews, I chose to book Camel riding and Ourika Valley with Click Excursions. Ahmed was very helpful and accomodating in booking both activities for us in the last two days that we were there and he was flexible in working around our time. We had left for both activities at the time it suited us and Ahmed with his very polite attitude and personality, helped me decide to go with this company. For camel riding we had Abdel to collect us from our Hotel Du Golf and was very kind and made us feel comfortable. The second day we had our tour guide Outhmane to take us to the Ourika valley, Atlas mountains and Berber villages. He was an absoloute pleasure and very talkative. I would definately recommend Outhmane as a tour guide. He let us connect our music to the car bluetooth and we enjoyed the trip very much. He did not rush us at all although we left a little late. Mohammed at the Ourika valley took us to the waterfalls and also was a great tour guide. He did not rush us with the hiking experience and took his time and helped us to get to the waterfalls which was very challenging. The best bit was that they all worked around our preferences and were such smiley people. When we went to Berber villages, Saleh took us around the museum and gave us an insight into his culture and introduced us to his family. What an absoloute pleasure to meet Thankyou Ahmed, Outhmane, Mohammed, Saleh and Abdel for a wonderful experience. Will definately contact you again when we visit. Sameena"

We had the best desert trip we could have imagined: After some unsatisfying experiences with some guides in Marrakech we were a bit scepital about what to expect.. but it turned out we had no need to be worried.Rabie, the nicest and best driver you can imagine, picked us up from our Riad very punctual. He was quite talkative and well informed about all sites as well as about the overall political situation in Marocco. Thus, we had good talks and got to know a lot. This made the long time you spend in the car flying by. Not to forget: Rabie is a very good and safe driver, so we really could enjoy the serpentined roads through the High Atlas.The hotel we spent the first night was amazing: Located directly next to the gorges we had a spectacoules view in a spectacoules sourrounding. The hotel even had a pool and there was a guided tour organzied for us in the morning. So was the camel-ride into the desert: The staff was lovely and took good care about us and the desert camp was absoloutly perfect. We had a nice dinner and a pleasend evening at the campfire.The whole trip was designed very individually. We could always ask for stops and Rabie reacted on our wishes. The only \"problem\" was, that we checked with clickexcursions beforehand that we would be back in Marrakech around 7pm in order to catch the transport to Essaouira we had already booked. Unfortunatelly, Rabie did not get this information and thus was planning our last day in a way that we saw a lot (Ait Ben Haddou, Atlas Film Studios etc.) but could not make it back in time. However, Rabie tried to organize us another transportation to Essaouira and even though this did not work out, it helped us finding a hotel for the night we had to spend in Marrakech. We were back in Marrakech around 10pm, so make sure for the planning of your trip not to have any appointments the same day :-) It really worth it and you definitly need to whole day to explore some of the great sights along the way. Of course it would have be great to have this information beforehand - we could have saved some money (hotel, transportation) - but Rabie handeld the miscommunication he apperently had with clickexursions really professional, so that in the end, we don't have anything to complain but can highly recommend this trip! Thanks a lot, Rabie!!!"

To our surprise it worked out much cheaper to rent a private driver and minibus than to rent our own minibus. Now I do enjoy the thrill of driving overseas, but given Morocco's reputation for speed cameras and police, not to mention that hiring with Click Excursion included petrol, full insurance and a driver, its pretty much a no brainer.I was disappointed with another company's lack of communication regarding our own private itinerary, and a friend of mine recommended Click Excursions. Ahmed was very prompt with his responses, offering us assistance for every question regarding travelling around Morocco. Ahmed even went above and beyond as far as providing us with an alternative itinerary suggestions and flexible payment options.We met our awesome driver Abudullah who was very friendly, warm and accommodating with our requirements. Having Abudullah travel with us enhanced our travelling experience, especially given his local experience and expertise. We had one of the best home made meals in Tamegroute (really enjoyed this authentic local experience), and Abuduallah even mentioned that he would take us to see Goats on a Tree (Which we would otherwise might have missed without prior knowledge of this crazy phenomenon, or if we took the local bus from Marrakech to Essauoria).Our group was extremely happy with Ahmed and Abuduallah for making our Moroccan trip become an excellent adventure, and would definitely recommend their services for family and friends."

After collecting two more passengers we set off for our journey up into the mountains. Our guide spoke excellent English and was pleasant and informative. Soon we started to ascend into the moutains and the views became increasingly spectacular, We had several stops - one at a viewpoint, another at an argan oil co-operative (where we were not pressurised into buying), one for a ceremonial drink of mint tea and a stop to experience walking across the valley on one of the rickety suspension bridges! On arrival at Setti Fatma we met our guide Mohammed who was to take us on a walk up to the waterfalls. This is a fantastic hike but does involve easy scrambling in places. We are both experienced hill walkers (albeit not in the first flush of youth) and were wearing sensible shoes but were still glad, on occasions, of the helping hand offered by Mohammed and relieved that the return route was less steep. Throughout the walk Mohammed was very attentive to all four of us.The scenery was absolutely stunning and the views on the return route were completely different from those we saw as we scrambled up the valley. We were then taken to a restaurant by Ahmed but were not obliged to eat there. On the return journey we stopped at a weekly market in the Ourika Valley which was for the benefit of locals, not tourists, and so gave us an insight into Berber life. We returned to the hotel at about 4.30 having had a really full and enjoyable day out."

Once we arrived near the Ourika Falls, our guide Mohammed took us on a 2+ hour hike up into the mountains. He was a very good climber and was able to help us with any of the trickier parts of the hike. Overall though, it wasn't a very demanding climb even for people like us with next to no experience.

As I write this we are on our last day in Marrakech before flying home tomorrow, we have been lucky enough to go on 3 different tours using click who have been excellent at every opportunity.Our first excursion was quad biking, we could have gone on the Thomson tour but it was more expensive for the same thing and having read the 5 star reviews we decided to give it a go with click. We are so glad we booked with them Abdullah arrived at 10am to collect us from our hotel, he was super friendly and keen to make conversation with us and totally put us at ease. On the way to collect another couple he talked about his love of football and asked about where we were from. Once the couple were collected we were taken to a rather remote village where the quad bikes were, they were all in good condition and the guide was excellent, Abdullah waited for us while we went for the ride, we biked in what they call the Morocco desert. It was perfect and we all got up quite some speed on the flats before nipping round twists and turns. Once we had returned Abdullah drove us back to our hotel where we exchanged the money.After this excursion we booked straight up for the Atlas mountain tour and were pleasantly suprised to find that Abdullah was our driver again for the day, he had a big smile for us and helped us into the minibus. After collecting some other guests we headed towards a typical Berber village where we hit a terrible traffic jam, at no point did he make us feel like we would not make it, he made good conversation and kept us entertained when he laughed at the bikes whizzing in and out the traffic jam. It took a lot longer to get there but we were never made to feel rushed or that we had to be back at a certain time. We had lunch in the Berber village at a lovely restaurant which had a roof top terrace and amazing views of the snow topped mountains in every direction. We then set off with Mohammed for a 2 hour trek to see the waterfalls, don't be fooled into thinking it would be flat it was up the side of a mountain but pretty spectacular when we got there. Wear sensible foot wear as you practically scale rocks. Mohammed was an excellent guide and was there to offer a hand climbing up and down, he talked fondly of his life and the culture of the Berber people, he described himself as a mountain goat and seeing him skip and jump over the rocks he really did live up to that name. Again another friendly person that couldn't do enough to help you. Abdullah was waiting at the bottom to take us back to Marrakech and our different hotels. Finally we went on a shopping trip in Marrakech with Ahmed who took us in his nice car, we were not sure quite what to expect but it was by far the best trip. He advised us to visit the Yves saint Laurent gardens and they are truely spectacular, he waited just outside and told us to take our time. We wandered round taking pictures and enjoying a tranquil place in a very busy city. Once back in the car we headed to a shopping location near the palace which was like a large department store, in here there was no hastle from people and you could wander round in peace looking at all the amazing item, we were given plenty of time to do this while again Ahmed waited patiently. He was going to take us to the medina but having already been there ourselves we decided to head back to our hotel a little early however once in the car Ahmed asked if we had time for one more stop and took us to visit a riad! This was such a highlight and a real privalage as it was truely unexpected. Down a small alley hidden out of site was a little door but once it was opened there was a courtyard and rooms all above overlooking it, such a beautiful place we think we made the wrong decision to stay in a hotel, we then went up onto the roof terrace and he showed us one of the rooms all very well kept and clean. Ahmed took us back to our hotel and we thanked him for such a lovely morning we had been with him about 3 hours.Click excursions are well priced and good value for money they need more of them in other cities as what they do they excel at, could not recommended them highly enough, thank you all so much.

He drove very well and safely and was prepared to be flexible to suit us. The waterfalls are very spectacular and we had sufficient break in the rain to walk to the bottom of the falls and back up again. A guide Mohammad was meeting us to accompany us on the walk. we paid extra for this although I am sure we could have declined if we wished. However the prices are very reasonable and we also stopped for coffee breaks and had lunch at the square near the waterfall.My husband left his glasses in the car and only realised later in the day. Ottman made a special journey out to the hotel in the evening to return the glasses! Thank-you so much (diolch yn fawr) Ottman. We didn't thank you properly but you can be sure we will arrange an excursion with you next time we come. Best wishes for your forthcoming marriage."

This is a must do trip whilst visiting Morocco!Highlights of the trip for us including Ait Benhaddou, obviously camel trekking into the desert and also meeting our brilliant guide Otman. We also really enjoyed our night just outside Tinghir as the hosts there were very friendly and showed us their village as well as spending the evening catering to our every need.Otman is a great guy to have as a guide, he spoke good English and was very unobtrusive allowing us to enjoy things at our own pace.Would recommend this to anyone visiting Morocco."

The first day of the walk in the valley was a bit more challenging than I thought. But once reaching the cafe by waterfall with a cuppa, it's all worth it. With the help of the local guide Mohammad, he'll make sure you walk in a comfortable pace as well as your safety. The journey to Ouarzazate & Ait Ben Haddou was quite long, but there were many breathtaking sceneries along the way. Ait Ben Haddou is definitely one of the must-go places if you have a day for a road trip. Abdella, our tour guide and driver, was professional and very friendly. If you happen to be a football fan as well, you will admire his wealth of knowledge about football. Abdella is also a very good driver which is one of the reasons to do a second day trip with him. Thank you very much, Abdella! The day trips with you were definitely among the highlights of my time in Morocco!"

Our driver Ahmed was punctual and very informative trying to teach us some Arabic (we have learnt 4 phrases). There were 4 of us in our party and I would also say that the local guide Mohammed was superb and very attentive and would have received a bigger tip if I'd had the change. His assistance as we did the trek cannot be overrated. I do think that Ahmed would have preferred not to go to the market but was very amenable when this was requested and even took us for an apt photo opportunity. We asked his advice regarding a hammam and were directed to the click excursion site.This was also booked and Ahmed turned up to pick us up for this experience. We also used the company for our transfer back to the airport and I cannot fault them for reliability- we did have a different driver here.On a negative side we did have trouble contacting the company via e-mail to confirm the hammam, though this could be due to our last minute booking and telephone communication through our hotel resolved this.There may be cheaper options in Marrakech but I would recommend this company as reliable and competitively price as well as friendly."

My Click Excursions tour and particularly to my guide Rabie Aitnachit were great! In five days (08-12 February) I learned so much about Morocco, its people, geography, history, the Muslim religion, and many other things. Rabie and I had a great time! His efforts and familiarity with the land and culture made the tour the highlight of my trip. I travel a lot and this was a truly memorable experience.I will certainly use your services in the future!"

            "review": "You get what you pay for. Very interesting trip with a small company in a minibus with just 4 other passengers. The cost was just 250 MAD or 25 Euros per person -- I bet many riads do special deals for their clients. That compares with prices of 60 - 80 Euros per person if booking with the larger companies. But when you do a cheap tour like ours, beware of the extras -- we paid extra for the coffee, the use of toilets, the guide (3 Euros per person), the lunch, the ferry across the pond (our guide said we HAD to use it, although there was a nice little bridge just a few metres away!!) and a tip for the driver. All in all, the price came out at about 500 Euros per person -- still a lot cheaper than the prices charged by the expensive excursion companies. So my advice is this -- before you book, find out EXACTLY what is covered. There is probably no law that says you have to use a guide and that you have to use the restaurant he has fixed for you --- but if you do your own thing, you might just upset a few people! The waterfall is very spectacular, and it's worth taking one path down to the bottom and the other path back up to the top again. You need to be reasonably fit and sure-footed -- especially if the ground is wet and muddy, as it was on our visit. The Ouzoud Falls are heavily commercialized, and the shacks used for selling knicknacks to the tourists are themselves strangely fascinating, in a bizarre sort of way. But in our limited experience the people are really friendly -- gentle and kind, and all they are trying to do is make a living in a country of limited resources."

We were determined to get out of the city for a day to see more of Morocco and this day trip to Ouzoud Falls did not disappoint! Communication prior to the tour was great and our driver (Ysheim? I fear I've misspelled that...) was prompt and courteous - we especially enjoyed his stories about Berber culture and commentary on the many different villages we drove through on our way into the mountains. He was very generous with time as well, offering to pull over whenever we wanted to take photos or use the restroom.RE: the falls themselves, as others have pointed out, there are lots of \"guides\" that wait for tourists in the parking lot - you do NOT need them. The path down to the falls is very easy to follow, I can't stress that enough... These \"guides\" are quite persistent, however. We had one actually follow us for a good 20 minutes which was disconcerting, but several (dozen) firm \"No, thank you\"s later we were able to explore the path and the falls undisturbed. It was absolutely lovely!If you're short on time in Marrakech, this tour is a great day trip - and I would 100% recommend Click Excursions to friends. Only wish we'd had more time in Morocco as I'd book our tours with them in a heartbeat."

They offer a wide variety of tours that are all equally nice but depend on how much time you have. I took a day trip with Mahammed to A\u00eft-Benhaddou and the film studios, but you can also do an Atlas mountain tour for instance. What I love about this company is that everything is really organized and that they put you at the center of everything. No crowded tourist buses and a fixed schedule; here you can decide what to do. If you want to stop to go to the toilet or take a photo that is perfectly possible. Same for stopping to buy some breakfast or tea. The trip I did took me the whole day (roughly 07:00-19:00) and I was picked up at my riad in the Medina and brought back there; great service! Also we drove a very comfortable 4x4 like car that was really convenient (could even fall asleep on the way back). My driver was really kind and attentive to me and my friends' needs and was asking us what we wanted to do or proposed some nice suggestions himself. When I visit Marrakech again I will definitely book another tour with these guys because they gave me and my friend a great and unforgettable day! We even had some \"Moroccan whiskey\" (just tea ;)) with Mahammed at the end of the tour! Superb! Booking a tour of your choice in advance was easy to do via their website. In short: highly recommend!"

I discovered Click Excursions in December 2011 and from the moment Ahmed picked us up at Marrakech Airport to drive us to our Riad in the Medina I felt save, secure in this man's company. He is polite, considerate, as passionate about his country as I am about Scotland, comfortable with different languages and personalities. In 2013 he put together a package for us which showed us the real Morocco, I share that experience often. So to be in Marrakech again and not do a tour with Click Excursions would be unthinkable. We chose the Ourika Valley. No disappoinments with Ahmed or the guide but the valley has changed, plastic chairs and tables have moved in, which I guess is to be expected, but I am very happy we saw it 5 years ago when it was natural. Look no further for the trip of a lifetime with a very capable company. Thank you Ahmed, love to you and your family."

Our driver, Ottman, is a very helpful, kind and resourceful man. It was great to travel with him (we even exchanged gifts).The first day we crossed the Atlas mountains, and although it was a little bit rough we enjoyed a great view of the 2.000 metres mountains. From there we went to Ait Ben Hadou, an old Kasba (very famous for being the set of multiple movies). The change of landscape was amazing - from a green and brown view to a sandy one. That night we slept in Todra Gorges. The hostel was quite good, I mean, it isn't a hotel and the room was enough to spend one night. By the way, the rest of the hostel was great (it had pool, also dinner and breakfast were great).The second day we visited the gorges and the village. A guy from the hostel was our guide and he was very nice (we ate together dates from the village). We continued the trip to the desert. We reached merzouga after lunch. There we left our luggage in another hotel and we started the camel ride to the camp in the sahara. We saw the sunset and we had dinner (by the way, it was prepared by a bereber guy, he was very friendly). The tents were better than we expected.The last day we saw the sunrise (very early) and came back to the hotel. There, we had breakfast and we could take a shower in a great looking bathroom. (There was a bathroom in the desert but not shower). And finally, we started our travel back to Marrakech. The landscape was, one more time, amazing...in this ocassion it seemed to be the african savannah.Best value we found with a really great experience."

It's also a very nice climb to make up to setti fatma. It also gives an idea how this area looks a like when you would travel further into the Atlas. It shows rocky mountains combined with green area and fruity area's.Essouira is a great day to the sea and to escape the crowd from marrakech. It gives you the oppertunity to discover an Medina in peace. It's also nice to see the fishermansharbour. You see people bringing the fish in and making them ready for dinner."

Excellent value and we were picked up by Hicham, our driver who was informative and very friendly. He told us lots about the Berber people and we had several photo stops, visited an argan oil co operative, stopped for mint tea by the riverside , wandered over rickety wooden bridges and also visited a traditional Berber home. At Setti Fatma we met Mohammed who guided us on the hike to the waterfalls- he was amazing at getting us up slippery , steep rocks ( wear good footwear) and we met friendly Berber people at the wayside stalls. Ingenious way of chilling drinks! Hicham also arranged for us to be picked up for the airport from our Riad. An excellent day."

A long day but totally worth it - we booked with Click to visit Ouarzazate and Ait Bin Haddou as they offered a very good and fair price for such a long trip, and we were not disappointed. Setting off at 7am, we traversed the Atlas (unfortunately through the fog and low cloud!) to Ait Binhaddou arriving at around 10:30am. We spent an hour wandering the ancient mud walls and stone-hopping the river bed before heading on to Ouarzazate for lunch, finally having a tour of the Atlas Film Studios in the afternoon which was very interesting. Fortunately the clouds had lifted for the journey back to Marrakech and we were able to fully enjoy the awesome beauty of the Atlas on the way back! Thanks to Click, and extra thanks to our Driver who was courteous and drove safely the whole day.A long day (12-13hrs) and a long way, but if you don't have much time in Morocco, I recommend Click to help you see more of this beautiful country."

Much cheaper than a lot of the other tour companies!!We were collected on time from our hotel by our driver Otman. The car was large and comfortable, with free wifi. The journey was pleasant; Otman was a very good driver who told us lots as we drove. We stopped at an roadside olive oil producers, and an Arian oil cooperative. Both were very interesting and there was no pressure to buy at all. The falls at Ouzoud were lovely - an easy walk and we needed no guide, though our driver did offer to arrange one if we wanted. We were given good directions by Otman and plenty of time to enjoy ourselves and relax there. We had a nice lunch at one of the cafes overlooking the falls in our way back up. We met Otman again at the end of the day, and enjoyed some free mint tea before setting off again. The drive back was quick and easy, and we would definitely book with this company again!! Highly recommended, and thanks again to Otman our fabulous driver!"

The falls were as wonderful as everyone else says and our driver, Otman was very good. He arrived on time and told us things about Morocco as he drove us to the falls. We had a comfortable big car all to ourselves which we really enjoyed. Otman arranged a guide for us and we are SO glad he did! Our guide, Mohammed, was excellent and really made the trip for us. He first took us to his home and made us the best mint and verbena tea of out holiday! He guided us along the valley away from the falls, then gradually back towards them. This meant we had the place to ourselves until we reached the falls, which was fantastic. He taught us a lot about the vegetation and other things as we walked and was very patient as we negotiated the path. (Wearing trainers or similar is a very good idea) We did the boat trip at the falls which was hilarious and well worth it. (Do take a plastic bag for your valuables as we got very wet, but had come prepared!) We enjoyed a leisurely lunch overlooking the falls and were very much left to take things at our own pace. We were with him for about 4 hours altogether and highly recommend asking for him if you want a guide. We stopped at an Argan oil production place on the as back, which was interesting. Overall we had a superb day out!"

Hicham Chifunde is the best guy you can catch. He is ponctual, speaks a very good english and is genuinely a good person. We spoke about everything: his culture, our culture, his religion, beliefs and traditions, same for us, and also about football, music, cars, trips... Everything you would speak with your very best friend. He is also a very learned man, as he was constantly telling us histories and details about the places we were passing by. We felt that we made a good friend in Morocco. He was also a good driver and of you think that he's going too fast, you can ask him to slow down with no problem at all. We highly recommend Hicham as your tourist guide.Transport: Van This is the other good thing about Hicham: his brand new van! There was plenty of space in the van (7 seats), it was so confortable, we were listening music from our mobile phones (by AUX cable connection) and guess what? You can also have free Wi-fi in case you need it!Trip - Day One:We started this day at 7am and we went from Marrakech to Ouarzazate and then to Dades. In the way we saw the most amazing (panoramic) views, we saw some small villages between the mountains, we had such a great lunch (bit expensive +-12\u20ac) and we ended the day in Dades, a small river-crossing village in the valley. We spent the night in an \"hotel\" which was a really bad one: full of flys, dirty pool, poor breakfast (but great dinner). This is the only thing that we would change but you also have to think that is one night and you payed less compared to other tour companies.Trip - Day Two:This is the best day of the trip. You start with a walking tour trough Dades where you can have a close look of the Atlas Mountains and its river where families do their lunchs during weekends. We also walked trough some farms and ended entering some locals house and of course, we felt in obligation to buy them a carpet (you really have to bargain there, its more expensive than in Marrakech).After this, we had a 2/3 hours ride to the desert, where we stopped at an hotel to swim in the pool (42 degrees air temperature), to take a shower and rest a couple hours before taking our 2 hours camel ride trough the desert. And here you can watch the most amazing sunset.You end the day with a dinner in the desert, and sleeping in the tents. It's an amazing night, so relaxing and so natural, just beautiful.Trip - Day There:The last day! We started the day with another 2 hours camel ride (your butt will hurt ahah) and we watched the sunrise, which is obviously amazing. Then, the worse part of the trip: 8-9 hours to get back to Marrakech!Despite that, we made many pit stops at local villages and touristics points and we slept some of the time, so it is not that bad.I really suggest you to do this amazing trip with Clickexcursions with Hicham, he's the best! Cheers"

We were picked up promptly outside our hotel by our driver who was very polite and courteous. We were (pleasantly) surprised to have an MPV vehicle for just us 2 but it was so spacious and comfy inside that it made the 2.5-3 hour journey worth it. The driver was happy to give us info on our destination and any questions we had were answered. When we got there, our drive asked if we wanted a guide and honestly told us that it was not essential. We opted out and wanted to explore ourselves, so declined and weren't hassled into getting one. The waterfall itself is amazing! Simple as that! You walk down to the bottom of the falls on a walkway through little souks and cafes/restaurants. You will also see Monkeys roaming freely, so plenty to see on the way down. At the bottom, there are boats that can take you very close to the falls which is well worth paying for. As usual, always haggle for prices. We negotiated to half of what the man originally wanted. Expect to get wet but not soaked. When we were ready to leave, our driver was waiting. I'm guessing there is some time factor involved but we felt that we could have a lot of time to explore. Overall, we were there about 3 hours, including a bite to eat for lunch. We booked from the UK before we left and had to pay when we were there, so budget for this. This was such a memorable experience and we cannot recommend it enough. You will not be disappointed!"

Thomson were charging the same price per person as click were charging for the two of us so it was a really good deal. Initially we were a little uncertain as the confirmation email was quite brief but we needn't have worried. On the morning of our trip we rang click as my girlfriend had been ill during the night. No problem at all and the excursion was moved to the next day. Ahmed met us promptly outside of our hotel at 9am in a very comfortable car and proceeded to tell us about our itinerary for the day. As we drove out of Marrakech he continued to tell us bits about Moroccan cultural, heritage and society. We stopped off a few times to take photos, enjoying green mint tea and sampling local oils. Arriving in Sti Fadma we met Mohammed who took us on a trek up to the waterfalls. It should be noted that it's quite steep and rocky so wear comfortable and sturdy shoes. Having spent time at the waterfalls we took a scenic route back to the village taking in the views and chatting to Mohammed about life in the mountains. When we arrived back in Sti Fadma Mohammed asked if we were hungry directing us to a very nice cafe where we ate by the waters edge. The excursion was excellent value and a really worthwhile day out. Both Ahmed and Mohammed were excellent guides, very knowledgeable and helpful but at the same time gave us space and time at various points to do our own thing. At no point did we feel rushed or that anything was too much trouble. I can't recommend click enough!"

Hicham collected us from our Hotel early the next morning and made us feel genuinely welcome and kept us entertained with his local knowledge on the ride out to Ouzoud. When we arrived we hired a local guide for the day who took us around the amazing falls which were definitely a highlight of our trip. I strongly recommend going out on one of the boats at the bottom of the waterfall and spending some time with the baby monkeys on the way back up! The restaurants over looking the waterfall as also great value for money compared to the city and are just what you need after walking in the heat. When we were finished Hicham was waiting and took us back to the hotel pointing out some interesting places on the way home. We asked him what else he recommend doing on our holiday and he said the Fantasia show was well worth a visit so he booked it for us and came and collected us the next evening. Hicham came along with us and explained fantasia to us and we enjoyed our evening. He even managed to find time to take us to the airport on our last day for the same price as a local taxi which took the hassle out of booking one in the morning. Overall we were very happy with click excursions and would recommend getting a driver you can rely on to look after you when in Marrakesh."

The communication we had with Ahmed in relation to our bookings was first class. Once in Marrakech Ahmed emailed us clear instructions with times and pick up points. On both occasions they sent a driver to pick us up from our Riad. Our first trip was to Ouzoud waterfall. Our driver Abdul was fantastic. He was very friendly and a good laugh but also very professional. He is multilingual and included all tourists in conversation. He knowledge on football was second to none! Once in Ouzoudhe handed us over to a local guide who was brilliant and took us down to the waterfall. Our route down was 'off road' and we were pleased we wore suitable footwear. Once at the base of the waterfall there was an opportunity to swim in the waters and jump off the rocks into the water. There were many places to eat although slightly more costly than in Marrakech the view was perfect! After this we went back up the valley to see wild monkeys who were more than happy to climb on you for peanuts. At the top we met Abdul again who brought us back to Marrakech.Our second trip Hussan took us to the camel ride in the Olive Grove. Again, Hussan was friendly and professional and again handed us over to the team looking after the camels. It was an amazing experience and to say that we've had a camel ride in Africa is just awesome! Following the camel ride we then had mint tea with the locals before being taken back to our Riad.Both trips were perfect and went without a hitch.

The taxi driver came to our Riad to collect us and off we went in a very spacious and air conditioned vehicle. We stopped after just over an hour for a comfort break and then arrived approx 2 1/2 hours after leaving. Our driver arranged for a guide for the day. He was both patient and very information. He was not pushy at all and made suggestions as to where we swam and ate etc, Would recommend this company"

It was a wonderful experience we learned a lot in just a day. The driver Issham was very nice and accomodating and aas on time to pick us up in our riad. :) The tourguide was very careful with us when we were climbing to see the waterfalls. It was an amazing experience. Defenitely will book with them again."

We were tired and it didn't bother him that we fell asleep for the 2 and a bit hour journey, and he would've stopped for a loo break/snack if we had wanted. When there he showed us to the direction of the waterfall, giving us recommendations for a cheap and good lunch. He waited in a cafe and said to be back by 3. The waterfalls were spectacular and we took a rather hair-raising route down to the bottom passing donkeys on thin sand paths....a fantastic place to visit and spend some time people -watching (one of my favourite pastimes!). It was far too hot to eat the tagines that were on offer for lunch so we grabbed a tube of Pringles, 2 bottles of fizz and a large bottle of water (equivalent of just under \u00a34) at the shop at the square before the waterfalls. We took fruit and fed the wild monkeys which wS fab, and headed back to the top. We must have done it pretty quick as we were ready to head back about 2. We found Adissi easily and he had no problem with heading back a tad earlier! He was polite and had no problem answering any questions we had. The car was new, comfy and well air-conditioned. We opted for Click over Thomson and quite happy we did as Thomson let us down a number of times during our holiday. Very easy to book and paid after the trip in Dirham cash. Thanks!"

After lots of research online we found Click Excursions and decided to book a number of trips through them. We did the Ouzoud waterfalls trip, the Spa experience and the Camel trek. It was incredibly easy to book these trips through the online website and I received a confirmation email from the company with pick up times. I was pleasantly surprised that they offered to pick us up from a resort, at no extra charge, which was some 15 minute drive outside of the centre. For each trip our driver arrived promptly and was helpful in answering any queries we had about the day. At each trip we were met by a fantastic guide and could not have asked for better experiences. I thought they were also very good value for money - we paid approx. \u00a360 each overall for the three trips.Overall I would definitely recommend this company for anyone travelling to Marrakech and wanting to enjoy excursions without doing much organising! Ladies definitely should try the experience - was probably our favourite excursion, we had the best time!"

We were picked up from our Riad at 9am and driven across the landscape to first see the Agran oil women at work, and then on to Ourika and the waterfalls in the valley. It is a rather steep climb to the waterfall, but my somewhat unfit self managed to get up there anyway. Our guide was a great guy, helping not just us up the climb, but anyone who needed help. He was informative and friendly. We also stopped by a stone cutters shop. We recommend talking to the old bearded man there, he is hilarious!

He confirmed the details with me including how long we would be then we set off.The trip was fantastic, new and clean vehicle, only comment was the standard of attention while driving along quiet roads (although I experienced much worse elsewhere) but we arrived safely back at our hotel.On arrival at the Ouzoud falls the driver introduced us to a local guide who would take us around the falls. Again I cant fault the guy, he looked after us fantastically never rushing us, and explaining everything we could see - even drawing our attention to things we didn't notice. Brought us back to the driver, who then took us back to our accommodation.Was well worth the money, no crying kids the whole day, loved it. Also at the falls no big groups of tourists in sight.A fantastic day out."

Truely amazing experience of Marrakesh thanks to a wonderful guide.I had alot of reservations about travelling solo, and hadnt planned on doing a tour but really wanted to see the Medina and Souks. I booked last minute, was met at my hotel and was taken to numerous sights along the way. The colours, smells and vastness of the souks are overwhelming but not to be missed. I got to relax and felt very safe as we walked about. While I booked a shopping excursion I found I had little or no interest in shopping, theres so much more to see and do and I was fortunate to have a guide who picked up on that and adapted the tour to a more cultural one. I sampled mint tea on a roof top terrace, tried the local soup in the square and a camel ride at sunset. I really appreciated the generosity in time, I didnt feel like a paying customer I felt like I had a friend showing me around who knew me and what I liked. I would love to do it all over again. Truely amazing"

I chose to book with Click Excursions as although I found their prices fractionally higher than their competitors, they had a large number of positive reviews. I was pleased I did; Zagora the driver turned up exactly on time in a clean, fairly new and well-kept mini bus (which had on-board Wi-Fi and reassuringly centrally monitored GPS tracking). Zagora was extremely polite, professional and an excellent driver both confident and careful on the road taking absolutely no risks. I have read other reviews criticising the driver being unable to speak English and for spending their time talking on a mobile phone. I am pleased to say Zagora's English was far better than my French or Moroccan Arabic and he often offered up information as we drove past or stopped at places of interest. Although he did indeed spend a large part of the journey talking on his mobile, it was always through a hands free headset and, given the trip was over four hours driving in each direction, to hear the driver talking and laughing quietly was actually quite reassuring, particularly on the mountainous roads, as it meant he was still alert at the wheel. We did a further two excursions, one with Zagora again and the other with another driver (I forget his name) who was also very professional, turned up on time though I must say was perhaps a little too fast in driving style. Just to come back to pricing; as mentioned Click Excursions are slightly more expensive and indeed the hotel reception advertised other companies doing identical trips for about ten Euros less per person. However, as a French couple staying in the room next to ours found out, you do often get what you pay for. They booked through a cheaper company and on the day of their excursion were still waiting over an hour and a half later for their driver to turn up with absolutely no word as to his whereabouts or the reason for the delay. I would definitely recommend Click Excursions based upon my experience."

The prices were very competitive and much cheaper than the tour operator. We booked buggies which Isham took us to which was great fun. We also booked Ouzoud Falls but we can't remember the name of who took us here but he was very helpful and friendly, we were in a private 4x4, it was a long drive but worth it, especially having a traditional Berber tagine very tasty.We also booked the Atlas Mountains and we had Abdullah that took us in a minivan which had free wifi! and he was great throughout the day, very informative and friendly and very helpful. We were with 2 other couples and it was a very good day, very memorable, the other couples were very nice and it made it a bit more fun. The tour up the atlas mountains was quite a surprise and not what we expected, it is so pretty and the walk was quite an experience, definitely for more abled people. I think a little more information on this tour needs to be described as it was quite difficult climbing and walking up waterfalls and stepping stones, there is a separate guide from the village that takes you and he does have to help everyone get to the top. It was not a problem for us it was very exciting and one of my favourite tours, but some older people may struggle.Our last excursion was a camel ride which Oussain took us to and it was a great experience all dressed up, it was a very hot day, we asked Oussain if we could get the quad bikes booked for the afternoon after the camel ride and he put us on to his manager Ahmed and he sorted it all out for us and we had a great day. Ahmed thanked us for using them for all our excursions which we thought was very nice. The service and professionalism with click is second to none! Excellent, we would definitely use them again if we ever come back, we had a very enjoyable time, many thanks to everyone."

Anis was super nice and accommodating, and spoke perfect French, which was excellent, as it gave me a chance to really practice mine. His command of English was plenty good enough to keep my anglophone-only wife up to speed. When asked to change up the tour a little and go to some less touristy restaurants, Anis was only too happy to oblige and even made sure we paid a fair price!This was definitely appreciated, as a fair price without a fight is something of a rarity in Morocco.The tour itself is lovely. Through the Atlas Mountains to Ouarzazate and Ait BenHaddou, then onto the Todra gorge (nice respite from the dessert heat) for a stay in a nice riad. A tour though the gorge in the morning (I recommend just walking yourself as the tour doesn't provide much in the way of anything) and then back on the road out to Merzouga. We arrived in the Merzouga a little too early to set out on the camels, so we hung out by the pool at the villa where we left our bags. At around 6:30- 7:00 pm we set out for the Berber camp in the desert with Omar, our camel guide. He was super cool and wasn't bothered by my incessant questioning and made us a pretty good tagine too. Overnight at the Berber camp, then back on the camels to the villa and breakfast. Then back in the car for the long ride to Marrakech. The countryside is gorgeous and photographic opportunities abound. Thanks again to Anis for pulling over whenever we asked to take more pictures.While this trek doesn't take you far off the tourist track (it's a tour!), it does show you a vastly different set of geographies and climates. All in all, it was money well spent and I would definitely recommend it to anyone with the time to do it. And don't hesitate to ask for Anis!"

Book for a Monday to see the berber market at Min Ourika - you won't buy anything but an awesome insight into rural life! Then a trip to a local woman's house who made us mint tea (tip her 20 dirhams) which was superb. Off to the women's argan oil co-op (again tip 20 dirhams) and buy what you want or nothing at all - up to you. Then the drive up the valley and lunch before or after the waterfalls - as you like. A guide is there and prob best to take him. It's a real climb up to the 2nd waterfall and steeper after that if you're intrepid! Tipped the guide 80 dirhams and he earnt every sous of it. Great lunch down by the river and back to the hotel for about 5.30pm. Exceptional value for money and our guide, Houacine was truly superb. All was at our pace with no rush anywhere. A full private day out for very little money. Superb and something you really must do to get a glimpse into life and the landscape outside of Marrakech."

Had mint tea: it was a nice, novel experience.A few days later we took the day trip to essouria. Again, we were collected at our hotel in a nice car by a friendly driver. We did have some issues with this trip however. On the way there we stopped off at a tree with goats standing in it (a tourist attraction). We were told we were to get out of the car and take pictures with it the tree. We were happy to do so as it was a novel and fun thing to do, but as soon as we took our cameras out we were aggressively heckled for money by local men standing at the tree. Our taxi driver didn't help us and suggested the we should give the men some money. A few moments later we pulled in to an Argan oil cooperative. Again, we were not asked if we wanted to stop, we were just told that that was what we were going to do. To be fair, the stop off was really interesting and I am glad we saw the cooperative but it would have been nice to have been given the option of going, or at least being told in advance that we would be making stops (my main issue here being that obviously we were obliged to tip the ladies in the cooperative heavily for their 'free demonstration').We spent 3 hours in the town and had an amazing time- I just wish we had more time there! We had more surprise stop offs on the way back to Marrakech too! Our taxi driver pulled us in to a restaurant and tried to get us to sit down, saying 'you should eat here now'. We were a little bit frustrated at this point as we didn't feel like spending anymore money on things we didn't want and so we refused to sit down. The taxi driver encouraged us to sit down 'even for a drink' but we refused that too (mainly out of principal).The couple we were with on the trip felt obliged to eat in the restaurant and so my group sat outside the restaurant for an hour until the taxi driver was ready to go. This really annoyed us as we would have loved to have spent that wasted hour in the town.. (By the way, this stop was not made so that the taxi driver could eat/drink. It was Ramadan at the time and so he was unable to do so- he just sat in the car).Despite all these hidden extras mentioned above, I still think that click excursions are a reliable company which offer a great service at really good prices. I would just advise all travellers to be aware of these extra charges and to put your foot down when you've had enough! "

Hisham was brilliant. His english was amazing, he chatted to us on the way there, telling us about the areas we were driving through, the culture and history. It was great! His driving was amazing too, we felt super safe. We stopped for a short break and then it was onto the Ouzoud waterfalls. Hisham dropped us off with our guide, Mohammed, the guide that click excursions us. Mohammed was equally awesome and it was just us with him! He took us off the beaten track, showing us all the best places to take photographs, he took photos for us too and they were great! Action shots, scenic, he really should be a photographer! We walked down to the bottom of the waterfalls, saw the monkeys, jumped into the river. It really is so beautiful, nothing I type here will do it justice. We then had a boat ride which was great, taking us really close tot he biggest waterfall. The locals (Children of the Ouzoud) were jumping from really high up. We then had lunch at Cafe Restau Berbere, chicken kebabs, bread, salad, fries, water, melon, morrocan tea all for 200 dirhams - for us both!We slowly walked up to the top, took a few more photos, saw more monkeys and Hishaam was there waiting for us when we were finished. It was the best day of our whole holiday. Hisham and Mohammed really made it even better."

By reading the reviews on tripadvisor we thought this was the best deal.By reading the website we thought we were only going to Essaouira and back. And were free to spend our time there.Before arriving in Essaouira we had a stop at an argan oil 'company'. This was not planned. Women were cracking argan nuts and we had a short explanation on how it was made. The oil they sold there was not (even close to) as pure as we got from our Riad.In Essaouire we had some time to walk around, shop and sight see before we went for lunch. The place to have lunch was sort of 'fixed', even though we asked to stay in the old medina. We had the feeling there was some sort of agreement and the driver got a fee for sending us there. The same as with the argan oil company.Eventually we had a good time there, they are the cheapest around, but we expected to be a bit more \"free\"."

I can't say enough good things about this company, they were excellent!Emails were responded to promptly and we were collected on time for our trip to the falls. For the price we paid we expected to be sharing with at least another couple but to our surprise we had a lovely air conditioned car to ourselves. Our driver Otman was friendly and very professional - along the way he provided insight into Moroccan life and answered our questions. As importantly he let us sleep without distraction on the way back!!The drive out was 2 1/2 hours, on arrival we met up with a group of 4 and together we joined our guide Mohammed. Some reviewers suggest you dont need a guide but we suspect they only say that as they dont know what they missed. My wife will openly admit that she isnt the most athletic but Mohammed took time and care to ensure she managed to traverse the more uneven parts safely. It was made clear to us that the guide would be extra but we were happy to pay - we tipped more than we thought we were going to because of the superb job Mohammed did.Once at the bottom of the falls we had ample time for a swim and to marvel at the diving skills of the locals. The walk down and back up was spectacular, on the way back we stopped for lunch with an excellent view of the falls. We also got to see monkeys!We thoroughly recommmend this trip, the Ouzoud Falls are superb and the whole trip was well organised. We were so impressed we ditched our hotel airport transfer and booked one through Click Excursions. Abdullah arrived on time and regaled us with his knowledge and enthusiasm for football!All in all we wouldn't hesitate to recommend Click Excursions."

We just booked online, they came to pick us up in the reception took us there and we had a long tour. The staff were very friendly, a bit cheeky, but it was fun. It was exactly like any other tour. The price was cheaper than we expected which was fantastic.The only thing I wasn't too pleased with was; when the driver came to collect us from our hotel, he literally sat outside waiting for us to come and find him. We had to take the initiative and ask around, tell the reception to call them to find out where he was etc. So you must have initiative to speak up or else you'll be waiting all day and possibly miss your excursion! We used clickexcursion for quad biking. (their bikes were a bit rugged BUT they were big and you could tell that it was better than the tiny fancy ones all the other excusions used)"

We told Ahmned what we wanted to do and he came back with a perfectly set out Itinerary. We did a total of five tours and the two airport transfers. One set price for everything and we paid when we got to Marrakesh. We were picked up by Abdulah from the airport and from then on we didn't look back. He was professional and so polite and his English was excellent. We then visted Atlas Mountains, Ouzoud Waterfalls where we met a guide names Mohammad, what a brilliant guide, is local knowledge was brilliant. We also did Marrakesh Shooping tour, Essaouira Fishing Villiage and Ouarazate. The latter drivers were Ahmed and Annis. Ahmed owns Click and he was obviously very professional and knowledgeable. We also had Anis for more tours than any other driver which was good because we got to know him and he was very good too. Overall, we would recommend this company to anyone wishing to travel to Marrakesh and see the sights."

We weren't quite sure what to expect with Click Excursions but we decided to take the risk as the trip advisor reviews were good and they offered the trip we wanted for a good price.On our 2nd day we took a day trip to Ouzoud Waterfall. Our driver from Click Excursions arrived at the lobby of our riad (which was hard to find) right on time and ready for us. We were expecting a mini bus with other people but to our delight it was a comfortable private car. Our driver,Isham (hope I spelt that right) was brilliant. He gave us lots of information and insight about Morocco whilst on our drive to Ouzoud and spoke brilliant English. He answered any questions. gave us info we needed straight away about our trip and even offered photo stops along the way for the incredible scenery.2.5 hours later we arrived at Ouzoud and we met our guide (which we expected) to show us around. We had a wonderful hike from the top to the bottom, and our guide was an amazing photographer! He had no problems showing us the best spots for pictures and showing us all the produce they grow there etc.The driver then met us promptly after our trip and drove us all the way back to our Riad. We had no problems with the journey or payment. Everything from communication beforehand to the actual day went smoothly. One tip, just make sure you confirm all prices via email (for both the excursion AND the guide there if you want one) to avoid any surprises. I definitely recommend for day trips in Morocco!"

Most companies we came across wanted money upfront, this is what I liked about click excursions, it was pay upon arrival. Our first trip we wasn't sure if they were going to turn up but dead on time we were greeted by the lovely Abdul! We had a laugh with Abdul who drove us to our first trip to Ali baba! Abdul stayed within reach all trip but not close enough that he became annoying, if we needed him he was around! He then took us back to our hotel and told us our driver will pick us up tomorrow. Sure as dead on time the next day we had abdulah another lovely chap who spoke very good English and again was easy to laugh and joke with. Our third trip we had Abdul again which I was pleased about to see a smiling face early on in the morning! We drove to the camel trip and again Abdul was hanging around waiting for us and there if and when we needed him! We did not want to go back to the road we was staying at so Abdul kindly dropped us off where we wanted to go which was very kind of him!I would recommend this company to anyone looking at doing some day trips, they are very cheap compared to other companies also!Thank you to both Abdul and abdulah for making our trips ones to remember! !"

We visited Ait Ben Haddou and Asil showed us round, introduced us to people and took photos with us. He took us to paddle in the river which was special. Asil was very happy to meet our needs (toilet stops ect) nothing was too much trouble. When we arrived at the camels to take us to the desert he made sure we had enough water as there is none available at the camp site. We really appreciated this thought. Camping in the Sahara was AMAZING! Well worth doing. The Berber people are lovely and very welcoming. Asil picked us up on time from camping and drove us back well. The second day was hard as had no sleep in the desert (nobodies fault- just hot!!) and we wanted to get back. I would definitely recommend this excursion and Asil as a tour guide. Just be aware that it is a long couple of days- give yourself some time to relax afterwards!"

We decided upon the 2 night/3 day Marrakech to Dades Gorge/Merzouga Desert with return to Marrakech. Abdul was our driver and he met us right in front of our Riad at the specified time communicated beforehand. The vehicle we rode in was a newer van, very clean and comfortable. Abdul was a great driver. Everything was as it said in the trip description on their website. Abdul stopped on along the way for us to take some great scenic pictures and was nice enough to take some photos for us so that my husband and I could have pictures together. Our first night we stayed in a nice Riad near the gorge which had a beautiful view. All of the staff there were very friendly and accommodating. We had dinner there which was very delicious. The next day we made our way to overnight Merzouga desert stay. Again, stopping along the way for any scenic photos and nice lunch. Once arriving in Merzouga we arrived at a hotel near the dunes. Here we had a room to rest a bit and leave any items that we did not want to take along the desert trip. Very friendly staff at this hotel as well. Around 4:00pm we headed out on camels lead by two guides to our overnight desert stay. The ride took about 1.5 hours but the views are amazing and riding a camel was neat experience. Once we arrived to the camp we climbed up the dunes to watch the sunset which was one of my favorite parts. I was pleasantly surprised on how well equipped the camp was. They had a fully functioning toilet with a sink, soap, and towels. The tents were more like little rooms nicely decorated with full bed and light switch. Outside they had rugs laid out with tables and chairs to lounge. We were served a deliciously prepared Moroccan salad, rice, chicken tagine fruit by our guides. After dinner they performed a few songs for us and then we turned off the outside lights to enjoy the beautiful starry skies. We woke up early the next day and watched the sunrise while riding back to the hotel on the camels. Once back at the hotel we were served breakfast and were able to shower in and get ready in the rooms provided before. We then were on our way again with our driver Abdul back to Marrakesh. This was long drive back but still enjoyable as were able to take enjoy the views and take in more of Morocco. My husband and I decided to stay in a different Riad then our first night in Marrakesh and Abdul was kind enough to call the Riad for us and let them know when we plan to arrive. We also very grateful to Abdul as he was very kind to lead us on foot to our Riad in Marraskesh. The Riad was tucked away down several very small roads only available on foot and if Abdul did not take the extra effort to take us where the Riad was we most likely would have been lost or it would have taken a lot longer to find on our own. In all this trip was a once in lifetime experience and we enjoyed every minute of it. Thank you again to Adbul for being a fantastic driver and guide to us throughout our journey!"

We were picked up right at our apartment and taken on a 2 1/2 hour car ride to the waterfalls, with one stop for a bowl of soup on the way! Unfortunately, I can't remember the driver's name - he was very polite, though he did not know much English. Fortunately for us, my wife speaks French as well, so we got along fine.The drive there was interesting, seeing the countryside and how people live outside of the city. A warning for those with carsickness, the roads are winding, and my wife started to feel sick - the driver provided a plastic bag in case she needed it, though she was okay.Once at the waterfall, we went with our tour guide, Mohammad, who was very nice and knowledgeable. He lives in Ouzoud so he knows the place well. He took pictures for us when we wanted them, and took us on a little side tour of an Argan farm (the Argan workers will ask you for tips if you do this).The falls are fantastic. We chose to swim, though it was March. Mohammad seemed to think we were crazy, but he let us swim anyway. The guides there all know each other, and they helped my wife when she wanted to jump off a small cliff (she needed some persuading). They all had good humor about it though.At the end, we had a 3-4 course meal at a restaurant (salad, tajine, fruit, dessert, mint tea) for about 10 euros! It was wonderful food and really filled us up after the hike. And of course, there are monkeys at the very end of the hike as well! Mohammad gave them peanuts and had them jump up on our backs! (We were unsure about fleas or disease. It's been about 2 months now though, and we're safe!) What a great day trip from Marrakesh! If we had stayed longer, we would have definitely chosen to do more day trips with Click Excursions. Great price, excellent guides, and memories we will cherish forever."

Ahmed picked us up and told us all kinds of cool facts about Marrakech and was super helpful. He spoke excellent English and we were very happy to have him! He did a great job.When you get to the camel site, they dress you in typical Moroccan clothing for the ride to protect you from sand and sun (or maybe just to look cool-we got great photos with the clothes!) Then, a guide leads you on a camel for about an hour, and the guides are so cool, mine made me a camel ring out of palms! Our camels were Madonna and Titi and they were adorable.After the ride, they offer you typical Moroccan tea (I fell in love with this tea). It's the perfect way to end the ride. This was a great excursion at a really good price and I highly suggest booking with Click Excursions if you want to ride a camel while in Marrakech! I did my research and decided Click Excursions offered the most for the best price, and we had a great time!"

I wasn't expecting much as I don't normally take tours but it was one of the best experiences I have had travelling. The trip was organized by my girlfriend and my brother, so I didn't know much about it beforehand. We were picked up right at our hotel in a very comfortable new mini bus and to our surprise had wifi provided the whole time. This was all nice, but the best part was having Abdullah as our driver. I couldn't say nicer things about him as he made everything go by so easy, didn't try to overcharge us, didn't take us anywhere to buy things and even steered us away from hagglers. On top of all this he was really friendly and very informative. I can honestly say this is probably the best experience I have had on an organized tour as I usually feel like I am being pushed around and being sold things the whole time, but Abdullah made it feel really pleasant. All the attractions along the way were really obviously incredible. Ait Benhadou is a little touristy for my liking, but the Todgha gorges were magnificent, especially because you spend the night there and get to have it without all the tourists. All in all I couldn't have asked for a better time, and I would recommend this to anyone going to Morocco. If you can ask for Abdullah you should, as he should be listed as part of the tour he is that good!"

We contacted the tour operator a day in advance outlining the activities we wanted to do (camel riding and ATVs) and they got back to us within an hour with an itinerary and very reasonable price. Things went very smoothly the next day and we had a blast! I definitely recommend them to anyone traveling to Marrakech."

I thought the trip was shared with other people but we were surprised to see it was just for us, which I think is a pretty good deal for the excursion price. Abdullah showed us many things, was very flexible and stopped everywhere we wanted to. He is a very intelligent person, so we could enjoy listening to lots of topics such as Moroccan culture and ways of living. and of course, football! He is an absolute expert, the only downside is that he is a huge Bar\u00e7a supporter!! The overall experience was great and I would highly recommend it."

            "review": "Desert tour 3 days. We were looking for a 3 day tour and went through all the options on the internet and also wondered whether to wait and book when in Marrakech. Click Excursions was great value compared to some other tours. Initially we were sceptical about why this might be, but other people had left good reviews so we booked with them.Abdullah was our driver. He met us at our riad at the time specified (7am). He bought us water for the trip and we were in a mini bus type vehicle with wifi inside. The first day included driving for the morning over the atlas mountains (3000-4000m) with many panoramic photo stops which Abdullah was enthusiastic about. We arrived at the UNESCO heritage site at lunch time and he directed us where to walk to the top of the village, how to respond to guides trying to take us places and where to meet him after for lunch (he didn't eat with us). We set off again through amazing ever changing landscapes, the rose valley, Ourzizate, so many places we lost track, and ended up at a riad which we didn't know anything about. Abdullah kept all belongings safe, he checked how we were, we all talked (luckily he spoke Arabic, French, some english, Spanish, Italian) and left us to enjoy the evening. the riad was lovely, with a pool, it was homely and had good food (included in the price). We were up early again (were offered a short walk with a friend of the riads through an old part of the village- we declined a visit to his house!!! and gave a small tip). Then we were surprised to find out that when we set off driving again we were infact around the cornet from an amazing gorge with river running through which we had time to walk through and enjoy. We had about a 3 hour drive- arriving in Merzouga after many more photo stops. The hotel was very quiet and in a sort of new build area next to the dunes. We were provided lunch (soup tagine and fruit- Abdullah called ahead with orders as he was concerned about us only eating in good places) and had the afternoon to relax. the lunch was a reasonable price. The hotel had a pool and we had chance to shower and rest and had a room so that after the desert we could come back in the morning and shower etc. At 4pm we were let by our guide, who we learnt had been a Nomad, and shown our camels. We had about an hour/ hour and half camel trek before sunset, out to the desert. It was just 2 of us and the desert was quiet, but we felt perfectly safe and learnt 4 other people would be camping that night. Arriving at the dunes we had time to climb slowly up the dunes to watch the sunset. We were first to arrive and could see to Algeria and across kilometres of dunes. Our guide started making tea and dinner later whilst we had free time. The camp had a cute desert cat! The tents were more like huts with proper metal frames and electricity from solar power. Proper beds and flooring over the sand. The only basic thing was a toilet in legs which when it got quite windy later added a sense of adventure to the adventure! We all enjoyed drumming and singing later and had plenty of food and tagines, tea and fruit. It was too cold in march to sleep outside but I believe you can in summer months. We got up at 5am (with a nice wake up from the guides) who discussed with us how we wanted to see the sunrise. We opted to start our trek back, on the well behaved camels. We enjoyed the amazing sunrise from the middle of the dunes, due to the month it was silent and not many other people trekking so a once in a life time experience. When we were back at the hotel by 8am, we could shower and breakfast was ready. All the drivers were having breakfast and chatting too- the universal language of football. We set off again when ready for the long drive back to Marrakesh- this was via more incredible scenery, a stop for a nice lunch in another town. When heading back over the mountains, the weather changed and it was thick fog and snowing!! Abdullah drove slowly and carefully round the hairpin bends and we arrived safely and slightly in aw of the whole experience, back to Marrakech at around 7pm the third day. Click excursions were fantastic, Abdullah made us feel safe and cared about, if you are happy with a bit of the unknown and uncertainty and take the drive as part of the amazing journey then this trip is well recommended and from talking to other people, it sounds like Click Excursions are safer, more friendly, reliable and trustworthy than some other tours. Thanks Abdullah and Ahmed and hope Barcelona are doing well!"

            "review": "our favourite morroccan excursion. My boyfriend and I chose click excursions for a short daytime hike up the Atlas mountains. We were picked up from Eden Andalou hotel early in the morning. From there we were driven in a comfortable car towards the gorgeous snowcapped mountains. Throughout the journey our driver topped us off with interesting information about not only Moroccan culture and landscape, but also about the politics, the role of women in their society and was willing to answer any kind of questions that we wanted to know the answer to. When we arrived we stopped for some bread with olive oil and traditional mint tea - settling with a beautiful backdrop of the surrounding mountains and streams. Consequently we were informed about how the locals (Berber tribes) produced argan oil and even had a go at cracking the argan nuts ourselves. At this point we had the opportunity to also purchase anything from a range of argan products. Following this we drove further on and met a different guide who took us on a walk up the mountains. After crossing streams on rickety bridges and tackling the climb, we were greeted by small but beautiful waterfalls, a magnificent and rewarding view. We sat up there for a while with a glass bottle of coke from a \"Berber fridge\" then proceeded a little further up. Finally we enjoyed lunch on a rooftop terrace allowing us to soak on what we had just discovered. All in all, a lovely experience, very informative guides and beautiful landscapes - would definitely recommend. Thank you!"

The guide took me on a trek up the maintain and past some beautiful waterfalls, informing me of their village life and culture throughout, before returning me to hicham.

We had a very prompt and efficient response from Ahmed to our email requesting a guided tour of the Souk and the Atlas Mountain day trip. Our driver for the Souk visit was Hussein. He arrived in a very clean and comfortable vehicle and was very friendly and professional. Ali was our guide around the Souk and, again, he was very professional and extremely knowledgeable. We were given the option of looking at the Berber Pharmacy and other \"commission-making\" outlets. Ali made it quite clear that this was at our discretion. Ali's anecdotes and historical knowledge of Marrakech made it a very enjoyable and interesting morning.Our second tour with Click was to the Atlas Mountains. Ahmed was our driver/guide and he gave us a very memorable and enlightening day. He arrived on time at our hotel in a very clean and comfortable vehicle. Our drive to the Atlas Mountains was interspersed with a break for mint tea and olives at a caf\u00e9 on the river. This was most enjoyable and we embraced the beauty of the surroundings in the brilliant sunshine. From there we visited a Women's Group Co-operative selling argan oil products. There was no pressure to buy and the experience was very interesting. Ahmed passed on lots of local knowledge and was delightful company. We travelled further into the mountains and had a walk to the Waterfalls with a local guide who was excellent (we gave him a tip, which was no doubt expected but we didn't feel pressed to do so). Afterwards, we were given the option of having lunch on the rooftop of a local restaurant overlooking the river and mountains. It was a pleasant way to complete our stay in the mountains before heading back into the city. The day was very relaxed and Ahmed was an excellent driver/guide who made our trip most memorable. We will definitely use Click again if we return to Morocco and can fully recommend this company."

We wanted to explore the surrounding areas and meet the locals (Berbers), and when I looked on the Internet, Clickexcursions were amongst the cheapest.2 excursions:- 1st excursion: Ourika Valley. I went on my own but I was with another French couple. Ahmed drove us there and back. Lovely landscape, good knowledge of the area. we stopped a few times on the way (for tea, to visit an argan oil coop, and to go and see the small waterfalls). For the waterfalls, a guide took us there (we gave him a tip at the end (5dirhams each I think), that's part of the culture and to be fair to him, he deserved his tip. Some other guides weren't that attentive (esp when climbing the rocks)- 2nd excursion: Ouarzazate and Ait BenHaddou. We were recommended those 2 places by some friends of mine who went there last year. Soooo worth it. And yes, it is a VERY long journey but you can ask the driver to stop as many times as you want on the way. It took us almost 5hours to get to Ouarzazate and 3hours back. We probably would have skipped the cinema studios but decided to visit them in the end (quite expensive for what it is). visit of Kasbah Taouirt (Hamish the driver warned us that they would force us to take a guide to visit it, so we declined but they were very insistent that we would get lost. Don't get fooled, it is a bit like a labyrinth but you don't need a guide, esp at the price they ask for.AitBenHaddou, gorgeous site. We got dropped to the restaurant the company seems to take its clients. It would be nice to have a choice if I'm honest but the food was good. After lunch, We were asked whether we wanted a guide to visit the site. We dropped the price to 75dirhams because we didn't want to spend 100dirhams ( you can decline though, but we wanted to have some further info about the place). The young lad was very informative and nice. The journey back was a lot quicker, Hamish didnt hang around (which is what we wanted, we love a bit of speed too :))Overall, great experiences, lovely people. Take plenty of cash with you for the extras (lunches, tips, guides ...). It would be nice to have complimentary water bottles as part of the price as it can get pretty hot, and you never know when you'll stop next.Vanessa & Rob"

The other was not so great unfortunately.The first one we did went to the Ozoude waterfalls. I cannot fault the waterfalls, they were stunning and I would recommend everyone visits if they're in Marrakech! The car we were driven in was lovely and for the most part the driver was nice. However, at the end of the trip he asked us for an extra 20 euros, or 200 dirhams, claiming it was for the tour guide who had shown us round. The guide was lovely etc. but it was an unexpected charge on top of the amount we were already paying. It was quite a lot of money too, we are students and had budgeted for each day so were shocked to find it was a lot more than we'd thought. Also, the driver got pulled over by the police while we were out for speeding. He wasn't a bad driver and speed cameras can be frustrating for everyone, but before he got out to speak to the police he asked us, quite impolitely, to give him 50 dirhams straight away. We didn't have the money so couldn't, but I am still confused as to why he asked us for this before getting out and speaking to the police. It didn't seem appropriate. he spent the entire time loudly on the phone to his friends, which isn't a big deal but wasn't great. He also turned up to pick us up outside Cafe de France 10 minutes late. Essentially, he was friendly enough but not very professional.The second excursion was a completely different story and is the reason the rating I have given is still so positive. We went to Ait Benhaddou. Two other customers were in the car this time too. The car was early, already waiting for us. The driver was kind, polite and very helpful. He was quiet (not on the phone at all) but it was clear that he was friendly and almost protective of us. He was excellent. He pulled over whenever the others asked so that they could take photos and was a very good driver, which was great as the trip took us over winding narrow mountain roads that may have otherwise been nervewracking. He asked if any of us needed the toilet or a drink on several occasions and gave information about the places we were passing through. The site itself was beautiful and we got back in good time too. This trip was perfect.Overall, it is clear that the company is very good and that most people have an excellent time. Both drivers got us to the sites and back etc. it was just a shame that the first one was not at the same standard as the other. Maybe it was because we are in our twenties that the first man was more laid back with his service. I would still recommend the company, based on the second trip, and because the sites were really beautiful. It's definitely worth visiting them. Bring extra money for lunch out and to tip the guides, which will both be pre-organised."

We also went quadding which was great safety helmets provided and the guide was always checking we were ok.The high Atlas mountain tour is fabulous a guide picked us up in a really nice car and took us through the mountains to the Berber villages, he explained all kinds of things to us and was happy to answer any questions. We took the walking tour upto the waterfall which was great although the terraine is difficult, my mum and dad chose not to take this part as it was walking on rocks up hill and then again down but I was glad I did we were very lucky to see wild monkeys as not really the right time of year when we went, the guide again was great he helped us over difficult parts of the hike ... the 2nd waterfall was a bit harder to get to but again well worth it .... all round 3 fantastic days out with Click would definitely use them again.

He was polite and happy to answer questions but I had already seen the market the day before after I had the camel ride.The one thing that came clear was the Guide was taking us to stalls where he was obviously getting a commission to take us there.He took us to one shop that sold \"oil\" and were taken to a private room and then two people came in and started to massage us and we had no choice and then billed for the pleasure without even being asked. It was clear he was on some sort of arrangement to bring tourists to the shop.Over my time there it was obvious you have to be careful to not get caught out even pay the guide you pay for advise.I would use them again as at least they turn up even if you don't get the full camel ride and the guide will try and tout you for his pocket, they seem ok and its just a Morrocan way of life to try to squeeze that extra out of you."

Nothing was too much trouble and he even showed us the best place to buy spices and gifts! Cannot recommend you guys enough and look forward to coming out later this year and using you guys again. All the best!"

Our driver Abdellah made the whole experience so much more memorable from the discussions in the van on the way out there. He was very informative and laughed alot and was able to pick us up from the hotel and drop us back. A nice van also.Muhammed our guide at the trip was also very relaxed and informative and helped us find the best spot to go for a swim in the waterfall. What a magnificent waterfall also. We fed the friendly monkeys also and ate tagine with a spectacular view. Highly recommend this excursion!"

Compare to other companies Click appeares to be the cheapest offering similar schedules and the good thing is you don't pay until you have had the tour, so can be very flexible. Had a great time in Marrakesh with the 4 tours we chose which filled 3 days. We stayed in a Riad in the Kasbah area so was quite close to the Medina but I was glad to be guided into the Souks as I'm sure we couldn't have weaved through the maze as smoothly and throroughly on our own! The Atlas mountain trip was interesting passing through numerous Berber villages and stopping at several scenic spots and argan oil factory before \"rock climbing\" to the waterfalls. It was quite foggy and drizzly the day we went so the climb down was quite silppery!My 12 year old daughter loved the camel ride in the Palm grove and the quad biking nearby was great fun!Have to give Hammad a mention. He was our guide for 3 of the tours and was a very nice guy with good English and also a careful driver so he is well recommended. We came across many poor Berber children enroute the excursions and was glad that I researched and brought along pencils, pens and party fillers to give out and put a smile on some of these children's faces. We are planning to come back to do the desert tours and will definitely book with Click again."

We were only in marrakesh a few days so wanted to pack quite a bit into our trip. Click were very accepting of this and had no problem adding additional quad biking on to our trip. Abdullah stopped at fabulous photo spots and nothing at all was a problem. The car has it's own wifi and he even went out and bought a duel phone charger for us to use. He also helped us out with change for toilets when we had run out. I had heard a lot about trips taking you to expensive restaurants for lunch but we stopped at some superb places for really good value. As for the trip itself, well that was just amazing. We were the first there and were treated really well. We had extra time with the camels, we sat and drank tea on the sand dunes and were able to want the sun go down. I was a bit unsure of what the desert would be like in zagora but the dunes were still a good size. The tents are comfortable and the food was very very good. Quad biking in zagora was also a fab experience as they took us back out to the dunes which was just amazing fun. Click are personal and great value. We were safe and happy at all times. Thanks for a great trip Leanne and tony"

            "review": "Great week with Click Excursions. My family and I (seven grown-ups) used Click Excursions during the whole week we were in Marrakech (the agenda and price was agreed by email a few days before we arrived). The company fixed us up with the same private bus and driver the entire time (even when we used them as \"taxi\" in the evenings to go to various restaurants). The driver was very, friendly and dependable. He showed up on time every day with a clean bus, and he was a cautious driver so we always felt safe. Among the trips we took were; 1) Daytrip to Berber Village/Atlas Mountains - Yousef was a good guide along on the trip and fixed us up with a great mountain guide (Mohammed, I believe) for our hike up next to the falls. This was a great trip which didn\u00b4t require to much time or energy (although do wear snickers or light mountains boots if you want to hike all the way around - which I totally recommend). 2) Daytrip to Essaouira - a pleasant, though a bit long, drive across the country to the coast and fishing town. The changing landscape was nice to see, otherwise it wasn\u00b4t the most exciting trip we\u00b4ve been on, nor was Essaouira all too exciting. It\u00b4s not a trip to go on in bad weather (we had sun although it was a bit chilly).3) Guided tour in Marrakech - we had a guide showing us around in the city. I don\u00b4t remember his name but he clearly had a lot of knowledge about the city and its history. He also made sure that we weren\u00b4t bothered by salespeople (basically they just stayed away) so that it was easier for us to pay attention to everything around us.4) Guided tour - Camelback riding in Marrakech - this was a fun and easy activity. A guide took us around the Palmeraie grounds for about an hour. He was very friendly and willing to take lots of pictures of us (with several of our cameras). 5) Guided tour to the Souks in Marrakech - we used the same guide as before, and he showed us around in the souks and the areas where we could see all the craftsmen at work. As it was in the morning, the medina was pretty calm and again nobody bothered us on our walk.6) Day trip to Ait benhaddou and Qarzarate - a long but exciting day trip over the high Atlas mountains. This drive is amazing and shows you the grand beauty of the mountains and the amazingly changing landscape before and after. It is simply stunning! This was our favourite day of the week. So, all-in-all, we were very satisfied with our week with Click Excursions. They were fairly easy-going and flexible when it came to meeting our needs and requests. We got a good price for the entire week (80 euros per person), and it was great that the driver was able to drive us to and from restaurants in the evenings (paid extra). He was happy to call the restaurants directly and check their availability for us and how to get us back and forth in the best way possible (some were hidden well in the medina)."

My family (husband and three children) and I had a fantastic day in the Atlas mountains during our recent break in Morocco, organised by clickexcursions. We liaised with Ahmed before we left the UK, telling him exactly what we would like to do as we only had a limited time. He was very accommodating, and tailored our day exactly to our needs. The bus driver, Abdullah, picked us up from our hotel and was incredibly courteous and warm. His English was good (along with many other languages) and he had a wealth of knowledge about the history and culture of Morocco and her people which he was keen to share with us. Once we reached Siti Fatma, we left our vehicle and continued the rest of the trip up the mountains by foot. For this, clickexcursions had arranged for a local guide, Mohammed, to lead us. He was like a mountain goat! He was so agile, and made ascending the mountain paths look very simple. However, Mohammed was also very keen to ensure he aided all of us in our climb (including my 11 and 14 year old daughters), and his English was very good too. What we were also very grateful for was the fact that he didn't make us stop at every seller's table that we passed; we stopped only at those in which we were genuinely interested.Before returning to our hotel, Abdullah took us to the Palmeria, where clickexcursions had arranged for us to have a camel ride. Again, the guide we had, Aziz, was very friendly and was particularly good with the children. After an hour on the camels, the children were keen to get back to the hotel for a swim, and this was not a problem for Abdullah who explained to the camel owners that we would not be staying to drink tea.All in all, we were very happy with the day arranged by clickexcursions. Their airport transfers were also very good, and enable us to avoid the trouble of haggling with the taxi drivers after a night flight. Each time we used the services of clickexcursions in Marrakech we were very happy with the punctuality and manner of the drivers, and with the standard of the vehicles used. We would not hesitate to recommend them to friends, or indeed to use them again ourselves should we be lucky enough to return to Marrakech."

I did not get any pleasure or benefit from this portion, it is a rather long day and I would have preferred arriving back to hotel earlier and dropping this part of the trip altogether. THE REST WAS PERFECTION!!! The day tour we booked was Marrakech to Ouarzazate stopping at Ait Benhadou. We highly recommend this tour group. The booking process on line was very straight forward and they got back to us very quickly.Abdula was our driver and he was great! In some reviews folks mentioned drivers on their cell phones during the curvy/dangerous driving portions who did not use a hands free device, he used a ear piece for his calls and was a very professional driver who seemed to know the route well. He was very flexible with giving us amble breaks, would stop for toilet whenever it was needed and was willing to do whatever was needed to make sure our group had a great time. On the way back he stopped by a local road side fruit stand and purchased fresh fruit to share with us.We would absolutely book with them again!"

I contacted Click excursions for a tour of Morocco for a holiday in August.Ahmed was able to provide us a 16 day holiday that met all our requirements and within our budget which included a beautiful riad in Marrakech.We were provided excellent service from the transfer to the hotel in Marrakech; to the 6 day tour which included Beni Mellal, Ifrane, Fez, Meknes & Volubilis, Rabat and Casablanca.We also had day tours of Fez, Marrakech, Essaouira and Ouzoud waterfalls.The day tours of Fez and Marrakech we particularly enjoyed as we saw places we just would not have seen on our own.Would recommend confirming that tour attraction fees are included in day tours as they were included in Marrakech tour but not in Fez tour.We had a holiday our family will always treasure thanks to the service of this company who were always happy to accommodate our requests.We had contacted many other companies, but none came close to Click excursionsThank you Click excursions and all the staff."

            "review": "Highly recommend for transfers!. We first used servicetransfers.com, which is part of Clcik Excursions, two years ago. We had booked our flight and hotel to Marrakech independently and were looking for someone to pick us up from the airport and take us to our hotel, and then the return trip.We found them on the internet, and to be honest, it all seemed too easy to book. We had confirmation emails, and comprehensive instructions. We were told to pay in full when we reached our hotel. As this was our first trip to Morrocco, we were a little worried that we were going to be left high and dry at the Airport! Glad to say that we weren't. The driver was friendly and polite. He even pointed out places of interest on the way to our hotel. When we arrived, we paid in full - and then hoped for the best for our transfers back to the airport at the end of our stay! Again, we were not disappointed. A driver arrived at our hotel, on time, to pick us up to return us to the airport. Amazing service.When we returned to Marrakech again this summer, we didn't give it a second thought - we had used the company before - had received amazing service and so we booked again on line as we had previously. Again, we encountered a faultless service. Friendly and polite drivers - who were informative and pleasant throughout the journeys. We were given an envelope on arrival at the hotel, with the list of excursions that Click were providing - but due to the fact we were only in Marrakech for a very short trip, we did not go on any - but having a look at the details, they all looked very reasonably priced, and I have no doubt they would have been as successful as our experience. When we return to Marrakech - we will be using the transfers service again - and we will be experiencing some of the excursions that are on offer.Highly recommend - enjoy with a peace of mind that what you ask for, you will receive."

BUT.... once there we we given a full instruciton of what to and off we went - we managed to get a private tour which was was fab. We went over many different terrains, and the hour and a half flew by - we culd have done more, but it was great!

The price was very reasonable, the communication during the booking and throughout was great. On the day of the tour, we were picked up by our driver at our riad, on time and in a new sangyong air conditioned jeep. Which we had for the whole trip. The driver Jaseen or yasseem (im not fully sure how to spell his name) was lovely. He was very nice to us and we had a great time on the tour. Be prepared as this tour is the real deal! We thought we'd go a few hours outside the city see a mountain and then go to a sandpit for a camel ride. Not the case. We went all the way through the highest mountains I've ever seen, to a place you could only describe as like the grand canyon. We stayed in a Dar (small house hotel) there. The Dar was lovely and of very high standard they even had a pool and wifi. The next day we got a tour of the area from a lovely guy from the Dar, who picked wild figs for us and showed us amazing sights. Then onto the sahara. There we changed in another lovely hotel with time for a dip in the pool. We rode for 2 hours into the sahara on camels with a guide and then stayed in a camp in the sahara and slept under the stars (our choice). All in all the food was really good with dinner and breakfast included on 2 days. Everywhere was very safe and a really nice break from the chaos of marrakech. The people were lovely and the standard of the accommodation was great. The driver was very nice too. The only thing to keep in mind is that in order to provide a genuine experience they do actually drive you half way across the country so you will spend a lot of time in the car! But dont let that put you off on the way there you'll be taking photos all the way and on the way back maybe read a book! You will need money for you lunches on average about e10 per lunch (usually 3 courses) and to buy a lot of water and souvenirs!! "

We had a fantastic experience with Click Excursions - couldn't have asked for more, and I will definitely be using them again if I return to Morocco!We booked online in advance for 4 people, but we weren't certain they would actually show up as there is no deposit and I didn't actually speak to anyone when booking or for confirmation. However they showed up at 9am sharp. We had a very informative and friendly tour guide whose English was very fluent, and we drove together in a comfy car whilst he answered our questions and told us some of the history of Morocco. On the way we stopped off at a little cafe by a beautiful little stream, and he asked the staff to move a table and chairs into the stream so we could have breakfast with our feet dipped in the water! It was very picturesque and a lovely breakfast - and the mint tea was delicious! We also visited a place that employs women in need of income, such as widows and unemployed women, who make argan oil products, and we could watch how this happens. We had the opportunity to buy products as well - It was quite expensive but it was great to see the process. We then drove on until the car could go no further, at which point the tour guide introduced us to another guide who would take us up the ~45min hike to see the waterfalls. It was very crowded as it was the weekend and peak holiday season, but still enjoyable. The walk down was much quieter and the views were lovely as well. When we reached the car again, there was some time for us to have some food in a restaurant if we wanted to, and then we drove home. It was a lovely day and I would definitely recommend Click Excursions. I'm just sorry we didn't get a chance to try any of their other tours!"

            "review": "Atlas Mountain tour: A complete rip off! Camel trek: delightful! Click: Simply a taxi service ( albeit a prompt and courteous on. We had 2 trips booked through Click and 2 very different experiences. Firstly, i would like to point out that the taxi service to and from each activity was prompt, professional and comfortable. However, that is all the advertised cost includes - the lift there and back. Be prepared to be royally ripped off upon arrival at your chosen day trip. ( although Click is not responsible for this, they must be aware of the hidden costs along the way) Atlas mountain and water fountain tour: upon arrival we were met by a very friendly and helpful guide, whom we presumed was all part of the package ( how wrong were we) it was never once indicated to us that this guide was optional and would cost extra ( a lot extra) so we followed our guide through the mountain tour and in and around the beautiful waterfall. ( wear flat, sensible shoes that you do not mind getting dirty as it is a long trek through the mountain) we were prompted to stop at several pit stops and ushered into outdoor stores and cafes ( clearly the business' of our guides friends) we were put under enormous pressure to purchase items during our pit stop and often the sales pitches were heavy handed with a sob story thrown in for good measure to ensure a swift and profitable sale. If we were stronger we would have kindly declined and kept our money, but it seemed almost expected that we make a purchase and so we did so for a swift exit. We were not given the option to stop at any other cafe or stall, only the ones owned by the guides mates. Clearly back handed deals are in place here, although i imagine this is common place and how business' keep afloat, although it is not very tourist friendly to be dictated to as to what we can buy from where and where we can and can't stop for refreshments, especially when there is such ample choice. Without a guide i imagine it would have been easy to stop and grab a drink from wherever we pleased.  The guide, although friendly and chatty often mis informed us ( hence our annoyance at his huge fee at the end of the tour) my other half is from SA and so knows a thing or 2 about African culture and terrain, so was very quick to pick up on blatantly incorrect facts and information( not in a know-it-all kind of way though - and never to or in front of the guide.) It didn't help that our guide was also constantly talking on his mobile phone!  We were then ushered towards the lunch cafe, again, we were under the impression that lunch was included ( it is not and is chargeable there and then) and then offered a boat ride under the fall of the water, well worth it by the way, it was a lovely boat ride and very refreshing after a long and tiring trek through the mountain.  There is also an opportunity to see some monkeys in the wild in and around the edge of the mountain, ( this was free unlike the guide, lunch, stops and boat trip) this was also a lovely addition to the trip and we thoroughly enjoyed it.  At the end we tipped the guide ( as you do) just to have our money thrust back rudely and abruptly ( we offered 120 MAD) when we asked how much he was expecting he said he usually takes anything between 250 and 300, so we reluctantly increased our tip to 250. Its not that we weren't grateful for his guidance, but we had no idea it was not included in the original cost as a guide was never offered as an option but thrust upon us on arrival and what with all the convenient stops to his mates' cafes and stalls, the pressure put on us to purchase items and participate, we felt a bit fleeced. The whole trip is clearly a money making scam with the drivers 'helping out' the guides and the guides ' helping out' the local merchants, i understand that business is business but it should be advertised as such and all costings clearly stipulated. The entire trip reeked of a rip off! Our 2nd trip was a camel trek and it was lovely. It was short and sweet, maybe 30mins in length with plenty of photo opportunities and our driver was charming and smiley. When we arrived we were ushered off with a camel expert and he took over from the Click excursion driver, we tipped him at the end ( 100 MAD) and he was grateful and thankful for the tip instead of rude, abrupt and greedy. I got the impression that on this trip a tip genuinely was just that, a kind gesture of thanks and appreciation, not a hidden cost that is forced upon you with no previous indication! It is because of our enjoyable camel trek that this company are receiving 3 stars and not 1! Advise: 1. the mountain and waterfall trek is stunning and well worth it, but if you feel able, insist on exploring it yourself without a guide,that way you can control your stops and spends. If you do opt for a guide be prepared to tip big at the end.  2. Wear comfortable shoes - it is a long way down the mountain.  3. Take plenty of sun cream and water ( there are places along the way to purchase water but if you opt for a guide you will only be allowed to stop and purchase water from certain places) - shaded areas are few and fair between and it is a hot journey ( and a long day at the mountain)  4. Take extra money!! Click only offer a taxi service to and from your chosen activity. On arrival additional costs will arise."

After a quick google search I found click's website were they had a good range of activities. We chose the Fantasia trip but wanted to go the next evening. I gave them an email and within the hour they had replied saying that they would pick us up from our hotel @ 8pm with a final (very reasonable) price including all transport and food. They were on time with a very comfortable new car and drove just the two of us to the event. When we got there our driver explained absolutely everything to us in very good English and when he found out we had been asked for more money by the waiters went and sorted it out himself with the management. He took us round the entire palace explaining everything to us in great detail and just generally went the extra mile to ensure we felt safe and had a great evening. He left us once he had ensured we would have a private table for just the two of us and new to walk over to the main arena once we had eaten, but once the spectacle had finished was waiting right by the exit with the car to drive us straight back to the hotel. Never once asking for or expecting a tip. For click excursions benefit Abdel Ford should be recognised as his great customer service made our evening much more enjoyable. All in all 5*. Thank you."

There wasn't much information provided about the tour prior to the day and we thought it was going to be a coach tour of city landmarks. It turned out to be better than that - we were collected in a decent looking coach and driven to the Medina. We were then told to disembark for a walking tour of the Medina (so glad I'd worn flat shoes).From the time we left our guide shared intesting facts about the sights, the city dos and don's and culture. It was fantastic getting into the heart of the Medina making turns into narrow lanes you wouldn't think (or be brave enought) to turn, and see where the locals buy their bread and fruit, etc.The guide then took us to two places - a gift shop and a pharmacy tour; and this is where it got expensive. In both places, no prices are displayed and when you make selections and enquire you're told not to worry, it's 'good price'. Having ventured mildly the day before we were aware of some prices and the costs eventually quoted at the gift store were way above, but we were assured it was because their goods were the 'real quality'. Overall the few items chosen came up to over 700 dirhams (over \u00a340) and we haggled him down a bit, but it was still a lot for what was chosen. Similar story at the Pharmacy. The guided tour (not free we later learned when leaving) was very interesting and the array of products from the simple nut is amazing. Not as amazing as the final bill, so don't get carried away when offered their 2 for 1 deals.Final thought is that we couldn't fault the tour, be sure to wear flat shoes and bring water - espectially for young children, but it can get quite expensive!"

This did not involve any payment prior to our driver pick-up on the first trip. The prices were some of the most competitive we were able to find, and of course their excellent reviews were reassuring!Ouzoud waterfalls- Excellent trip, the perfect antidote to the close heat of Marrakesh city, as it gave us an opportunity to swim in a beautiful river. Abdulkarim picked us up on time both ways, drove safely, and stopped at some really nice rest stops (it's a 3 hour drive). Once there we had a guide for the day who walked us around the top of the falls, down through the olive groves (where he also pointed out carob for us to taste), to the downstream river. I would recommend wearing swimming items under your clothes as it's great to have a swim by one of the small falls! We then stopped for lunch halfway up, with an excellent view of the falls. We finished the day by climbing back up to the top, seeing some wild Barbary macaques, then our driver was waiting for us. The guide was included in the price but we chose to tip him. Excellent value for money!Zagora dunes- Another excellent trip, really made our holiday. Picked up on time from our riad, stopping at some beautiful viewpoints over the Atlas mountains and through the desert towards Ait Ben Haddou, where we spent 2 hours for lunch and exploring the kasbah (just right in terms of timing). From there we went on to Zagora. The trip involved about 7 hours of driving so be prepared to spend a long time in the car. From Zagora, we left Karim our driver, and rode camels for about an hour and a half to our camp with the Berbers. The camel ride was just us and our guide Said, who kindly took plenty of great photos. The camp was formed of a number of 4 bed tents, other tourists arrived on their own camel trains, and we were all served soup, tagine, and watermelon in the 'restaurant tent'. The Berbers then light a night time fire, and performed some traditional music for us - we had a good dance! We stayed up late admiring 'Berber television' - the clearest view I have ever had of the night sky. We woke up before dawn the next day, to have breakfast (bread, jam, butter, mint tea/coffee) and watch the sun rise which was beautiful! Then we took the camels back along a different route to be picked up by our driver. Unfortunately Karim was 45 minutes late picking us up, which was quite worrying, and provided no apology for this. This was the only negative of our experiences with Click. On the way home we stopped at Ouarzazate where we visited another Kasbah, but this wasn't one of the highlights. There is also the option to visit the film studios here if you wish. Karim drove a little fast on the return journey to Marrakech but overall this was an excellent trip.Essouira day trip - We were again picked up in a timely manner from our Riad by Abdul-karim for our day trip. The drive out is about 3 hours, and we stopped along the way for a comfort break and a chance to take a drink. We also stopped by a herd of goats who had climbed up into an Argan tree - a very amusing sight! We arrived at Essouira at around 11am, and spent until 4:15 there (you may be able to stay a little later outside of Ramadan). This was enough time to visit the South Bastion, experience the hustle of the port-side, walk through the main streets of the city, eat a grilled fish lunch, the North Bastion, and admire all the skilled woodwork on show!! Essouria has a very relaxed feel with Bob Marley cafes and is quite different to Marrakesh, especially as it has cool sea air. We had a little walk along the beach too and paddled in the sea! If you have the time it would probably be worth spending a night in Essouira to experience more of it. We returned to Marrakesh for around 7pm, giving us time to freshen up before dinner.Overall we would definitely recommend Click Excursions - it was very easy to arrange, they provided a competitive price, and were reliable and trustworthy. We really enjoyed all our trips and they provided some of the highlights of our holiday. Thank you Click!"

Once settled in we compared the excursion to ones offered to us by our riad and discovered that they were substantially cheaper! plus we were impressed with Ahmed, his English and his new car! with air conditioning . Anyway a couple of days in we decided to book an excursion through click, we rang them and arrange to go to the Atlas Mountains and Ouzoud waterfall, and hoped that we would get Ahmed! we did her turned up early! was the best host we could hope for and gave us a fantastic day out! peppered with history! facts and information on his culture. the day was balanced and fun, plus with hands on experience of making Argan oil! to climbing up to the waterfall! he gave us sound advice on dealing with traders and taught us some much needed words of Arabic to survive. I would recommend an excursion with this company, and if you can with Ahmed."

For some reason a lot of the companies were booked but Click Excursion gave us no hassle at all! We simply called them the day before and they asked us what time we would like to go and they picked us promptly at our riad at the specified time. Ahmed, our driver was very nice and funny! He told us a bit about Moroccan culture and its history while we were on our way to the camel ride. The camel ride itself was very pleasant, the workers were incredibly friendly even though they're fasting during Ramadan and cannot drink water in this heat. They equipped us with the proper attire and off we were to enjoy our camel ride. They helped us take lots of pictures and we were so happy about that. The best thing though was that Ahmed was very accommodating and as per our request dropped us off at the new town instead of the medina which would've been nearer for him. He was also understanding when we paid with part euros and part DH because we didn't have enough DH with us. All in all, we are completely satisfied with both the service and experience with click excursions. "

Our driver (Abdullah, we think) picked us up on time from our Riad and en route we stopped at various viewpoints to look at the scenery. Our driver was very friendly, and we enjoyed talking to him about local culture and football! Once at Ouzoud our driver introduced us to Mohammad who would be our walking guide around the falls. He was excellent, very informative and very patient as we faffed around deciding whether or not to go swimming in one of the pools. We were very impressed by how beautiful it is there and the walk itself was very good and not too difficult. Mohammad also took us to a cafe during the walk for lunch which could not have had a better view or be any closer to the falls. once completed the walk we were re greeted by our driver and went back to Marrakesh. We were very impressed with both the driver and guide and were a bit embarrassed that we had not money to tip the driver, so if you are reading this - thank you! we recommend this company for a brilliant excursion out of the chaos of Marrakesh.

The next day we booked another trip with a different driver for my son and friend to the valley trip which they loved water falls,.. mint tea at a Berber village.. on arriving back our son forgot his sunglasses before i needed to contact the company they emailed me and the next day even phoned me and delivered back the sunglasses to our apartment..great service so we will use clickexcursions every time even on our next visit to Morocco even if you can get the trip maybe a little cheaper else where. many thanks Paul,Helen,Lloyd and Emma ,Exeter ,England"

On our way to the camel ride he told us about the history of Marrakech which was very interesting and he engaged with us about the culture and other things to do. When we arrived we were given things to wear that would keep us cool and protect us from the heat as it was very warm. The guide helped us on to the camel and then took us around the area, he also stopped a few times to take photos for us. The ride was exciting and the camels were well behaved, it was a great excursion if you want to go outside the city and experience the culture. Afterwards you are taken to a sheltered area and given mint tea which we were told is traditional Berber for welcoming guests. Overall it was a great experience and a must if you aren't staying in Marrkech for a long time as most other excursions last the whole day."

The driver picked us up promptly for our camel ride in Palmeriea and shared some interesting facts and views on the history of the city and its culture. Upon arrival we were drapped in traditional Berber garnments and mounted our camels. The humidity was bearable but it was extremely hot. The palm trees and desert terrain proved to be a nice contrast to the hustle of the city and the camels were well behaved. Overall I would highly recommend the camel ride as at just over an hour long it proved to be excellent value for money. And the tea offered left me feeling minty fresh."

Clickexcursions and the driver, Deleted the name, asked me to write a review if I wish.Well, here we go:The trip in overall is very interesting. We saw lots of Morocco; Ouazarzate and the places around are very nice.Also:1) The driver's English was very good. He clearly stopped wherever he had deals to. Despite we clearly asked him NOT to drop us to a touristic place for food, but rather to a local Ouazarzate restaurant he trusts he did not. He showed he understands but then he purposely let it go when we suddenly saw he was driving us out of Ouazarzate to eat. Instead we reached Ait Benhaddou where he decided for us to eat, despite I told him again we don t want to eat there.2) He was driving quite carelessly and was talking on the phone for a long time on handsfree. He did not really speed down at curves although asked him twice.3) He avoided to give us change pretending he does not understand. When I clearly told him he has to return us 2 euros (a really so small amount) he told me he does not have euros. I told him to give me the equivalent in Dirhams and then he told me he did not have money as change. Well, some self-respect and dignity would not hurt."

I went off of the good Trip Advisor reviews and was not disappointed! For SUCH a reasonable price (about $80 USD for 2), we were picked up by Karim as scheduled around 9am and driven 1.5 hours to Ourika Valley. The drive was gorgeous. We had just one other passenger in a very nice air conditioned SUV. We absolutely loved hiking with our local guide Mohammed to see these waterfalls- had no idea what a workout it would be! It was a great day out of the craziness of Marrakech with some exercise, great views, and experiencing another part of the country. Had a nice lunch overlooking the river after (I'll admit food was mediocre and overpriced, but still so pleasant!), and got back to Marrakech around 4pm."

Abdel was so accommodating taking us to Ouzoud falls and taking pity on me - so scared of the winding paths up and down the mountain! And then he made sure our night with Fantasia was exactly that, an Arabian fantasy - picking us up promptly and bringing us back, replete with lamb tagine!Hussein was another fantastic driver, making sure we could take refuge and drink mint tea in a cafe while our crazy children went camel riding in the hot sun.One of the nicest things was that both drivers spoke English, so it wasn't all just down to me, with my hesitant French.Click's prices are very reasonable and negotiable depending on the size.

My friend and I really wanted to go to the desert during our week's stay in Marrakech so we decided to book a tour with click as they were one of the cheaper providers we had found. Our driver picked us up and off we went. Our driver was nice but the 8hr drive was uncomfortably long because he didn't talk to us! Asked us if we wanted to stop to take pictures but spent the majority of the time on his phone! He also didn't put the air con on so it was very hot in the car. He opened the window which clearly helped to cool him down but did nothing for us in the back! When we arrived at Zagora we got on our camels and our guide, Said, took us to the camp. Said was so nice - he made the trip! When we arrived at the camp he made us tea - or whiskey Berber as he called it! It was very nice. Later it was time for dinner and the food was the best I had in Marrakech! Massive portions too! They also provided us with a big bottle of icy water. After dinner we sat in a circle and the guides sang, danced and played the drums - wonderful cultural experience! I had a go on the drums but needless to say I wasn't very good! When the singing and dancing came to an end most people either stayed where we were and chatted or went into their tents. We did neither! Said took us out onto the dunes and we sat for hours chatting, burying our feet in the warm sand, looking at the stars - or Berber television as Said called it - and he even taught us some Berber and gave us Berber names! My Berber name was Fatima and my friend's was Yousef. I still remember all of the words Said taught me such as water, camel, sand, sunrise, star, moon etc. The next day we set off again and Said was chatting to us along the way. When our driver picked us up it was much the same story as the way there - he didn't speak! The trip was amazing and I'd definitely do it again. I hope somebody can pass on my thanks to Said for really making it an unforgettable experience! He should be commended by the company for being such a brilliant guide - even other people on the trip who didn't have Said as their guide were commenting on how nice he was and were jealous that we had him as our guide! Overall very good - the driver was just a bit lacklustre."

            "review": "Good value tour company.. Pre-booked two excursions while still in the UK prior to flying out to Marrakech. Website was easy to navigate with good description of available tours. No money is taken during the booking process, you simply select your tour and you then receive a confirmation email stating what time you will be picked up from your hotel reception. The first tour we did was the 'Palaces and monuments tour'. The guide arrived at our reception (nearly) on time and was excellent. We were taken to parts of Marrakech we never would have never found ourselves, and would have got well and truly lost in had we found them. I found all aspects of the tour interesting, the 'Bahia palace' especially so. However at the end you are taken into a chemist / pharmacy and then into a rug shop to discover about a bit about their respective trades. In my opinion this is little more than a sales pitch, however the shop vendors are not particulary pushy as can sometimes be the case in the Arab culture (in my experience). The second tour we did was of the 'Ourika valley' in the Atlas mountains. This was a lovely day out driving through some lovely scenery, drinking mint tea at a riverside restaurant and culminating in a trek to visit some lovely waterfalls above the village of Setti Fatma. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed this day, but be warned the trek to the waterfalls, though while obviously not rock climbing, does involve a fair amount of steep walking scrambling over rocks. The itinerary was slightly different than advertised but this didn't effect our day in any way as we had a great time. If we return to Marrakech and wish to take a tour we will definitely use 'Click excursions' again."

We booked a tour online before arriving in Marrakech so weren't sure what to expect, but out driver Abdellah was waiting in our hotel reception on time and drove us around safely for the whole trip. He was friendly and helpful as well and any time we wanted to stop for photos or anything was more than happy to and we even got wifi in his 4x4! We were able to pay in GBP when we asked as well which saved changing more currency.The trip was amazing and I would recommend it, just be prepared for a LOT of time in the car as Merzouga is very far from Marrakech and although the way there is spread over 2 days with things to see on the way, the way back is a whole day in the car. Still worth it for the amazing sights though! The main sights were the Atlas Mountains, Kasar of A\u00eft-Ben-Haddou, Todra Gorge and a camel trek and camping in the Sahara desert in Erg Chebbi. We had some time to ourselves to see the Kasar of A\u00eft-Ben-Haddou where so many films are set, and things like Game of Thrones etc. make sure you have sun cream as it's the middle of the day and so hot!! The hotel the first night was Day Ayour in Todra Gorge. Great views, nice food and friendly staff, plus in a traditional riad which was great. We had another tour guide for a couple if hours the next morning to walk around which was a great way to see the area. Had air conditioning but is a basic hotel so don't expect a hair dryer or safe in the room, awesome views from the room and roof terrace though and it does have a pool! The camel trek was done from Dar Tafouyte in Merzouga. You arrive for a late lunch and a couple of free hours before the camel trek at 5:30-6pm. It's good to go late because of the heat! We could leave a bag with Abdellah so we were only taking a light bag with what we'd need on the camel.i recommend you buy a scarf in a Souk in Marrakech for 10MKD, but if you haven't had chance the hotel staff will go and get you one for 50. You definitely need one to keep the sand from blowing in your face! You return for showers and breakfast the next morning so no problems trying to shower in the desert! At the camp there is a proper toilet and a tiny sink. The camel ride was easier than I expected! You sit above the hump which is different to what I'd heard, and it wasn't difficult holding on. A little uncomfortable for boys apparently and getting back on the camel to return highlighted where the bruises were! Make sure you have a head scarf! The guys at the hotel happily went and got me one for 50MKD when I asked though. You get to walk up a sand dune that is over 100m high. As a tip it's much easier barefoot! Take your camera although mine is now full of little bits of sand! For 2 of us we took 3 litres of water which was plenty, it was warm but not too hot because of the time of day. We took jumpers thinking it would be cold overnight but there was no need for them. In the evening after dinner we were playing bongos and dancing with the camel 'drivers' and other tourists which was a lot of fun. We had our own tent but there were about 12 people staying in the camp. Overall a memorable experience and recommend it to everyone visiting Marrakech!! Also would recommend this company, literally half the price of other companies I saw online and I don't know what you'd get with other places - we saw other people on similar tours who'd done the same route and from what I can tell the only difference was that some give you a guide as well as a driver."

In an air conditioned 4x4 nonetheless. He was most helpful and more than happy to stop whenever we wanted for photo opportunities, and he even went the extra mile and picked us up some water. We arrived at our destination where we were met by Mohammed and told that our climb to the waterfalls would take an hour and an hour back. We were happy as we thought the delightful drive was more than enough for the \u00a322 we were paying! On to our hike up, definitely wear comfortable shoes as it is a challenging climb (which Mohammed helped greatly on). He was most friendly, spoke great english and very patient with me as I am afraid of heights! He was a great tour guide, knew loads about the region and as I say we could not have asked for someone better! The views are incredible and a definite must do in Morocco. All in all it was a fabulous experience and tips included we spent 750 dirhams for the two of us. Great place to book with, reliable and friends guides, couldn't ask for anything more."

We were picked up on time and exactly where we anticipated in a clean, modern vehicle. Our guide was full of information and handed us over to another excellent guide when we arrived at our destination (after a stop for mint tea and to see how Argan oil was made). We then enjoyed a hike to visit a spectacular waterfall with amazing views along the way. Definitely a highlight of our trip."

We were picked up from the lobby of our Riad and walked to our transportation (a clean and comfortable minivan), then driven the 2 hour drive to Ozoud. Once there we were met by a guide who took us on the walk to see the incredible falls from different angles. We were expecting quite a hard trek but it was more like a long walk. We then had lunch in a cafe looking directly at the waterfalls which was stunning. The guide then took us further up to see some of the monkeys and told us some facts along the way. We met back up with our driver and headed home after a really smooth-running and enjoyable day/"

We stayed a night in Marrakech at Riad Barroko, which I also highly recommend, AMAZING staff, service and stay. We were picked up the next morning by our guide Abdellah Sadik who was so wonderful and kind and very very flexible to our needs and what we wanted to do. We travelled through the Atlas mountains and were offered plenty of opportunities by our excellent guide to stop for pictures. We camped two nights in the desert (in Zagora and Merzouga) accompanied by Berber guides on camel back, again experiencing extreme hospitality and they were also very flexible with my vegetarian meal preferences! We stopped at incredible sites along the way visiting UNESCO Kasbah's and La Todra Gorge. It was beyond incredible to be guided by someone so helpful and with such great insight to the culture, who was happy to answer any and all questions we had. Abdellah stopped to by us local dates and when my camera broke he took it upon himself to find an electronic shop and got them to take a look! I highly recommend the 5 day tour it gives you an amazing well rounded experience of many different places in Morocco but will also leave you dying to come back! Also ask for Abdellah he's awesome!"

You can pay in whatever currency you want at the time of the service rather than in advance and at an excellent competitive price.Originally, we were going to also book an excursion or two, but because of personal reasons, we were unable to do so this time, but when we go next we would not hesitate to use this company given the level of great professional service this time.

Whilst booking my transfer from Marrakech to Agadir for monday 28 april 2014, i was reminded by Ahmed in the office to write my review for February last year!My cousin Rita and I were going to Agadir but as you cannot fly from Scotland to Agadir, flew from Manchesrer to Marrakech. Instead of staying overnight in Marrakech as we used to do, and coaching to Agadir the following morning ,decided to book Click Excursions which had been recommended by a friend! They were great.....booking form was easy,admin excellent, answering all my queries, and we could pay in \u00a3, euros or dirhams on arrival.The trip took about 4 hrs on the motorway and arriving late at night we thought this was a wise move. The driver Houcine was excellent (the flight was 2 hrs late but he was there!) stopping at a wee supermarket for us to get some goodies. He spoke good English too and Ahmed in the officephoned the taxi to see if we had arrived and all was good. Excellent customer service. We were so pleased with the taxi, driving, courtesy etc that we booked the return journey sharing this time with 2 friends. Again excellent punctual service. The price last year was \u00a395. Anyway I have booked again!Thought I better mention Sandy Mackay is my cat! Jeanette Scotland"

The driver was waiting for us at the airport lobby, it was relief to see him, we got excited when we saw the vehicle he bought (The company has brand new 7/8 seater vehicle..it makes the journey less painful if you have a nice vehicle). I made a few changes to the book via email and Ahmed always replied on time. I made a few more booking to take us on excursions. The driver always arrived on time and you only pay what has been quoted to you, no hassle what so ever. The drivers do speak English and are very kind, though one driver did humph when Hubby gave him less tip.

Our first night was spent out in the desert (by camel) in Zagora - beautiful. After a night of good food and wonderful Berber company, we slept in tents and woke to watch the sunrise over the Sahara - and the trip only got better and better! We spent another night out in the desert (again trekking by camel) at Erg Chebbe along the Algerian border. It was like an oasis hidden amongst the most beautiful sand dunes I have ever seen. We spent a few nights in Riads as well, they were all beautiful, with delicious food (tangine, couscous, oranges, dates, tea). I have not got one single complaint. The trip was spectacular, Abdellah was such a great guide (I would take another trip with him in a heart beat) and there was wifi in his car!!!"

After a booking a 3 night break in Marrakech, I had 2 full days to see as much as we could of the city and with very little time to get our bearings so decided to book several trips in advance.Click Excursions ticked all the boxes with great prices and reviews, so we booked a full itinerary a few weeks before travelling and didn't even need to leave a deposit, so simply has to pay for everything when we embarked on this exciting trip.Day 1 City TourAbdullah picked us up at 9am, and drove for 20 minutes into Marrakech before handing over to Jamal as we embarked on a 3 hour tour of the city. Jamal is the perfect guide who spoke with great knowledge about the history of Marrakech and we learned more from him than we ever could of from a guide book. When we reached the Souks, I don\u2019t mind admitting it was nice to have Jamal escorting us because it was just as crazy as you could ever have imagined.Snake charmers, monkeys in dresses and traders are all desperately trying to get your attention but with Jamal by our side, we could concentrate on exploring and learning about Marrakech.Horse and Carriage RideWe bid farewell to Jamal and now it was time to escape the madness and enjoy a romantic Horse and Carriage ride through the city and could just sit back and soak up the many sights on offer that we could never have covered on foot alone before stopping for a nice hour in a place of serenity and shade, at the Jardin Majorelle. Wandering within the paths of this small garden full of palms, bamboo, cacti, coloured pots and buildings, birdsong and pools is quite a contrast to the souks just a few hours earlier.Camel RideAfter the gardens, our new friend and driver Abdullah drove us to our camel ride adventure at La Palmeraie which is on the north side of the city in a very peaceful surrounding. This was the moment I get to ride a camel like Peter O\u2019Toole and the perfect end to or day.Abdullah had one more surprise for us tough and that was introduction to Morocco\u2019s national drink: Berber whiskey, but he cheekily advised \u201cwhiskey without alcohol\u2026its mint tea\u201d and this wouldn\u2019t be the last time that I would get to enjoy this national drink either.As we head back to our accommodation, I ask Abdullah if he could stop somewhere so we can buy some snacks for our room. He selflessly said shops were too expensive but stopped somewhere that we could get a \u201cSpecial Moroccan Price\u201dDay 2 Ourika Valley TourOnce again our new friend Abdullah picked us up at 09:00am and we headed out to Ourika Valley for a day trip/adventure.Another opportunity to escape the madness of the city and head for the Berber villages located 46 kilometres away. You will be rewarded with scenic landscapes and photo opportunities aplenty before being greeted by our guide Mohammed who will take us up to the Sitti Fatma waterfalls. There are seven of them but only the adventurous and fit tourist hikes to the top so make sure you take sensible shoes.As we return home with many crazy stories, great photos and happy memories of enjoying Moroccan Whiskey with our friend Abdullah, our short time in Marrakech will always have a special place in our heart thanks to Click Excursions"

We had the choice of paying in either Dhms, Euros or GB\u00a3First was to Ourika valley and waterfalls. On the way, as it was Monday, we made a stop at the weekly Berber market- well worth seeing. Then continued on to Setti Fatma where we were put into the hands of a local guide and made our way up to the waterfalls. It was quite tricky in places as the rocks were wet and very slippery, but the guide made sure we were safe at all times.The second trip was to Imlil. On the way we stopped at a Berber village for a demonstration of how the mint tea is traditionally made, followed by a refreshing glass of the finished product.At Imlil we went for a 2 hour trek with a local mountain guide up into the mountains and through small hamlets dotted above Imlil reaching a height of 6000ft - where it snowed, before making our way back to Imlil.Both trips were very good value for money, they didn't include lunch, but we had taken a snack with us ( we could have had a local meal if we had chosen.) The only extras were tips - 40dhms from the 2 of us for each local guide, as recommended by the driver.Service was excellent and would certainly recommend Click."

            "review": "Excellent service. I had the task of planning a group trip to Marrakesh for a friend's 60th birthday. After much on-line research I booked a day trip to Imli and a transfer from our villa in Marrakesh to Casablanca airport with Ahmed at Click Excursions. The booking process was very easy with Ahmed replying to my emails and questions immediately. Very efficient and a very warm and friendly guy. On the day of our trip to Imli, it was pouring with rain - not a good sign and as we headed into the mountains we encountered very heavy snow. Nevertheless our drivers handled the weather professionally and drove safely. We stopped briefly to see a Berber market which was fascinating although we ended up deep in mud. A short walking tour had been arranged for us at Imli but 2 of our party opted out due to the snow. Our drivers made sure they were safe and warm in a local cafe while the rest of us ventured into the snow accompanied by a local guide Mohamed - he was a gem - he made sure we weren't rushed and helped us through the slippery terrain. The walk was beautiful especially in the snow and we finished up in a local restaurant and had a decent hot meal (included in the price). The day could have been a disaster due to the weather but our drivers were flexible and professional and made sure we enjoyed the trip. For me, it was the highlight of our 5 days in Marrakesh. I left the group on the last day to fly to Istanbul from Casablanca and Ahmed arranged a door-to-door transfer for me. The driver was waiting for me well ahead of time and drove me to Casablanca airport safely. I can recommend Click to anyone needing help in Marrakesh - professional, friendly, efficient and good value. Day trip to Imli was about 27.00Euros I think incl lunch and private transfer to Casablanca (a long way) 130Euros. Pay in Dirhams or Euros. Thanks Ahmed."

            "review": "Fun camel ride with kids. Booking is on line, and immediate; we changed the booking online the night before we went, and had no trouble (we booked about 18 hours before we were on the camels). We chose to go on a Friday, when there is a (small) risk of shops being closed due to it being the main prayer day. Our driver (Ahmed) spoke perfect English and was on time. The camel ride was in La Palmeraie, about a 20 minute drive from the hotel, but still within Marrakech (and much, much closer than going into the Sahara). La Palmeraie is not exactly scenic (it is a park with palm trees, dirt, and tourists on camels) but also has some beautiful homes that are fun to see by camel-back. There are, however, decent spots for a picture, that the guide happily took for us with our cameras. The ride was about an hour. Our two kids (ages 9 and 10) each had their own camel. The ride is gentle, and each camel is tethered to the one in front. We then went to a place nearby for tea with our guide, and chatted for a little bit while the kids ran around the play area. Our driver dropped us off at the Jardin Majorelle at our request -- a nice way to see another part of Marrakech without negotiating getting there. The kids loved the ride. Maybe on our next trip we will do a trek into the Sahara, but this was much quicker, cheaper, and easier, and satisfied the desire to be on a camel."

We used Click Excursions for our short trip to Morocco for our daughter's 8th birthday and booked a Camel Ride.We were very impressed with the service especially as it was only booked 2 days prior to the trip and there is also the flexibility of being able to pay for your excursion on the day. Ahmad at Click Excursions was also available when I emailed to answer queries which gave me peace of mind as it all seemed to good to be true and thankfully there was no reason to doubt the service provided as it met our expectations.Me and my daughter wore headscarves although this is available as you arrive and the camel ride is about an hour with complimentary mint tea and you are picked up and returned to your hotel which was very convenient for us.We had a very, very helpful driver called Abdallah who (although his English was fine) was patient enough for me to feel comfortable using my beginner's French! He was also willing to give us insight into the town and suggested places to visit for the short time we were there and so we also opted to pay for to have him take us to various tourist attractions and just arranged a time for collection at each stop.We were very thankful to have him and help us get the most out of three days in Marrakech and this has made us even more keen to return to discover more of the country. It was a very enjoyable trip and feel like we had seen a lot despite being short on time thanks to Abdullah whose local knowledge helped us organise our trip."

            "review": "An excellent service. I used Click excursions after I had read the reviews from Trip advisor. I emailed Ahmed, the organiser, a number of times beforehand, and he always replied very promptly with helpful advice. In the end we booked a city tour and a trip to the Ourika valley.The city tour of Marrakech was run by Rachid, who arrived promptly and took myself and my 8 year old son round the sights of Marrakech. We visited the Saadian tombs, the Bahia palace and the souks. I was a bit reticent to enter the pharmacy, expecting them to do a hard sale on the spices, but they kept the talk short, and weren't pushy at all.The next day we visited the Ourika valley. Our guide was Ahmed, who also arrived very promptly and was very polite, pleasant and informative. He adapted the tour to suit my 8 year old, as I had asked, and was full of information on the life of the locals. I found the tour very interesting, as we saw a typical way of life for the locals, and my son got an insight into how children live in the mountain villages. We didn't do the walk to the waterfall, as Ahmed advised us that it might be a bit steep for my son who was a bit tired by that time, so we stayed in the caf\u00e9 and admired the view. The car Ahmed drove was in very good condition, and he was a very careful driver - that had been one of the things I had previously been worried about when choosing a tour.The next day we booked for a trip to the Majorelle Gardens (pleasant, but quite small) and a camel ride (which I found quite scary as there are no safety helmets or stirrups, but which my son absolutely loved), and also a transfer to the airport, which was 10 euros, half the price of the transfer we had paid to the hotel when we arrived.I would definitely recommend the service offered by Click Excursions, they made our holiday very stress free and were very well organised."

            "review": "A great way to explore Marrakech without hassle. We visited Marrakech in this x mas, which was for only 4 days so time was pretty tight. Therfore I googled and found this website which already had very good feedback. We booked 2 excursions, Ourika Valley and Camel Ride. I was quite impressed that our booking was confirmed promptly by e mail. No advance payment was necessary and all payments to be made to drivers, either in \u00a3 or in Dhirams. Since we were a party of 2 families comprising 4 adults and 4 kids with both checked and hand luggage and we were landing around 8.30 pm , I inquired whether they could provide us airport transfer to our hotel in newtown as well since it would have been a real nightmare to find a taxi and agree a fee at that time of the hour. The Owner Ahmed instantly replied to my e mail quoting \u00a3 20 each way, which I think is not bad. Once again no advance payment needed. The driver was already in the lobby when we left the airport. He helped with our baggage and we were at the our hotel within 15-20 min. With 8 pieces of hand luggage, 2 pieces of checked bags and 8 people this would have been much stressful if we were to find our own way of transfer to hotel.Our second experience with Click excursion was ourika Valley Excursion. There was a slight hiccup which I believe due to some confusion in communication. We both families were due to go together and we were planning to go for camel riding, though the transport came for Ourika Valley. It was not much of a problem and turned to be better option. There were two fairly comfirtable vehicles and drivers were ontime, @ 9 am. We got on to one which was driven by Ahmed, not sure he was the same man who answered e mails. It was a pleasant experince to travel with him. He was a guide as well as the driver, fluent in English and was knowledgble. He gave us a running commentory, which was comparable to what you hear in sightseeing bus, even better as it was interactive. We stopped at a cafe and had mint tea and visied nearby shop which demonstates extraction of argon oil. You can take part in the procedure if you wish. There was a small shop though you are not pressured to buy anything. There is a toilet, but only with sqatting plates. It may be a good thing to toss few dhirams to women who work there. We then stopped in two places, one which has breathtaking view of Atlas mountains and other at a place you could cross the river on a suspension bridge ! We then drove to Setti Fatma village at the foot of mountains. There we met our trekking guide, Hassan, a pleasant young man who was very fluent in English. We climbed about 30 min to a water fall, about 200m. We stopped several times to rest. Although the climb was not very streneous, it is not suitable for anyone who has mobility issue or frail. After taking some pictures at the falls, we set-off again. Hassan took us back to a resturant at the village , where we were supposed to take our lunch and meeting Ahmed and other driver. Here few of us lost their way,however it is worth mentioning Hassan has been great that he managed to locate them. He was truly professional and I wish him a best of luck !My only criticism of Click Excursion is that we did not have a choice of selecting a resturant in Setti Fatma to eat. The waiter showed us only 2 of the set menus for three course meals and gave us other menu cards only when we asked. The 3 couse menu would cost upto 140 d. Food was OK. After the meal Ahmed drove us back to the hotel.We went on camel ride excursion on next day. Once again the driver was ontime. We drove to palm groves in the suburbs and were met with the trekking guide. We were helped to dress in traditional clothes and helped to get onto camels. My 7 year old daughter travelled with my wife and the caravan was all together 7 camels, which were tied to one after another. Once the caravan started to move a photographer who wanted to take our pictures, and told us one photo would cost 20d. He agreed for 100 d for 7 photoes. It was a bit annoyance as he said we have pay then and there. It was quite difficult to take the wallet out and give him money on the back of a moving camel. Anyway he wrote down out hotel name and room number and gave a receipt and told me photos would be delived to hotel later. I thought I would never see him again, but he dropped them at the hotel at the end of the day. Anyway later our guide volunteerd to take our photos with our cameras/phones. The walk was about one hour.It was little scary when the camel was rising and more scarier when it was sitting down at the end, but feels much benign when compared to rides in a park. Initially it was bit scary when it started to move, but one would get used to it after few min.After camel ride we were taken to a riad in medina where we were met with Ahmed. We had mint tea and were shown us arond before we were driven back to hotel.Our jouney back to airport from hotel was our last experince with them. Once again driver was ontime, courtseous, helped us with luggage. I felt sorry for him as his had two flat tyres when he dropped us off at the airport.Overall I am very much pleased with Click Excursions. Their communication is excellent. All the drivers are very punctual, polite, helpful and professional. I would recommend them to anyone who wants to explore amrrakech."

A complete contrast to the bustle of the Medina and a chance to see the countryside and culture of the Berber people in the mountains. The guide (we did not catch his name) had a large comfortable and clean 4 x 4 and was punctual, professional and gave us a detailed and knowledgable commentary on the passing scenery, way of life and context of the Atlas Mountain region. There were stops to admire the views and take photos and at the village of Setti Fatma we were escorted to the falls by local young guide Mohammed who spoke excellent English and was very helpful as we scrambled up the steep rocky path. Wear suitable shoes and note that it can be slippery and coming down is actually harder than the ascent! There are many shopping opportunities during the half hour climb to the 2nd waterfall and it is amazing how the stallholders and sellers of cold drinks have managed to carry their goods and equipment to such inaccessible areas. We stopped at the second waterfall as the next level involved climbing a vertical ladder up the sheer rock face....After the trip to the falls, we had lunch in a riverside restaurant which was good value and sampled our first Tagines which were very good. Life is hard for the Berber people in the hills and tourists are a valuable and valued source of income. However, there is no hard sell and we were not pressured to buy goods at the various stops such as the Argan Oil co-operative or in the villages along the way. Definitely one of the highlights of our trip to Morocco and we would recommend Click Excursions."

We had 4 trips booked with click:Guide around the Medina - 30 euroFolklore show- 42 euro eachOuzoud Waterfalls - 48 euro eachMarrakech to Ouarzazate via high atlas - about a 1000 dirham total (can't remember exactly)Guide around Medina - it was good because he took us to loads of places we would not have found otherwise but the price was pretty high. we were also taken to a pharmacy and told everything is 3 for 2. We were taken in to a room and given a talk by the pharmacist and it soon became clear that it was a sales pitch. We were in there about half an hour (we'd booked a three hour tour). At the end she then said she'd go through all the products she'd shown us and we were to say yes or no to what we wanted. We just said we'd take some herbs which we were given a pretty cheap price for so said we'd having some of these roll on things (the sort that you can get at the pound shop)- when we got to the till it was going to be just less than \u00a330. Said we'd just have the herbs. As soon as the pharmacist realised we weren't going to buy much she went from being friendly to very rude. Tour ended 20 mins early.Folklore show was just laughable. So poorly organised. If this was done right it would have the potential to be such a good earner for them but basically they care about getting your fee and then you get ignored. The dancers look bored and all they want is a tip. Food is plentiful but poor quality. We left early.Ouzoud waterfalls trip- we were almost there and were told that the guide around the waterfalls was not included in the cost of the trip- I thought that that was what we were paying for not just a taxi ride there! Our guide told us we should give the other guide 100-150 Dirham. So thats already about \u00a38-13 extra. The trip round the falls was lovely and we saw the monkeys which we could hand feed. We took a tour on a bout at the bottom of the falls- 100 dirham. Rip off but as it's a one off, we did it and it was beautiful. Tour ended about an hour before our original guide was due to pick us up. Perfect amount of time for our guide to take us to his house and give us tea. Sounds good but I feel it was more of a play on our emotions BECAUSE when we gave him the tip 150 dirham because we were so please with the tour, 5 mins before our guide arrived- he told us it was not enough and asked for more money. We gave an extra 40diham (about \u00a33.50) but it totally ruined the experience for us.Trip to Ouarzazte via high atlas.Was nice to do this trip from a nice comfortable car with beautiful views. By this stage, 4 days in, we were sick of being harassed and hassled so we pretty much stayed in the car. Everytime we got out on the previous day, instantly kids were coming up and begging- 'madam, madam 1 dirham/ bon bons' etc etc. This trip was ok, we didn't allow ourselves to be in any situation where we could be hassled or ripped of!P.S - kids avoid going to school so they can stay off and beg for money and sweets so please avoid giving them things. Without an education their future will simply continue in this same way as they won't develop any skills to enable them to change."

He picked us up from our hotel and drove us out through the Atlas mountains, he took us to see the Ben Hadou Kasbah (which wasn't on our itinerary), he then took us to see the Ladies making the argan oil again not part of the trip.We arrived at our destination around 6pm having driven for about 7 hours stopping at various photographic spots, we then 'boarded' our camels and set off into the desert where we saw the sunset whilst travelling along, it was pitch black when we arrived at our berber camp, there we were shown to our own berber tent, had a meal and settled down to watch the desert TV - the stars! we saw 7 shooting stars, listened to the Nomads drumming & singing before going to bed. We were woken before the sun rose so we could do our aboulsions & have breakfast, then watch the sun rise over the dunes, after this we 'boarded' our camels back to our 4x4 luxury car where Hakim was waiting for us to take us home, we got home around 5pm.The waterfalls are truly spectacular and our guide Mohammed was fantastic as he grew up in this village so there was nothing that he didn't know, he too was a superb guide & his photographic skills are second to none!! he was really a pleasure to be with, he even went out of his way to find some monkeys for us which was truly amazing. On our first day in Marrakech we hired a guide through this company & was very glad we did as it gave us our bearings on this mad mad city!Thank you so much to Click Excursions for making this a very memorable holiday with some fantastic photos.Shukran beezef to you all, especially Hakim & Mohammed you two are a credit to your country"

I was met by a very nice guy called Ahmed at my hotel and he explained the order of the day and due to this being a private tour I was able to listen intently and ask whatever questions I needed. Mahmet is originally from the Atlas therefore he knew his stuff and walked (literally) in their shoes growing up. We stopped in various places for photo opportunities and our first stop was at the Association for Berber women who produce various items from Argan and the do all this by hand. Most of the women are estranged from their Husbands and this is the only income. Next stop was along the river for the traditional Mint Tea to relax and take in the peaceful time. Again question where answered and lots of information shared. Then we arrive into the village of Setti Fatma where I was met by another guide, he gave me info on the village where he and his family have always lived happily. We took the 30 minute trip up the atlas mountain and arrived and disappointedly low waterfall .. (It was out of season) but the walk up was fun and great as you can shop too!! On the walk down we was treated to a show of the Macau Monkeys who came down from high mountains to steal the nuts from the trees. It just so happens it was the bearing of walnut season and this display was quite rare!! Talking of walnuts, we found many ate many and brought home many!! After the walk back down, which is a lot harder than going up, we stopped back for a traditional lunch set menu where I had my first Berber Tagine! Yummy!! Then the journey back to Marrakech was quiet and I was able to take in all that I saw and learnt and left feeling satisfied that I had really journeyed into the Atlas Mountains. Will defo recommend this tour and this company and recommend you do it!!"

Our driver/guide (Ahmed) was friendly and informative, spoke perfect English and helped us enjoy the day enormously. The vehicle we were taken in was modern, clean and comfortable. The stop-off at the argan oil co-operative was very nice, as was that to enjoy tea at a riverside cafe. The walk into the mountains to see the waterfall was great, as was our very nice and helpful guide, Mohammed. It is quite a challenging walk, if (like me) you're middle-aged and some distance from peak physical condition. Having both hands free for the steepest bits was useful, and it would not be suitable for small children. The waterfall itself and the views from it are lovely. The guide was patient and expert in getting us up and down. It is possible to carry on further and see up to 7 waterfalls, but we were happy to return to enjoy a pleasant and very reasonably-priced late lunch at a nearby restaurant, before going back to Marrakech."

            "review": "Truly Amazing!. I booked with Click Excursions for my holiday in June 2013. We booked the camel ride and the day trip to the Ourika Valley. Both excursions were thoroughly enjoyed and we cannot fault anything. The driver (I'm sorry I cannot remember his name) turned up 10 minutes before the allocated time for our camel ride booking, and dropped us off at the designated location. He waited whilst we went off for an hour and a half enjoying our camel ride. The man leading the camel ride was very friendly and took pictures and made videos for us. Upon our return to the base, the driver drove us to a restuarant where we could freshen up and have some mint tea - all part of the booking. He then dropped us off outside our Riad. We also had the day trip to the Ourika Valley booked a couple of days after our Camel ride. On this day we were greeted by Ahmed at the Riad's reception desk. During our drive to the mountains he told us about the history of Marrakech, and the Ourika Valley. Ahmed took us to a Berber village where we spent time with the village ladies making Argan Oil. It was truly an amazing experience. The ladies even let my sister join in the oil making process! In between leaving the Berber village and reaching the Valley, we stopped for some mint tea, again, a part of the booking. After our break, Ahmed drove us to another Berber village where he appointed a tourguide, Hassan. Hassan was very friendly and polite - he even carried our water bottles for us! He guided us up to the Valley which was a wonderful experience, and kept us entertained throughout the walk up (in 40C this was quite a challenge!). Upon our return from the Valley, Ahmed took us to a Berber restaurant which served the most amazing Tagine ever! At no point throughout the day did we feel rushed. After lunch, we were driven back to our Riad. All in all, the day trip was from 9am to 4pm. It was perfect!We were three women with no male companion and we felt safe during the entire experience and would definitely do it again!On a separate note, the face masks we bought from the ladies in the Berber village have worked wonders! I would definitley recommend them. :-)"

We were picked up exactly on time as promised and dropped off again wherever we requested. Be prepared that the individuals you meet along the way i.e. the camel leader, taxi driver etc, will probably ask you for tips and this will add on to the price you have already paid. The only reason this gets 4 out of 5 stars and not 5 is that we were left wondering what was going on most of the time as no-one spoke any English and they didn't communicate the itinerary or times to us i.e. we spent a long time waiting in the taxi for others to arrive but no-one understood us when we asked what we were waiting for, and that can be a bit disconcerting in a new and unfamiliar place! Should have taken our phrasebook with us! This isn't to say people weren't friendly though, and after the initial confusion we had an enjoyable experience. I would say it was well worth the money spent."

If you have never been to Morocco before or like me treat it as a second home, Ahmed and his team will go out off their way to show you their culture. I have been to Morocco many times and will now only use Click excursions. What appeals to myself is that you pay when you have your excursion which was extremely helpful to me in 2011 when my mother became ill and I had booked an excursion with Click excursions and had to postpone the trip. The guides are with you at all times, their understanding of your language is very good and are willing to translate to the Moroccan People on your behalf. This year I did a 3 day Sahara trip and it was the most amazing experience I have ever had. Ahmed will select a driver / guide for you with a private, air condition vehicle and will arrange pick up at your hotel doorstep. The guides will show you what you would like to see and if you do not want to go to any extra factories or shops they will not take you! I travelled this year with another female friend and I felt safe while I was with the guide at all times.Ahmed and the team, look forward to seeing you in November!"

He provided us with an insight into his culture, the importance of the waterfall and mountain and he was absolutely hilarious at times.

I was travelling with my mother and we did 3 tours and 1 transfer with this company. We booked a city tour for the first day, Monday. Ahmed was on time and very polite and patient when we realized we have the wrong hour so we were not expecting to leave for another hour. He took us to Medina where we met Ouidad, who is not an ordinary guide but a beautiful, intelligent, warm lady. She was flexible with our needs and together with Ahmed took us to an affordable Shopping Centre to buy the wanted Djellabas -not included in the tour and no extra charge ( we got compliments all week about them). Being the first day they made us optimistic about our stay in Marrakech. On Wednesday we took a tour to Ourika Valley. Hicham the driver made us feel very comfortable from the minute we step into his car. When we got there we decided not to visit the cascades as I didn't want my mother to get too tired so he made it clear to the guide that we will not use his services. We felt he was there for us all the way and not trying to \"sell\" or push for anything. There we met Ahmed (the head and heart of the company) and we were very impressed with his honesty and willingness to satisfy his clients. Based on these 2 experiences we decided while still on Ourika to take a trip to Essaouira next day. Ahmed confirmed it on the spot so we went with Hicham to Essauria. By then we felt we are meeting a member of our family and the day we spent there was perfect. Hicham gave us great tips and answered any questions we had. All the way we felt we were looked after and for 2 women travelling alone this is very important. Same company arranged our transfer to the airport. Timings were great as we didn't want to spend unnecessary time in the airport ( too hot). Overall it was like dealing with a company going the extra mile to offer you the comfort and service you couldn't even dream of. Tips: feel comfortable to book everything before you leave UK as you don't need to pay on booking and you can trust the driver will be there as agreed. We booked 24hours before our departure and got immediate confirmation. As I did my research before choosing them I can say this is one of the very few travel companies that are straight forward with their prices ( so no surprises afterwards). A big thank you to Ahmed and his team!"

She knew a lot about Marroco history and fun facts, and very important, she was fluent in english. We went to visit the Bahia Palace, the Saadian Tumbs, the Koutobia Mosque, and then we went to some local souks, not touristic so the true marroccan experience. She also took us to a Berber Farmacy and L'Ensemble Artisanal, wich are very interesting too. The cherry on top of the cake was the price. We paid for 50\u20ac (for 2 people), so 25\u20ac each, to the visit of half a day. In our hotel they were asking for 60\u20ac, and it wasn't a private tour. So, if you want to visit Marrakech, we encourage you to book with click excursions and ask for Ouidad."

But everything considered, we'll give you a thumbs up. Ourika Valley: worth the trip, but you will get shepherded through stalls and guilt-tripped into purchasing items \"for the community.\" It was unfortunate that this was our first day, as we were subjected to hardselling, and not prepared for it (huge culture shock). Otherwise, it was enjoyable and involved a reasonable amount of scrambling (which I like, but some people may struggle with the journey - I'd advise purchasing a pair of extremely good, closed toe walking sandals). Our tour guide was included and was great. Ouarzazate: for the love of god, don't go on this trip. It was a very time consuming and intense waste of time. Certainly not worth the 4 -5 hour drive (each way) through the Atlas Mountains, veering around corners blindly and generally taking the insane Marrakech driving to a new, hair-raising level. Our driver didn't explain what we were supposed to be doing (left to fend for ourselves), the restaurant we were taken to had such poor quality food that it made us feel temporarily unwell, we were expected to pay for entry into all the attractions (the second kasbah was astoundingly bad and you will be forced to explore it with a local guide...who won't leave you alone), and I experienced heat exhaustion on the return journey, because the air conditioning wasn't turned on in the vehicle. Skip this tour. It put a dampener on our whole week. Ouzoud Waterfall Trip: best trip by far. This is an astoundingly beautiful natural attraction. We had a wonderful guide who didn't try to ferry us into any shops (shout out to Mohammad - best guide of the holiday)! Quite a long walk, so be sure to wear comfortable shoes. You can finally expect a delicious lunch on this tour, with amazing waterfall views. Definitely worth it.Camel Ride: great way to finish the holiday. Just fun and easy going! Only takes a few hours out of your schedule. Unfortunately, we only had Ahmed2 (there's more than one Ahmed driver...) on our last day - he was wonderful and spoke fantastic English - we wished we'd had him more. Afterwards, we went to a beautiful and peaceful riad for complementary mint tea and cake. General Comments: beware of many hidden costs. Although its advertised as a tour package, most of the time, you only seem to have paid for the drive there. Usually, you have to also pay for entry, a guide, and your lunch (plus any tips).But thank you, Click Excursions, for kindly transferring us to and from the airport. It was much appreciated. In summary, generally worth booking with, if you bear in mind the above."

It took us about 45 minutes to get down to the bottom, with incredible views the whole way - including wild monkeys!On the way back up, we stopped and had lunch, and we were served by a very enthusiastic man!

As you will appreciate - I am happy to recommend them and will use them again when we go back."

Our guide, Abdullah, was helpful and accommodating - giving good tips of when to take guides and when to not bother. The overnight stay in the desert was a real highlight, with a decent ride out on camel to a small private camp. Excellent stops along the way, with small things like the Rissani stop to visit a kasbah and co-operative differing the trip from a self-guided one. A couple of the lunch stops were at the pricier end of the market, which would be our only minor quibble - and food was good.Would recommend, particularly at the price."

Email correspondence was easy and professional. Emails were answered almost immediately and our requirements observed. No deposit was asked for and we were assured that we would be picked up at 10.00 am from our Riad (which was 6 km outside of the Medina). Precisely on time a driver came to pick up up in an air conditioned 4x4 and we were driven to the Medina to meet our guide. We payed our driver in Uk Sterling. I can not remember her name but our guide was lovely. Her English was excellent and her enthusiasm catching. We spent 3 hours hoofing around the historical sights of Marrakech. It was great. At the end of 3 hours, the vehicle was waiting to pick us up and take us back to our Riad.The only criticism I would make is we did end up in the Spice shop and the Carpet and Lamp shop. There was no hard sell but I just wonder why this always happens on tours? It leaves me feeling a little mugged off as it is hard not to buy when you almost feel obliged too. We were told that both these shops were government run and had fixed prices. But we did not ask to go shopping. Anyhow, it did not spoil our time, it would just have been better without.Overall this was an excellent experience."

            "review": "Great :). Firstly we took a trip to The Ouzoud waterfall, it was very beautiful.We were happy with our driver, I don't remember his name but he was French speaking and managed to communicate with some English, he was helpful and stopped wherever we asked, so we could take photos, along the way.We travelled at our own pace and this trip only ended up taking half a day, which we were happy with. We were offered a guide for approx \u00a310, but we declined and the driver directed us in the right direction, the waterfall was easy to find and we saw some lovely wild monkeys on route.There are two ways you can go, the way our driver directed us to was the best and took us to the bottom of the waterfall where we took some lovely pictures, you will encounter people trying to take you in the other direction, which we quickly realised takes you to the top of the waterfall so you are looking down, not so good.During our stay we took another trip and this time Ahmed was our driver, his car was very nice and his English was excellent. He told us lots of interesting information about the city and this time we went for a camel ride, it was fun (and a bit of a work out), we were left with a young man who was very sweet, he led us around the vast area filled with palm trees and even made me a little camel out of an old palm leaf.We definatly got our monies worth and didn't have to worry about taking photos as he stopped on route to take photos of us on our camels, the pictures came out very well and he obviously picked the best places to stop.The excursion included having some mint tea in a tent, Ahmed checked that we wanted to do this and we set off, it was just down the road, the tea was very nice and the tents were nice for photos. Ahmed chatted to us and answered any questions we had about our stay and the city.Ahmed would drop us anywhere we wanted after this but we asked if he would stay with us as we had trouble the previous day, trying to find the Tanneries & we also wanted to visit Yves Saint Laurent gardens, Ahmed was very helpful and willing to take us where we wanted and he waited for us even though we took a while to look round the beautiful gardens.We paid him extra on our departure but he never pressured us for money, he let us decide how much to give him. It was a massive help to us and we are very grateful :)I would definatly book this company again and recommend to anyone else.They also seemed to be the cheapest company I found whilst looking & while we were in Marrakech, our hotel were charging double the price.Definatly value for money, these trips made our holiday :)"

Put on good shoes as we did, it will help you. The berber guide here was Hassan, very nice guy. Beautiful views over the landscape. Third excursion was a day-trip to Essaouira. Nice car and the driver, Mohammed, could tell us in excellent english all kind of information about the country, culture and religion. We really learned a lot this day and thank him especially for that! We would certainly recommend Click Excursions!!!Visited Marrakech 22-27 februaryHans Peter and Marianne"

Ahmed was a great guide, met us just outside our Riad in his 4x4 and took us out for the day. There were 4 of us on the tour, my wife and I and another couple from the UK staying in Marrakesh. We visited a traditional souk/market which was really interesting to see and then went up the valley to see a waterfall. The hike to the waterfall and back took about 1 \u00bd hours with a local guide- quite touristy with shops etc on way, but well worth it for the views (worth wearing better footwear than our old slick bottomed trainers). After the tour we were taken to a restaurant for lunch- was abit more expensive than other places we ate at during our stay (fixed meal was the only option at 120dhr per person without drinks and this bought us a meal for 2 with drinks in the Jamaa el Fna in Marrakech) but was still nice and the views from the restaurant balcony were amazing. Click were suggested by our riad and I\u2019d certainly go with them again. The price was excellent at 50euro for 2 of us and Ahmed really was fantastic, very knowledgeable and friendly, nice going with other people too. Don\u2019t hesitate to book with Click."

He gave us insights into Morocco\u2019s history and the huge cultural change that the country is going through. He was outgoing, interesting and entertaining. The camel ride was the right length and we had the best cup of mint tea at the end of it.We then booked a third trip to Ourica valley with Ahmed, he quoted a very good price as we had booked two trips before. An eight hour trip into the Atlas mountains with beautiful views and an exciting climb to the waterfalls.As with everywhere in Morocco, there will be people trying to sell you things wherever you stop and you will need some money for tips."

We looked at a number of different tour companies in Marrakech but this one stood out due to the English speaking guides and the price compared with similar companies. We booked 1 trip to the Atlas Mountains initially as we weren't sure what to expect. The guide (Ahmed) was early and waiting for us in the hotel foyer. The car was smart, clean and extremely comfortable. Ahmed was funny and interesting and explained to us all about Morocco's history and answered our many questions. His English was excellent and he made us feel safe and comfortable the whole day.The mountains were breathtaking. We visited a few different spots where we took plenty of photos. This is NOT a visit where you are pressured into spending money. It was a thoroughly relaxing and enjoyable day. We chatted to Ahmed about other visits because we had enjoyed the mountains so much. We booked to go to Essaouira and although it was a longer drive we still had an amazing day. Where we had learned to make argon oil on our 1st trip, on this occasion we observed some tables and other fine pieces of furniture being constructed by hand with amazing intricate designs that made us wish we had bigger suitcases. The views were once again amazing and we were left to go at our own pace with no pressure. On both days Ahmed picked amazing places for lunch and I would thoroughly recommend the 'authentic' lunch as the fish and seafood were the best I've tasted. There are many tour companies in Marrakech but I cannot recommend this company (Ahmed in particular) highly enough. These trips were definitely the highlight of our holiday.

Our vehicle was a comfortable 4 x 4 with air con. Mahjoub is a lovely guy with very good English and gave so much information on our journey. There is a lot of driving involved in this excursion. If we needed a break, Mahjoub would always find us somewhere to stop and somewhere that had good clean toilets! He would stop wherever there was a good photo opportunity and at times became our own personal photographer, so we have plenty of pictures of the two of us together (plus some selfies with Mahjoub also!). My husband has prescription sunglasses, and unfortunately the night before the trip lost a screw from them, so lense had popped out. We explained this to Mahjoub, so whenever we went through a town he would drive slowly to keep an eye open for an Optician and also stop and ask for help. Unfortunately due to Ramadan, most places were shut. He even took a screw from his own spare sunglasses to see if it would fit, but it did not. He offered my husband his spare sunglasses to borrow, but luckily the next day we were able to find an optician which was open and quickly fixed them for us. The standouts for our first day was the driver over the Atlas Mountains, and Ait Ben Haddou. We stopped at a small hotel opposite Ait Ben Haddou for lunch and had a set 3 course meal for an extremely reasonable price. Am so glad we did Ait Ben Haddou before lunch as would have struggled afterwards as we were so full!For our first night we stayed at XALUCA DADES. We absolutely loved this hotel. It was decorated throughout in an African theme. The only issue we had is that because we had left our hotel in Marrakech and were returning to it after our desert trip, we had left our passports locked safely in our room safe. We were unaware that this hotel would need our passport details, so had to obtain them from our hotel in Marrakech. Had we not been able to get these details, I am not sure we would actually have been allowed to stay there as it seemed a very big deal! Our evening meal was included at this hotel and also breakfast, both buffet style.Day 2 and Mahjoub collected us at 9.00 for our journey towards the desert. We travelled through Dades Valley and Todra Gorge. I believe we arrived at Merzouga around 6pm. Mahjoub left us with our \u201ccamel boy\u201d and we started our 50 minute trek to our desert camp (AMANAR). We were met by a guy called Youssef who provided tea and snacks. There were 8 tents at this camp, and we were a little disconcerted to find we were to be the only guests staying there. Unfortunately Youssef didn\u2019t speak much English and we couldn\u2019t speak his languages! After our tea he asked if we would like to see our tent. It had a lovely comfortable double bed, plus a single bed, shower and most importantly our own toilet! We went outside to take photos from the dunes keeping an eye on the dining tent. When dinner was ready Youssef gestured us to come over and that\u2019s where our feast began. The food was absolutely gorgeous......and so much of it! After eating we retired to our tent. Had there been other guests, there would have been singing, so was a little disappointed as this would have added to the atmosphere.... this wouldn\u2019t have been able to take place outside though as unfortunately was very windy so sand was blowing everywhere. Day 3We were up for sunrise so we could take photos. We had breakfast and were on our way again for the return 50 minute camel journey for 6 a.m. Mahjoub was waiting for us to being our long journey back.....and long journey it was, with not so much impressive scenery on the way back. Thank goodness for good company, comfortable car and air conditioning!I could have written so much more, but will leave it here. Thanks to all at Saha tours for enabling us to experience such a unique 3 days that we will never forget. Ouzoud WaterfallsThis was an almost 3 hour journey from our hotel in Marrakech, but so worth it and good to meet with Mahjoub again. When we arrived, we decided to pay a local guide to show us the waterfalls and were glad we made this decision. It was worth the 150 dirhams he requested (for both of us, not per person). We arrived around 10.45 and were with him for 3 \u2013 3.30 hours. This place is absolutely beautiful. What I also loved other than the beauty of the falls was seeing the wild monkeys.....so nice to see monkeys that are not behind bars. We were shown to a restaurant directly in front of the waterfalls where we could eat whilst having the best possible views. We were also joined by one of the monkeys who stole some of our bread before being chased off by staff. Am so glad we did the private tour, as reading reviews on the shared tours, you only get around 2 hours there before being whisked off to eat somewhere else on the way home.....why would you want to do that when you can eat directly in front of the waterfall and relax? You are able to swim here but we chose not to. Totally recommend this tour, loved every minute."

            "review": "Two day/one night Zagora Desert . Majoub picked us up at our hotel in Marrakech at 8:00am. He was very friendly, and helped with our luggage. He explained the itinerary for the day and began telling us facts about the important places we drove past, such as the city walls of Marrakech and the Koutoubia Mosque. Our first stop was in the High Atlas Mountains where we had coffee on a terrace overlooking an amazing view of the mountains. Next, we stopped to see how almond butter is produced and we bought some cosmetic creams made of argon oil. We had lunch in a little village and then had a private tour of Ait Benhaddou, which dates back to the 11th century. Various films were filmed in this location, the most notable ones being Gladiator and Indiana Jones. We went to the top of Ait Benhaddou and captured some amazing photos of the desert and mountains. After that, we went to take pictures outside the film studio where movies are filmed. We continued our way towards Zagora through the Anti Atlas Mountains for more breathtaking photo opportunities. Along the way is also a Palm grove that we stopped at to take pictures of the sea of Palm trees that seems to never end. Before we arrived at the drop off location to mount the camels, Majoub asked if we would like to buy scarves for the desert. We said yes and he made sure that the merchant did not over charge us. The merchant originally said 100dh per scarf, but Majoub talked him down to 30dh each. When we arrived where the camels were waiting for us, Majoub said we could leave anything in the car that we did not need for the camel ride. We mounted the camel and trekked further into the desert and watched the sunset. We arrived at the Berber camp and we were greeted with mint tea and wafers. We went during Ramadan, which was so amazing to experience as cultural learning opportunity. Majoub had not eaten or drank anything all day, so before he met with us again, he had dinner. We finally met again and he allowed us to get any clothes or bags from his vehicle to take into our tent. Around 8pm, dinner was served by the camp workers. It consisted of bread, salad, tajine, and followed by fruit. After dinner the camp workers set a fire pit and played music. My partner and I stayed a little off to the side and just stared up the stars and listened to the drums and singing. There was another group of six people at the campsite, so it was a little overwhelming since they had took over the fire pit area and there were not enough seats. Either way, we still had an amazing night starring at the stars and taking it all in. We went to bed around 1am. We slept with the door of the tent open because it was still uncomfortably hot even at night. The toilets and showers were very nice. I was a little disappointed with how nice it was actually. I thought we'd have more of an authentic experience, but for those who don't really like the outdoors, this is perfect for you! The next morning, drums woke us for the sun rise. After the sunrise, breakfast was served. It was a simply breakfast of bread and croissants, with coffee and orange juice. We decided not to ride the camels back, so we got in the car and started our journey back to Marrakech. We didn't stop often since it was the same route from the day before. We eventually stopped for lunch at the same place we bought argon oils, so if you want to buy more, this is your opportunity. Majoub dropped us off at the train station in Marrakech since we were going off to Casablanca. First class tickets for the train are only 150dh/person to Casablanca and can be purchased at the station. All in all, we had a wonderful time. Majoub was an amazing tour guide and he is a great person in generally and really cares about the happiness of his clients. Tips for travelers: Bring extra cash with you. The economy in the desert heavily relies on tourism. You will find that the places you stop to take pictures are coincidentally places that locals have set up shop to sell souvenirs. You have friends and family at home that would love a little something from Morocco, so help out the locals and buy a little something each place you stop. Also, make sure you have enough money to tip your tour guides and anyone who serves you. The tour at Ait Benhaddou is free, but we tipped the guide for his time. Again, tourism is what drives their economy. We also made sure to tip the workers at the camp. One more tip, as amazing as it was to travel alone with just my partner, we discussed how much more fun it would be with a close group of friends. The other group of six at the camp site seemed to have an amazing time, but they were there for themselves and didn't seem to want to interact with us even when we tried to interact with them. It made it a bit awkward, like we were invading their vacation. So I would highly recommend to make this a group trip so that you can fully have fun and let loose when the drums and music begins around the fire. Thank you again for an unforgettable vacation!"

Booking was very easy and Youssef was very responsive to all of my emails prior to arrival. Majoub was our guide and was very nice and knowledgeable. It is a very long drive to Zagora from Marrakech. Majoub stopped many times to take pictures as well as at Ait Benhaddou and gave us a tour. We were very jet lagged during our drive and Majoub would make sure we were up for important sights. The camel ride and overnight stay in the Zagora dessert is something that I will never forget. The guides in the dessert were so nice and welcoming. We were greeted upon arrival at the camp by Rasheed with mint tea, crackers and cookies. The campsite is very lovely with beds, showers and toilets. Dinner was wonderful and the evening was capped by songs and dance around a campfire. The guides with Saha tours are truly wonderful people and made us feel incredibly welcome during our short time with them. I'd highly recommend using this tour group. Be aware that this trip includes a lot of drive time (about 6 hours each day) but it will be something you will never forget. Thank you Majoub!"

A fantastic tour, brilliant tour guides, different and intimate and not constrained by other tourists.From the beginning, the communication from Youssef was outstanding and reassuring. It was his prompt and professional interaction with us that meant we chose his service for our honeymoon tour from Marrakesh to the Sahara Desert and back over three days. We were slightly worried about the Western Union transfer of deposit but this worry proved unnecessary.Rachyd and Zyed (Sp*) collected us from our Riad in Marrakech and the adventure started! Rachyd was so knowledgable about the history of Morocco, the politics of the background stories that he spoke about were an interesting and insightful introduction for a novice throughout the journey.The first two days of driving out to the Sahara were interesting and conducted in short bursts, interspersed with coffee stops, photo panoramic opportunities and old settlements. We went out in search for nomads, history and culture, sometimes off the beaten track and we weren't disappointed. The night in the Sahara was enchanting and special. Camel riding into the dunes to watch the sunset was magical. We shared the camp with only one other couple who we had a traditional sing song with before bed. We chose to upgrade to superior accommodation. Private plumbing and showers in the tents were an absolute treat - unbelievable in the middle of the desert!! The service during the meals was fantastic and Rachyd's personal touches were heartfelt and beautiful - a honeymoon cake at the end of what can only be described as a feast was almost too much, but an extremely kind, personal touch.The return drive was a bit of a slog - about 12 hours. However, we went a different route back, with different anecdotes, sights and stories to keep us interested (when we weren't sleeping) and a traditional Berber lunch was a fantastic experience made possible by Rachyd and Zyed.A massive thank you for making our honeymoon trip extra special and interesting!"

The driver Ali and Hmad our guide were knowledgeable, trustworthy, funny, smart and not in your face or pushy. We did stop at a few shops but we had a choice so if we did not want anything we could have left. It was nice and Hmad also helped us get a good price as best as you will get unless you are with locals or family. The 4x4 car was always clean, comfortable and we had an option for AC but we chose not to have it on. We learnt a lot of the culture, local practices, tribes, nomads, Berbers, Arabs, languages etc although I am no good at speaking. We loved the music, the quiet stretches when you just want to immerse yourself in the view and the local life / villages etc. we could stop anytime but I chose to take photos while moving, and they look great. Especially the local village life. We are both vegetarian and we had no problems eating at any of the places we stopped at lunch or overnight. The hotels were good quality and we felt safe all the time. The desert experience and overnight in a luxury camp was our highlight. We had the best food their and the camels were the cutest. Everything was working and we had a nice shower in the tent. All our stops overnight were clean and good quality. For us the gorges, the Tichka pass, the Draa valley, rissani market, were good places we would want to stay longer at these places especially the gorges. Everything was good timed and professional, friendly, practical, reliable, trustworthy and easy going. Thank you for making our trip comfortable and lovely. "

He gave us the names of our guide, Mahjoul, and driver, Hassan, and said they will be meeting us for pick up at the airport. When we arrived, they were right there and made sure we had all that we needed before we made the long trip through High Atlas and eventually Merzouga. Along the way, Mahjoul was very informative and stopped at any number of stops and requests we made. I think he got us to take more amazing panoramic views than we ever would try to. The meals we had were delicious and what I loved was that he always took us to the cleanest possible bathrooms, no matter where we were. Our driver Hassan was also amazing. Even though he didn't speak a lot, his gestures and reactions to events made us laugh all throughout our trip. The ride there and back was very comfortable. We upgraded to the superior accommodations and did not regret it one bit. Even our camps were amazing. It far exceeded our expectation of what it meant to \"camp\" in the desert.

Also when we asked him not to bring us to one of these standard tourist food places to eat an overpriced lunch, he dropped us at a place only with locals where we were the only tourists. We felt also safe with our driver Ali who had to cope with flooded roads (he literally had to drive through a river) and snow in the Atlas (which seemed to be something very rare).We also very much enjoyed the stay and the dinner in our first hotel (superior accomodation category) which was very cute and designed with a lot attention to Detail. A great experience! However, the difference between standard and superior category wasn't clear to us on the second night when we stayed in the tent in the desert. Unfortunately, we were quite unfortunate with the weather in the Sahara, there was a sandstorm going on and that made the camel ride and stay in the tent ...Let's call it an adventure ;-) But well, nobody can help that and all the staff on any place was always helpful, professional and friendly. I definitely recommend Saha Tours for this experience!"

We absolutely enjoyed our time spent with Mahjoub, the guide, and Zaid, the driver. They are a pair of happy and responsible brothers. Our trip is quiet unique as we encountered a rare snow storm at high atlas, strong sand storm at Sahara desert and flood during these 4 days. Zaid and Mahjoub did above and beyond to accommodate our needs. They always try their best to make sure our experiences are pleasant and wonderful. Within 4 days, we have been through deep snow, desert, flood and many beautiful sceneries. Our trip was adventurous and crazy, while we knew we were in good hands. Zaid is a calm, experienced and skillful driver. Because of the snow storm, many roads were closed. Zaid and Mahjoub made endless calls to figure out the best detoured routes. Though we were off-road most of time, we felt comfortable and safe as we knew Zaid and Mahjoub are experienced and familiar with these areas. We enjoyed their company so much. The owner, Youssef is very responsive, accommodating and always provides great valued packages for us. Our experience with Sahatour is wonderful. Thanks for making our Morocco trip memorable. We are talking about brining our 10-year-old little boy back to experience the fun with us next time. Highly recommended."

Hassan, our guide and driver and Mohammed Oukhayi the second driver, were so much fun but at the same time very professional. Hassan and Mohammed did everything to make our trip enjoyable. They were flexible and no request was too difficult. An example of this was that we were to drive from the desert to Midelt so as the journey from there to Fez the next day would not be too long. We loved the desert so much that we decided to stay in a hotel on the edge of the desert and 'chill' for a night. This was the best decision and Hassan had no problem changing our arrangements.We were in two 4x4 vehicles which made it possible to go off road on a few occasions. There were many highlights but a few that we will never forget were visiting a nomadic Berber family who lived in a cave and sharing mint tea with them; visiting Mohammed's home and enjoying a beautiful lunch prepared by his mother and sisters and trekking into the desert on camels to camp overnight. Although many groups camp in the desert and this could be thought as 'touristy' it was still a beautiful experience. The climb to the top of the sand hill twice to view sunset and sunrise was truly worth it.We chose mid-range accommodation and all riads or hotels were excellent. We particularly enjoyed the Hotel Babylon in the Dades Gorge. After dinner the staff played the bongos and got the guests up dancing! The camel dance was hillarious!We liked all towns and cities we visited but one that particularly stays in our minds is the 'Blue City', Chefchouen. A smallish town with a nice vibe.Thanks Hassan and Mohammed for putting up with three talkative women and three not so talkative men from Aussie! Moustache says hello!!"

We did a lot of research before booking with tripstomorocco.comThere were quite a few companies doing professional tours, but we were looking for something more - personable guides. We got a very professional tour, with great accommodation, and all our requests were accommodated - but we didn't get any sort of personal relationship with the guide. He did his job, and that was it, unlike the relationships a lot of the reviews mentioned. I think there were a number of reasons for this. One big one is that as companies get bigger, they employ more people, who may not be as personable as the original people. We had Mbarak as driver (who was personable, but he mainly just did the driving). Our guide was Yousseff (one of a number of Yousseff's employed). Our guide answered any questions we asked, but wasn't interested in having a conversation with us. He preferred to spend his time talking to our driver (which may be a reason for those who had a combined driver/guide having a better experience). We may have been partly to blame - we're outgoing and friendly, but we're 65 and 73, and our guide was a single man of 30 (and to make matters worse, my husband had picked up a bad case of the flu in Morocco, so wasn't very well). We also preferred to just pick up some bread, cheese and yoghurt for lunch rather than spend ages sitting in a restaurant in the middle of the day, which may have affected their plans for their lunches. Unlike a lot of the other reviewers, we're very experienced travellers (and have spent two months in Morocco many years ago) so probably were more independent, and didn't need a guide as much.In summary, a very good professional company, but some guides can be a bit impersonal if they feel they don't have a lot in common with you."

Bad points:\u2022Slow response to our emails before departure. \u2022Lack of information in the itinerary regarding travelling times/distances (e.g. once we were told 45 minutes but drove for 2 hours which led to us having to cut short places of interest (for instance we had to cut short the tour in Volubilis and were only given 20 minutes for a tour of Skoura Kasbah)). \u2022Our guide's lack of experience. Excuses were made for spending long periods of time on a phone whilst driving when we had said at the outset that we were unhappy with this. In Volubilis we were allocated a guide who couldn't speak English (we resolved this ourselves) and our guide on 4 occasions started to move the car whilst one of our party were still climbing in. After several days he became distracted and distant and the car journeys became uncomfortable for us and, most probably, for our guide as well. \u2022Uncomfortable vehicle (the middle seat in the back was uncomfortable for longer journeys). \u2022Last minute changes to accommodation (one being poor). We were told we could go elsewhere if we didn't like it, but after a long day we just wanted to sleep. We booked this trip far in advance so would have been much happier if we had known where we were booked earlier (as we requested by email) so that we could research the places. \u2022Lack of information regarding the need to pay entrance fees/tips which increased the cost of the holiday considerably (Volubilis, movie studio, Skoura Kasbah, people carrying luggage, to see the nomads, to watch the singers, to be shown around by guides, etc.) Overall we had a good trip - the locations we visited were interesting and most of the guides we were allocated were enthusiastic and knowledgeable.As regards Trips to Morocco there was room for improvement and I hope this review helps the company to see where those improvements can be made, particularly in terms of communication, clarity in pricing/details and ensuring the focus is on customers' hopes and wishes for their trip."

Mohammed replied and we discussed options for a 3 full days in Morocco trip starting in Marrakech. He was very flexible and open to whatever my husband and I wanted to do. He remained flexible and we discussed options and finalizing plans even after arriving in Marrakech. He met us at the airport and the dialogue began. The desert was an option but it sounded like too much driving. Mohammed then suggested the Atlas Mountains trip for the next morning. We had a beautiful day driving up to the snowy mountains. We stopped and took breaks for coffee Etc. We visited the Kasbah and that was incredible as well as a great antique and rug shop. We saw argon oil being extracted from the beans and madeInto all different products. We bought great soaps Etc to share. Without rehashing every detail I can tell you that Mohammad really watched out for us including guiding me across a river stepping on stones and bags of rice. I thought I might fall in but not a chance. We stopped for fresh squeezed orange juice after I mentioned to Mohammed that I heard the oranges were Delicious. And we bought oranges to snack on for the next few days. Day 2: We visited Marrakech palaces and markets with a guide who knew Marrakech inside and out ending in the Majarelle gardens. We bought wonderful spices and oils There. I will be cooking Tagine. Day 3: Our third day we traveled with Ebrahima, Mohammed's cousin and met up with his twin brother also a Mohammed in a seaside town of Essaouira. Great market there too. We bought freshly fried sole and picnicked on the beach. Ebrahima told me he and his brother did the same. We also stopped to admire an argon tree full of goats. Wild. I felt safe and enlightened the entire time I was in Morocco. This family multigenerational business holds itself up to a very high stands and I would recommend them in a heartbeat.

We never felt pressured or harangued and in every city we were safe and free from any of the hassle I had read about online.  We will be back! Thank you Mohammed Aabou and Trips to Morocco for giving us memories and experiences that made our lives richer. This is the spirit of Morocco and it will be forever in our hearts.

            "review": "The Best Way to do Morocco!. I found this tour company through other reviews on Trip Advisor, and would like to add my recommendation as well. We just got back from our trip in March, 2016 starting in Tangier and driving to Marrakech. Our guide was Mohammed Abdou, who with his father and brother have a small family business as a tour company. We were met at the airport, and then drove to Chefchaoen, a city largely painted blue. It was a fascinating place with winding alleyways. Mohammed employs local guides for the various cities we visited, and Achmed was a very colorful character in Chefchaoen with a red fez cap, red shawl and white robe - and an iPad under his arm. He claimed to have been a local guide for the Obamas, and pictured in a Lonely Planet publication.On our twelve day trip we visited a number of places too numerous to mention at length: Roman ruins, a movie studio, 450 year old kasbahs, monkeys that live in the snow, etc. What is worth mentioning is buying leather jackets at a tannery in Fez for $200 each that were custom tailored for us and delivered to our hotel. The alleyways of Fez were even more narrow, and our local guide Nabile, took us into the bowels of the souk where you couldn\u2019t go alone and not get lost.After Fez we were in the desert for two nights, one of which we stayed in a tent among the sand dunes after a three hour camel trek. It was a luxury tent with a toilet and a shower obviously designed for tourist. The trip through the dunes at sunset was definitely a highlight, as was sunrise. We later did visit an authentic Berber nomad tent where we were served tea, and the young girls showed off their baby goats.Mohammed was gracious enough to take us to his own home where his mother served us tea. Moroccan tea always is flavored with mint and sugar, served with flare, waving the teapot about three feet above the small glasses. The market is Rassani, close to Mohammed\u2019s home and close to the desert, was also quite an experience for it\u2019s rural qualities: unpaved streets, donkey parking lot, blacksmiths, goat sellers, spices, and all manner of produce. Here the majority of women were covered.We also visited the souk in Marrakech, another place one would get lost without a guide. This was the biggest we toured with every imaginable product: rows of handmade shoes, wedding dresses, head scarves, dates & figs, lamps, meat & fish, vegetables & fruit. And in the Medina were snake charmers, entertainers, fortune tellers, and belly dancers (men dressed as women).The hotels where we stayed were all great, many riads or the former homes of wealthy Moroccans adorned with high ceilings and intricate carving and tile work. With one exception, the riads helped us feel we were steeped in the Moroccan culture. Our favorite hotel was in Marrakech, the La Maison Arabe which was definitely a five star operation. The cost of the tour was very low, but a cautionary note: every day you will be tipping local guides, anyone you photograph, and buying most of your meals. So the ultimate cost was beyond the basic tour quote. In La Maison Arabe alone we spent an additional $500 on three dinners, the spa, and cooking school. In addition, it was difficult to resist the many enticing products available. We spent more in Morocco than on any of our many previous trips, buying a carpet and a set of dishes. We also bought an extra suitcase to bring home the many gifts and souvenirs we purchased.The other cautionary note would be that there are some days which are primarily driving from one place to another. On those days there are stops, but they aren\u2019t for long. However, it was the only way to cover the distance we did and see things like the desert, ride camels, visiting nomads that live in tents or caves, and traverse the country. We did have many full days in Chefchaoen, Fez, and Marrakech. I\u2019m sure Mohammed could customize a trip with less driving, but you would miss the diversity we experienced. Mohammed is good about email communication and is responsive to your individual preferences.My wife and I prefer travel with a guide, avoiding tours with groups. We like to have a guide, interpreter and driver just for the two of us. Mohammed ably served as all three, and I would recommend him heartily to future travelers who want this kind of experience."

Maybe back into the souks for one last adventure! On Monday, for me, a flight from Casablanca to Colombo. This has been a wonderful experience made even more special by the presence of my two great mates Barney and Dave. We have laughed our way across the depth and breathe of this country, challanged our views of the Arabic world and the Islamic religion, met some wonderful people and had some amazing adentures. We ate interesting food (never want tp see a tangine or cous cous again!!!!), drank local beers and wines, saw amazing sites and generally immersed ourselves in the Moroccon culture. Peregrine/Intrepid tours are great at getting behind the scenes and away from the glitse and razzle dazzle of the fake tourist world. We feel we saw the real Morocco. We eere welcomed into Berber homes, tried our hand at Berber drumming, bargained hard in the markets and asked questions repeatedly and learned so much from Said our main guide.We were woken by the call to prayer, travelled hundreds of Km on fairly good roads. We had perfect weather with no wind and crystal clear blue skies. We met wonderful, honest people always smiling and happy. We explored Medinas, Kasbahs, souks etc; thousands of years old and dripping with history. The country is clean and functional and moderate in their views on important issues that are dividing this world.We observed people living much the same way as their forfathers did. We heard wonderful music, rode camels and gazed at the stars in the Sahara. We met people on our tour group who were interesting, open, sharing and caring. We bonded and it was hard to say goodbye to them after two weeks. No tears but lots of kisses and cuddles and promises to keep in touch. We extended an open invitation to all of them to visit Australia and we will show them around.We fell in love with the Morrocon people and learnt a great deal about ourselves.In short we ticked every box on what 'adventure travel' is all about. It's not overly luxurious but has a great balance of roughing it and feeling pampered and looked after. The measure of any trip like this is the manner in which the participants bond and the interactive quality of the guide. Said was always on the ball and ready to give that little bit extra to make our experiences meaningful and valuable.So all you readers out there. Get off the couch and book a trip. You will never look back. As a famous writer once said 'To find yourself you have to leave home'But now it's back home for Barney and Dave and it's off to Sri Lanka for me. Thanks to my two mates for making this trip so special. And thanks to Judy and Nita for providing the leave passes so they could join me. I am forever in your debt.Salam Alekum"

It felt as though we had known him for ages. On our return journey we were hit by a storm up in the Atlas mountains. It was cold, dark and visibility was almost zero in all directions thanks to the pouring rain but Mohammed drove us calmly and safely through the storm back to Marakesh. We spent many hours in the car but didn\u00b4t reflect on the time as the landscape was interesting and Mohammed told us, in good english, knowledgeably and interesting about his beautiful country."

We changed our itinerary mid way and there was no objections and things were rearranged with no fuss. We were treated to some memorable experiences that we had not expected. Visiting the families living in caves being one in particular. Because we had a four wheel drive vehicle we were able to visit sights that would not be available on a bus tour.The things we will remember most, along with the awesome sights, were our guide and our driver. We both felt a genuine bond with them. In particular, our guide, Yousef who was genuinely a kind, warm and thoughtful person. Yousef, our driver, did not speak English which made it difficult to connect but his big smile said it all.We were sad to say goodbye but hopefully we will keep in touch when back home."

We were greeted at the airport by our guide, who led us to a very nice driver and a fairly new Toyota Prado SUV. The guide, the driver, and the SUV was with us the entire trip (just for the two of us!). There was a lot of driving involved since we visited a number of sites across Morocco (Casablanca, Fes, the desert, Marakaech...), and there were a lot to see as well. We booked mid-range hotels, which were very good considering their prices. However, it is worth considering to book luxury hotels with Mohammed, considering the hotel price in Moroco is quite low. The mid-range hotel are mostly riads, which are very Moroccan but could be slightly uncomfortable. I would guess luxury hotels are more close to business hotels in the west."

It was my friend, Jessica, who arranged our trip with Mohammed and he was prompt to reply on our queries. Though we didn\u2019t get a chance to meet him when we arrived in Casablanca, there are two Yousef who welcomed us. It's Mohammed's father, as our driver, and the younger Yousef, as our lead guide. They\u2019re so nice, warm and kind to us, added to that they are very punctual.And since we\u2019re two female travelers, they made us feel that we were safe and secure all throughout the trip. As Yousef always tells us that we are family, indeed, we\u2019re with our family. We had good times with them too. We enjoyed Uncle Yousef\u2019s funny gestures and his music while on the road. He is such a very cool guy. So with Yousef, a kind-hearted, honest and responsible guy. He shared some interesting and funny stories with us. Overall, our journey was 100% awe-inspiring. It\u2019s quite tiring because of the long drive, yet each place we go are all worth a visit. It\u2019s like looking for a hidden treasure and we\u2019re fortunate to found it. We\u2019ve never thought that we will explore the Morocco in one of a kind adventure as we had. Experiencing the Atlas Mountain, got the feel of gorges and captivated the beauty of Sahara Desert\u2026the sunset and gazillion stars in the sky are surreal! By the way, we had good hotel accommodations during our stay. When we were in Morocco, I saw again how simple life it should be. And as the saying goes, it\u2019s the simple things in life that are most extraordinary. Berbers have rich in culture and the people are warm and hospitable. We even had a jam session with some of the Berbers during a visit in the canal\u2026that\u2019s really awesome and one my favorite!

Our driver, Hamid, was excellent, and enthusiastically imparted information on the culture and history of this diverse country, as well as looked after both of us when we got a little sick.For anyone with a limited time in Morocco who want to get a taste for what the country has to offer, TripsToMorocco is a great option.

We spent 20 of those days with the company owner Mohammed Abou (our guide) and Yusef, his father (our driver). In the end we feel like we now have family in Morocco. It became apparent early on that we were not prepared for how strenuous this trip would be. I was ill coming into the trip and my husband has mobility issues. Mohammed suggested that we modify the itinerary to give us more days of resting after days of long drives. We readily agreed. This meant that Mohammed had to cancel reservations and seek new reservations, which he did willingly. My illness caught up with me in their home town of Erfoud and a doctor was called to our hotel room. I ended up in a local clinic receiving IV fluids and having antibiotics prescribed. We did not have the cash required to pay the doctor ($170 USD), so Mohammed paid the bill and we paid him back two days later. He also checked us into a five star hotel so that I could rest and recover. This meant that we also owed him for the accommodation upgrade ($100 USD per night). I was concerned about paying him, but he was not concerned. We had the opportunity to visit the home of Mohammed and Yusef and meet their Mother/Wife who prepared lunch for us. She also did a load of laundry for us. Yusef is a GREAT driver, having driven large trucks and taxis for a living in the past. The traffic in the cities is the most chaotic I have ever experienced. You need a good driver to handle this. Because I was still recovering from my illness, Mohammed suggested that we upgrade to a 5 star hotel in Marrakesh. We were glad that we did and on our last day together we paid Mohammed for the upgrade, which was only $100 USD per night. Be advised that credit cards are not widely accepted in Morocco. Be prepared to withdraw Moroccan Dirhams from ATM's for the cash needed for meals and other incidentals. The only places we were able to use credit cards were to pay for the carpet we purchased and had shipped home and for meals (and massages) at the two 5 star hotels. Tripstomorocco.com does not accept credit cards. We sent Mohammed Western Union funds to pay our deposit and used a bank wire transfer to pay the balance prior to our trip. Be advised I would only use a wire transfer, to avoid the Western Union fees. Our credit union guaranteed the bank wire transfer to be delivered in 20 days, but Mohammed received it in ten calendar days. Best to allow for the 20 days when you send the wire. In the end we had to be driven from Marrakesh to Casablanca for our flight home. Mohammed and Yusef had a new couple flying in to Marrakesh that afternoon, so they arranged for a different driver and guide to drive us. When we left the hotel I forgot my camera in the lobby. Mohammed called our new driver and we returned to the hotel to find Mohammed and Yusef standing on the street with my camera in hand. You can't go wrong with this company. We passed four other groups being led by brothers, cousins and friends of Mohammed. They are busy, but make you feel like you are their only customer. Mohammed told us that he felt like we were his parents and he wanted to treat us like he would them. I could go on for hours and never say enough good things. You can't go wrong with this family run company."

Amar was warm, easygoing, well-informed, prepared and professional, and has years of experience leading tours. His English was excellent. All details were well-planned including where to meet, hotels, meals, and activities. He had many interesting things to show us, but also seemed to make adjustments according to our interests. Some highlights:--beautiful scenery while driving through various parts of the Atlas Mtns. and the Ziz Valley--fascinating visits to the ancient walled city of Ait Ben Haddou, and a fossil mining/finishing factory, where the process of extracting and sculpting fossils from slices of rock was demonstrated--some off-roading near Erfoud where we saw fossil beds and visited with a nomadic family --morning walk in the peaceful, vertical-walled Dades Gorge--overnight in the dunes of Erg Chebbi: met up with a group of about 15 other tourists, and went by camel about 90 minutes into the dunes at sunset; guides made a delicious tagine, played drums and sang for us; slept on comfortable cots in tents with walls of rugs; and rode back at sunrise the next morning. Perfect, comfortable, well-planned, and visually amazing. Will probably never ride a camel again, once is enough!I have mention that Amar really went the extra mile for us: when he dropped us off in Fes, it was nighttime and he had hours of driving to do to start back toward Marrakesh. When we arrived, we weren't able to contact our hotel, so he walked us and our luggage through the medina to find it, making his day longer and our arrival much, much easier. You will be in good hands with this family of experienced tour guides, and will see and experience amazing things. Advice: arrange as many days as you can--our trip was quite relaxed, but there's an infinite amount to see in Morocco."

We visited the fortress of Rabat, the mountains of Chefchouen, the Roman mosaics and ruins of Volubilis, the forests of the mid-Atlas, the Sahara desert, the tree-less peaks of the high Atlas mountains, the intricate medina of Fes, and more. The driving of Mbarek and the good humor of our daily guide on the road, Yussef, made the driving portions of the trek extremely enjoyable. Stops were well-planned. The specific city guides they had arranged for us in the larger cities of Meknes, Fes, Marrakesh were incredibly knowledgeable. I learned so much. It was a tremendous experience for the mind and the heart."

            "review": "Casablanca to the Desert, 8- days with Trips to Morocco. We found Trips to Morocco on Trip Advisor, looking for an affordable, local company to arrange a custom tour for my wife and I.\u00a0 After looking into 7 tour companies, we decided to go with Trips to Morocco largely because of Mohammed's prompt replies and the itinerary he put together which really met our expectations and needs from the beginning.\u00a0 It appears that most of the reviewers had Mohammed as their guide. We did meet him at the end of the trip, however we had his best friend Yousef and his brother M'barak as our guide and driver. They were always on time, patient, knowledgeable and fun. All the things we expected to see and do, we did. We did it all while listening to their addictive desert compilation of music....\"the sun, the moon, baby all the stars....\" (sorry, inside joke with them).The hotels/riads we stayed at were all good. The Sofitel in Casablanca was super nice\u00a0 (maybe too nice for us) and La Maison Arabe in Marrakech was our favorite.\u00a0 The lodgings east of the Atlas Mountains in the desert region were all good. One the A/C didn't work in our room, but we should have asked for a new room instead of settling for a poor night sleep. They have set places they use for tours, but if you want to stay somewhere specific, let them know.Don't kid yourself, Morocco is a big country. The days can be long when traveling from one destination to the next. You are in their Toyota SUV for awhile each day. We traveled 1000 miles in our 5 days actually traveling.I would totally recommend them, but there were a few things that we learned and you should be aware of with this tour (and other similar companies).1) Can't book with a credit card. Cash only. We used Western Union money transfers which does charge a fee. Use a bank card instead of a credit card because it is treated as a cash withdrawal and starts charging interest immediately. 2) They arrange your custom tour and provide safe transportation along the way. They are not with you 24-7, so you will be with other guides for specific tours like the Hassan II Mosque, camel trek, Marrakech souks, etc. and left to do as you like most evenings once you get to your destination. They typically stay somewhere else.\u00a0 So, when they drop you off at 5-6pm, you generally won't see them again until the next morning. This wasn't exactly what we expected, but did appreciate this as the tour went on but would have welcomed a bit more presence in the first couple days to help with the adjustment.3) I think they try to prime all their customers with the need-to-know details, but there were a few we could have used, like the famous Moroccan buying experience. Thankfully we had read a little about it, so don't be shy and ask them if they didn't let you know. Another was letting us know the cost of places that we visited while traveling to our destination ahead of time. It was only 20 dirham (~$2), but would have been good to know that beforehand instead at the end that's all. Not a big deal, but carry small bills/change on you at all times and just ask.4) All tours appear to bring their customers to specific shops and hotels that are owned and operated by people from their town/region. Mohammed and his friends and family are Berbers from the desert, so you will be exposed to more shopping by them in that region. Are the shops/hotels nice, fair and not pushy? Yes. Would they take you somewhere else? Sure if you ask them. Folks we talked to on other tours (which you will run into while traveling to/from the desert since they stay at similar places) mentioned the same thing, even suggested that tours get a percentage of sales made. I really can't speak to that, but the bottom line is, they try to help their own people prosper first. I can understand that. Something to keep in mind anyway. If there's a place you specifically want to shop or stay at, let them know ahead of time. They really do want to please the customer first and foremost.By the end of the trip though, we left with some fantastic memories, great pictures, awesome suveniors and new friends in Mohammed, Yousef and M'Barak.\u00a0 It really is a family business started by Mohammed aabou's father. They are customer focused and a great company to use if you want to arrange a tour in Morocco with the independence not typically provided by other tours. So I encourage you to seriously consider them if you are looking into a custom Moroccan tour. If you have any questions, send me a trip advisor message and I would be happy to reapond."

It was truly a fantastic experience and created such wonderful memories. We arranged our excursion as part of our fantastic Great South Tour with a company called Trips to Morocco. Tour organizer Mohammed Aabou and his brother M'barack arranged everything and took great care to ensure that we and our grandchildren were comfortable and safe (no small accomplishment when the temperature in the desert is topping 115 degrees!). We chose to rise early (4:30 am) to see the sunrise. It was spectacular! Plus the early departure got us out of the desert and back to our air-conditioned riad before the temperature got too hot. Though we saw many wonderful sights during our Moroccan vacation, the desert excursion topped everything. If you've ever fantasized about an experience such as this, you should definitely go. Adventure awaits!"

Mohammed was responsive over email with my questions about itinerary and adding in stops and trips that were not initially on their template schedules. And we did one skype call to answer my questions and organized a good schedule that responded to our wishes and what we wanted to see. During the trip, Mohammed was our guide and driver for 9 days driving around the country, and everything went without problems. They had recommended Riads and Hotels for our all our stops, and were flexibile to allow my personal riad choices instead when possible and available, which I appreciated. There were city specific guides for our visits in Fes and Marrakech and other attractions like Volibulis, who were local and had more detailed knowledge, and they were also good. It was generally easy for my friend and I, as two solo-women travelers to be in Morocco, as long as we respected local cultural norms, which is respectful anywhere you travel. But even with those precautions, there were still misunderstandings and assumptions. I would recommend that clear boundaries are laid out with guides and with Trips to Morocco to ensure no misunderstandings and miscommunications on this front. I would recommend using Trips to Morocco with this caveat."

We got a superb and fascinating insight into this country from this knowledgeable man - it was incredible! We have been on quite a few journey around the world, but the guided tour provided by Ahmed was superb.Ahmed was also very flexible and worked his itinerary around all our needs and wishes. We had some local guides in Marrakech, Rabat and Meknes who were ok, but not a patch on Ahmed. We also enjoyed our accommodation in beautiful Riads, wherever at all possible, - something you cannot have if you travel in a large group.All we can say is - if you plan on going to Morocco, do it with Trips to Morocco Tours and, if at all possible, take Ahmed as your driver/guide.May 2015"

Mohammed planned a well packed trip in the 10 days we had allocated in Morocco and even catered the trip to our needs. The entire trip was so extremely well planned, we didn't have to worry about a thing. The accommodation was amazing, we stayed in the most beautiful places which were all well located. Our guide and driver were lovely and we had many laughs along the way. There was no way we could have covered Morocco to the extent we did nor managed it without such ease without this tour. The car was extremely clean and necessary for the long trips. However if you're not into long car trips I would recommend allocating more time for the trip. There were plenty of stops along the way and local guides provided for the confusing souks. As a note I would not buy anything until you get to or are in Marrakech as it's a lot cheaper to buy things yourself in the souks. The camel trek in the Sahara desert was definitely a highlight and something I will always remember. Thank you trips to Morocco for an incredible adventure."

It only took a couple of emails and the whole itinerary was organised and customised to fit in with our requests. We were picked up by Yousef, our guide, who said we were now family and he would ensure we had great holiday- which we did. The accomodation in local riads was all excellent and in good locations, particularly important in Fez and Marrakech where exploring the old alley ways and shops occupied us for days. The whole trip was very well planned all the experiences very memorable - many of which you could not do as an independent traveller or in a large group.Yousef was also the name of our driver (Mohameds father) and he did a great job of getting us around the country safely and kept us entertained with his singing- amazingly he seemed to know everyone in Morocco which provided us with constant entertainment. Somehow the car, a late model Prado, was cleaned inside and out everyday - even in the desert where there was dust everywhere. A 4x4 was essential for the places we visited.Yousef our guide was also a lovely young man who had great knowledge of Morocco and we had no difficulty in spending 16 days, some of which were long, with both the Yousefs. They were very reliable, took into consideration all of our needs and were very helpful.Highlights of the trip were Chefchaouen, Marrakech, Essaouira, Dedes Gorge and of course the Desert- where we got drenched in a rainstorm while on a camel heading to our luxury campsite in the desert!.We would have no hesitation in recommending Trips To Morocco and our itinerary -well worth making time and spending at least 16 days in Morocco if possible."

Especially the shining and smiling song in the car!!I cannot praise them highly enough.Everything exceeded our expectations, the quality of the hotels, the meals and the fascinating things we saw and that you will see we're mind boggling, we will never ever forget this trip, it is something we will tell our grandchildren.Also, we would like to make a mention of the local guides which they sometimes use, they choose well informed, quality guides, especially Mohammed the local guide from Marrakech, we cannot praise him highly enough, his knowledge was incredible, his kindness and humour really comforting in a foreign land.He made Marrakech for us, we would have been lost without him, a truly global human being if that makes any kind of sense.So thank you Mohammed, M'Barack, Yussef and Mohhamed from Marrakech, you gave us a fascinating insight into Moroccan and Berber culture that we will always cherish.To fellow travellers, you don't have to worry about a thing with these guys, you will be in safe hands.

I cannot recommend Trips to Morocco highly enough for your Moroccan discovery adventure of a lifetime!"

            "review": "An Incredible Experience. We travelled with Mohammed from Trips to Morocco, mid March 2014 for a 6 day tour. We are a family of five, and were all perfectly comfortable in Mohammed's Toyota with all our luggage very skillfully piled into the back of the car. Mohammed made our trip so complete and interesting taking time to explain and share information about the places we travelled to and his culture. The 6 days involved heading out towards the Erg Chebbi desert ( A real highlight) through the high Atlas mountains, the valley of the roses,Todra gorge and various other sites. The geology of the areas we visited was absolutely incredible. Mohammed made great fiends with our youngest son and they shared many a conversation and joke. It was really lovely that we all felt so at ease. The riads selected where very beautiful although some did cater for a european market, serving less traditional food which was nice but not so authentic. You do need to be prepared to tip on a regular basis for just about everything. Mohammed was a great support in advising us what to tip although a few times we did feel it was a little high. Just be prepared for this as it did cost quite a lot. I suppose, in the end it is up to the individual how much you feel comfortable with. Overall, we felt the tour was reasonably priced, very well organised and a trip to remember forever. Thank you Mohammed."

Yusef had fantastic English, and did a wonderful job of explaining everything that we got to see. Morocco is sensory overload. I cannot recommend any higher."

            "review": "The Trip of a Lifetime!. My husband and I went on a 10 day tour of Morocco arranged by Mohammed, the owner of Trips to Morocco Tours. From the moment we stepped foot in Casablanca until our departure from the airport of Marrakech we were extremely well cared for. There was never a dull moment. We travelled with Mohammed's father, Youssef, an excellent and experienced driver, as well as a wonderful young man named Youssef, who served as our interpreter and guide. Both men were ideal travel companions: knowledgeable, fun loving, and ever so welcoming. We immediately felt like friends, and thoroughly enjoyed the time we spent together.  From busy cities to off-roading in the desert, we always felt safe. We learned so much about Morocco in 10 short days, but it just wasn't enough. In fact, I am sure that my husband and I will go back, with the hope to pick up where we left off, and to continue the tour with our same favorite guides: Youssef and Youssef. Perhaps we will even bring our adult children next time. They would love it. The riads that we stayed at were all excellent. The traditional riad architecture is so rich. These were not considered luxury hotels, perhaps because of their size. Most felt like boutique hotels, and the service was consistently top notch. If we arrived a bit late, many riads fixed us a bite to eat. Note: be prepared to eat a lot in Morocco. When we asked for bread and cheese... We would be served fresh breads, wonderful olives, cheese, fruit spreads, fresh fruit, yogurt... and more! Sometimes we would feel badly that we couldn't eat it all, but I am told that it is part of Moroccan hospitality and that nothing goes to waste.  Our overall feeling about our trip is that we were treated with such warmth and always felt welcome. Our guides, Yousseff and Youssef, were the highlight of the trip. Everywhere we went we felt privileged to be taking part in experiences that we never could have imagined or made possible without them: tea with nomad families, exploring the Old Medina of Fez, learning about the Berber culture and customs... Sleeping in tents in the Sahara under the stars... We felt like National Geographic explorers. Just amazing. We have encouraged everyone we know to take this trip, or any trip that Trips to Morocco may put together, as they earned our trust and admiration over the course of the 10 days that we spent in Morocco. It was an adventure that we didn't know possible until we experienced it."

We picked this company based on recommendation of our fellow travelers on Tripadvisor. We started planning our trip with Mohamed. He was readily available and help plan our itinerary. Dealing with him was quite straightforward and without any kind of hassle. We agreed on a price and an itinerary which was lot better then many other companies. Originally we were planning to travel in September. Our plans changed and I wrote to Mohamed to see if we can travel in March. He promptly agreed and made all the arrangements. Again based on recommendation of Tripadvisor travelers, I requested Mohammed to be our driver and a guide. He agreed and met us at Rabat airport. From there on, we traveled with Mohammed to FEZ ,Meknes, Volubilis, Ifrane, Midelt, middle Atlas mountains, Ziz valley, Erfoud, Merzouga, Erg Chebbi sand dunes with camel ride and overnight stay in a Tent, Risani, Tinghir, Dades valley, Roses valley, Skoura with many Kasbah, Ouazazate, Ait Benhaddo, Tichka pass in high Atlas mountain, Marrakesch and Casablanca. Trip also included visits to small villages, including visiting local houses of nomads, Berber family living in caves, visiting Khamlia and listening to the Gnava music. On our friendly prompting, Mohammed even took us to his home for a wonderful sumptuous lunch. We really enjoyed meeting his family and their hospitality. Morocco is a beautiful country. It has old Imperial cities with beautiful architecture, Medinas, Souks, great food and very friendly and welcoming people. Morocco also has lots of natural beauty in the form of mountains, valleys and desert. We thoroughly enjoyed all of it. Most of the locations we stayed in Riads and they were wonderful. One riad in Marrakesh, had a problem in the bathroom. When we brought it to Mohameds attention, we were promptly moved to another riad and were given a suite. We were provided good breakfast every morning. The dinner was included in five out of the 10 days. Mohammed was quite knowledgeable, flexible, easy going and made sure that we were comfortable and are enjoying the trip. He even provided few impromptu excursions. Local guides that were provided to us were quite knowledgeable as well. Overall we had a great time. I would wholeheartedly recommend this company and especially Mohammed to anybody who wants to travel to Morocco."

After a few days in Casablanca, we were picked up by Mohammed and his uncle and the adventure began. In each of the royal cities we had a special guide to show us the sights. The Riads we stayed in were excellent and really added the exotic experience. I can't say enough about how knowledgeable our guides were and how well planned a trip it was. I really feel like I have gotten a good look at Morocco and its culture. We would never have had this insight, had we just checked into a hotel and done the sight seeing on our own. I would definitely recommend this type of trip to anyone interested in more than a mere hotel stay. For us it was truly an unforgettable experience and I hope you will choose this tour company when considering a trip to lovely Morocco. Thanks to Mohammed for taking such excellent care of us. We have so many fond memories!"

He helped me plan everything, specific to what I wanted to see. He also met me for coffee to talk about everything before I committed, showing me photos and discussing in further details. I could tell right away that he was very professional and a very kind person. I traveled from Marrakech over the mountains to the Sahara, and then returned to Fes, stopping at many great sights along the way. He was able to set me up with an amazing camel trek into the Sahara. It was something that I will never forget. It included a camel ride for several hours out into the middle of the desert and I met with the a nomadic family that made me lunch, and we hung out in their tents all day to hide from the hot Sahara heat. Mohammad also took me to several places that I would have never found on my own or with a larger group. He was always incredibly positive and happy, even as we had lots of driving in the car. He would sing along to the music and I soon joined in, as if we were already friends for a long time! At another point, we went two hours off road to visit a family of four people that lived in caves. They invited us in to have tea and he translated what I was saying so that I could have a conversation with them, something I will not soon forget. I would highly recommend Trips to Morocco for your next adventure. I won't hesitate to contact Trips to Morocco when I return to this beautiful country!

My friend and I travelled on a round trip from Marrakech through Merzouga. 'Trips to Morocco Tours' is a family run business. The family are Berbers from the Erfoud / Merzouga area. I arranged the trip at about two weeks notice through Mohammed. We decided we didn't want to travel too far each day and allow time for stopping and exploring as much as we wanted to. Our excellent guide was Amar, Mohammed's cousin. Amar made our holiday so interesting and a lot of fun. He has a great sense of humour (as do most Moroccans) and was happy to adjust timing etc to allow us to spend time in markets, go fossil hunting etc. We travelled 'off road' quite a bit, in particular to visit a Berber nomad family where we drank mint tea in their cave. This was a wonderful highlight. We were blown away by Morocco's landscape. The High Atlas Mountains and the Anti Atlas Mountains are incredible. In March the weather is warm and the there are wonderful contrasts with the red earth and the verdant green in the valleys. This is one of my favourite places and I would love to go back. I recommend 'Trips to Morocco'. I met Mohammed twice during the time we were there. He seemed an intelligent young man, very focused on providing a excellent experience for his clients. I believe the versatility of their tours is their strong point. Just ask for what you want and they will incorporate it into your holiday. When planning, allow enough time for interesting stops and diversions along the way. We went looking for fossils in rock on two occasions and found some amazing fossils over 300 million years old. One thing I'd add is this - Mohammed is driving and guiding tours as well as handling all the email inquiries and bookings, so that's why he doesn't always get straight back to you. Mohammed actually needs a secretary! These guys are great. It was a once in a lifetime experience. Wendy and Gaylene"

Mohammed had great knowledge and answered many of my questions. I feel I saw Morocco for what it truly is because Mohammed avoided the tourist traps. On our way to Merzouga we stopped along the way to enjoy the beauty of the country and took many pictures. Mohammed had no problem stopping for a photo shoot if we asked.

Right after leaving the airport you notice thatyou entered totally different world. Bypassers wearing traditional dresses, distinct architecture dominated by towering minaretes and if it is a prayer time singing immam seals that first impression. Man kissing another man (no sexual context) but afraid to show even the most innocent affection to his own wife. Moroccan women avoiding an eye contact with stranger male even if she is just a waitress. Not staged visit to the Nomad family is like visiting another galaxy. They live either in desert or in mountain caves separated from civilization. It is just between them and the nature with insignificant tourists or rather their money influence.Food in Morocco is good. It is monotonuous but always fresh and made from natural ingredients.Local spices make the taste unique and you don't need any \"hamburger helper\", diana sauce, or wine to enjoy the dish. Alcohol is forbiden so it is not on display but in restaurant they will serve you if asked. Country is clean to the level you are not afraid to eat in restaurants or sleep in the hotel beds. English is not widely spoken and many local guides, eventhough they are carefully preselected, stay just above the annoying level.People are friendly and tollerant. They understand importance of tourism to the country and they showing their appreciation for coming here. Careful though! Very often after nice greeting words they offer you some useless/worthless gifts. You may not accept. In many cases international sign of index finger rubbing tumb follows. If you are still slow, whisper: \"money, money\" leave no doubts. Any innocent visit to the interesting gallery or store store has an agenda to sell you something, so you have to be very strict in your behaviour. If you intend to buy something always bargain, price is at least doubled. Another irritating issue is taking pictures with locals in it.They either not allowe you that or asking for money. It is not much but getting to the irritating point when instead of focusing on site seeing and taking good shots you are afraid to offend somebody or you have to distribute change all over. You may not take pictures of police or army men. They will erase your whole memory card.There is big competition among many travel agencies, so I am quite sure many are providing good service but I can definitely recommend Trips to Morocco 4x4 travel. They providedeverything what agreed up on before therip. No cutting corners. Our guide Mohammed, intelligent young gentleman didn't hesitate to make an extra mile to make it even more memorable. He has nice personality and his presence is just balanced: \"not too much\" of him but always there when needed. It is important as you spend entire days only with him. He drove all wheel drive, so we were not afraid to hit local mountain or desert roads. Don't want to repeat the other reviewers about flexibility to the program and any possible effort made by Mohammed if unexpected obstacles arouse to solve it but I can definitely confirm that opinions.Our trip to Morocco left a lot of warm, positive memories. We received what we were loking for: new experience not achieveable in many staged not authentic trips to even more exotic countries and it was definitely provided in good package.George Toronto, Canada"

We wanted to experience a culture very different from our own and this was a great cultural tour. Mohammed took us to many parts of Morocco and we were welcomed everywhere we went. It was a very interesting tour as we were in the major cities, small villages, mountains, desert and even the isolated cave homes of the nomad goat herders. We were well taken care of by Mohammed and his family and felt perfectly safe everywhere we went.Trips to Morocco is a business owned by Mohammed's family and we really felt that our appreciation of their country was their inspiration for the tour. We felt like special guests the whole time. Midway through the week, we stopped at Mohammed's home to pick up his brother for our sand dune camel excursion and were treated to a meal at their house that his mother prepared. It was unexpected and a special treat for us.Another nice feature of the tour was that Mohammed arranged for English speaking guides to take us through special facilities such as mosques, ancient Roman ruins, casbahs, souks and even the oldest existing educational institution in the world. We walked through the Medinas and markets, many of which haven't changed for hundreds of years. We had lots of opportunities to buy the special crafts of the area or just watch the craftsmen work. Our overnight accommodations were fantastic. The riads were absolutely beautiful in Fez and elsewhere. In the Valley of the Roses our hotel had a rooftop pool and served us a five course French meal. There were many surprises along the way. We traveled through beautiful valleys full of palm trees. We crossed the Atlas mountains and saw a totally different environment with cedar forests and Swiss looking buildings. We went off-road (like no other off-road I've been on) to get to a remote area to meet the nomads who live in caves. They welcomed us into their caves so we could see how they live.My girls and I started to feel the vibe and bought jalabas to wear and wrapped scarves around our heads. That was especially helpful on our camel ride through the sand dunes as it was windy and the scarves kept the sand off our faces. Our overnight in the desert tents was quite comfortable. Our tent had two queen beds in the first part and a flushing toilet, sink and shower in the second part - in the middle of a desert! It was very cool as the caretakers built a fire after our evening meal and all we saw were sand dunes and stars.We had a few hick-ups along the way. Our little group arrived in Casablanca from three different parts of the U.S. and two of our suitcases didn't arrive with us. Mohammed did everything he could to get the luggage transferred to Fez so we could continue on our planned tour. He also tried to meet any request we had during the 10 days and with vegetarian and gluten-free eaters among us, we had all kinds of requests. We were in fancy restaurants in the cities and small cafes in the villages. We enjoyed all the diversity and being part of the local scene.There is a lot of driving on this tour to get to all the locations, so be prepared. The roads are fine and Mohammed is a good driver. We had to stop at a little drug store along the way to get dramamine and they had everything we needed. Morocco is ancient yet modern with a mix of Berber, Arab, Jewish and other cultures. We thought that the experience was a bargain as the price included picking us up at the airport and returning us there in the middle of the night ten days later and everything in between (except lunches, drinks and personal purchases) - Mohammed's expertise, the vehicle that took us everywhere, the specialty guides, our overnight accommodations, breakfast and dinners, and the many interesting places we went. Everything was taken care of for us. Mohammed and his family were very gracious and made us feel comfortable and very much a part of things. I would recommend this tour to anyone who is adventurous and wants to experience something different. If you can't do the full 10 days, I'm sure the shorter tours would be well worth it, too.My girls and have been lots of places and we really enjoyed this experience."

Mohammed was a great guide and spoke very good English. We had a wonderful time and experienced Morocco off the beaten track whilst still feeling safe. Mohammed was very accommodating to our travel needs and allowed us to stop the car whenever we wanted for sightseeing. I highly recommend Mohammed and his family for a true Moroccan experience. Our only regret was not travelling with him to more places in Morocco!"

We travelled very comfortably with Youseff our skilled driver and Youseff our guide and we found Morrocco to be beyond our expectations in beautiful contrasting landscapes and a warm welcoming culture. Every hotel and restaurant was comfortable, clean and we had lovely food at each place we stopped. This was a great trip not to be missed and we would not have seen half of the places and learnt so much of the real Morrocco without our great guide and driver. We had 5 days and felt very relaxed at the end of the trip - everything was made easy for us and nothing was too much trouble."

Mohammed picked us up in Fes and dropped us off in Marrakech 3 days later. On the way, he took us to see so many amazing things, always stopping the car so we could take pictures. We were in Morocco for 12 days and the desert tour was by far my favorite part of the trip. We saw countless incredible views, fed monkeys, went to a rose oil cooperative and an argan oil cooperative, saw amazing kasbahs... I can't even imagine a trip to Morocco where you just stay in the cities, in my opinion, a trip out to the desert is a must! Mohammed speaks English fluently, and was so great about accommodating me and my boyfriend's eating habits- I'm vegetarian but my boyfriend eats meat, and every meal was perfectly planned to accommodate both of us. I also appreciated that he was such a safe and careful driver. In Morocco, with some of the busy town streets, and more importantly the crazy, winding (beautiful) mountain roads... I kept thinking how different the trip would be if we didn't have such a careful driver. Like some other reviewers, we were kind of hesitant about the Western Union deposit, but we read that it was fine for another reviewer, and it was absolutely fine for us too. I did a lot of research and contacted a lot of different tour companies before choosing one. Trips to Morocco quoted a great price- he wasn't the absolute cheapest but was far from the most expensive, and when we factored in English-speaking and just the general vibe of the responses, he really stood out from the rest. We are both so happy we chose this tour company, and if you're on the fence too please don't hesitate to email for a recommendation!"

At Kasbah Itran, in the beautiful Valle\u00e9 des Roses (highly recommended!), we were having some drinks, relaxing on one of their gorgeous terraces and started chatting and philosophizing with this very nice and clever guy called Mohamed. Such a shame we didn't know him before because we would have definitely asked him to show us around. He gave us a bunch of excellent tips for our road trip throughout Morocco and also arranged a desert trip for us, which was truly amazing! After the desert trip, we met again in Erfoud and he showed us around in typical warm and welcoming Berber style. Even though we didn't do a trip with their travel agency, I can highly recommend Mohamed and his family to anyone that is looking for an unforgettable Moroccan adventure. Very warm regards from Belgium!!! Yvonne and Rik ;-)"

The stop in the Burber village is a welcome break I got the impression the house we visited was where the chap who led our party lived. Sitting in the shade drinking traditional tea and nibbling on a Moroccan freshly made flat bread was awesome. If you are going in the summer wear sleeves trust me is over 40 degrees and there is NO shade, don't wear shirts either as your legs will cook. Your left leg will cook from both the sun and the heat from the quads engine. Go in the morning it's just too hot to quad in the afternoon."

My other half and I booked our half-day trip at Lake Takerkoust with Maroc Quad Passion via Whatsapp, with them confirming pick up time for our half day trip the evening before departure. They collected us as the hotel on time and transported us to their base in the desert outside Marrakech in a very comfortable, air conditioned van.The trip itself was wonderful. After testing everyone's skills, they split the group of 12 into 3 groups of 4 riders. This was great as our group wasn't slowed down by some of the more nervous riders or kids, which can so often be the case. The quadding itself was amazing, at times like driving across the moon! The scenery was unbelievable, and there was opportunity to stop for photos (although there could have been more of these for the view of the lake). Nonetheless, a solid 2 hours of quadding at a reasonable price, and with great guides.There was a nice post-quad meal of moroccan pancakes and mint tea, though this was a little rushed. It was very pleasant though, and the view spectacular. There were a few attempts to sell some other trips, like jet-skiing and such, but a polite no was sufficient.I can't recommend this trip enough!"

We stopped at the top of a mini mountain and were able to take pics and ride a donkey before taking off again on our journey.

We stopped off again at what looked like a traditional Beber village to have some mint tea before heading back to our pick up point. After the ride we were air hosed to get all the dust off and dropped back to our Riad.Overall a great experience and I would recommend the only negative would be that they could've given us gloves as it was very chilly to begin with in the morning."

Only criticisms would be that first impressions are not great...the website shows sand dunes and you get a gravelly, rocky bit of land with lots of rubbish. But this is only the practice area and you are soon on your way through the countryside. My only other point of contention is that once you get used to the driving its a bit boring. They don't allow you to speed up or kearn any fancy moves! The driving is flat road and a bit monotonous."

A 16 year old son who wants quad biking but a wife and daughter who only want to ride camels \u2013 not a problem for Maroc Quad Passion and after a couple of emails with Youssef we were all set. First it was pick-up from the hotel and a short drive to the quad centre. After a safety briefing and helmet fitting followed by some simple familiarising and steering we were off. There we only 8 in the group but we immediately split into two groups of 4 so there was no riding at the back of a long train. Our guide took us quite some distance but mainly on tracks and trails so we were never bothered by any road traffic and we felt safe and secure throughout. There was the opportunity of a couple of stops for some photos and a chat plus a visit to a rural homestead for the ubiquitous mint tea but also some delicious Moroccan pancakes. The two hours went so quick and we were soon being dusted off with an air hose before meeting up with my wife and daughter who\u2019d been separately collected from the hotel. It was then a brief drive to the palm grove to put on some more traditional head gear for the camel ride. No controls to learn this time but like our guide the camels were all very friendly and we spent a brilliant hour or so with a leisurely and surprisingly comfortable stroll in the sun. I can\u2019t recommend the whole experience highly enough and we\u2019ve been left with lots of great memories to recall and reminisce now we\u2019re back home plus my son wants to know when we can do the full 5-day quad safari!"

He kindly called our Riad to check we were aware of the clocks going back on the morning of our excursion. We were picked up by Youssef and taken on the short drive to the quad bikes. From there we had an amazing quad bike ride through the desert with stunning views of the mountains. It was great fun and definitely worth doing if in Marrakech. Visiting the Berber farmer who provided mint tea and crepes was a lovely addition. The camel ride afterwards was a nice way to relax. If you want a fun way to explore beyond the city then you will love this!"

It was perfect because we had a sunset camel ride through a palm grove just outside of Marrakech. The camels were well trained and ready for passengers. The guide asks for a small tip at the end of the hour ride. The quads were very easy to ride, no gears but still quick. We rode through the rocky desert, past a Berber village, a stop for Th\u00e9 de Menthe, and through winding sand dunes. Unfortunately, it was only one very small sand dune but, it was still lots of fun."

The trip to Ouarzazate and Ait Ben Haddou was worth the long drive. Four hours on the road might seem like forever, but Abdul makes the trip enjoyable and comfortable! He picked me up from my Riad on time trip starts at 7am and we started the journey through the High Atlas Mountains, making brief stops for pictures and tea/coffee break. Abdul is personable and very professional, and his knowledge and passion about his country is impressive! We talked about culture, politics, history, and how he started in the Tourism business. I got to know Abdul not just as a tour guide/driver, but as a friend. The UNESCO world heritage site of Ait Ben Haddou is beyond words beautiful, I felt like traveling back in time! The Taourirt Kasbah is also a wonderful place to visit, as well as the Atlas Studios where they filmed movies such as The Mummy, The Passion of Christ, and Prince of Persia, to name a few. On the way back, we stopped for some refreshments overlooking the mountains and Abdul taught me how the Moroccans drink their mint tea and he introduced me to eating cactus or prickly pears as they call it. I got back to my Riad at around 8pm, tired but fulfilled. Abdul is an excellent, safe driver and his van is comfortable and well-maintained. I highly recommend him to anyone planning a trip to Marrakech! Thank you Abdul for making my trip memorable!"

The lunch at the Barber familiys apple garden with the best view possible was both an outstanding tasting experience and a good break in the very compact and educative day. The trip in the middel on foot through great coulours of all kinds, as well as the short walk through a real Maroccan market in the countryside was a thrill. Higly recommended trip !"

We drove through the High Atlas Mountains, stopping at scenic locations for photos and a great coffee at a small cafe, the largely treeless red mountains which opened up into a red stony desert was like visiting another planet, the only green to be seen were in the river flats the were feed by water coming out of the mountains. We visited Quarzazate where we toured through a 17th century palace and a movie studio where they filmed scenes from \"Gladiator\" , \"Romancing the Stone\" and more. Then we visited the old Berber city of \"Ait Ben Haddou\" which sits on a hill overlooking the valley, for me this was a true highlight. Abdul was a great host for the day and went out of his way to give us a truly inspiring day."

This tour to Ouarzazate City, Taourirt Kasbah, Atlas Studios, then to Ait Ben Haddou Kasbah through High Atlas Mountains & Berber villages had wonderful scenery with lots of photo opportunities. This trip is long starts at 7 and we got back around 12 hours later with driving through some twisty roads so beware if you have issues with motion sickness. However, our guide Abdul was very considerate and stopped the van frequently for fresh air and breaks even without my asking. I feel that we spent a touch too long at Atlas Studios on a tour that did not provide very much information and was given in two languages as only half the group spoke English. Ait Ben Haddou is gorgeous but it was very hot and the climb to the top of the city was worth straining ourselves a bit. One thing I did not love our lunch stop at Ait Ben Haddou which was a rather touristy place to be expected and we the waiter did not allow us to order a la carte even though a table next to us was able to. As such, it was our most expensive lunch in Morocco and was our worst meal in Morocco. Luckily, the scenery, tours, and conversations with Abdul made up for this mediocre lunch experience. If you only have time for one day trip from Marrakech definitely take this one as it is incredibly informative and stunningly gorgeous tour to Ait Ben Haddou."

            "review": "Day Trip to Ouarzazate City, Taourirt Kasbah, Movies Studios, Ait Ben Haddou Kasbah Through High Atlas Mountains. Have you met Abdul, yet? There is a reason why everyone is raving about this guy: he's good at his job. But, without getting into too much of an Abdul-hype, here's what you can expect from the tour. You'll be picked up early in the morning from either your hotel or from an arranged check-point, which is usually nearest road. We stayed in a Riad in the Medina Souks, so we had a short walk out to the Dar el Bacha (Royal Palace) and high street (the backstreets are well lit, even in the early morning, so the walk was pleasant). Abdul's car is air-conditioned; I already miss his (music) playlist; and the man, himself, is very knowledgeable with ready answers, lots of information, a keen eye for good photo-opportunities and a GSOH. By the end of the day, if not by the end of the long drive across the Atlas Mountains (approx. 4 hours, one way), you'll have learned so much that you'll find yourself smiling if anyone else tries to teach you the same things afterwards - because 'Abdul already told you that'. At Taourirt Kasbah in Morocco's Hollywood, Ouarzazate City, you'll hopefully meet Mohammed as your guide. He not only knows the history and culture behind the Kasbah and its restoration, he has worked on the special effects of some major films - some you may even know. At the movie studios, you'll walk through some of the sets used for films such as Lawrence of Arabia (1962), Body of Lies (2008), Kundun (1997), Asterix and Obelix (1992-), Gladiator (2000), The Mummy (1999), and - way in the distance - you'll see the city of Marine from Game of Thrones, Season Three (2011-). After that, is the beautiful fortress of Ait Ben Haddou. You'll get to walk up to its uppermost beacon tower for a panoramic view of the city, desert-land and the Atlas mountains. This trip is a great addition to any holiday, long or short, as you'll get to see Morocco from a side you won't see by simply staying in the city centre. All our entry fees for the Kasbahs and the Movie Studio were sorted by Abdul in advance of the trip. It is, however, rude not to tip anywhere in Marrakech/Morocco, so practise your Gentleman's Handshake for handing this over. The food-stops Abdul will take you to are pretty decent and, unlike some other tour guides, he doesn't expect you to buy things from market stalls, so he will walk straight past these - but if you want something, just say so, he'll be happy to wait for you. Same goes with pictures; he'll happily wait for you to take all the photos you want. Do keep an eye on the time, however, because you are doing a lot in a small period of time and there's so much to see, you'll find yourself so lost in looking at something you'll have to drag yourself away in order to have the time to see the next thing. But you never feel rushed.If you are the kind of person who'll worry about not buying things, don't be, because the tour gets you back by about 8pm and Medina's Jemaa el-Fnaa (market) is open until late - and they have EVERYTHING there, including the occasional snake charmer.This tour is great for anyone who is interested in things, and for anyone with a camera. If you have any special lenses, bring them. You won't regret it."

The driver, Abdul, picked us up on time at our hotel in a clean, air conditioned van. He gave us cold bottles of water which was nice since it was hot that day. The palm grove is only about 15 minutes from the \"New town\" part of Marrakech. When we arrived there was another guide, Said, who took us on our camel tour. One thing I was really happy about is that the camels looked happy and healthy, well taken care of. Even the guide, Said, told us how much he loves his camels and how to him they are like more than animals. So about halfway through the camel walk, we stopped at a house where a lady brought us mint tea and Berber style crepes with honey and olive oil. Overall, the camel walk and tea stop lasted about two hours. We got some GREAT photos... Both Said and Abdul made sure of that!! Highlight of our vacation by far!!"

We stopped off in a village outside of Marrakech where we were invited to drink tea with one of the locals inside her family home. We watched as she prepared the delicious Moroccan tea, which I must say takes great skill and patience. We then went on to climb up one of the mountains in the first valley where we stopped off by a waterfall to relax for a while. The second valley saw Abdul take myself and my fianc\u00e9 to a Berber village where a nice family prepared a local 3 course meal. The setting was absolutely picturesque as we ate on a hillside overlooking the small village. They were very welcoming and were genuinely happy to receive us. During the 3rd valley we drove through it stopping off in multiple locations to take pictures. Abdul was all too willing to take us our photos.All in all it was an experience that neither myself or fianc\u00e9 will never forget and left us wanting more. Thank you!"

I wanted to say how truly wonderful our tour with Abdul was for my wife & I. We chose the tour to the Sahara for camel rides and an over night stay with the Bedouins but we also customized our trip and added other stops along the way. Abdul was extremely accommodating and took such great care of us. The camel rides and overnight in the Sahara was definitely unique and fun but I think the best part was spending time with Abdul; visiting unique towns and shops along the way, learning about the various cultures and customs, and making a new life-long friend. I can't remember the cost but it was very reasonable for a planned 2 night/3 day trip. Transportation was in a comfortable new mid-size van and we never felt unsafe at any time; even on the mountain roads and passes. He's an excellent driver and as a guide he has a very easy-going relaxed manner that puts you at ease right away. I couldn't recommend a better guide or traveling companion. He's the absolute best guide and companion we've had in any country. If you need space, you've got it. If you want him to be more actively involved with you; he's right there for you. Our trip was in the first week of December 2014 and happened to coincide (after we'd crossed the Atlas) with what turned out to be a 100 + year massive destructive flood. On the day we needed to return to Marrakesh we discovered that landslides and massive flooding had closed both passes we could choose from to get back to Marrakesh. Flooding of riverbeds that hadn't seen water in years were wiping out roads, homes and businesses, and closing roads. Thank God for Abdul and his experience, knowledge, and professionalism! What could've been a nightmare scenario was handled very very well. We 're laid-back seasoned travelers & although bus loads of other travelers were freaking out, we remained calm with the hand we'd been dealt, as did Abdul. He seemed to know people and places to stay and eat at every little town we got stuck in. We never felt unsafe and were soooo glad we had Abdul taking care of things. We ended up spending 2 extra nights before the water receded and the landslides were cleaned up. But the Moroccan government was well organized, responsive, and was quick to get repairs done and open the passes. With Abdul as our guide, we had an incredible trip despite the difficulties and viewed the whole affair as more of an adventure than a headache. We can't wait to go back to see more of Morocco and spend more time with Abdul. He was FANTASTIC!!"

The excursion took us out of the bustle of the city in air conditioned comfort, and showed us the beauty and culture of the mountain areas. The waterfall walk was particularly stunning, the descent coinciding with a call to prayer from a local minaret. Lunch in the Berber village was well off the tourist track and an enlightening insight to the Berber way of life, besides a fabulous meal. Our guide, Abdul, spoke brilliant English and supplied comprehensive commentary as well as many photo stops. We plan to return to Marrakech, and will certainly look up Abdul and his company to see what other trips he is offering."

After first visiting a Berber house (and drinking tea) we continued up into the valley where we were introduced to Abdul, our other guide for taking us further up on foot. Abdul again was a real pleasure to talk to and a wealth of knowledge, being Berber himself. We then got to the waterfalls which were beautiful and later took a stunning root down, back to Ismail who was waiting patiently for our arrival. We then visited some women making Argan Oil were we got to try and smell many of things they had to offer. Heading on we travelled higher and through some incredible scenery that can be found throughout these three valleys. Later we stopped for some home cooked food which was delicious, and carried on back down towards the market. This was very different to the markets found in Marrakech and was a real insight to the local way of life. The tour was absolutely fantastic and we would recommend it to anyone, definitely worth the time."

Abdul is interested in 'solidarity tourism' in which tourism income can be used to support Moroccans in many regions - and I was very happy to be able to support this family, who made the most elaborate picnic overlooking the atlas mountain villages.

For lunch we drove much further up into the mountains to a small village in a beautiful valley. We had an excellent picnic lunch served by a very gracious local host. This really set the trip apart from others as Abdul had personally found the family and the location to host his guests. The remainder of the day was spent driving the mountain roads and stopping to explore unique areas and take photos. This was one of the most unique and authentic excursions we have ever done.

My friend and I chose the day trip to Ourrzazate, Taourirt Kasbah then to Ait Ben Haddou Kasbah through the Atlas Mountains & Berber Villages.Summary: What made this trip so good was our tour guide/driver Abdul. He always made sure we were comfortable and stopped en route to let us take photos as well as have a short mint tea break! The drive to our first proper stop was just over 3 hours and a half but with the rest stops and photo opportunities, as well as the information Abdul was providing, the time went by very quickly.Itinerary:Abdul picked us up at 7 at our hotel and then we started our drive through the mountains, which was a very pleasant drive! We then arrived in Ourrzazate for our first proper stop and had a tour of Taourirt Kasbah in Ourrzazate which was very interesting and well worth doing. After this we had a choice of a smaller film museum or the film studios - we chose the latter. Although the film studios were not hugely cultural, it was still quite interesting. We then had lunch near Ait Ben Haddou Kasbah which was quite nice. After this, we spent the rest of the day in the Ait Ben Haddou Kasbah which was truly spectacular - it is no wonder it is a world heritage site! After this we drove back to Marrakech and arrived at our hotel around 8pmThe benefits of doing this trip is a very comfortable car (almost like a ford Galaxy), an excellent driver, free entry to the museums which means no hassle whatsoever, and also a good variety of things to do. I would highly recommend this day trip, even if you are only in Marrakech for a few days. Also, I left my earphones in Abdul's car and he dropped them off the next morning at our hotel and called us to make sure I had received them - great service!"

Many only dream of returning to the motherland, so when planning for our recent trip to Morocco Africa aka Marghrib, I wanted to be sure to select the perfect Tour Guide. When I first came across Morocco Inspiring Tours, I was a bit skeptical due to the very few reviews they have on Trip Advisor. As a Muslimah convert, it was important that I have an authentic experience, that included Halal foods, time for prayer, and visits to historically Islamic landmarks. Additionally, i wanted to learn about the Indigenous and Saharan tribes. Inspiring Tours was not only affordable but they were also immediately responsive, attentive and accommodating of all of my requests. From the moment we arrived at the airport to our final goodbyes, the guides were extremely professional. Abdul, Ismael, Muhummad, and Mouhssin were always courteous, patient and ready to share their abundance of knowledge! We often had long drives, but the good conversation helped the time pass quickly. We traded stories, riddles, songs, pictures. We discussed Hip Hop, faith, language, culture, history and even had a Moroccan Mint Tea pouring competition before dinner one evening!For three large families traveling together out of the country for the first time, the guides made our trip very special by joining us for meals and always ensuring that everyone was \"good\"! They were so thoughtful, inclusive and encouraging of all the children both Muslim and non. They met them where they were as first time travelers yet challenging them to discover and try new things constantly. Ishmael raced along the beach, took selfies, carried tired little ones, answered a million questions, conversed in both Spanish, Arabic and English and watched out for them as if he were their big brother. All three of our families ( 15 in total) have even been inspired to continue language studies and have a newfound appreciation for so many cultural identities including tea and herbal remedies indigenous to the area! All thanks to this team of committed guys!They really seem as if they were born to do this kind of work! They have numerous relationships with people and places across the country! From modern to traditional, if you are one who likes more trendy/ tourist places or if you are open to off the grid spots, they know all the good spots! We got to experience the very trendy tourist belly dancing at Comptoir, stayed in both a contemporary hotel, and a riad, and got to taste the local tagin, and rarely found Medfounna typically only found in the Risani area. The Dramadeer rides in the Sahara and the exhausting road trip through the mountains was all worth it! The experience has been life changing and these guys come highly recommended!"

While this was my fourth visit to this beautiful country, there is always something magical and enchanting to newly discover. Moroccans are wonderful hosts, extremely welcoming and have a genuine desire to ensure that your visit to their country is fulfilling and satisfying. One of the best ways to enhance your experience is to hire a professional guide/driver to see the country and Morocco Inspiring Tours is just the ticket. The staff include Abdoul, Ismael, Mouhsin and Mohammed, all of whom were very friendly and engaging. This visit included overnight and day trips to Rabat, Casablanca, Essouria, Atlas, Ourzazate and the Sahara in Merzouga, all from our base in Marrkech. I worked directly with Abdoul to plan our 9 day visit for a group of 16 people and then a smaller group of 3 people. The vehicles were very comfortable and we always felt safe with their driving. Based on our wishes, Abdoul was able to create an itinerary that was filled with adventure, beautiful vistas, historical sites, camel rides on the beach for children, evening entertainment, amazing food and most importantly an opportunity to authentically engage with people. We also requested a spur of the moment major itinerary change and even with such a large group, they were patient, calm and accommodating. All you have to do is be present in the moment and open your mind and heart to exploration and discovery! We shared and exchanged stories with them about our families, work, politics, religion, laughed out loud, and most of all the experience of human connections. With Moroccan Inspiring Tours, there is no problem that can't be solved, including airport transfers, booking hammam appointments, hotel stays, cell phone charging and wifi access while on the road, interpretation and shopping. Everything is \"as you like!\""

Abdul was pro-active and worked with our Riad to get us to the meeting point on time for an early start to our day. Our first stop was a bustling Berber market. It was fascinating to see the early morning market being setup. You could buy anything from a 20 year old cassette player, to a donkey! After the market we started toward the Mountains and surrounding valleys. Once we arrived at the first valley, we were handed off to our Berber trekking guide who took us on a breathtaking climb up to some waterfalls. We stopped along the way for a refreshment and breather, then continued to see some incredible vistas of waterfalls and snow capped mountains. After our climb we journeyed to a Berber village where we had once of the best meals of our trip. The view from the terrace was amazing. After lunch, the rest of the day was spent driving through the different valleys, stopping along the way for photo op after photo op. I'm glad we are in the age of digital because I probably would have gone through about 10 rolls of film on this tour. On our drive back to Marrakech, Abdul gave some unique perspective on life in Marrakech. We really enjoyed learning about life growing up in Morocco. Thank you Abdul for a wonderful experience.

We used the Morocco Inspiring Tours excursions as offered by our Riad and we can highly recommend the tours with Ismail and Abdul especially if you travel with young kids. Both drivers spoke excellent English, were very friendly, attentive and committed to giving us a good time. The cars were very clean, spacious people carriers. When people say, you can get the tours cheaper \u2013 yes, you can but it depends on your travel preferences. If you travel alone and don\u2019t mind sharing the bus with 20+ others to get straight from A to B, you will get it half the price down the road. In our case, we felt we got great value for money. The Marrakech Sightseeing Tour for example, cost us in total \u20ac45 and it was a personalised experience i.e. just the four of us in the car with the driver (Ismail) who was funny, knew lots about Marrakech, took our kids into consideration and stopped whenever we wanted to jump out for photos or have a look at places and he showed us so many beautiful places like the Bahia Palace or Majorelle Garden. His brother Abdul who drove the other two tours did the same. We enjoyed both days with him and had a great experience. Abdul was also the one who picked us up from the airport, organised through the Riad, even with a flight delay \u2013 he waited for us and welcomed us to Morocco in the middle of the night with a smile. I travelled to many places in the world, experienced various excursions and the ones offered here were very good. We did three in total and we highly recommend the Marrakech Sightseeing Tour and the Ourika Valley Tour (a day Trip to the Atlas Mountains through Berber villages and waterfalls). You get a combination of guided and independent touring which allows for many photo opportunities, getting to know the area and meeting locals as well as knowing you\u2019re being looked after. We were each time picked up in the Medina near where we stayed which was an added bonus and made us feel very safe. Overall we had an amazing trip. We saw so much and learned even more."

We were staying across from the train station at the Opera Plaza, (fantastic place with indoor Olympic-sized oasis pool!) which I have described in detail in another post. Abdul arrived promptly at seven in a clean minivan, perfectly-sized for our small party. Driving in Marrakech can be an adventure unto itself - with donkey carts, two lanes that inexplicably mushroom into six, and the ever-present motorcycles weaving in and out, but Abdul handled the traffic like a pro. We made our way through Marrakech itself, via the palace area that skirts the Old Medina walls. Once we were clear of the city, we begin to climb into the desert, winding through dramatic switchbacks as we made the ascent toward the High Atlas Mountains, passing village sites where the Berber people have lived for millennia. The scenery here is part of the experience, changing from palm trees to scrub to desert in just a few miles. Ultimately our morning destination was the Atlas movie studio location where numerous films have been made - Quarzazate - but on the way we made several interesting pit-stops. We stopped briefly to see Argon Oil being made at a Women's Cooperative (extremely labor intensive process! Cooperatives like this are an important source of income for local women - think micro-finance - and well worth seeking out when traveling. I will not mindlessly slather on the oil again in future without thinking of the ladies who harvest the nut, break it open with a hammer, grind in into pieces and then mash it to remove the precious oil that is so good for hair and skin!) Then it was off to a quick stop at a local event honoring Special Olympics participants and their families. A side note here: it is very encouraging that the people of Morocco support some of the weakest members of their society in this way! Midmorning, we stopped at a Kasbah, home to one of the Berber families tasked with governing during the French occupation (from the late 1800s to late 1950s). Touring this particular Kasbah, we began to understand the link between architectural design and the arid climate: wide, covered porches, thatched and mudded roofing systems, interior air-drafts, enclosed courtyards, complete with original tile-work featuring inscriptions from the Koran, as well as the geometric designs prevalent in the Berber culture - similar to a Riad but on a grander scale. Here, everyone from the local population to visiting dignitaries were ushered into the upstairs inner sanctum to meet with the Berber equivalent of a local Sultan. Don't miss the local artists busily painting desert scenes in one of the upstairs balcony areas!Then it was onward - and upward - past the highest point in Africa - 'Tizi N'Tichka (over 2200 meters high) toward Quarzazate. This is a surprisingly large city, given how incredibly difficult it must be to get people and supplies up there. I can only imagine that most of the people have lived there for generations and have no need to go elsewhere, and there IS a steady stream of traffic up that two-laned curvy road, but still! Apparently the movie people fly into the small airport and skip the switchbacks. Over the years, the studios have been the set for numerous films: Cleopatra, Gladiator, Mission Impossible, The Bible series with Roma Downey, The Jewel of the Nile with Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner and a French film that involved Spinx-like creatures with Crocodile heads (the set is still there!) Although expensive to film epic movies of this sort, given the 10:1 economy of Morocco to the US/Canada/Europe, it must be cost-effective and provides a needed boost to the economy locally.The final stop of the day, after lunch, of course, was to the UNESCO world heritage site at Ait Ben Haddou, which served as a backdrop to the city of Yunkai in The Game of Thrones. Originally built over 400 years ago as a fortified city along a major trading route with Sudan (think African Silk Road), the complex has held up remarkably well. Families still live in some parts, and if you close your eyes for a moment you can \"see\" life the way it would have been in the 1600s. Amazing!After a full day of touring, Abdul now had the unenviable job of getting us safely back down the mountains. Past construction projects designed to widen the road in places, through miles of the morning's switchbacks in reverse, back down from 2200 meters we went, to arrive, ultimately, back at our hotel, safe and sound.I have to commend our driver Abdul for his patience with our many questions, his willingness to make unscheduled stops (I did really need a postcard stamp from Quarzazate!) and his professionalism in conducting the tour, but most of all for his driving skills!"

We were picked up close to our riad, in a comfortable and spacious people carrier. Abdul our guide introduced himself and spoke very good English. It took an hour or so to reach the Atlas mountains. We stopped at a argan oil cooperative where we has the chance to see how the oil was made and have a little go ourselves. We then moved further into the mountains where we met out 'local' guide for the walk to the waterfall. Our guide was very friendly and helpful. He did a fantastic job a making sure my Mum felt comfortable and safe while scrambling up the rocks and over the shallow streams. We had a break half way through the walk at a little 'cafe' where we could enjoy some beautiful views of the waterfall, the valley and the snow topped mountains.From there we went onto the second valley where we had a lovely meal on the terrace of a berber house. We then moved onto the third and final valley and the berber market. If you are looking for crafts and souvenirs to take home then you'll be disappointed (unless you want to bring a goats head home...), but if you are wanting you experience the sights, sounds and smells of a traditional berber market then you'll not be disappointed. Not once did we feel rushed by Abdul or our local guide. Abdul was very accommodating to my snap happy fingers, providing plenty of opportunities to stop and take photos or stopping especially if there was something we wanted to see. We had lots of questions and Abdul was always pleased to answer them. We felt safe in Abdul's care, he was a very safe and cautious drive. The sights and views on this tour were beautiful and the day was broken up by a mix of activities. Oooh. My Mum left her hat in the vehicle. Abdul made contact with our riad and he went out if his way to return the hat to my Mum at our riad the very next day.Fab trip and excellent tour guide :-) Thanks Abdul"

Stopped us at the best place to get the best photos and gave us so much local knowledge about Morocco. First, we stopped at a place to go on the camel ride. Then visited a Berbere family house. He was very engaging and informative throughout the whole ride. We continued to a cooperative where we saw the women making Argan oil. He was never in a hurry, letting us enjoy the sights and have breaks as and when we want. We then went to the Atlas Mountains where he introduced us to another Abdul that took us up the mountain. All in all, no regrets, no complaints, an amazing experience."

We stopped for a camel ride, a tour of a Berber house, a womens' co-operative shop, a string bridge and many waterfalls. Abdul let us stop frequently for photo opportunities and surprised us with all the great places to visit. We ended our tour at a beautiful riverside restaurant with stunning views and some of the best food we had in Marrakech. We ended our tour there but he even offered to take us further up the mountain for an hour walk to more waterfalls. Great guy, fantastic day!"

My girlfriend, a mutual friend and I decided to take a two day one night trip out of Marrakech to go camel riding and sleep in the desert during out trip to Marrakech. Our riad recommended Abdul to be our guide during the trip and since we hadnt met him we werent sure what to expect but they assured us Abdul would be wonderful. Since it was our first trip to Morocco we opted to pay a bit more to be the only three riding with him. We got up early in the morning and Abdul walked into the Souk to meet us at our Riad dour. He arrived promptly, well dressed and was very friendly. We proceeded to spend the next 10 hours driving with him the first day, stopping at about a dozen places headed south to the meeting point with the camels, and about 12 hours with him the next headed back North to Marrakech. He was amazing. His knowledge of his country was incredible and he joined us for most of our excursions, explaining everything he could to us during our first (of many) trips to Marrakech. We ended up having such a trusting experience we hired him to drive us from Marrakech to Casablanca for an early morning flight out. It may have cost a few dollars more but we knew we were in good hands.He was amazing and all three of us kept his info for our next trip to Morocco. Highly recommended."

Getting out for a day gave us a breather from the intensity of the place and the opportunity to catch a glimpse of the Atlas Mountains. You can soon see why people become attached to them. The scenery is stunning. Our Riad fixed the trip up with Morocco Inspiring Tours. We spent the day in the easy, cheery company of Abdul who drove and guided us around to a fixed, itinerary but with the aim to please. We were happy going along with the Berber cultural tour on the way to what we considered the main event which was to get out and walk in the mountains. Once we'd agree the level of challenge we wanted to take on (As sissy as possible), he fixed us up with a very charming and reassuring local guide who you could've equally trusted to take your kids up the north face of the Eiger. Back in the motor, Abdul was as chatty as we wanted him to be, no more, which is nice. He was informative, helpful and accommodating. By the time we got back to Marrakech, we understood the place better and enjoyed it the all the more."

Abdul rahman s driving is very very safe - matter of fact we crossed the Atlas mountain at around 11 pm ( atlas mountain is a single lane road and known as notorious in morocco) again we did not feel any discomfort during his driving. I must admit at times he drives on 60km/h (about 50mp/h on a clear motorway . Morrocon speed limit is 60km/h) but this is to maintain the fuel economy and to avoid police fines- which is understandable. In summary I would use Abdul for my next trip and strongly recommend his services to all especially to families with children"

We had a blast singing and sharing stories about our respective cultures. I learned so much about the Muslim culture and the holiday of Ramadan. And although he wasn't able to join me while I ate lunch, he took me to a great kasbah near Ait Bennhadou. I told him how much time I needed to explore the area and he took pictures and gave me great tips on how to explore the area. We drove back to Marrakech and continued to share stories. Before he took me back to my hotel, he took me to a great place to ride a camel. I had told him that I'd like to ride a camel before leaving and it was certainly a highlight of the day.

The colors are breathtaking when you drive through the Atlas Mountains, Camel ride through the Sahara, visit the Kasbahs and Medinas, and see the Blue City. If you have the time, please try to cover Ouarzazate, Dades, Erfoud, Merzouga, Fes, Chefchouen, Casablanca, and Rabat. Mohamed can tailor your visit and will make recommendations based on your needs. We stayed for 2 weeks which allowed us to enjoy many of the sites but had enough down time to rejuvenate. Best of all, the Moroccan people that you will meet along the way will warm your heart each and every time! Thank you to our Berber friends in the desert for putting things into perspective ... Looking at the stars under the full moon, listening to their drumming and enjoying the bonfire ensures that you pause and appreciate people and nature at its best! We had a phenomenal time taking two different tours with Mohamed who is absolutely the best tour guide ever! Trust me, you will start of with him as a tour guide and leave as lifelong friends! He is always prompt, respective and sensitive to the needs of everyone! He is fluent in several languages including Arabic, French and English. Equally important, he is an excellent driver. Starting off in Marrakesh, we covered a lot of ground in the car but it never felt that way. Mohamed is quite the historian so he shared so much about Morocco but also about world history and a host of many topics. We learned a lot of fun facts about linguistics, we laughed, sang and danced on our off road trip! There was quiet time too as we took our naps. He stopped at all the photo stops and anytime that we asked! All of the hotels / riads that he selected in the cities that we covered were clean, friendly staff, had wifi, and good food. On our road trip lunches, he called ahead to the restaurants to make sure that they were prepared for our arrival! Mohamed is well respected in his industry and was well received everywhere we went. We sure felt like royalty traveling with him. Thanks Mohamed for making our trip to your beautiful country so very memorable! We hope to visit again .. Enshallah!"

We are very glad that we have chosen Colours of Morocco as it was a very comfortable and interesting experience. Mohamed was not only extremely knowledgeable and pleasant, but also very accommodating to our potential needs. The first night at the riad \"Chez Pierre\" up in Atlas Mountains was beautiful - breathtaking views and the hotel itself was very cozy. Both dinner and breakfast were outstanding. The camel trekking and night in the desert watching the stars were one of a kind. I have never seen so many stars (and even the Milky Way) in such an incredible setting. Mohamed told us a lot about the history and religion in Morocco and had a lot of knowledge on everything we asked him about. At the end he even organized a transfer for us to Essaouira and then from there to Casablanca several days later. I highly recommend Colours of Morocco to anyone who values individualized approach and an erudite easy-going tour guide."

We had a wonderful day with Khalid who was very informative about Moroccan history and the Berbers, being a Berber himself. As we travelled he asked us about what we might like to visit so had an impromptu stop at an Argan oil women's co operative and a village family home who operate a water wheel. We also had tea with a very memorable Berber grandfather who made it in front of us and we got to choose what went into it. They are a very accommodating people with a great sense of humour and we were pleasantly surprised to see so many Berber villages scattered across the amazing Atlas Mountains and their colours, each matching the colour of the earth where they stand, amazing. The day flew and we had a wonderful lunch at Ourika Gardens, a beautiful little place with rooms for rent and in a lovely setting. Thank you Ahalid, and watch out for those cats' with 9 lives!"

He drove me and my friend to the Atlas villages for a one day visit. Besides a well prepared guide I understood I had met a very special person.So in March 2015 I came back to Marocco for a 7 days holidays this time with some other 3 friends and asked Mohamed to organize the whole tour for us. From Marrakech down direction Ourzazate, Zagora, Merzouga and Desert, Erfoud and then back to Marrakech. It has been one of the most beautiful trip I can remember. Hotels chosen for us were excellent, the night spent in the desert was so exciting that it will remain in my heart forever. Mohamed is never tired to talk with you if you feel like doing it. In his car you can hear all different kind of music ... he is a very interesting and cultured person but at the same time very funny. He is very professional and with him you are in very good hands.Morocco is a beautiful country but you have to choose the right guide and I strongly recommend Colours of Morocco and Mohamed as your first contact."

My wife and I have recently returnedfrom 10 days in Morocco with Colours of Morocco.we were collected in Casablanca by our guide, driver and now friend, Mohamed. Booking colours of Morocco on the strength of Internet recommendations was something of an act of faith. Mohamed repaid our trust. He was reliable, insightful, patient, humorous and tireless. Your trip he proposed for us started and Casablanca, with the first night in Rabat, followed by Meknes, Volubolis, Fez, the Sahara desert, the Dades and Todra gorges, Ait Benhaddu , the High Atlas mountIns, Marrakesh and Essaouira. All the arrangements went smoothly, the accommodation \u2013 a combination of riads and hotels \u2013 was all excellent (we had asked for something between mid range and luxury and we were not disappointed). As well as a guiding us \"on the road\", Mohammed arranged guides for us in Fez, Essaouira and Marrakesh. All three were wonderful. They spoke excellent idiomatic English, and shared Mohamed ' obvious passion for Morocco. On the road we talked politics, history, religion, culture and music (with Muhamed's music collection having a nice Arab-theme. Who would have guessed there were so many Arabic speaking members of western pop groups from the 1980s And 90s!) Mohamed was sensitive to our interests \u2013 in my case photography, and was patient and proactive in helping with this. While wanting to ensure we had an opportunity to purchase Moroccan products (rugs, ceramics, leather goods and Moroccan clothing), we were generally taken to local cooperatives, and nothing was ever too\"pushy\". If you were thinking of a bespoke tour of Morocco \u2013 either for a day or for a longer period like us, I would not hesitate to recommend Colours of Morocco."

Mohammed Al Mouwahidi who owns Colors of Morocco was our driver, guide and friend for the duration of our visit. While the first part of the vacation was smooth as we started in Casablanca and wound our way up to Tangiers and then to Chefchouen, the heavy rains and ensuing flooding was rather bad. Even though it impacted Mohammad's business severely, he was a professional through and through balancing our needs as well as managing his crisis. The trip was extremely relaxing mostly because Mohammad made it so but also very educational as we spoke to Mohammad on a variety of subjects about Morocco, its history, the Arabs and more. Additionally Mohammad allowed us to experience the real Morocco, eating at local eateries some of which did not have a name, others were not high on hygiene but rich in taste as well as visit attractions that are normally not on tourist itineraries.In addition to typically going above and beyond, Mohammad has a wonderful sense of humor and can sing....yes; his singing is part of the on-road entertainment!!!More in my blog about the trip and how much we enjoyed it.

We were a little nervous going to Africa but our fears were set aside by Mohammed, he met us at the airport and never left our side for 5 days. We loved the hotels, they were beautiful and absolutely loved the food. I am a picky eater so I was concerned there would be nothing for me to eat, but was I surprised, I loved the Moroccan food, everything was delicious! We went from Marrakech to the High Atlas Mountains, the Anti Atlas Mountains and a wonder trip to the desert. That was our favorite experience traveling by camel into the desert to spend the night with some fantastic Berbers, and they prepared dinner for us that was also delicious. As long as I live I will not forget the trip into the desert it was wonderful. I know why Mohammed calls his company Colours of Morocco, this is a wonderful word to describe Morocco, so many vibrant beautiful colors like nothing I have ever seen. The vibrant Orange of the desert with the bright cloudless sky, unbelievable. I recommend this trip to everyone of all ages!!"

It was fantastic, upon climbing on the camel I was soo scared but was reassured that I would be fine and it was wonderful. Wow Wow Wow We saw the Atlas Mountains Beautiful Georges, Best places to eat, met the most wonderful kind and caring people We drank bottled water and all 4 of us were fine. No problems. We danced under the stars with the Berber People, ate their wonderful food and sang songs and we were in the best place ever. Mohamed watched over us ever step of the way. He took us to the airport, checked our luggage in, guided us to the boarding gate. With tears in my eyes we said goodbye and I knew as my fellow travelers did that Morocco has so much to see that we would be back again and have another Trip of a Lifetime with Mohamed from Colours of Morocco.Thank you again, and again from the bottom of our hearts for making this Dream come true.With the Best of regardsJane Cohen and FriendsBoynton Beach Florids"

I have to admit, it was a little bit nerve racking not having paid anything prior or seeing formal confirmations. Mohammed simply told us to meet our driver and/or guides in the lobby of our hotel at a certain time and without fail they were there waiting for us. Our driver, Hassan, was incredible. He knew his way around the entire country. Since we drove so far we got to spend a lot of time together and both my fiancee and I really got to like him very much.

I was fortunate that the concierge (Youssef) at my hotel, Le Meridien NFIS in Marrakech immediately contacted a tour company to accommodate my wishes for four days post Conference. Luckily for me, it was Mohamed from Colours of Morocco. What an absolute professional, knowledgeable, adaptable and comedic person. To understand the political landscape and the culture of Morocco, you need to have Mohamed as your guide. Book him in advance - worth every penny. If you are one person, the rate for this tour company might be expensive. However, if you are more than two persons, this is the best value and efficient manner to receive a personalized tour of Morocco compared to a bus tour with forty plus persons. As many others have already mentioned, Mohamed is a kind person by purchasing chocolates and soccer balls for the kids in the villages in the Atlas mountains. Moreover, the highlight of the trip was to understand why the taxis don't have meters and there aren't any standardized prices. Once you understand the Moroccan internal government policy that needs to be fixed immediately, you empathize with the drivers and welcome all Moroccans as genuinely friendly, and hospitable people. I didn't want to reiterate what others have already mentioned but all the tours that you choose, Mohamed will exceed your expectations - just let him know in advance, if possible and he'll take care of it. In fact, why I prefer such tours is that you are able to adapt them to your needs. My only fault on the trip is to inform everyone to ignore Mohamed's advice and NOT to purchase any of the Argan Oils from the Women's Cooperative in the Atlast mountains. Given that Argan are grown when travelling to Essaouira, the costs in the mountains are astronomically more expensive. Purchases were up to 50% more than in the lowerland. As such, I would recommend to ask Mohamed to find a store in the lowerland or buy them in the souk where you can negotiate. If you aren't visiting Marrakech or going to Essaouira, definitely negotiate the prices with the women in the mountains. Mohamed doesn't make you feel like a client but a best friend by the end of the tour. Bon travail Mohamed - you have become a friend for life!"

Amongst the many beautiful places we visited, for me the highlights of this trip were; a camel ride through desert of Sahara for unforgettable experience of a night in Bedouin camp, and a scenic drive through the High Atlas Mountains with breathtaking views... I never imagined that I will be able to see such variety of landscape in one country, during one trip!

When I came online to write a review for Colours of Morocco, it is clear I\u2019m not the only one who felt compelled to write a review due to the fantastic experience!After touring the Atlas Mountains, Essaouira, Casablanca, and Rabat with Mohamed the last three days, my only regret is I didn\u2019t find him sooner! True to my usual travel form, I arrived in Morocco with only hotels booked in Marrakech and Casablanca (I\u2019ve found getting local suggestions is more interesting than coming in with a planned itinerary). By sheer luck, my hotel in Marrakech recommended Mohamed, who was able help modify my itinerary a bit so I got to see more of the country.Parts of the tours required long distances of driving, yet they all seemed short since Mohamed was able to discuss a variety of topics and always had great music playing. Conversing with him is like chatting with a friend \u2013 he\u2019s always engaged, and you end up on various tangents and covering quite a bit of ground (pun intended!). He drove a very comfortable sport utility vehicle that was quite new and was always courteous and professional, going out of his way to ensure I saw the most possible in every place we visited. Food-wise, he\u2019s also quite knowledgeable and able to provide suggestions from very local to \u201ctouristic but good.\u201d Let\u2019s add patience to the list \u2013 he kindly and quietly waited for me when I was running late on our last day!I\u2019m looking forward to another trip with Mohamed soon to explore the other parts of his lovely country! This next time, however, I might break my rule and seek out his opinion prior to arriving to ensure I maximize my experience :)"

We had some idea of our preferred itinerary and emailed a number of tour companies onTripadvisor. Colours of Morocco were the most responsive to our questions and offered the best value for money. Some other companies offered lower lower quality hotels for the same price. We were happy with every recommendation and the final airport transfer from Essaoira to Agadir was also included.From the moment Mohammed picked us up at Casablanca airport we were at ease. He looked after our every question and need. He was an excellent tour guide - informative and entertaining. We are both big music fans so there was much fun in the 4x4 as we debated the merits of his music collection! He gave us an insight into all aspects of Moroccan life and was happy to discuss any issue that arose. All of the hotels and restaurants recommended by Mohammed were to the highest standards. We've been to many counties on holidays but think this might be our best ever holiday! This was down to the wonderful nature of Mohammed who felt more like a family member, even staying with us until we were safely through security and on our way home.We've since recommended Colours of Morocco to a friend and they too were delighted with the friendly and informative service."

Don't hesitate a second - book your your trip with Colours of Morocco now. \u2028It was the WOW factor trip, which turned our family holiday into an unforgettable, amazing adventure which took us from Marrakech via the Atlas mountains to the desert of Merzouga.\u2028Our family consists of myself, my husband and 4 kids aged 8,12,14,16 - who are not easily impressed, but they were! \u2028I chose Mohamed as he responded to my emails promptly, courteously and helped me to plan a fantastic itinerary for our 4 day excursion. I initially considered a 3 day trip, but thank goodness that Mohamed suggested 4 days, due to the heat and the distance driven. \u2028The rave reviews on TripAdvisor are ALL TRUE! Mohamed is professional, kind, charming, highly educated, funny and just brilliant with children. He took the time and made a huge effort to share his vast knowledge of the culture, language and history of Morocco with us all and he really engaged the children's interest.\u2028The hotels that he chose were just lovely. Our itinerary / stops tailored to our family's interests, with some amazing unscheduled stops (such as stopping at a desert well to give nomadic camels some water - the kids simply loved this).\u2028I cannot praise Mohamed enough - nothing was too much trouble, from finding a pharmacy to ensuring that we chose suitable restaurant stops which would cater for adults and children (including one very fussy eater).\u2028Be prepared - a 4 day trip does involve a LOT of driving - this is why it is important that you have a friendly tour guide like Mohamed - you basically spend a huge amount of time in each others company.\u2028Our 4 day trip was an authentic Moroccan experience - each day was an adventure. For us and the children, the memories of this amazing trip will last a lifetime. As we said our goodbyes, the kids even remarked how it felt like Mohamed had become part of our family. \u2028We would all HIGHLY RECOMMEND a tour with Colours of Morocco.\u2028So thank you once again to Mohamed."

As a single woman travelling alone, I was a little worried at first especially that I didn\u2019t go to Morocco prepared. I just booked my flights and my first two nights at the Le Meridien in Marrakesh without any itinerary. I have been reading about different tour companies and read great reviews about Colours of Morocco. I also asked the concierge at my hotel if they can recommend a good tour company and sure enough they recommended Colours of Morocco. I called Mohamed and inquired about his services. Mohamed met me at my hotel lobby right away and gave me an overview his country. He even drove me around the city just so I could have an idea and he took me to the Jardin Majorelle which I loved! Even though I gave him such a short notice, he agreed to drive me around on a private tour around the country the very next day!My trip to Morocco was one of my best trips ever and that is largely because of Mohamed. He made me feel very comfortable and safe instantly. As he took me to beautiful places around the country, he always made sure that I knew the important facts and the history of these places. He is very knowledgeable! Even if I didn\u2019t have enough time to see everything , Mohamed took me to the best places\u2026the Atlas mountains, Kasbahs, gorges, souks, camel trekking and camp in the Sahara desert, etc.! The hotels that he booked were great! My favorite was the Riad in Fes. I stayed in the biggest room which had a huge separate living room and a Jacuzzi tub in the bathroom! It was quite fabulous. That room seemed pricey but I guess since Mohamed knew the owner, he got a great deal!Mohamed is very professional and is the nicest person! I didn\u2019t have to worry about anything. He takes care of every little detail from taking my pictures, making sure I had enough water (I was there during summer time!), to making sure I ate when I was hungry (I felt bad because It was Ramadan and I had to eat in front of him), to lending me his cell phone, getting me a cell phone car charger when I needed one, to helping me carry my luggage, to taking me to the airport (at 3am!) and making sure that I made my flight without any problems! There is just an endless list of things that Mohamed happily does to make sure your trip is perfect!When I got back to Los Angeles, my family and friends asked me, \u201cHow did you manage to travel around Morocco by yourself?\u201d I told them, \u201cI had the best tour guide!\u201dThank you so much, Mohamed for making my trip the best ever!!!"

We met our tour guide, Mohamed, in the morning, and he was an excellent driver and guide! He started us off with a question, Who are the Berbers? He then delved into their history, as well as the history of the region. He knows a great deal about his country - we learned much and thoroughly enjoyed it. He ably navigated us through four valleys and knew every turn, including where best to take a little walk, get good pictures, etc. We especially loved his love for the children of the area. He brought along biscuits and a few gifts for the kids he knew he would see. We would stop periodically so he could brighten the kids' day.I recommend Mohammed without question! And, you don't have to go through the Le Meridien hotel to get him - visit colours-of-morocco.com to set up a tour. Excellent. Thanks again for a great tour!"

Unfortunately, I am afraid of heights. Mohamed was kind enough to cater to my terrified whims while crossing the mountains and he deserves many accolades for doing so. He is always willing to pull over for a pictures and an explanation of what we were viewing! I won\u2019t go into all the details of the trip so that you may experience them for yourselves, but I will say that should we ever again visit Morocco we would have no hesitations in booking excursions with Colours of Morocco again.

My friend and I found Colours of Morocco on Trip Advisor and chose it over another highly ranked company based on reviews and the description of the tours available. It was the best decision. We spent three days with Mohamed touring different aspects of Morocco- Casablanca (the mosque makes the visit worthwhile), the Ouzoud Cascades (watch out for the monkeys during lunch), and Essaouira (spend more time here!!) Mohamed was friendly, punctual, knowledgable and generous. Sometimes when people, especially in the tourism industry, do extra things for you it feels like its done only for an extra tip on the end, but this is not the case with Mohamed. He went out of his way for us with no ulterior motives. After talking about the confusion of finding restaurants in the medina, he picked us up one night after a day tour and took us out to dinner in the new city. Upon learning our airport ride had fallen through, he came back to pick us up and take us to the airport and waited while we checked in. Our days in Morocco we fine before we met Mohamed, but our experience with him turned an average trip into one we won't soon forget. Prices are more than fair and we felt he was owed more than he charged, so we paid accordingly."

Mohamed was incredibly knowledgable about the history of Morocco, the Berbers, the landscape, etc. He was also quite funny and personable. Every story was tinged with a personal anecdote that brought the color to the colours of Morocco tour. I've been on more than a dozen tours in a dozen countries, but Mohamed was the best guide I've ever had. And WHEN I go back to Morocco, I will take another tour with him for certain. It was clear to us that Mohamed didn't just know the area, he loved it. Kids rushed up to the car to say hi - not to ask for anything - but just to see that he was there. Of course, he was generous with them, even going to the market to get a soccerball for a kid he had made a promise to on a previous trip. He was a part of the community and welcomed us into it as well. Some of the highlights: mint tea at a Berber home, incredible colors of the doors and buildings, stunning variations in the colors of the red clay, green hills and white mountains; the smiling faces of the children we met, the hustle bustle of the Berber market (just for passing through not buying the goods), seeing stunningly beautiful visages of Morocco far from the image that you had in your head before you took the tour. Definitely bring your camera. You could take pictures for days. Also, bring some snacks. You will stop for lunch, but having a few bites along the way will help."

            "review": "Very memorable experience!. My husband and I went on a very rush 1-week vacation in Morocco back in late December 2012. When we planned this trip almost half a year ago, we had requested for quotes from many tour agencies and finally we picked Colours of Morocco mainly for its fair price (almost half price of what other agencies quoted us) and the very good review mentioned here related to Mohammed. When we first arrived at the airport being picked up by the driver, we were a little bit upset that it wasn't Mohammed, but afterall December is a busy season for most tour agencies and we understand that there were only 2 of us so it is understandable that Mohammed could be leading a bigger group happening at the same time. So we weren't that unhappy about it, and met this young driver named Ahmed. He was very accommodating throughout the trip, although his english skills are fairly limited in our expectation so a bit difficult to maintain a fair conversation. But he tried to answer most of the questions that we had throughout the trip. He kept mentioning to us the car was ours, we can stop and take pictures whenever we liked to.The highlight of the trip was definitely 1-night stay at the Sahara Desert and the 2-hours camel ride from sunset to pitch darkness in the middle of the desert. The moonlight landscape was very beautiful and definitely unforgettable. However, we feel a little unprepared for the night of stay at the desert, because we weren't told in advance to pack only 1 night of clothes. So we were rushing to get all the clothes and stuff we need for that night just when we arrived at the hotel where we started the camel ride and made us forgot to bring our down-jacket and tuque that we did bring along in the luggage. End up that night was pretty cold (almost 0C) and we could have enjoyed more if we had those items with us. Other than that, the sunrise the next morning was again a very sensory experience. At the tent, we were waiting for the guide to bring us to a good spot to see the sunrise, but we waited for awhile and still didn't see anybody, until we saw a group was already walking on the huge sand dunes behind the tent to reach the top just in time for the sunrise. We went running on the sand trying to catch up with them, but couldn't make it to the top because it was very tiring especially running on the sand. So we were again a bit disappointed because the guide didn't wait for us! And the sunrise was supposed to be the HIGHLIGHT of the entire trip, to me at least!I read some reviews about driver taking you to buy souvenirs (fossils, rugs, robes, tagine, etc) throughout the trip, but we were okay with that as part of contributing to the economy. I also want to mention about lunches. Each day we were brought to nice restaurants for lunches, we were okay on the first day, but then we wanted to try some local food. We later understand that we were on the road, so it was not easy to find safe and clean local foods. If you really want to try local foods, save it for Marrakech. After the 4 day road trip back from the desert, we had 1 day at Marrakech. A tour guide named Zubida was arranged for half a day of the tour. She mentioned that Mohammed had treated us to take the carriage from the main square to Jardine Majorelle. So we feel very pleased as although he couldn't take us personally on the tour, but he did something to make up for it! Overall, the trip was very good, but I couldn't give full 5 stars given the reasons above. But definitely the scenery from Marrakech to the desert through the Atlas mountains was amazing...you will see mountains in different colours, transition ranging from very green, to few trees, 1 tree, then no trees, and then pure sand and rocks, very fascinating! A must-see country!"

We have traveled extensively in the U.S., Caribbean and western Europe, but Morocco was well beyond what we could have imagined. It is very different and incredibly beautiful. We probably have more than 1,000 pictures of the scenery, the villages, and the markets, etc. Our trip was highlighted by a camel trek into the Sahara Desert and an overnight stay in a nomadic tent. Morocco was an excellent travel destination and Mohamed El Mouwahidi of Colours of Morocco was a fantastic guide. As Americans, we felt completely comfortable and safe throughout our visit, and would highly recommend this trip.The Colours of Morocco tour service and its owner Mohamed El Mouwahidi provided an outstanding tour from start to finish. We have taken many guided bus tours with the large companies (Globus, Trafalgar, etc.) and enjoyed them. But having a private guide was a completely different and superior experience. We found Colours of Morocco through Trip Advisor and even contacted some of the reviewers just to get a comfort level with the destination and guide. Then we contacted Mohamed with our tentative plans and he provided several tour itineraries. Based on our flight times, Mohamed adapted a 4-day trip to fit within our schedule. You\u2019ll never get that type of accommodation from a big tour operator. Mohamed personally picked us up at the Marrakesh airport and arranged a local guide for the afternoon/early evening in Marrakesh. (Tip: we sent a picture of ourselves to aid in meeting at the airport.) Our guide walked us through the extensive and chaotic souk (marketplace located in the Medina area, which is the old Roman city area). The market featured all kinds of products for sale, from clothing, leather goods, metal works, and almost anything else. Within many of the alcoves along the very narrow alleys, you could see the workers and artisans working hard making the various goods that were offered in their shops. We really appreciated the labor involved in creating the items that were for sale. The open market area had food vendors and entertainers, including animal acts with snakes and monkeys. The whole experience was a bit overwhelming. It was very clear after our first evening that our visit to Morocco would be unlike any trip we had ever taken.From Marrakesh, we headed east across the Atlas Mountains to Ouarzazate and Merzouga and various points in between. You may want to consult a map at this point to get a sense of the geography. We traveled in a Toyota Landcruiser and were joined by another guest, our new friend Gena from Canada. The mountain scenery was breathtaking, although parts of the drive on narrow switchback roads were a bit unnerving. The roads are similar to what you might find in the American Rockies. We made numerous stops along the way including highlights such as the Kasbah Ait Ben Haddou and the Dades Gorge (featured in the Cadillac commercial). . With a group of 3, we had the flexibility to stop anytime to take pictures or to visit a roadside vendor. Since we covered a fairly long distance in just a few days, we did spend a great deal of time in the car, although since the scenery varied so much along the way, the hours went by quickly. Mohamed had a great selection of music to play ranging from classic American and British tunes to local and Middle Eastern music. The terrain included deserts, steep gorges, lush valleys and villages of every size. The car was roomy and comfortable; however, at this point, it\u2019s probably fair to note that if you have car sickness issues, this may not be the tour for you. On the other hand, Mohamed is able and willing to provide off-road and more extensive tours for guests that are more adventurous and have more time than we did.Besides being mesmerized by the natural beauty of Morocco, we were captivated by the people and the architecture. The most surprising thing about Morocco was the blend of primitive and modern. You will often feel like you have stepped back in time, but at the same time, you\u2019ll see ample examples of how even the most remote areas are touched by 21st century technology, with modern conveniences and the accompanying problems. We could go on, but it\u2019s best that you discover it all for yourself.Our tour included the overnight accommodations, which were surprisingly luxurious. While exotic, the hotels offered spacious comfortable rooms, lovely common areas and grounds, excellent meals, and conveniences such as WIFI and international TV. The tour also included breakfasts and dinners, which were either buffets or fixed menu items in the hotels. All were excellent, even for some of us who don\u2019t eat just everything. Be sure to sample the orange juice, which was the best ever. I also recommend the Moroccan Whiskey \u2013 Mint Tea. We stopped for lunches along the way at interesting restaurants. We ordered off the menus and paid for these meals directly. The offerings generally included some form of chicken or lamb, vegetables and rice. The food was well-seasoned, but not too unusual. We are used to an American diet and found the food to be very good.While we really enjoyed all of the tour, the highlight of the trip was an overnight in the Sahara Desert. We reached our camp by camel, which was very cool. Note that riding on a camel for a long distance is not as easy as you might think. We were greeted by our Berber hosts who served us a great meal and even sang and played drums for us. The night was clear and cold. Mohamed told us that Morocco is a cold country with a hot sun, which made perfect sense after our night in the Sahara. We were there in mid-November so it was very cold overnight. Other times of year might be warmer. Just be prepared with layers of clothing. The bed in the tent was more of a firm mat than a mattress. Honestly, we didn\u2019t sleep too well that night. Regardless of any discomfort, we were amply rewarded with an indescribable night sky full of endless stars. We rose early to watch the sun rise. The Sahara Desert is exactly like you would imagine, incredibly vast with enormous mountains of soft colorful sand. Truly, this was an experience of a lifetime. We rode the camels back to a beautiful resort where we were able to shower and have breakfast.As mentioned, we spent a lot of time in the car. During the ride, we learned much about Morocco, the Arab culture and the Islam religion. These discussions enriched our experience. Mohamed is knowledgeable, well-educated, and demonstrated a great deal of national pride. Overall, our trip to Morocco and our guide were great. Please feel free to contact us with any questions."

            "review": "Fantastic tour with Mohamed. This was our first trip to Morocco and following the many positive reviews we had read on Trip Advisor about Colours of Morocco, we decided to book a 4 day tour discovering the south of Morocco (which included the Atlas Mountains, Dades and Todra Gorges, Daraa Valley and the Sahara). The perfectly tailored tour which made the most of our limited time in Morocco surpassed any expectations and helped to ensure that we are both eager to return to Morocco in the near future. Mohamed is a very friendly and knowledgeable guide. We learnt so much about the history and culture of Morocco from him. He did try and teach us some Arabic and was incredibly patient with our multiple failed attempts to remember even the most basic of phrases (the only word we can remember is madfouna which is a type of Moroccan pizza found in Rissani \u2013 it\u2019s very delicious and well worth tying if you get the chance). The tour had a good balance between culture and scenery and showcased the country at its best. Mohamed adapted the tour to meet our needs and at various points gave us a variety of options about what we could do. This was especially appreciated at lunch times, when we couldn\u2019t cope with another 3 course lunch and begged Mohamed to take us somewhere for a lighter lunch (this is how we got the opportunity to sample madfouna). Mohamed arranged lovely accommodation for us for each night and we started each day of the tour well rested. Mohamed is an excellent driver and at all times we felt very comfortable in his land cruiser (even while travelling off road or driving along narrow mountain passes). These drives were made even more memorable by Mohamed\u2019s carefully chosen soundtrack. The wide variety of music provided a perfect accompaniment to the gorgeous scenery. We would like to thank Mohamed for making our first trip to Morocco so memorable and we will book another tour with him the next time we visit the country.Kristen and Gillian"

Prior email comms with Mohamed were a pleasure and gave us confidence that his company would be right for us...(plus we had a recomendation from other friends).We were met at the airport and taken to our Riad which was excellent. The following morning Mohamed had arranged a walking tour of the city of Marrakech, which was led by a wonderful local lady Zoubida. She was very knowlegable and good fun to be with. The following morning Mohamed took us into the Atlas mountains following one of the ancient Berber trails, truly facinating. Our tours were very professional and we were all very impressed. Mohamed was very pleasant and most of all very reliable, a safe driver with a well maintained vehicle.Overall highly recommended."

A Marrakesh-based travel agency called Colours of Morocco organized a two-week tour that was an exciting, insightful experience. We travel to learn more about the countries and cultures we visit, and the guides employed by Colours of Morocco were highly educated, worldly and wise. Multilingual, fluent English speakers and skilled, careful drivers with 15 years working in the Moroccan travel industry, our guides taught us much about the country's history, culture, government and religion. We traveled to beach towns on the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea, visited villages and nomadic outposts in the High Atlas Mountains, and rode camels into the Sahara where we spent the night with other tourists in a comfortable, solar-powered camp. We experienced the urbane, big-city offerings of Casablanca, Tangier and Rabat. All of our hotel accommodation was luxurious, particularly riads (traditional family homes turned into tourist accommodation) in Fez, Chefchaouen, and Essaouira, where we enjoyed a modern hammam, the traditional bathhouse. Our guides brought us to ancient tanneries, rural women's embroidery co-ops, and desert carpet sellers. They introduced us to a wide-range of Moroccan cuisine, art, architecture and music. I highly recommend visiting Morocco with the good folks at Colours of Morocco."

It was a wonderful holiday and alot of that can be attributed to Mohamed. I am 50+ and was travelling solo. I spent the first two weeks with Mohamed where he picked me up in Casablanca and we visited, Fes, Chefchouen, Rabat, the Sahara and everywhere inbetween. Finishing the tour in Marrakech. I cannot say enough about how attentive and genuine Mohamed was throughout my stay. I have to also mention that I wasn't going to spend the night in the desert because of my physical limitations and not being able to ride a camel. It was Mohamed who encouraged me to go and made arrangements for me to be driven to the camp. There is something magical about the Sahara and difficult to articulate but I am so happy that I did not miss the opportunity to experience it.Mohamed has a great sense of humor and has a vast knowledge of Moroccan history, politics and religion. I was also educated on this trip! And he isn't a bad singer either! All of these traits made the trip that much more enjoyable. Thank you Mohamed!!He also ensured that I had local English speaking guides in the Imperial cities and Old cities. He was willing to change Riads when I was not happy. And not once did he make me feel guilty or that I was being difficult. He was a complete gem!!I cannot say enough about just how accommodating Mohamed was during the whole trip. Even when I was on my own in Marrakech and Essouria. He checked in to see how things were going.You certainly don't get that with most companies. So, yes I would highly recommend Colours of Morocco and will use them the next time I go to Morocco and I will definitely be returning."

The title of our review does not take away from Marrakech at all as it is an amazing place, but the time spent with Mohamed was by far some of the most rewarding and special time we have ever spent visiting any where in the world. Mohamed is an extremely learned man with such a vast knowledge of history, philosophy and religion. That said, he does not force anything on you, you can travel with just music on or you can talk, I reccomend the latter. We did 2 trips, 1 to the High Atlas Mountains to see 2 fantastic Kasbahs and the other to The Cascades, including a trip to see dinosaur footprints. This day was amazing. His English is impeccable and as said before the knowledge he imparts is somthing you would never get on a coach trip excursion. He will stop anywhere you want, knows all the best places to take a picture and goes off road to places a coach would never get to. Cost wise, if there are 2 of you then this is the same or even a little less than a travel company arranged trip. I could go on about Mohamed for hours so all I will say is that if you are going to Marrakech and you want a memorable time, use this company and you will come away as we did with more knowledge and experience than you started with. Just do it I promise you will not be disappointed."

Mohamed collected us from our hotel in Marrakesh on time, even being kind enough to take my wife to the pharmacy for a few things whilst I was settling the hotel bill. Mohamed is a great driver, knowing when to engage in conversation and when to turn the music up and let you take in the sites. The tour was excellent and the hotels are more than adequate for the trip. Basically from what we saw many of the guides will end up in the same locations, given us tourists generally want to see the same sites. Given this your guide will make or break your trip. I can not recommend Mohamed highly enough!!! He even went out of his way to drop us at out hotel in the Atlas mountains at the end of the tour, adding about 2hrs more driving to his day than if we had ended in Marrakesh as per the tour outline. A true gentleman who we were sad to leave behind when the tour ended."

We were travelling with my son and partner. I emailed Mohammed and explained the type of excursions we were interested in. He replied next day with attachments of various trips and costs. Mohammed tailor makes the excursion as to how you wish. You do not need to send money or deposit prior to going. We settled for trip to Essouira. Khalid (driver) arrived at hotel at stated time, spoke English and was an excellent guide, having laughs along the way which also made the trip. We travelled in a 4x4 air conditioned vehicle which was very comfortable. The day trip started at 8am and returned to hotel at 7pm. Khalid stopped at various places of interest and a cafe etc. Once arrived at Essouira Khalid dropped us of at a restaurant for lunch which was also very nice. This was important to us as I believe there are some restaurants would not be recommended if you dont want an upset tummy. Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our day and would have no hesitation in recommending Colours of Morocco if you wish 1:1 which we prefer as we dont like going on large group excursions, this was ideal for our needs. We had rang Mohammed while at our hotel to enquire about a possible day trip to Atlas Mountains, he puts no pressure on, he gave the price and we said we would discuss on the day of the Essouira trip. However, we decided against it as we were only there for 1 week and wanted some chill time.On our journey home, Khalid received call from Mohammed who wanted to speak with me; I initially thought he was going to put pressure on me to go on the Atlas Mountain trip but this was far from the case, he rang to get feedback from the day - now if that is not excellent customer service - what is?? We were all very touched by this personal touch. Not many companies take the time to do this.You do not pay until end of the day. On that note I am sure the company must lose out to some degree if people do not turn up without informing the company.We hope to return to Morocco and we would def use Colours of Morocco again. If anyone wishes to contact me direct please feel free to do so."

            "review": "Long Overdue Glowing Review. It takes a special guy to put up with my mumblings in horrific French for three days. My wife's used to it, so she just nods, but this was Mohamed's first meeting with my inexhaustible belief that I can speak French, and his patience was impressive. Granted, for the first day or so, maybe Mohamed didn't understand what was going on. Maybe he just thought I had some sort of speech impediment, but somewhere along the line it must have dawned on him that the sounds coming from the passenger seat were an attempt at language and pretty soon he was nodding in sync with my wife as I gestured at the landscape and pronounced it tray, tray bow. It all worked out beautifully. The tenor of the trip was settled early the first morning after I'd mentioned lamb the third time when Mohamed asked us, a little skeptically, if we would \u201ceat where the Moroccans eat?\u201d The answer was \u201coh yeah.\u201d From there on, not a day went by that we didn't end up eating somewhere extraordinary, chattering the entire time: Mad Founa in Rissani, lamb chops in a variety of towns . I was doing pretty well on my diet before we got to Morocco, then I just sat back and enjoyed, slurring my French syllables and devouring plate after plate in nameless restaurants. I can't say enough about Mohamed's ability and patience. The man has a wry sense of humor coupled with strong pragmatism. This is his country, and he represents it well. There is no point in me describing the scenery \u2013 go see it. Go see it with Mohamed. Enjoy his music collection, and enjoy watching someone do his job very, very well. Have the lamb, it's amazing. Up until this trip, I never considered myself the kind of person who would enjoy having someone else do the driving and the planning, but I learned a lot, and I can't wait to go back. I am telling all my friends to go see this place and I can think of no better guide than he is."

We went on this tour in early February and was under the understanding from the numerous emails with Mohammed that he would be our guide for the trip. The reviews we read on Tripadvisor was the main reason we booked through this company and we were very excited. Unfortunately, on the day of the trip we were collected by another guide, who was friendly enough but we were really disappointed that Mohammed had not explained that he would not be taking us (as I understood from our guide, Mohammed was sick that week) We felt a little rushed through our trip, we were not asked what we were interested in seeing, and I felt that we were taken many places that helped us spend our money - often places we were not really interested in visiting. It really was a beautiful tour and the hotels were good quality - the night in the Sahara was brilliant. However on the last day our guide\u00b4s driving was appalling. I am not sure if he was in a rush to return home, but it was quite frightening, especially on the narrow mountain roads. Mohammed did speak to us on the guide\u00b4s mobile phone on the last day to ensure we were satisfied with the tour, but I felt too uncomfortable to explain these issues to him as our guide was in the car at the time. It would have been far more professional for Mohammed to contact us prior and give us the option to change or cancel our tour. In hindsight, we would have been better off spending our money on a group tour as this tour did not feel that personalised and we stopped at all the \"tourist spots\" that the bigger companies would have taken us to anyway."

The trip itself is stunning, we did the 4 day trip over the atlas mountains to the Sahara and what we got to see was incredible. The hotels we stayed were alright, the first one was actually quite good, then the 2nd night we spent in a tent in the Sahara, which was nice, just the last one wasnt so good but also not horrible. What I really didnt like so much was that we booked this trip for the good reviews the company and esspecially the driver Mohamed had and well we expected that that's what we'd get. In the end our driver's name was Hassan and on his car was the name of a different company. To be honest I find this a bit unprofessional, simply because it wasnt who we booked and we should have been informed first at least. Hassan however was a kind man, his english is alright but unfortuneately alot of the times he didnt understand our questions correctly, so we never had a truely fluent conversation. However he tried his best to adjust the trip to our preferences and made it possible, that we could make walking trips, which we told him we would like to do, at nice sites he would recommend us. We did many stops for pictures and the route itself is just fascinating, he will take you to amazing places where you will enjoy great views. What you have to know before you book the trip though, is that you will spend alot of time in the car and that you sort of rush through things. However you certainly cannot blame the agency for this, this is what all of the 4 day trips to the Sahara look like. If you want too see alot, you will have to rush a little bit but you will get many many impressions and see various amazing sights. If you dont want it like that, you should ask to customize your trip a little bit first, which I'm sure would be possible. We just didnt know what to expect so we just went with it. For lunch he always took us to places where we'd pay about 200-220 Dhm for the two of us. The food was always alright but it also always was a place just for tourists. Just on the last day we asked him to take us to a local place to eat, which he did and there we payed 35 Dhm for the two of us ! What really finally stopped me from rating this trip as \"good\" though was the way we were dropped off in Marakesh, while he was telling us first that we should always watch out for fake guides he brought us to some square in the city and called the people from the riad to come pick us up. Instead of waiting two minutes he just introduced us to a random young man he talked to in the streets who then should lead us to the Riad, shook our hands and took off within a moment. We found that quite strange after having been with him for 4 days, too bad for him as we wanted to give him a tip for the trip but he took off so fast that we didnt get the chance to do so. Shortly after that the owner of the Riad actually arrived at the square and told us once again to watch out for the fake guides and then brought us to the Riad.So in summary: The trip itself is very nice, you see great sights and alot of them in a very little time (A bit too little time but thats not the agencys fault). The hotels are all alright and we always ate well as well (except the first hotel, there the dinner was rather bad). The driver tried his best to adjust the trip to our likes and we did two really nice walks through some of the agriculture fields in the mountains, those were great. Just for the facts that we didnt get who we booked, that the drivers english wasnt good enough to allow for flowing conversations, that almost everywhere we went was quite touristy and the way we dropped off we couldnt rate this trip better.I found it hard to rate this trip, because what you get to see really is amazing but in the end you will get to see the same with all the other agencys that organize similar trips so I'm rating the driver, hotels, food the organisation and so on. Lets say it was a 3.5 out of 5"

We were both very impressed with Mohamed's prompt response to my initial email enquiries and his willingness to answer my questions and reassure me that we would have plenty of time to see and do everything on the itinerary. On the day of the tour Mohamed was on time, always polite and friendly and very accommodating if we wanted to stop to take photos or spend a little longer at any point of interest. He is also extremely knowledgeable with regard to Moroccan culture, history, politics and traditions - and he has great taste in music!I had an amazing birthday walking in the footsteps of the dinosaurs, having lunch in front of the spectacular Cascades of Ouzoud and feeding Barbary Apes by hand. Many thanks to Mohamed and his excellent tour for helping to make my birthday an extremely enjoyable and truly memorable day."

He was a very friendly guy who told us that he was from the Berber people himself. He was very proud of the Berber flag. This was a nice touch because by the time we were in the mountains we had tea with a berber family in their house . We had given a proper view on the Atlas mountains and it's people."

Our guide had an excellent knowledge of Morocco and of all the history of the cities we visited, including all the different dynasties that reigned over the Kingdom of Mororocc through the various centuries. It was a trip rich in culture and in the diversity of the different regions. We saw snow, a sand storm, went through mountains and to the sea. What do you want more? The only bemol on this trip was the weather, which was much colder this time than in Jan. 2010, when we had done our previous trip. So you need to bring some warmer clothes in case it is cold, good and comfortable walking shoes, your camera, sunglasses and hat and you're all set for the visits. Enjoy! It is a wonderful country full of warm people, who recognize the value of tourism for their country."

We visited a Berber Market, drove high up into the Atlas Mountains (the quietest place I have ever been to; I live in rural Somerset). We saw snow (when the city temperature was 18 degrees). Our guide was very knowledgable, extremely punctual and helpful.Don't hesitate about booking a trip!"

            "review": "A customized tour of Morocco and its hidden gems!. If going to Morocco anytime soon a private tour guide is the way to go and Mohamed is your man. When beginning to plan this trip we thought we would fun to hit up Marrakesh and take a train to Fes. I am so glad we didn't do that because we would have missed so much of what we loved about Morocco. A friend gave us the trip of hiring a private guide since we don't speak French or Arabic. This was a great tip because honestly not many people spoke English. Don't get me wrong the big cities are great but the landscape was absolutely amazing. Mohamed was a wealth of knowledge and made the trip educational and interesting. He will customize your trip in Morocco to whatever you want. We went with a night in Marrakesh, 3 days driving through the Atlas Mountains, a night in camping in the Sahara desert and 2 days in Fes. Yes it was a lot of driving, but after traveling around Europe for 2 years the change in scenery was great. Seeing snow covered mountains next to valleys and plateaus was beautiful. Off roading and seeing nomadic people and venturing into small villages and abandoned ruins was so memorable. Mohamed coordinated local guides in both Marrakesh and Fes. He arranged our hotels (Riads) and we were totally satisfied. After reading reviews for other private tours I am so glad we picked Mohamed; he was so personal and great to talk with. All in all an amazing trip and I know we have Mohamed to thank for that!"

We learned so much from him about Arab, Islamic, and Moroccan culture, politics, and history. Mohamed has read widely and is knowledgeable about many topics. He went out of his way to be helpful and to make our excursions enjoyable. He was prompt, responsible, and always kept his word (he is also a careful driver).

Not only is his English exceptional but his sense of humor and suggestions along the way made it seem like a drive with an old friend.We would highly recommend him for this type of trip. Our only regret was that our schedule did not permit us to take a longer multi-day journey with him - next time! We will have him help plan our next visit.

We booked a 2 day trip to Zagora and we saw and learned more during our tour with Mohamed than we expected from even the best tour guide. Mohamed went above and beyond. He never failed to keep us entertained with stories about Morocco culture and history, great music, and conversation along the way to Zagora, even after having driven many hours on the Atlas road. Mohamed knows A LOT about Moroccan history and you will get more than a tour of the sites when you book with him! Mohamed is also an extremely good driver which is important when you are driving high on a mountain on curvy roads. We saw some horrible drivers and were thankful we didn't have to worry about our safety. Mohamed even taught us how to haggle and we got some great deals on souvenirs. He made us feel comfortable and safe at all times as we adjusted to a new culture and always checked up on us to make sure we were happy and enjoying ourselves. We paid Mohamed more for his services than he had asked because we were so happy with our experience and felt he really deserved it. Mohamed's English is excellent so we never had any communication barriers either. Best tour guide I've ever had. Book your tour with Mohamed, you won't regret it!"

            "review": "A Life-Changing Experience. Having recently been on this tour (mid September), I am having a hard time understanding why it is not #1 on tripadvisor. There are so many tour companies, so if you are feeling overwhelmed like I initially was then please let me help you\u2026look no further than Colours of Morocco! I have never been so inspired by a place or a person so much in my life!! Morocco is stunning and our guide Mohamed is extremely knowledgeable\u2026not just about Morocco\u2019s breathtaking sites/history, Moroccan life, people & culture, but he knows just about everything! My sister and I were looking for a reasonably priced tour company that would accommodate our tight schedule. We wanted a couple days in Marrakech and a tour to the Sahara through the Atlas Mountains and back in 3 days. Mohamed was the first to email me back, but that\u2019s not the reason I decided to go with him. Yes, he was super fast and responsive and his English is, indeed, great. But I decided to go with him because of his warm and friendly nature. It sounds weird, but I could tell he was a good person from our email communications. He was so unbelievably accommodating and he set up a perfect itinerary for us. My sister was a little nervous to book such a long tour with someone we did not know in an unfamiliar country based off a few reviews on trip advisor. I assured her that everything would be fine and that this would be a trip of a lifetime. She could not thank me enough afterwards. This trip will change your life. I have been recommending it to everyone. Mohamed will cater the trip to your every need (within reason, of course). I told him that my sister and I wanted to be immersed in the culture\u2026we wanted to taste the best local food, meet the local people, listen to live music, shop at the best souks and learn a great deal about the history of Morocco. Well he did all that and so much more. I like to take a ton of pictures and Mohamed had no problems stopping. In fact, he knew all the right places to stop to do just that. He was extremely patient the entire time. Mohamed has a true passion for what he does and it shows. He makes you feel so comfortable, yes, his SUV is extremely comfortable (let me also note that he has such great taste in music), but even more than that, he makes you feel at home and at ease. There were several times when we would all burst out into song\u2026Mohamed has the best music to sing along too! He also shared music with us from all over the world. I am a music lover so by the end of the trip, I had a couple pages full of artists and albums that I need to buy. Mohamed opened our eyes to so many things. My sister and I felt a bit ignorant as to what little we actually know about Muslims. Mohamed did an excellent job of educating us on this and SO many other things. But do not let this intimidate you; he will in no way push his thoughts/opinions/beliefs on you. He will not try and talk about religion or politics unless you are interested in learning. I highly recommend you ask as many questions as you can and take full advantage of being around such an open and intelligent person who is in no way judgmental. My sister and I were embarrassed at first to ask certain questions, but Mohamed encouraged them and was happy to answer them.I can go on and on about what an amazing trip this was and what an amazing person Mohamed is, but I think you need to just experience this for yourself. I attached a few pictures. I will not go into detail about the specific places we visited and what we did and saw in those places because being a little surprised and in awe is all part of the adventure. I\u2019ll only say that you can trust that Mohamed will plan one of the best trips in your entire life!I did a lot of research before going on this trip so based on this and my experiences, I will give you a few tips on what I\u2019ve learned along the way. The old medina in Marrakech is completely overwhelming at first. It is too easy to get lost, there is unwanted attention, the sellers at the souks and the performers at Djemaa el Fna are super aggressive. As much as you may be warned about this aggressiveness, well, it never fully prepares you. They are there to make money and it\u2019s all part of the culture, but if you think you may not be able to handle this then I would definitely recommend a guide. Regarding haggling at the souks, I would offer half of the original price and you\u2019ll usually walk away with 1/3 off. As a woman you do not need to be covered from head to toe, but do dress respectfully. At least learn how to say please, thank you, no thank you, you\u2019re welcome, how much, hello and goodbye in Arabic\u2026it\u2019s really not that difficult and goes a long way. Mohamed will set you up with a great tour guide in Marrakech. I highly recommend this to see the sites. When exchanging money, be sure to ask for a lot of coins\u2026this will come in handy for tipping the performers at Djemaa el Fna and a \u201cguide\u201d to help you get home. It is so easy to get lost in the old medina. We tried to avoid the \u201cguides\u201d and ask the shop keepers for directions back to our riad, but it was impossible. Let the \u201cguide\u201d know how much you have before he guides you back. Some may say \u201cno coins\u201d, but if you tell them up front then they cannot get away with this. If you have more money to give than great, it is probably how these people make a living. Also, tip the performers at the square up front or else they will hunt you down for some coins. Some will not let you as much as look without being tipped. Others will not allow photos so it\u2019s best to put their mind at ease by tipping right away. You will also need coins on your trip with Mohamed into the villages. There were times that I wanted to give some coins to the children or the nomads but had none left. The Sahara is an absolute MUST. Actually, every village, Kasbah and site that Mohamed recommended on our way to the Sahara is a MUST. In fact, Colours of Morocco is a MUST!!Mohamed, if you\u2019re reading this thank you again for such an unforgettable experience! You have given \u201cTracy bien\u201d and I more than we could have ever asked for! Having met you, we are better people and we wish you and your family all the best! \u201cOk, ok, come on, bye bye\u201d :)"

Mohamed, a 36-year old Moroccan, returned about 12 months ago from 6-years at the University of Montreal, bought a comfortable Toyota Land Cruiser and set up a one man Tour Business. We booked late and he was only available for 4 days (3 nights). Nevertheless we had a remarkable and most memorable experience--of the many things we might mention we particularly enjoyed: Mohamed's prompt and lucid replies to email; uncanny accuracy in positioning & choice of photo-stops; his soft, eloquent & extremely knowledgable conversation; his kindness & resourcefulness--at 85, having travelled the world in great depth, I now move in a wheelchair. Of all the travels of my wife & self--including sub Saharan Africa, Siberia, Japan, Tibet, Cambodia, etc this trip was one of the most memorable"

We\u2019ve been on a daytrip with Colors of Morocco in April and it was GREAT!!!I found several tour offers on tripadvisor and contacted 3 and asked for a custom trip. Colors of Morocco was the fastest to respond. They replied in a way that made me feel that I\u2019d chosen the right company.On the day of our trip Mohammed was exactly on time and picked us up with his Toyota land cruiser in the morning. On the way over the Tizi-n-Tichka pass he proved to be a very good and safe driver and a wonderful guide with a lot of historical knowledge. His English and French is excellent.My husband and I were really happy to have a 4 wheel-drive car and an experienced driver, as the road gets kind of narrow several times and the precipice is right next to the road.First Mohammed took us to Telout, a beautiful old Kasbah with incredible mosaics on the inside, and later that day, we went to see Ait-Ben-Haddou, another Kasbah, where many movies have been shot.In Ait-Ben-Haddou we noticed another big advantage of having a personal guide: Unlike other tourists we were not bothered by any pushy salesmen and were able to enjoy the stay undisturbed.In every destination we had plenty of time to take pictures and even on the way Mohammed stopped for us to take pictures and showed us nice panoramic spots.We got back to Marrakech by 8 p.m. and both of us were completely happy with the trip. It\u2019s been a great experience. Thanks Mohammed!"

His commentary about Morocco and its citizens, history, geography, etc. made the trip even more exciting. I traveled with my wife and 8 year old daughter, who equally enjoyed the trip. My daughter of course loved climbing the dunes in the Sahara, the night in the tent, and the camel ride.

From there we took a dromedary ride into the desert during sunset. Our guide, Mohamed, was very friendly, curteous and was always willing to stop for pictures or answer questions. He is very knowledgeable of the history of the country so we learned a lot! I would only suggest to spread out such an excursion over 4 days, otherwise there is a lot of driving on the last day and less time to appreciate the scenery (unfortunately we didn't have a choice as our flight was departing). This was without a doubt the highlight of our trip to Morocco."

The country is beautiful, with stunning colours and completely different to everything I know! What made it extra special was Marrakech Tours Trips - Moha and Sayd. They will add to your adventure should you choose to travel with them. They have an infectious sense of fun and devilment that you can't ignore. Their attention to detail is second to none. On our return from the dessert we had to get a jeep from the base where the camels stayed to the main road to catch the bus to Marrakech. Enjoying the experience of 4 wheel driving through the dunes my phone fell out of my pocket without me realising. A half hour on the road it dawned on me. One quick phone call from Moha to Sayd had the whole thing sorted. My phone was on the next tour to Marrakech and was handed to me at a location that was most convenient for me and my boyfriend. Not stopping the amazing service there, my boyfriend and I had bought a 5 day / 4 night package and an extra 2 days, outside of the package, to visit Essouirra, another town by the beach. Sayd gave us amazing tips and tricks on how to get there, things to do, place to see etc. On the day we were flying home to Dublin, Sayd organised a private driver to take us from Marrakech to the airport. When we got in the car Sayd called to make sure we were well looked after and had enough time to get to the airport for our flight...I'm sure the other packages out there are great but from my boyfriend's and my experience we can't recommend Marrakech Tours Trips highly enough. 5 Star service from 5 Star people. Much love, best wishes and success to Marrakech Tours Trips for the future xxx"

So when we arrived in Morocco we first thought we'd go solo and organise all of our trips as it's what I do for a living anyway, but after spending some time in the hostel and meeting the amazing people we did, staff included (Waka Waka BEST HOSTEL EVER) we decided we'd try the more sociable approach and go with their organised excursions!  We definitely made the right choice! Our day at the waterfalls was incredible only to be equalled by our trip to the coast. Then came the 2 day Sahara experience and BOOM what an EPIC adventure. Our driver, Husain, might be one of my favourite people in the world, the most awesome/entertaining driver I've ever met. Despite only being able to communicate in our shared broken italian we spent 8 hours bonding!  The desert experience itself was incredible, nothing too taxing and although it felt a bit organised at time that wasn't a problem. The guides were incredible, the main man Mohammed and Sayd were great fun and once you speak to them on the level they'll show you a great time!  I'd recommend it to anyone visiting for at least a week, I'd definitely want to try the 3 days desert experience next time!"

Everyone will try sell you something in Marrakech but the tour Sayd does is truly amazing and authentic and he won't just take you here and there like every one tour guide is Morocco but will actually stay with you and have a good time with you all as well and be apart of the experience which makes things so much more fun. He is also from the Sahara, not Marrakech, thus his knowledge of the surroundings you will encounter throughout the tour are a lot more in depth and interesting to listen to."

We had taken ages to get through passport control and I was worried he might have left without us- but there he was waiting once we made it outside!Thinking so more of it our riad booked us a tour to Ourika valley a few days later- and we were lucky to get Gallou again. He was a fantastic guide, stopping along the way as and when we wanted. He even stopped on the way back to marrakech so we could use a cash point (and before you think it- the money wasn't for him!)The trip to Ourika was amazing and well worth the extra to go as a private tour- that way we could stop as we wished. Gallou reassured us many times that we did not need to buy anything at any stop- this was helpful as the sales pitch is often hard going!"

We explained to her that we booked a tour with you and we are now at the airport, she said she call us back, but after an hour waiting. all this is ok. Starting our tour the driver mohamed come to pick up us in the morning after 45 minutes of the fixed hour. Here, he said his is sorry he slept, OK fine, The problem is the driver speaks very poor english which chocked us because all the reviews said he speaks good english and that means all the reviews are fake and not real. Any way we started our tour even, we tried to communicate with mohamed and he didn't understand most of our questions, he said that our english is difficult. the days we stayed in the car discussing between us. In addition, he missed many places in our program and itinerary. when we asked him he said that he doesn't have the program from the office. he said that the lady told him to go for 7 days Tour without knowing where he will do, at the end we are the victims. this agency isn't professional at all.I have to say it again when you want to book a tour try to ask about all details and be sure you have all they confirm with you. We don't recommend this agency they are professional."

Ali stopped the car at so many locations for amazing photo opportunities, including where the argan oil products are made, I purchased some wonderful face and body moisturiser. Hats off to the Berber women who work so hard there. We were taken up into the mountain by a lovely young Berber guide to see spectacular waterfalls which come from the snow covered mountain tops. It was time for lunch when we came back down but we had spent all our cash and Ali said there were no ATMs until we went back to Marrakech. But Ali saved the day by lending us some cash for lunch. THANK YOU ALI !! . We took a different route back to Marrakech for more amazing photo opportunities of scenery, Berber Villages, Berber people, Sunset, lakes, valleys , various animals and wild life, I could go on and on. Nothing was to much trouble for Ali, he made the day an unforgettable experience for us. I would highly recommend Krikich Day Tours especially if you are lucky enough to have Ali as your tour guide."

As we had already used them for a taxi from the airport and been very impressed, we booked a day trip for a Monday for an 8am start.We were delighted to be met by Mohammed Gallou, the same driver who had picked us up from the airport. What you look for in a tour guide is professionalism, attention to detail and exceptional customer service; Mohammed was all three! As we meandered our way to Essaouira in a relaxed style paradoxically opposite to the bedlam & mayhem of the city, Mohammed gave us an in depth insight into Moroccan life and culture. We stopped on the way for coffee in a nice roadside patio area and then stopped briefly to take some snaps of goats climbing trees in search of a snack of Argan nuts! We thereafter experienced a whistle stop tour on how the locals make Argan Oil at a local shop/recognised manufacturer. There was no pressure at all to buy any product but my daughter persuaded me otherwise! Next stop was just prior to Essaouira itself for a panoramic photo opportunity before reaching the coastal town. Once in the town we had a few hours by ourselves to explore, armed with top tips from our guide. He picked us up at 16:30 and we arrived back in Marrakech just before 19:00 for our evening meal. You may see plenty of posts saying the bus from Marrakech to Essaouira is cheap and easy to book. That might be the case, but for just a few hundred Dirhams extra you can have your own personal guide and chauffeur, who can stop whenever YOU want, do whatever YOU want and takes you places the bus won't in an air conditioned comfortable 8 seater van. It's a no brainer. Ask for Mohammed Gallou. You won't be disappointed."

The Berber eco museum was an interesting half hour stop off. The landscape of the valley is pretty particularly with the snow capped mountains beyond.

            "review": "Desert Tour from hell. This review concerns the tour and not the beautiful scenery we saw along the way. Here comes the review:1. The communication was terrible. We don't know what we are doing/where we are going each day unless someone proactively asks the guide/driver. It will be nice if before dropping us somewhere, he tells us about the plan.2. Lunch was not included in tour price, which is fine, but the tour guide took us to places that are clearly overcharging -- and I am fine with that too if the food is good. The food throughout the tour was very blend, and we both got food poisoning from one of the lunches. (It has to be due to the food from the tour since we got the symptoms two days after the start of the tour). Clearly, the guide took us to wherever provides him the best commission. We saw the restaurant pay the guide after one of our meals. 3. They will promise you anything and never deliver. For example, on the website it says that it will take us to a hostel to shower after spending a night in the desert. The next day, we drove straight back to Marrakech (apart from another lucrative lunch stop for the guide). One person in our group was promised a choice of hotel or tent in the desert, and apparently the hotel was the tent. 4. The desert camp we went to has no shower or toilet. No shower was expected, but no toilet??? You are supposed to hide behind a short tree, dig a hole, and go, then bury it. Imagine having no toilet when you have diarrhea in the middle of the desert! It was a very tough night for me. Make sure you have rolls of toilet paper with you as they don't have any. I have booked this tour through a great guest house recommended by a friend, thinking that it would be good. So, make sure you research thoroughly before you join any desert tour. My thought is that the budget ones ($90 for a 3 day trip) are mostly the same. When in doubt, don't book it. The scenery of the Kasbahs and desert are beautiful and if you have the budget, the best way to go is to rent your own accommodations/research your own restaurants, and hire a reputable driver. Don't let the driver pick your accommodation as he/she will likely charge you a premium. If you can, also research your own restaurants. Hopefully, you can find great guesthouse that has good food with half-board option, which will take care of half of your meals."

Organised via our Ryad, we took a day trip to the Atlas mountains to see some of the waterfalls. Our driver Mohamed Simo Gallou was just amazing. Very elegantly dressed, he picked us up from our Ryad located in the heart of the Medina where most taxis dont dare to venture. He was an excellent and safe driver who grew up in the area making him one of the most knowledgeable person to go out on a day trip with. We started by visiting a berber village on our way to the Atlas which was very interesting. Our driver then took us to do a short trek on Camels' back through a forest in the mountain which was an incredible and memorable experience. He knew all the right spots for sightseeing and made sure we would not get ripped off by the locals which made the whole trip even more enjoyable. We felt safe at all times and I would trust Mohamed again a 100% if I were to visit even more remote areas of the Atlas or in the Sahara!I cannot recommend him or krikich daytour too highly as everything was extremely well organised, clean, safe. They made the perfect day for us."

Our trip to the Atlas mountains was a short drive.

Even though he is not a tour guide, he is more than happy to point out things along the way. Both drivers are happy to pull over on the way for any photos of the beautiful scenery.The tour guides were a mixed experience though. The guide at the cascades was a lot more informative and enthusiastic throughout the tour. However, the guide on the Atlas mountains trip seemed to rush us up and back down with minimal interaction and knowledge. He seemed like he just wanted to get back down again to do another tour... was not impressed.But overall, such a great experience and well worth it. (Just dependant on driver and guides)."

After several days in Marrakech, my British friend and I (I'm American) were really looking forward to a day tour from Marrakech to Ourzazate. We arranged the trip through our riad (Riad Linda -- a great place to stay!)We were told Habib's (the driver) English was very good. He had trouble understanding us, and we could barely understand him (often spoke in a mixture of French and English). When we asked questions about certain things (landscape, customs, traditions), he'd repeat the last part of the question, instead of actually answering the question. If someone's English isn't very good, that's fine, but don't say it is.After a 7am start, fairly obvious we hadn't had breakfast and he never offered a stop to get something to eat. The first stop was at a cafe where instead we were herded into the women's cooperative where we felt obliged to buy something. As soon as that was done, back into the car.At Ait Ben Haddou we didn't want a guide but Habib \"arranged\" one for us without asking. After the \"tour\", in which the guide took us only half way around and a second guide asked us for money simply for helping us up a step, Habib asked the kid if we'd tipped him. We had, half the amount of the entrance fee. Habib laughed with the \"guides\" about it. He then gave the kid 10 Dhs more, making us look cheap. We also felt rushed here, and would've been happy to spend more time here.Lunch where he wanted to. It was the most touristy place we saw, right next to the kasbah in Ourzazate, and the food while not horrendously pricy was poor quality compared to the local places in Marrakech. In fact my friend's local kebab shop in London would have done better. We would've appreciated eating with locals.After making it clear we weren't interested in shopping, he took us to a \"nice\" Berber house. It was supposed to be a large souk but we couldn't see in. When the doors were opened it was a carpet shop where we were asked to sit and have tea. We were being sold carpets and trinkets.Habib then swore about the British after a conversation about where we were going in the afternoon and what *we* wanted to do as the morning had been disappointing. My British friend bit his tongue after Habib said this. After all, we still had several hours in the car with him after this point.Final count: 11 hours in the car driving, 60 minutes in tourist attractions we had to pay for without being asked; 40 minutes at lunch; 20 minutes ad hoc photo stops. And just 20 minutes, that we had to ask for, of our own time just wandering around in Ouazazate.It sounds like people have had good experiences with Krikich Day Tours. That's great, just don't go with Habib."

Only one short camel ride as we were told at the camp it was either an evening or morning ride. Very badly arranged tour, not recommended at all."

He was so helpful and made sure to tailor the tour to our likes and make sure we saw all that we could. He was great to work with!On the day of our tour we had Reda as our guide. He was absolutely wonderful!! I cannot say enough good things about him. He was kind and made sure he explained to us all the sights we saw. He drove safely and was always letting us stop for pictures.We visited a Berber home, waterfalls, the Agafay Desert, Lake Lalla Takerkoust and Ourika Valley with many other little stops on the way. It was a great tour and we learned so much. Definitely recommend going with this company and if you are lucky having Reda as your guide! We loved Morocco! Cannot wait to go back!"

So when we landed and walked around Marrakech we found Rachid. At first we were apprehensive, because we didn't know the correct price for a 3 day trip with everything included. The first time around, the price seemed a bit steep, but when we talked to other guide agencies, it began to be more reasonable and very fair. We ended up paying 185 per person with everything included for the total package.Taxi to and from Imlil Breakfast, lunch and dinner A very very good guide. (Hamid, you are the man!) Water (although there might have been a misunderstand of the quantity included. We got 8-9 x 1,5L included. But we needed a bit more.) The trip was very nice and the planning was spot on. Very efficient.The only thing we were missing was information on what we should pack in our backpacks. Rachid told us to pack very light, but we had to repack into bigger bags when we got to imlil.Im sure if you ask to the specifics of what you should bring Rachid will be very happy to help you.He also helped us book the bus to Essouria for no extra charge. Everyone was nice and friendly, very service minded and efficient."

Our driver was very friendly, nice and we felt safe. The drive up to the Atlas Mountains was fantastic and we went to the Berber village and Argan oil \"plant\". We stopped off at key \"Kodak moments \" to take pictures and He even took group photos for us. When we reached the Atlas Mountains there was already another guide already waiting for us to take us up to the waterfalls and he was great, very knowledgable and helped since the mountain is tricky climb. We didn't feel under pressure to get back in a certain amount of time so we really enjoyed the trip and the scenery. The waterfall itself is fantastic and well worth the trek to reach it. The water is freezing so I wouldn't recommend jumping into it. The quad biking was for 1.45hours and we followed our driver through a course, the man very friendly and helped whenever he could. Quad biking was super super fun and easy to do since it wasn't in the desert. We stopped off halfway through for refreshments and Moroccan tea. We had originally booked to do Atlas Mountains/quad biking and a camel rude however, we were just exhausted and couldn't do it. Rashid gave us our money back no problem, which was great.Overall I would recommend this company; the customer service is fantastic and the price was phenomenal."

We booked a private tour with Rashid with agreement that it would be flexible, 4 days and three nights to include gorges and the Sahara. On the first night having visited other sites and saying yes or no at the time whether we wanted to stop, we arrived at Toudres Gorge. The Hotel Dar Ayour was fantastic with views of the mountains from our room and every terrace. the room was amazing and the food really good. We decided that we wanted to put the Sahara back by one day and stay a second night at the Gorge. This was no problem. Our driver Rida arranged this with Rashid. Rida was an excellent driver and courteous at all times, nothing was too much and he asked us often whether we were okay. He was always smiling. The Sahara trip was as to be expected a total tourist trap however the desert was amazing and that was what we wanted to see. I cannot fault Rashid's service in any way and when we got back he arranged transport to Imlil for us the next day."

The night at the Berber camp site was fun with music and singing by the Berber desert guides around the campfire after dinner. The group also joined in for some dancing fun. Arrangement: I arranged a private 3-day tour from Fes to Marrakech with a camel trek to the Sahara Desert from Merzouga by simply sending an email through the website. Ibrahim was quick to respond with detailed information and pricing. Booking was easy and straightforward via email. We were assigned a driver and a tour guide. I prefer this set up as it allows the driver to focus on driving without getting distracted with all our questions.Driver and vehicle: Salah was our driver. He was a fun, smart and skilled driver. We were lucky to get a pretty new SUV that was clean and comfortable. Tip: See if you can request a 4x4 SUV that way you can go off-roading if needed. Since we wanted to go sandboarding, Salah drove on the dunes to the first tent site so we can fit in sandboarding before we made the camel trek to the second tent site where we stayed the night. Tour guide: We had Omar for our tour guide who was fun and friendly. He was open to answering any questions we had and provided explanations as needed. He picked us up at our riad in Fes, was punctual and even lugged our baggage through the small streets of the medina to the vehicle. Omar also came with us to the Sahara Desert even though we were also assigned a local camel/desert guide. Our local desert guide, Hassan was fun and energetic and he made our camel trek more enjoyable. Request Hassan if you can.Tip: If there are any special requests as in sights, shops or view points to see along the way in addition to the tour plan, let the tour guide know. Omar and Salah were very accommodating and good at addressing our requests. Accommodations: The tent at the Sahara Desert we stayed at was the standard Berber tent, but was sufficient for the quick night stay. It wasn't busy, so my friend and I got a tent all to ourselves. There were bathrooms with toilet seats though the flushing mechanism was not standard. Set up is like a campground. Sinks are available for washing hands, however no soap is provided as that water is just allowed to run off into the sand. Looks like only the toilet waste is collected. If I were to stay two nights in the dessert, I would request the luxury tents. We stayed at the Hotel Babylon Dades in the Dades Valley. It was okay for one night, but I would not recommend staying there. Tip: When booking ask to see if you can select what kind of accommodations you stay at in the Sahara Desert and in the Dades Valley. Based on other reviews there are luxury tent sites in the Sahara Dessert. We weren't provided with options at booking and I didn't bother asking at the time.I definitely recommend a private tour as you have flexibility with timing and plans."

Bear in mind it's only 10 minutes in a big bit of land, similar to pony rides at the fair. Worth it for a 'i've been on a camel' experience, but not a desert trek if that's what you're looking for."

From the moment that our guide Adil and our driver Mohamed picked us up in Marrakech, we knew we were in good hands. The 4x4 car was clean and comfortable and the journey, while long, never felt arduous. ADIL, our guide was an absolute star- he's one of the most genuine, friendly, kind people you will ever meet. He makes the journey interesting as he provides knowledge along the way to break up the long drives. He's so upbeat which is infectious, and we loved his Berber music. He went above and beyond as he really cares that you enjoy your trip, and he really does become like a good friend. Best of all, ADIL was an excellent picture taker. It is so rare to have a guide who knows how to perfectly frame a photo with both a DSLR and mobile phone, it makes it that much easier to treasure the best moments.Our driver, Mohamed, was a very respectful and safe driver who possessed a great amount of knowledge on both the Moroccan landscape, its people, political climate, and every other subject you may think about. While the road-trip may be long (you will average 6-8 hrs of being on the road, no way around it) the sights are incredible. You get to see the landscape transform from mountains to flats, desert to forest. If you're looking for any desert tour in Morocco.If you are doing the 3 day 2 night tour, ask Ibrahim if you can spend the first night at auberge Babylon. Just read the other reviews, you won't regret it.Once you get to the Sahara and get ready for your camel ride, you will be joining some other people from other private tours. It's actually quite pleasant and picturesque to all come together and form a camel caravan to the desert camp. It was great to have a different group dynamic and to meet such nice travelers.Booking and paying was easy thanks to Ibrahim's good communication by email.

It's so relaxing and tranquil and great to just go and sit on the top of a dune and contemplate life. You do spend quite a bit of time in the car but it is certainly worth it. I have even been talking with Ibrahim about coming back with friends and completing a trek in the Sahara."

What an amazing jam packed day you have taking a day trip out of Marrakech into the Atlas Mountains! Lahsan arrived bang on 9am as promised at the reception of our Riad. He guided us through the streets to our transport and talked to us about the upcoming day. On the way we stopped at an Argan Oil cooperative where we could see how the products are made. Then to a traditional market where we could look at the different stalks. Lahsan took us to try some cactus fruit too. Once in Imlil we met our guide Rachid who took us on a walk around this beautiful area and up to a waterfall. We weren't rushed and could take as much time as possible. Lunch was amazing, 3 courses with a great view of the mountains. Again, no rush to get us to finish and leave. They certainly gave us a full days worth for our money!"

We undertook Toubkal as a Charity trek and contacted Ibrahim to arrange transfers from Marrakech, accommodation the night before and the actual trek. Day 1 of the trek is quite gentle but in the words of our guide is \"up up up\" and the many little drinking points were very welcome both for water and freshly squeezed orange juice. The refuge was basic but comfortable and the food served to us by our muleteers was great! The day of the summit was hard, especially starting in the dark and using your phone for a torch but once the sun started to rise there was enough light to continue. I lost all track of time on this day, the views were amazing and made the tough parts worth while. I am not afraid to admit that achieving the summit brought tears to my eyes at my sense of achievement. Ibrahim's service was excellent and his team of muleteers fantastic. I have never laughed so much and it was his humour that kept us going at 5am in the morning on the day of the trek to the summit. Ibrahim is very patient and never left our side when we were navigating the difficult parts of the ascent and descent. If you are new to mountain trekking or experienced then Ibrahim and his team are the ones to book!"

Driving across the Atlas Mountains, visiting Berber villages, having our photo taken in the cell used in the film Gladiator at Ouarzazate, guided tour round Ait Ben Haddou, camel trek into the dunes of the Sahara, night in a tent under the stars, and so much more! Marrakech Day Trips certainly provide you with value for money! All the hotels used are great quality, their service is exceptional, the vehicle air conditioned which is a blessing in the heat of the summer. The staff from Marrakech Day Trips are so professional!

He made sure we saw all that the city had to offer, and the city had a lot! We looked at the various historical sites, museums, public gardens as well as shopping in the souks. The cities vibrant and exotic comings and goings was a wonder to see and be a part of. After our days in the baking sun of the city, we travelled to the Atlas mountains.The atlas mountains can be viewed from the city of Marrakech itself, in one of the many rooftop restaurants and bars, and are quite a sight to behold! The trip to the mountains was one of great exhilaration with the climate, lifestyles and flora and fauna all changing as the trip progressed. We went in the space of a few hours from 35 degrees to falling snow. We arrived in the small and interesting village of Imlil, situated at the foothills of the Atlas mountains. Ibrahim and his family and friends greeted us with a warm tea and we settled in. The snow continued, and the panoramic vistas from such heights were unchallenged. We learnt a lot from our tour of the village and its people. After a few days we arrived back at Marrakech and the heat beckoned us to the shade with a cold drink once more. The trip overall was a great success and one I'd highly recommend to anyone who is looking for something exotic, interesting and full of beautiful sites and wonder! The prices were fair, the experiences grand and the guides superb!!"

He allowed us to have as long trek as we wished to have, his sense of humour made a whole trip really fun and a I smiled the whole time so that I could feel my cheekbones the next day :) The lunch in a village was very tasty and the hospitality of people there was just amazing.

Our guide Ibrahim picked us up some water before setting off and then was very friendly and informative throughout the whole trip.Although the journey was quite long the views along the way made up for it. Over lunch we sat chatting with Our guideand were able to learn so much about the Berber life and Islam as a religion. He was very responsive in pacing the tour with what I wanted to do, I could ask to take photos and \"chill,\" at any time during the tour. What makes this the ideal tour is the operator's attention to details; Ibrahim and Omar treat you as if you are their family, which creates a very welcoming atmosphere. Very cool trip!

My family truly enjoyed the Marrakech Day Trips - Private Day Tour to the Atlas Mountains, and 4 day Sahara Desert Tour, primarily because of the wonderful tour guide, Rachid and Omar. We all agreed that this was the BEST tour we have ever been on.The tour lead us trough several sites and to numerous view points where we stopped. We enjoyed the scenery on the way to the desert, the changing landscapes and especially the colors of the atlas mountains. It's fascinating. The selection of sites were just great! The Hotels chosen to our trip were exceptionally clean and beautiful, even the tent in the desert was like being in a hotel. Breakfasts & dinners included were absolutely delicious! Vehicle was a very comfortable Toyota Prado 4x4. Our camel guide into the desert was friendly and very nice. The time out at the desert was amazing and an absolute highlight of our trip. However, as we had the extra time, we were able to spend an additional day in the desert and we saw how the nomads live as we literally drove across the desert, meeting some of the nomads and having an experience we will never forget. It felt much more isolated than the desert camp we had spent the night at. Our driver, Omar, was AMAZING. He's quiet, with limited English, but sweet - and he is as safe and skilled a driver as I've ever seen. If you plan to drive through the mountains, I would request Omar! Our guide Rachid, had considered becoming a teacher after university, and he truly has the teacher's gift. The hours in the car were tough, but they were made so much less miserable and passed so much quicker because of what we learned along the way. Rachid explained Moroccan history, including the impact of the trade with Tomboctou, the Berber culture, the geography, and colonization attempts and successes, he described the economy and culture of many Moroccans today, especially in the rural areas, he pointed out landmarks and geographical sites, and he walked us through a Kasbah and a gorge, very patient with our requests for stops for photographs. Many thanks to him for all the extra surprises! Overall, it was definitely one of the highlights of our many years of traveling the world and we are really glad that we found Brahim and his great team through Trip Advisor. When I saw all the fabulous reviews about them, I felt confident that they would be great and they were. As we are now wrapping up our time in Morocco, we are so thrilled with every place we have been, the people and the country. The entire experience here has been far beyond what we expected and we are so glad that we didn't listen to the naysayers about traveling to Morocco. We have absolutely loved it and this tour was a big part of us having fallen in love with the country."

The lunch was divine with a beautiful mountain backdrop and a camel ride at the end of the day was so much fun. Thank you Ibrahim for making our day so special."

Landed 1.5 hours later in the spectacular blue mountains. Welcomed with Moroccan whiskey and then we began a lovely hike for 3 hours in and around the Berber villages. Really spectacular. We stopped along the way for fresh fruit off trees and our guide told us loads of history! Lovely waterfall Also! We then stopped at a guest house for an unreal lunch which was fish salad homemade bread (like pizza) and egg tagine along with fruit and homemade yoghurt! Delicious! After we were full to the brim we continued our hike into a Berber home for more Moroccan tea (delicious!) and then we headed home! Along the way we stopped to see how they make the argon oil as well as a camel ride!!!!! Excellent value for money! Lovely people! Ibrahim who emails to arrange everything is extremely efficient! I highly recommend this tour! Thanks so much!!!"

I work for a UK University, and my colleagues and I brought 20 Geography undergraduate students on a field trip to Marrakech and Imlil. Ibrahim was amazing - we couldn't do the field trip without him. As well as helping to book suitable accommodation, Ibrahim liaised with the hotels and hostels in Marrakech and Imlil while we were there. He organised transportation, day trips, entrance to museums, study spaces and some of the meals. Ibrahim acted as a guide while we (students and staff) were 'in the field' in Marrakech and Imlil. His insights into community organisation and governance (in Imlil), city government and planning (in Marrakech), economics, agriculture, livelihoods, custom, history, cultural difference and representation etc were invaluable for our students' learning. But, more than this, he was always friendly and ready with a smile, and on one night in Imlil got a group of his friends together to perform music for us after our evening meal. Great fun! All in all, Ibrahim was brilliant!"

Myself and 3 other friends were on a quick trip to Marrakech, and as our schedule began to build out we didn't have any activity for our middle day in town. We started to look into day trip options here on TripAdvisor and found five tour operators who looked promising, and emailed each to see what they could offer for the very next day. Marrakech Day Trips got back to us in a matter of hours and were able to arrange a day trip to the Imlil Valley leaving the very next morning.The driver arrived at our riad very early and we departed there to Imlil, stopping at a weekly Berber market in a town along the way. Once we arrived in Imlil, we met with our guide Ibrahim, who couldn't have been a better guide to the area. A native of a village perched above Imlil, Ibrahim was kind, knowledgeable and gracious as a guide. We hiked thru the hills above Imili, stopping at a scenic waterfall before hiking to a guesthouse for a delicious lunch. The tour company provided a mule as well that we took turns riding up and down the hills. As mules are indispensable for transportation and agricultural work in this mountainous region, riding one ourselves was a very unique experience!The day wouldn't have been as great as it was, however, absent the amazing job that Ibrahim did as a guide. He embodied all of the great characteristics of Berber hospitality, and we left the day knowing far more about the area and its wonderful people than we would have ever imagined."

To start out, we were picked up from the airport cheerfully & on time. The Riad they chose for us to stay at for 2 nights was amazing. The staff there was very hospitable as well. Our driver from Marrakech to Imlil was named Omar, and he was funny. He let us stop for pictures many times. Omar ended up being our driver for the rest of the trip, and it was fun getting to know him. Two of our party of four did the 2 day hike up to Toubkal. Our guide was Rachid Amzil, and we couldn't have gotten a better guide. He remained patient and positive the entire time. From Imlil we started to travel the rest of the country. Omar was joined by Ibrahim Amzil to guide us. The pair was a perfect fit. They were positive and informative at every turn. Ibrahim had a great understanding of the country's history, along with its quirks and folk tales. He always had a smile on his face.If that is too long and you didn't read, basically Rachid & Ibrahim Amzil are great guides. Omar (never caught his last name) is a great driver. My family & I highly recommend each of them and this company for your vacation."

From the moment my daughter and I were picked up to when we were bought back, we were very well looked after.Ibrahim Amzil is a brilliant guide, he put us at ease from the moment we met and felt we were friends rather than tourist and a guide, we were given a choice of either doing a 1 or 3 hour walk and we chose the 3 hour one which we really enjoyed and it went really quickly,we tried cherries along the way, and to prove the difference in taste between the red cherries and black cherries, he even climbed a black cherry tree and picked some for us to try :-) He was right, the black cherries were very yummy. The waterfall was lovely and refreshing after the heat of Marrakech and the water was really surprisingly cold and refreshing. We stayed there for a while and had a paddle and took some photos.I would like to thank the lady who cooked lunch for us in her home/Riad, it was simply delicious!!!!!! they even catered for my vegetarian daughter, it must have been good as she ate everything including my dessert.The camel ride was OK and it gave us a taste of what it would be like to ride a camel, perhaps next time we would do a camel trek across a desert.Can we also thank you guys for the necklaces and tagine you gave us as presents, it was a lovely momento of our trip.We were glad we went during Ramadan as the walkers trail was nice and quiet and we were the only ones on the trail which made it special, despite it being a tad hot. We did feel sorry for Ibrahm as he couldn't eat or drink, we felt very guilty drinking.I would definitely recommend this trip and if possible ask for Ibrahim Amzil to be your guide."

However what made the day trip special was our guide Rachid who told us a lot about the Berber traditions. He is living in one of the villages there and seemed to know really everyone we met on the street. This gave us a good insight in the all day life of the Berber people there, who are really nice and hospitable. We had a delicious meal in a Berber family home, where we ate outside in the sunshine with stunning views from the terrace. The mother was happy to show us her kitchen and, with Rachid kindly translating, explain how she had cooked the couscous and its accompanying vegetable stew. If your in Marrakesh and want to see more outside the city then don't hesitate to book a tour with these guys. Its a great, small family run business and Lahcen and RACHID couldn't be nicer, so helpful and friendly they picked us up from our riad and made sure we got back ok.! Wouldn't hesitate to book with them again, next time for a longer trip hiking in the Atlas Mountains or a trip to the Sahara desert.

We took two day trip from Marrakech to the Atlas Mountains Imlil Valley and Ouarzazate + Ksar Ait Ben Haddou from the 15th/16th April and we had an amazing time. This is a must do trip whilst visiting Morocco!They both were exceptional journeys! such a wonderful mountain range and lots of beautiful places to stop and take photos. We saw beautiful valleys, agriculture terraces and a waterfall, lots of Berber villages, traditional Argan oil being made, and more...The first day of the walk in the valley was a bit more challenging than I thought. We walked up to the waterfall, a trek not for the unfit! It was so worth the effort and the guide that took us up there took his time to help us up.The meal on the side of the mountain was the highlight. It was an amazing experience.The journey to Ouarzazate & Ait Ben Haddou was a very long day but it is completely worth it to see more of the country than just Marrakesh and close surroundings, there were many breathtaking sceneries along the way. Ait Ben Haddou is definitely one of the must-go places if you have a day for a road trip.Our guide spoke excellent English, knew a lot about everything we came across and was willing to take us to any of the places we wanted to go see and stop along the way whenever we wanted to take pictures.Thank you very much, Marrakech day trips! The day trips with you were definitely among the highlights of my time in Morocco! Highly recommend this tour and make sure you request Ibrahim and Omarl!"

We drove through the beautiful and imposing Atlas Mountains with Brahim telling us about the area and answering all our questions - he pointed out that the pass we were going through had been closed the week before due to the snow! He knew all the great places for panoramic views and offered to take photos of us. It was a bit of a drive but it was broken up with plenty of stops for photos and a mint tea break.Ait Ben Haddou was a very dramatic place with some incredible scenery surrounding it. There are a couple of souvenir sellers in the abandoned village but they are not pushy like those in the Medina at Marrakech. The place has been the setting for many movies and series including Gladiator and Game of Thrones. Well worth the visit. Brahim took us around telling us all about the heritage, he was so interesting to listen to. Lunch wasn't included but Brahim took us to a lovely restaurant that served great quality food and wasn't too expensive.We really felt we got to know all about the country's Berber culture, politics and history with Brahim. If we are going to visit Morocco again we will be sure to book with Marrakech Day Trips again for any other day excursions out of Marrakech. I would love to venture into the High Atlas Mountains more as well. Ask for Brahim when you book your trip - you won't be disappointed!"

Personal fun and informative.In more detail: We (a couple in our early 20s) booked \"Atlas mountains day trip\" for monday the 6th of June and would strongly recommend anyone considering a break from Marrakech for a day to book through this company. We were met by our driver at the door of our Riad at 9.30am and led to a large, modern, clean car. We drove for 45 mins or so before stopping for a photo opportunity and then we were taken for a brief tour of an argan oil cooperative. The woman told us how the argan products are made and explained the uses of the products but there was no pressure to buy anything (a surprise after a few days of the Marrakech souks!). We then drove another half hour/45 minutes into the mountains to the village of imlil. Our driver was very friendly, he explained a little bit about the area and was able to answer any questions we had. When we reached imlil we had some mint tea on a cafe terrace with a good view of the valley. We then met our guide Ibrahim, he told us a bit about himself, the area and how we would be spending the day. Ibrahim is a very experienced guide was incredibly friendly, approachable and knowledgeable. After tea we began our journey further up the valley, we passed a couple of beautiful waterfalls, stopping for photos was no problem, infact he offered to take photos of us both whenever there was a good photo opportunity and we never felt rushed. The pace and route is somewhat customised according your own personal fitness, as a young fairly fit couple we loved clambering over the rocks to get up close to the waterfalls. Again we were never rushed, and definitely never bored! We carried on up through a couple of berber villages, Ibrahim explained a bit about the berber culture and way of life. And again was able to answer any question asked. He seemed to know every person we passed, this somehow made us feel that we were in good hands. Along the way we stopped for a break some freshly squeezed orange juice (again with a beautiful view) and a couple more view points. After a couple of hours of climbing (around 350m, reaching a height of 2000m above sea level) I think we stopped for lunch on a gorgeous terrace with yet another lovely view (please see all of my photos). Lunch consisted of a fish salad to start, a meatball tagine and Moroccan bread, for dessert a huge plate of fresh cherries and watermelon with some yogurt and of course some mint tea to finish off. All of the food was fresh and tasty, leaving us feeling very satisfied. After lunch we wandered back to imlil to meet with our driver, we said our goodbyes to Ibrahim and made our way back down the mountains. Half way, we stopped for a short and sweet camel ride, the camel driver didn't speak much English but was very friendly and offered to take photos of us with the mountains behind us. After another 45 mins drive we were back in Marrakech, our driver was lovely enough to stop off at the bus stop and wait for us to buy tickets (we were heading to essaouira a day later) before dropping us back at our Riad around 5.30/6pm. If you're on the fence about booking an atlas mountains day trip (or any guided trip really) I would strongly recommend....... Although it may seem more expensive than offers by other companies, this trip will me far more personal and I can guarantee it is great value for your money! "

Oh what a delight..The mouthwatering vegetables ,fruit,spices and meat filled the air with a curious aroma.

Myself and my partner Kate visited Marrakech in February and decided before we arrived to book a trip to Imlil and, after reading so many good reviews about these people, booked this online from the UK with Marrakech Day Trips. It turns out we made a perfect choice, everything went smoothly from start to finish, good communication, great service, friendly and helpful guides and drivers and a fantastic authentic Moroccan experience all round.The walk from Imlil was truly breathtaking with beautiful mountains which, when we visited, had snow on the ground, lunch was the best tagine we had on our visit in lovely surroundings with a great view.We both enjoyed our day so much that we booked another trip into the desert to visit Ait Bed Haddou, again this is a must do trip, bit of a long day but worth it just to walk the same streets that people have been visiting for hundreds of years, it was like stepping back in time.These two experiences will stay in our memories forever so my advice is just book up and enjoy your time in these magical places.Pete & Kate Farrow."

We would like to thank you because the last 4 days for us has been amazing!!!!We had wonderful experience with Rachid and highly recommend him for anyone wanting a private tour. Our guide was everything you would want when selecting someone to guide you and explain not only the history of the Berbers and religions but help out with any non-tour related request. When we make back to Marrakech we will definitely look for Rachid. We spend enough time with Rachid we see him as more a friend than tour guide."

Of the two weeks my wife and I were in Morocco, the three days we spent trekking through the Atlas with was by far the highlight of our trip! The scenery is nothing short of beautiful, but it was the beautiful people who really made the trip amazing. Ahmed was a gracious host and went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed. Our guide, Omar, was a pleasure to hike with; he was friendly, informative, and just fun to talk to. The other guides/support staff were equally as friendly and generous (the meals they prepared us were phenomenal!). From beginning to end, we were treated to extraordinary Berber hospitality. We would HIGHLY recommend this trip!"

Ibrahim initally provided us with reasonable tips why to go to Imlil valley instead of the others and we did not regret it one second. Omar (funny driver) together with the other Ibrahim accompanied us the whole day and enabled us to see how the real berber are living. Highlight was the local market (apparently only on Saturdays) and the short trekk up in the mountain. Ibrahim answered all question we had and the tour ended with a nice tromedar trip.

Once for a Geography/Geology trip with 32 pupils and 4 teacher, another time for Cultural/International Education trip for 16 pupils and 3 teachers. On both occasions Ibraheem and his family looked after my group like we were family. The delicious meals were prepared by Ibraheem's mum and her team. My pupils can be picky eaters (they are teenagers after all) and this was the first time most of them have tasted authentic Moroccan food. To my delight every meal was demolished by my hungry team. If you have any dietary requirements let your hosts know and they will accommodate your needs. One of my pupil was lucky enough to have his birthday while we were on the Atlas Mountain - Ibraheem managed to get him a birthday cake baked for the special occasion. The guides employed by the Marrakech Day Trips are very knowledgeable, professional and friendly. They speak Arabic, Berber, French and English. They showed us the best of Marrakesh and best of the Atlas Mountain. We spent most of our time in a small village called Imlil which is the gateway to mount Toubkal (second highest peak in Africa). My experience with Marrakech Day Trips is a very positive one. They were very flexible at organising my itinerary. They are good communicators, any questions and requests I had were answered within 24 hours. Considering the huge amount of work they did to make sure my group was comfortable, well fed and watered, entertained and educated \u2013 I think the service Ibraheem and his dedicated team provides is value for money."

We are a Family of 6 (2 Adults, 4 Children) that went on a day excursion to the three valleys, climbed to see the oureka waterfall and had our berber meal in the beautiful high atlas village of Imlil, booked through this company in early May 2016. I cannot stress enough how helpful both these hospitable gentlemen were. Throughout the day, they went that extra mile to ensure we were all comfortable. Ibrahim personally took us to the top of the oureka waterfall, helping each individual on the tricky parts. The drive through the valleys was breathtaking and mesmerising! What stunning sceneries this part of the world has! They stopped the car for us regularly at scenic spots so we could take those memorable snaps. It all culminated with a totally delicious meal served to us in a traditional berber house in Imlil(with mount Toukbal in the backdrop), after which our children enjoyed mule and camel rides!I cannot stress enough how great both Omar and Ibrahim were with our children aged between 9-14. Honestly, this day excursion to three valleys and Imlil with Ibrahim and Omar was the highlight of our trip to Morocco!. They both treated us as family and I have nothing but the highest praise for their total professionalism and hospitality.As you can probably ascertain from my review above, I would give them the highest recommendation possible. Do not hesitate to book them, you will not regret it and their feedback speaks for itself. Big thank you to both Ibrahim & Omar!!!"

He told us about the locals and culture, helping to take pictures too. He offered to take us further but we are not as fit as we used to be! He tailors the walk to fit the needs of all.

Another couple in the Riad we were staying in had just returned from a day trip to Essaouira and after seeing their pictures we decided that we needed to go! On their recommendation we emailed Ahmed /Ibrahim at Marrakech Day Trips for a quote. He responded within 30 minutes and even popped by our Riad so we could meet him and discuss our requirements with him. What a lovely man, his sense of humour and knowledge was evident from the first moment we met him which made us confident in using his company. His driver, Lahcan, picked us up at 8am the next morning and on the way out of the city we met up with our guide for the day, Rachid. We had asked for Ibrahim to guide us after reading all of the reviews but he was with another set of clients. After spending just half an hour with Rachid we knew that we were in safe hands for the day - it is evident the care that Ibrahim puts into picking his staff. On the way out to Essaouria we stopped at an Argan Oil co-operative and even had a go at grinding the nuts to extract the Argan Oil. Next we stopped to photograph the goats in the trees, that was an funny sight to see. The camel ride we took a long the beach was amazing - this wasn't included in the price but at 50dhs you have to do it. Essaouria is a very charming town and one I would certainly want to come back and visit again in the future. We arrived back in Marrakech at 7pm, tired but having had an amazing day! You certainly get your moneys worth from this company! I saw other companies charging more for less time. Ibrahim rang us that evening to make sure that everything had gone ok with our day which went above and beyond my expectations. You have to use Marrakech Day Trips for your day trips out of Marrakech - they are one of the best companies I have dealt with when I have been broad."

I was so happy to have taken this tour through the Atlas Mountains and out to the various stops along the way to Ait Ben Haddou Kasbah and Ouarzazate . It was truly an unforgettable experience in Morocco. I recommend that you take a tour like this one but it's definitely unforgettable day, so be prepared. My husband and I loved it. It was the highlight of our holiday. Yes the car journey was long, but through the most breath taking views, it didn't feel long to me. The tour guide Rachid was FANTASTIC. He was so knowledgeable. He knew all the best places for pictures and gave advice on where to stop for food and how much we should be spending. He gave us so much information on everything in Morocco, not just what was related to the tour. We asked many questions and he had an answer for every single one. I feel RACHID made the tour what is was and was a fantastic guide. If you like stunning views, a bit of adventure and are pushed for time this day trip is perfect. walking around and taking in the scenic views. The way back was a bit long because it's a 4hr drive back to Marrakech with only a half-way check point to grab coffee and use the toilette. If you have limited time, definitely take this full-day tour, but if you have more time I would recommend a longer trip to the desert. To sum up we were rally happy with this tour."

We then stopped for mint tea at one of the villages before our trek up the mountain, which could be as short or as long as we wanted, with the choice of riding on a donkey for part of it, with beautiful views of the snow capped mountains. We walked through some of the local villages, and stopped for a delicious lunch in one of the village houses, then a camel ride, before being driven back to our hotel.

I was reluctant to travel with a tour guide as I usually enjoy planning trips myself. I had a great experience with this company. They listened to my preferences and planned a very vigorous trip centered on photography. The itinerary covered most of the country and was fast paced as I requested. The hotels and meals were super and well planned. I spent almost no time waiting and wasted almost no time navigating. The tour guide was very knowledgable and kind. As I was traveling alone, I really got to know him which made the experience vastly richer than traveling on my own could have been. Morocco felt very safe and is a truly beautiful country. The food was amazing and more than I could eat each day. I took over 2500 photos of the scenery, architecture and the beautiful people of Morocco. I accidentally bought a carpet and had the time of my life doing it. I would highly recommend Morocco as a destination and Marrakech Day Trips as the company to guide your visit."

The local guide at Ouzoud Waterfalls was very knowledgeable and didn't rush us during the walk. The boat trip was worth the 20 drhm to cross the river and if you didn't want to pay then you could walk across the bridge for free. The restaurant he took us to was friendly, good quality food and clearly priced unlike the centre of Marrakech. The walking or trek to Ouzoud Waterfalls was easy and there have been lots of upgrades to areas to make it more accessible so don't worry about that and just be sensible with your footwear (no loose fitting items like sandals that slip off). The Monkeys were fun and it was great to feed them oranges. All in all, a brilliant day and once in lifetime experience that we won't forget in a hurry!!

We had a go at the grindstone which I imagine would be hard work with hand blisters, so I now appreciate how the oil is made traditionally! We bought some lovely soap/oil, but didnt feel pressured into any buying.Next on to the local village, in total about an hour's drive from the square, where we started with a traditional mint tea and cakes and met up with 2 other holidaymakers for our day trip. This was nice to get to know each other a little before the walk.Ibrahim, our tour guide asked if we wanted a mule, but none of us did, so we walked for hours - stopping whenever we could to see the gorgeous sights, waterfalls and some in-depth knowledge of the local life. We visited the village of Imlil. Our lunch in one of the berber houses at the end of the walk was delicious and so filling, enough that we didn't have dinner that evening!The sights are AMAZING! Ibrahim even jumped across some rocks on the mountain waterfall to get the best shot for us! And what a gent - he carried my sister's rucksack a little way too!When finished, Lassin then took us back down the mountains where we went on a short, fun camel ride.After that we got dropped back to the square, so all we bought all day was some gifts at one of the berber huts on the mountain, which were great quality, and tipped too as it was well worth it. If you took water you didn't need to purchase anything.Overall a fantastic day trip, away from the hustle & bustle of the souks!Ibrahim is so knowledgeable, friendly and caring and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend his trip and if I visit Morocco again I'd love to do the 3 day trek!"

Ibrahim has outstanding English (has a degree in English literature!), very professional prompt email responses & on-time pick-ups for all tours, excellent car service for day tours outside of Marrakech, tailors each experience to your tastes/interests, extremely knowledgeable (we asked A LOT of questions about everything from food culture to geology to economic policy to history, etc\u2026), promotes responsible tourism, takes excellent photos (always nice to get a picture as a couple or family now and then!), will show you the hidden side of the real Morocco, and all at a very reasonable price. On the day itself, Ibrahim and Omar met us at our hotel and drove us out to the Atlas Mountains ( Ourika valley ), stopping off along the way to visit an Argean Oil producer and to cross a rope bridge. They stopped the car for photos of the Atlas Mountains whenever we asked him to and we both enjoyed the drive, they gave us lots of information about Moroccan life and made sure we were happy throughout trip. Ibrahim took us hiking up a waterfall and he was very helpfull. On the way we were able to stop and look at all the beautiful things created by local artisans.The views very amazing, and we really enjoyed just hanging out with Ibrahim and asking him about his culture. The lunch that we had with the Berber family was the best food we had all trip, and just kept coming.

Omar our driver picked us up at 9am in a luxury air conditioned 8 seater and off we went. We booked on a Monday as there is a berber market at Min Ourika on the way.

Then to the Women's Argan Oil co-op which is nice - again tip 20 dirhams to the women then it's up to you if you buy anything or not.

A truly memorable day and Omar was fantastic. A guide will take you up the waterfalls (a good idea and I tipped him 80 dirhams for his time) and you can take all the time you want. Fantastic, memorable and great value for money. Do it!."

            "review": "Amazing Sahara desert experience. Highly recommended company for both desert trek and tour between Fez and Marrakech!! We too found Ibrahim through all the fantastic reviews on trip advisor. Initially we thought he only did camel treks on the Atlas Mountains but upon emailing him realized that he also organizes trips throughout Morocco! He is a super nice guy and really down to the earth. We travelled to Morocco with our two children aged 10 and 12 for three weeks and the desert was the highlight for all of us. Ibrahim organized a 6 day tour for us from Fez to Marrakech. I was not disappointed as my experience with Ibrahim and the team was the best I could wish for from start to end! He tailored the trip to our requirements and gave us the best options in term of transportation and accommodation depending on our budget. Ibrahim and the team are very passionate about their culture and work so they give 100% of themselves.He is so nice and friendly and will get in touch with you really quick. I'm impressed by the moroccan hospitality by moroccan desert tour. Our tour guide Mohamed is professional as he explained many historical facts of Morocco to us. Also, we really appreciate the warm welcome from sahara desert. Chilling and dancing under the stars with the warm nomads campfire song give you another experiences. Camel trekking, sunset and sunrise are amazing!!!!Ibrahim is not a business man, he is a passionate caring person wanting to share his love of the Sahara with people willing to open their hearts to it! He only cares about making the best experience for his guests. That's why the overall experience in reality have far exceeded my expectationsI definitely do recommend to plan your trip with Marrakech Day Trips and will for sure come back for more to see."

            "review": "4 Unforgettable places to go Trekking in Morocco. We opted for a four day trek around the High Atlas through the valleys and it was excellent. Like one of the other reviewers, the cost was less than other trekking companies and as far as I know, did not leave out anything. In fact, for \u20ac200 per person we had a guide, a mule, a chef, 3 nights in guest accommodation with hot showers each night (even a hammam for 20 Dirham pp was available on the last night) - in comparison to other treks that I've done (showers?!!) this felt like luxury. (We were quoted \u00a3350 pp from a UK based company for I think pretty much the same thing).The food was fantastic, thanks to Mohammed our fabulous chef, Shakira the mule carried all our stuff and Rachid our guide was polite, friendly, informative - we had a lot of fun. On average we walked 5-6 hours per day (although longest was 7.5 - we opted to go further to see a waterfall). Generally I would describe the route as moderate (although, of course, that all depends on fitness etc).You don't need to be fit before you come; take the minimum clothes (don't over pack); take walking poles; take the fact you will be in a Muslim country seriously and no vests/skimpy tee-shirts and shorts for women; bring a book(s) to read; try and get as much loose change (coins) in dirhams as you can as in remote places they find in hard to change large notes. I loved the village so much I want to return and assist on projects there. The holiday definitely benefited the local people in terms of money and cultural exchanges but I think we learnt more from them than they did from us! I would have liked to see some way of disposing or recycling of the plastic water bottles which was sustainable but the village is very remote and such things aren't always practical. There was some rubbish mostly plastic, batteries and shoes in the streets but it seemed to be generated by the villagers and the shepherds not the tourists. Anyway - I would thoroughly recommend Marrakech & Day Trips and thanks for the great trip you organized for us and if you ever want to use us as a reference we would be happy to help.All the best and thanks againRachida"

We thoroughly enjoyed the mule ride, seeing the water fall, dining with the locals and the camel ride. This trip is a 'must do' for anyone visiting Marrakech.

Luckily we came across the previous reviews and decided to book a day tour to the Atlas Mountains with Marrakech day trips . This was definitely the best decision we had made since arriving in Marrakesh and our trip to the Ourika Valley was the highlight of our holiday. Well, what can I say that other reviewers on here haven't already! I am another pleased customer and would 100% recommend Ibrahim and his tours to others. We chose Ibrahim and his 1 day Atlas mountains tour based on the recommendations on here and we weren't disappointed. The tour was one of the highlights of our holiday to Marrakech. We felt really comfortable in his company and were impressed with his knowledge and stories- he kept us entertained and engaged all day.He is personable, speaks great English and has a great sense of humour!The meal in the Berber house was something we will never forget - the experience was unique, authentic and so delicious (one of our nicest meals on the holiday).It was evident that Ibrahim cares about the Berber children, the local people and their community and giving something back to the community.He has excellent English and explained so much about Morocco and it's culture, allowed us to fill in the gaps for lots of questions we had about what we had seen so far in our holiday.For around 50 Erou each (for a group of 3), it was fantastic value. Book now and you won't be disappointed."

Ahmed was extremely organised and quick to email and explain possible itineraries for our trip. We are so pleased we got out of Marrakech and enjoyed the time exploring Morocco! We were picked up from our Riad in Marrakech and enjoyed a leisurely trip up into the Berber mountain village of Imnil - stopping to enjoy a local market en route. After the obligatory mint tea we were taken on a short trek to the waterfall and other small villages, with the opportunity to ride on a mule too! The guest house was beautiful and food excellent. The staff very friendly and Ahmed met up with us to discus our visit further. In the morning Idris our driver for the sahara Desert [art of our tour met us. He was keen to share all his knowledge of history, culture and points of interest on the journey. He drove very carefully and negotiated some very interesting roads through the mountains! We could only be thankful we were not driving! The scenery was very varied and we had options to stop to visit towns, gorges, oasisand restaurants for lunch. The highlight was the camel ride over the dunes to the camp in the desert - watching the beautiful sun set.The company organised an excellent visit and an opportunity to see so much of this vast country."

It was one of the best excursions we have done compared to all the other travels we have done all over the world (Italy, Thailand, Spain, India , Istanbul etc). The driver was very funny and kept us entertained. And Omar (our guide) was exceptional. He was very sweet to the kids and answered any questions we had. He made sure we were safe and held my younger son's hand throughout the trek. The Berber people were so sweet and none of the shop keepers pushed us to buy anything. Omar told us that we can look at anything but there is no pressure to buy. The villages were breathtaking and this was an unforgettable experience. Omar made it even more special with his sweet and caring personality. Whoever gets him as a guide here , is really lucky. I would recommend your company to all my friends who plan a visit here and if we ever come back, I will definitely plan excursions with Marrakech Day trips and hope we get Omar.

We also stopped at a traditional market which is nothing like the souks in Marrakech. When we got to Imlil Valley we were met by Rachid who took us to his family home for mint tea and explained what the day would hold. We choose to do a short walk with a mule to accompany us which we took turns in riding. The views were amazing of Mount Toubkal and the surrounding peaks. Rachid explained everything we were seeing and talked proudly about his Berber heritage. When we came back down through the Berber village it was lovely to be greeted all the time by the locals and made to feel welcome. Lunch in a traditional guesthouse was great. I am vegetarian and was worried that I wouldn't be able to eat much but when he met us Rachid asked if we had any dietary needs and therefore there was a lovely omelette style tagine for lunch which was amazing. The views from the roof terrace were amazing and it was so relaxing. After lunch Rachid asked us if we wanted to walk more or travel in the car to see some different villages. On the way back to Marrakech we stopped for our camel ride. This was a great day full of new experiences. It was well worth the money as we started at 9am and didn't get back to Marrakech until 6.30pm."

            "review": "5 Day Combined Atlas Mountains and Sahara Desert Tour - Wow!. My family and I booked flights to go to Morocco (landing in Marrakech) allowing us 7 days there. We weren't really sure what to do when we were there so we carried out some research on the internet and on here. It was quite clear that 2 days in Marrakech would be enough and that we should try and spend time doing some trekking in the Atlas Mountains and also go the Sahara Desert too. We emailed Marrakech Day Trips and a couple of other companies and the speed with which Ibrahim replied impressed us. He was very flexible in terms of the itinerary. We did not feel that we were fit enough to do the 2 day Toubkal Trek during the mountain part of the tour, especially with the children, so Ibrahim offered us a number of alternatives and we decided on using Imlil as a base (stayed in a lovely guest house called Chez Les Berberes) and did some day hikes around the area. The first day we did the hike that is described in the itinerary of the Imlil and Atlas Mountains Day Excursion: we started off walking up to a beautiful waterfall where we were able to stop and enjoy a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice and then upwards again and through a number of small Berber villages with amazing views of Toubkal and the surrounding mountains. Ibrahim was also our guide and took thinks at our pace, laughing all the way and explaining everything that we were seeing. When we returned back through the village of Ait Souka Ibrahim took us to the small reception school where we were able to spend some time with the children in their lessons - this was lovely to see. We were introduced to many of Ibrahim's friends and family as we passed through the villages and on the night he organised for his brother (a local musician) and his band to play some traditional Berber music for us. We then left Imlil and travelled across the mountains to Dades Valle where we spent the first night of our Sahara Desert tour. The accommodation was perfect, Ibrahim really knows how to choose accommodation that will meet the needs of his clients. On the way to Dades Valley we stopped at Ouarzazate Film Studios which was really good to see. The second day of the Sahara Desert tour we travelled to Merzouga via Todra Gorge, we spent a little bit of time walking in this area while Ibrahim told us about the history and what we were seeing. Then it was on to Mezouga where we meet our camels for the camel trek into the Sahara. We were able to leave our backs at an auberge which was very useful and just took what we needed into the desert. The camel trek last about 1.5 hours and the sun was starting to set as we reached the camp. Words can not describe how beautiful this was. Ibrahim choose not to ride the camels but walked with us, chatting all the time, taking photos of us on the camels. Once we reached the camp there was a beautiful Moroccan meal waiting for us. The entertainment for the evening was music and drumming by the staff of the camp, around a campfire. The atmosphere was great and the children had a go at drumming as well. The camp itself was comfortable. I have to admit that I wasn't sure what to expect of a campsite in the middle of the desert but there were proper beds and western style toilets. The silence of the Sahara Desert was strangely comforting as all you could hear was the sounds of the camels as they slept. You could choose to sleep out under the stars but we chose not to this time. The next morning we got up early to see the sunrise and rode the camels on the trek back to the auberge where we able to have a hot shower and breakfast. once refreshed we started on the journey back to Marrakech. The scenery on this journey back was beautiful and Ibrahim and his driver Omar never got impatient with us constantly asking to stop to take photographs. When we reached Marrakech it was quite hard to stay goodbye to Omar and Ibrahim as we had become so close of those few days together. Ibrahim was so generous and gave us all small presents when we said goodbye. He gave the children small geodes with crystals in after seeing how much they like them, my husband a tagine after hearing him comment about how much he like the food and could I cook some at home and for me a beautiful silver necklace. I have nothing but praise for this company and the level of service they provide. From first enquiry, to booking, to being picked up and completing the tour they were on call 24hours a day and went out of their way to make our time in Morocco so special."

Our time in the Atlas mountains was a holiday my partner and I will never forget. Not only was the experience breath-taking, but culturally and philosophically rewarding, as Ibrahim provided insightful information of the history of villages as we passed. It was also humbling for us to have healthy delicious meals and drinks provided daily whilst Ibrahim and the chef went without until after sunrise, as it was done during the period of Ramadan. They never once complained and despite many times Ibrahim going without water for sometimes hours he always remained happy and giving. And this is in itself a testament to the kind of person he ultimately is wishing to give one hundred percent of himself against all odds. I can guarantee that whom ever takes the opportunity to go on a trek with Ibrahim will have been very fortunate. The trek we undertook was organised in a highly professional manner and every guest house we stayed in we were treated warmly and hospitably. I cannot recommend this trek enough and I hope your experience will be as rewarding and life changing as it was for us."

The mountains are beautiful and the trek itself was just the right level of difficulty - training is not necessary but it helps to be relatively fit! Imlil is also a very beautiful place. I am so grateful to Ibrahim, he was such a great guide. He always had a smile on his face and made jokes all the time which was so great during the tough bits of the trek! I learnt so much from him about Berber culture and the mountain region. He was always happy to go the extra mile, show us round Marrakech and Essaouira - he became part of our group and a great friend. I would really recommend his tours to anyone :)"

His knowledge of the culture and history of the areas as well as his vast network of family and friends mean that not only do you get a stress free and smooth trip but you also feel very personally connected into the real Morocco rather than just a tourist passing through. You can't really ask for more than that :-)"

On our drive up to the Atlas, Ibrahim ran through the days activities (Berber village stop, Saturday local market - near Asni? Tea in Imlil, lunch overlooking mt. Toubkal and finally a camel ride) as well as his vast knowledge of Moroccan culture and interesting facts. The whole day was absolutely fantastic and went above and beyond our expectations, the views, the people and the food all brilliant! Ibrahim was by far the most polite, friendly and accommodating guide anyone could wish for. His use of English was second to none and as well as being a local music star (we bought his album at the market!) he was a fantastic guide!"

We eventually agreed on a 7 day hike around the High Atlas Mountains which ended in us completing the trek to Toubkal Summit. The organisation and professionalism of this company was first class!

The schools and disability homes were emotional to visit but great to spend time with less fortunate children that fully embarrassed our company. The market was amazing to experience alone with the apothecary/ pharmacy visit. They offered us herbal remedies and potions that people in morrocco use and showed us different things. On the same day we also when to go see how argon oil is made. Our tour guide organised all of this and the long weekend would have been a bore without him! Great company, very helpful and professional and makes time for everyone. Baring in mind there was loads of us! (I even lost my iPhone and he walked back miles to find it!) we were even invited to his families roof top for a henna party"

He and his driver Omar were there bang on 9am the next day and as we travelled to Imlil they chatted with us and talked about the day, what we were seeing on the way and life as a Berber. Once in Imlil Ibrahim took us on an amazing walk around the waterfalls and villages and stopped to talk and take photos. He was very patient, great company and happy to answer my daughters endless questions! Highly recommend him!"

Ibrahim was very helpful and recommended the day trip to Imlil. I booked this with him.

Within 30 minutes he had emailed me suggestions for a guided tour of Marrakech, arranged a city guide for us and even sorted picking up 2 of my friends from the airport and bringing them to join us. We had a great two days with Ibrahim who put himself out to make sure we were all happy, talking to us about the places we visited and about Islam, Berber life and traditions.

My daughter is only young so wasn\u2019t able to walk that much but Ibrahim sorted out a mule for her to ride and the muleteer (Omar) was very good with my daughter making sure that she was safe. The weather was a little cold so I would recommend layers of clothes at this time of year. After a couple of hours walking we stopped for mint tea in a local Berber home, Ibrahim sat and talked to us about how the homes were made and how the family live. We were made to feel so at home there. After a great lunch we had opportunity to walk around the village of Imlil and go into the shops. The owners were not pushy, they spent time explaining their wares and didn\u2019t make us feel like we had to buy. On the way back to Marrakech we stopped for a camel ride which my daughter loved, again Ibrahim and the camel handler made sure that my daughter was safe and happy. Lots of photos and memories from the day."

We stopped at the Argan Oil Cooperative and my children loved having a go at grinding the nuts and trying to split them. Seeing the goats in the trees made their day! Essaouira is beautiful and I will certainly be back for a longer stay there, hopefully combing it with some of the imperial cities in the future.

Our guide Ibrahim was amazing, he was extremely flexible with us and adopted the walk to our level of fitness which was much appreciated. He was really informative throughout, even introducing us into a few homes in the Berber villages (he seems to know everyone). We also had a lot of fun with Ibrahim and he went out of his way on a number of occasions to make sure we had the best experience. The food was brilliant, we were always given more than enough food (despite being 5 young men with very big appetites) and the accommodation was great too. We came away from the tour wishing we had more time to have seen more of the beautiful High Atlas Mountains. It is worth noting that it is a long and tiring day trip to see Ait Ben Haddou, and having hiked through several stunning Berber villages it wasn't much more impressive than what we'd already seen - In my personal opinion I would recommend spending the time hiking in the mountains."

We will never forget him as our tour guide, and We are going to recommend him and this company to all our friends back home. He was a brilliant and well educated tour guide. I will also comment on Omar, one of the best and nicest drivers I have met. Always helpful, in a good mood and a very safe driver. Moreover - the hotels were excellent and/or cozy and and very well choosed. And the Moroccan food and tea is among the best in the word - we had many memorable and delicious dinners. And - not the least - the price of the tour was modest.1st day: Omar and Ibrahim, our driver and guide, picked us up at our Riad at 8am. We went to the Atlas Mountains, the UNESCO World Heritage Site of A\u00eft Benhaddou (site of movies) , and Rose valley. Most of the stops were just a 5-10 min stop where we would take some pictures of the background. Overnight, we stayed at a very nice hotel with dinner included. 2nd day: We went to the Todra Gorge and we were able to trek along the Gorge for around half an hour. It was a very nice hike with wonderful views of the gorge. Afterwards. Around 3pm, we arrived at the hotel where we would take the camel trek. The highlight of the whole trip was taking the camel trek to the dessert and sleeping in the tent overnight. 3rd day: The last day is pretty much a car drive all the way back to Marrakech. It was a 10-11 hour drive straight with pit stops for washroom stops/lunch break. The experience to spend the night in the desert it's amazing. Don't worry the \"tent\" are very good with a real bed inside so you don't need to bring enything to feel confortable. Only thing the last day of the tour is a lot of driving so if you have the possibility I advice to make the 4 days tour that makes the going back easier.Overall, the 3 days to Sahara with Toubkal guide was perfect, and I wish I had done more tours with them! I'll be sure to book with them next time ( and ask for Ibrahim to be our guide again ), and I encourage everyone going to Morocco to do the same."

Accommodation along the way was varied and good, at two of the locations we had the option to sleep on a terrace under the stars, stunning! Our guide, Rachid was really brilliant and the other team members, Hamid, Hassan and the mules (Shakirah and Rhianna, lol!) were amazing. Everywhere we went we were well cared for and fed. The food was wholesome and filling, although a bit of a sugar overload for the breakfast! Rachid ensured we all felt safe and comfortable and clearly knows the mountains in depth. His knowledge and expertise throughout meant we learned a lot about the region and had a very memorable experience. The entire trip was well executed, professional and fun! My only complaint is that I had to come home. The highlight for me was a fast pace hike with Rachid on the last day to some of the other summits where we managed to make it for the sunrise. A truly magical experience and a site you simply can't put a price on. I highly recommend booking with Toubkal Guide Day Tours. :)"

I have some health issues, so I knew I couldn't do a group tour and I knew that the trip would be too much difficult driving for us to go on our own. The owner of the riad we were at recommended Jamal, and he and Jamal put the tour together for us. It was a little touristy for my taste - under-dressed Americans and Europeans at every restaurant and hotel, but so worth it to see and learn so much of the country and to spend the time in the desert, which is awesome in the true meaning of the word.We had a car and driver, and went from Imlil (a small town southwest of Marrakech) to the Dades Gorges, where we spent a night, then on to the desert, where we rode camels for just over an hour, watched the sun set over the desert, ate one of the best meals we had in Morocco, slept soundly in beds in a tent in a camp under the desert stars, watched the sun rise, then returned to a hotel where we showered and had breakfast, before heading back to Marrakech. Our driver, Adbul, was AMAZING. He's quiet, with limited English, but sweet - and he is as safe and skilled a driver as I've ever seen. If you plan to drive through the mountains, I would request Abdul! Our guide Ridoune, had considered becoming a teacher after university, and he truly has the teacher's gift. The hours in the car were tough, but they were made so much less miserable and passed so much quicker because of what we learned along the way. Ridoune explained Moroccan history, including the impact of the trade with Timbuktu, the Berber culture, the geography, and colonization attempts and successes, he described the economy and culture of many Moroccans today, especially in the rural areas, he pointed out landmarks and geographical sites, and he walked us through a Kasbah and a gorge. He also kidded around with my son and said he'd bring him home to meet Ridoune's family. My son is studying Arabic, and towards the end of our trip Ridoune even helped my son practice and improve his accent. The only real negatives of our trip was the dinner at the hotel in Dades Gorge (Babylon), and one of the lunches along the way. It's helpful to understand that Berbers in the tourism industry all seem to know one another, as Jamal knew the owner of the riad in Imlil and the owner and staff at another riad we stayed at in Marrakech (Dar Zaman, highly recommend), and Abdul and Ridoune seemed to know people at every place we stopped and stayed. It's a genuinely warm and welcoming culture, but you will be directed to shops and restaurants and riads they somehow have ties with!"

Jamal Imerhane organised the trip for us, which was reasonably priced and accommodated all our preferences. His correspondence via email answered all my questions before we arrived in Imlil and put my mind at ease.We were very lucky to have Mohammed Ali as our guide as I cannot imagine anyone who knows the Mountain better. We arrived in Imlil at 1000 to be met by Mohammed Ali who greeted us with a Mint tea and an explanation of how the trek would commence. He organised our mule to carry our bags up the steep hill to Kasbah Du Toubkal, which is where we left the majority of our luggage. We then met our chef for the trek, Mohammed, who was also helpful and provided some amazing meals with his limited resources. He also catered for my vegetarian needs.Throughout the trip, Mohammed Ali was informative, helpful and interesting to talk to. He would sometimes walk with us and give us useful insights into Berber culture, but he also allowed us space to walk in silence when the altitude was hitting us hard or when we were tired. Day 1: Starting at Imlil and finishing at the Toubkal Refuge, this was a moderately difficult walk with a couple of stops at small drinks huts along the way. There was no scrambling and there was a track to follow throughout. At times it was quite rocky and steep but this was not difficult for an experienced walker. The altitude sickness could be felt for some walkers, but walkers who had experienced small bouts of sickness could overcome them once they had a chance to rest at the Refuge before the next leg.Day 2: Be prepared for a sleepless night. This is not due to a lack of comfort, as the Refuge supplied beds in dormitories and a welcome open fire. However, the altitude results in a disturbed night sleep for even the most deep sleepers. We were up at 0400 for breakfast and began our walk to the summit at 0500. We were provided with Crampons as at this time of year there is snow from the Refuge until about 200m shy of the summit. It was amazing walking in the pitch black with just head torches and the stars were stunning. We watched the sun rise and enjoyed the feeling of being so remote. However, it was very cold and very steep, so this trek is not to be undertaken by the fainthearted. Ensure you have additional layers, particularly for the summit which is windy and cold. Be aware that this is a huge altitude to undertake in such a short space of time, so whilst it is not as big as Kilimanjaro, it is tougher.We definitely recommend Toubkal Guides and we would suggest you ask for Mohammed Ali, as he is one of the best guides and kindest people we met in Morocco, and he has exceptional mountaineering experience."

He was very knowledgeable and polite, and really made our trip lovely.In the trip there was lunch included - at the rooftop of a riad in the nearby village. Lunch was delicious, with salad, chicken tajine, mint tea and fruit.Afterwards we walked back to the starting point where the driver was waiting to take us back to our hotel.Overall, we were very happy with the trip and would recommend it."

It's an great opportunity to learn more about people there and how they live. We found it very educational especially for my 10 yrs old son.We then went on a 2 hours hike/climb at the Ourika Mountain. It snowed a few days ago and the mountain was still covered in snow. The track itself is not too hard but with the snow, it got quite slippery sometimes. Thankfully Hassan was there the whole time with us and he helped us climb all the way to the top. It was truly amazing. My son had such a blast climbing the mountain. After a decent lunch, we also went on a 30 mins camel ride. In the past when we rode a camel, we only got to ride around a circle or only for short distance, this time we got to ride for 30 mins and through some beautiful tracks. We've learned culture about Morocco and Marrakech from listening to Hassan during our drive to and from the mountain. It's a very special experience and great tour for us. We would highly recommend Toubkal Guide to all the visitors to Marrakech!"

I was surprised with the level of service and care the guys have given us and would definitely recommend them.One might think it would be cheaper to go on your own and we thought about doing that at first as we do hiking and rock climbing and are generally fit, but it's not easy to find your way on the summit day and I wouldn't do that if you have no experience. We didn't have much experience in mountaineering and were glad to have this option, when you just walk and get fed and guided :) It's also nice to support the local people and what you get is well worth the money.Note: we've also been provided with crampons and ice axes for a bit extra (15 euros), and in winter it was essential."

He brought and fetched us from the most difficult places.The treks (with camelride and night in a Berbertent in the Sahara) were marvelous experiences and Ibrahim is a very professional guide and enthousiastic and proud storyteller about Berber daily life, history, Islam, Marocco and was willing to give answers on any kind of questions we had.

The lunch at the lodge was an incredible treat - a generously portioned and beautifully presented meal served rooftop of a sumptuous inn overlooking an ideal valley. It was also something special to be hosted in our guide Hassan's own home to have tea, cookies and meet his family.You've got to be somewhat agile and fit to do even this relatively short walk. We were fortunate to have perfect weather, and not sure how much more challenge summer heat or winter snow would bring. Our wonderful guide, Hassan, raised and living in these mountains, was obviously comfortable making his way around, leading us quickly and effortlessly as his eyes were down on his phone. I do wish we could have slowed it down a bit, just so that there would be better opportunity for us visitors, who are not as familiar as the guides, to have eyes on the scenery rather than down on the trail to watch our step, and also to take more photos. We must have really dragged, I think, because we didn't even get to take the last 30 minute walk after lunch back down to the village - the car was sent to the lodge for us!This turned out to be the favorite outing for our group during our stay, and I can only image how much more so for other longer or far-reaching treks. Don't pass up this chance to see another of Morocco's many sides, and inquire with Jamal and Toubkal Guides to assist you."

With excellent communication and coordination by Jamal and wonderful guidance from Hassan, our family of 7 adults enjoyed a beautiful day hike around the Mizane Valley, in the shadows of Toubkal. The distance and challenge were just right for us, and the lunch at the lodge was delicious. We also enjoyed a stop for tea at the lovely home of Hassan, with a chance to meet his charming wife and children. This is not an easy hike for novices or anyone with physical limitations, but it's not reserved for the most experienced hiker, either. The Mizane Valley is the sort of place that immediately tugs at you and makes it difficult to leave. In addition to the hike itself, Jamal arranged our transportation all the way from Essaouira, a nearly 5 hour journey. All went perfectly."

Our guide and muleteer were thoughtful and adaptable - providing me with vegetarian meals and slowing the pace a little as we found the trek tough going. There was a great atmosphere in the refuge the night before our summit attempt. Setting off at 4:00am, we summited and were back at Imlil by 4:00pm for the drive back to Marrakech, where Jamal had booked us the traditional Riad Africa for our last night. Overall, a very well organised adventure and I'm glad we were supporting local Moroccans rather than booking through an international company."

The food was tasty and comforting after a day on the mountain, the mint tea sweet and warming. Walking with crampons was a new experience and really helped on the snowy slopes.

When I landed in Marrakech, the airline lost all my climbing gear and the toubkalguide owner Jamal immediately replanned my whole trip to go to the desert first and end on Toubkal once my gear was found and returned. My guide Ridouane and driver Omar were both excellent. I was able to see, do, and learn so much more in Morocco with a professional guide and driver than I would have ever been able to do by myself. The Toubkal climb itself was strenuous during the snow and ice segments, but SO worth it for the sense of accomplishment and the incredible views! My guide Ridouane was very fun and knowledgeable and I felt very safe both on the mountain and in the desert. My toubkalguide itinerary included overnights at amazing riads, lodges and Berber camps during the climb and desert trek. I recommend toubkalguide.com very highly, you won't be disappointed!"

Arranging a birthday trip for my hubby who is \" the expert\" when it comes to organising trips , was to say at the very the least , daunting. I had decided that not just wanting to tour the Souks in the Medina , or loll around in the Riad , a tour outside the Medina was needed. With just 3 days to spend I only needed a day tour. Trip advisor gave me all the info I needed and I booked a day tour to the Valley and Waterfall with Toubkal tours. Toubkal driver and guide Mohammad were a class apart . So knowledgeable , friendly and professional. We were picked up at the taxi pick up point within the Medina. Driven in a very comfortable jeep firstly to a women's co op for Argen Oil. We had a demo here and an option to buy if one wished , but no pressure. Then tea in a most novel \" river\" cafe !! ( an experience in itself) Then on to the foot of the mountai at the end of the valley, here Mohammad took over . I walk with a stick but even through the treck was a bit of a challange for me , I felt totally safe and like a piece of precious cargo with the attention given to me by Mohammad. He was encouraging , kind , attentive without being overbearing. The trip up the mountain to the waterfall is an experience for the senses and soul. The views are fantastic, but it was the resourcefulness demonstrated by the village/ mountain people who had stalls along the way that one couldn't but be impressed by. Again no pressure at any of these stalls to buy . But I couldn't come home without purchasing a small alabastair night light burner. We were also blown away when one sees the sheer physical work that is going in to build a beautiful Artists studio half way up. The mules bring the building materials up in saddlebags and all the building on the 3 storey cliff studio is done by hand..... No cranes or lifts up here! The views at all stage were fantastic but nothing quite prepared me for the sheer beauty at the top,& the fantastic sound of that waterfall. Back down again , once we reached flat ground again a lovely well deserved lunch was served again at one of the river cafes . At the end of an eight hour trip , we arrived back to the Medina and made our way to our Riad dar Justo , truly a little oasis away from the madness of the Medina. A welcome Hammamon followed by drinks and dinner on the rooftop terrace listening to the \" call to prayer\" being transmitted from the surrounding mosques one felt truly transported into what is the\" Marracheck Experience\"Thank you Toubkal Tours for a truly 5 star experience ."

In the next day, as muslim we praying our eid mubarak and celebrating at Imlil village together with the local berber, thereafter we preparing our stuff for 2 days trip in order to reach jebel toubkal. During the way to the refuge camp, which was our first stop, we walked through the mizane valley, then cross onto the shrine of Sidi Chamarouch, then continue east and by crossing the flood plains our route takes us along mule tracks and up into the high rocky cliffs above the valley, which provided stunning views along the way. After 8 hours walked we eventually arrived at refuge camp and spent one night in the tent under the millions of star. In the early morning (at 03.00 am) we made our attempt to jebel toubkal, the highest peak in Northern Africa. We had our breakfast, checked our tools, and did not forget to pray. We had rainy and windy morning to climb the top of atlas mountain. Our route takes us up the south cirque, crossing the stream above the refuge. The walking is relatively straightforward, but the scree and the altitude will make the going quite difficult in parts. It was not easy to find the path, but we made it slowly but sure because we have an incredible Mohamed our local guide, without his companion our trips was not possible. Moreover, the views along the way make the journey more than worthwhile. After the strenuous effort to conquer the cliffs, we barely made it to the summit at the sunrise. In front of us the clouds slowly lift up to reveal the beauty of atlas mountains. Literally shouting \"INDONESIA BISAAAA\" (We are from Indonesia, anw), no hyperbole or exaggerate involved. Standing behind the peak point of toubkal watching clouds and sunrise, letting our imagination run wild. This is why we all come here for, to witness such majestic view only very high mountains can give. We really grateful for the amazing journey that managed by toubkaltrip and also credit to our guide Mohamed for never stop motivating and encouraging us to reach the peak. Mohammed is really great guide, indeed. In addition, we really enjoyed our trips, among other things we also have valuable experienced and learnt a lot from our local guide includes, the berber culture, nature, tradition, food and language.

Jamal from Toubkalguide was my contact person. I organized the trip from South Africa via email, and Jamal was informative and helpful all the way. We got to Morocco - started in Casablanca for few days then took a train to Marakech - and the pick up was waiting for us as promised - really great! The transport system is good and atmosphere is generally safe.Jamal organized Mohammed to be our tour guide. He was patient and supportive to us. The climb can be done without a guide, but I would rather have. They carry 1st aid, know the route very well, they are local etc. We wouldn't have made it up there without his encouragement! We had our chef - Hamid cooking for us. The food is different yet we liked it! The climb was ok but got challenging as we got tired. If you are fairly fit - you will be fine. I have never done so many lunges in my life. My thighs and glutes are happy. Must do's: get a mule to carry bags, the walk is really long! - dress comfortably - it may be hot during the day - just remember it will be freezing & windy up there. - dress warmly the night of the summit. - have gloves, torch & have a walking stick, sunblock, and a jacket with a hoodie! If you are sleeping in a tent - expect to pay 20drh at the camp to have a warm shower.We started the summit at 2h30am. Yes, WE MADE IT to the summit at DAWN - we caught the sunrise! We got there around 7am.Expect the climbing down to be just as challenging and hard; knees, back and ankles will start acting. The guide showed us how to step properly on the rocks to avoid injuries. However- expect a slippery fall or two - it is slippery on the tiny rocks- you must have that walking stick. I came back with a few bruises- but it was all worth it!What an unforgettable awesome fulfilling experience for us. The achievement on its own is priceless. We were tired - very tired but it was all great! \u263a\ufe0f It is doable - Go for it!"

With another person joining us (a couple), we were cared for perfectly by Rachid (mountain guide) and Hamid (cook and muleteer). Due to the weather up-mountain, we stayed in the mountain refuge instead of in tents. After our return to Imlil at the end of day 2, we stayed in a lodge in Imlil (dinner and breakfast included). After a 9 am pickup by Redouan (desert guide) and Omar (driver) - who were perfectly on time ;-) - we spent one full day driving through a spectacular landscape. With just us in the car, we could stop whenever and wherever we wanted. We were cared for perfectly! We did a 1.5 hr camel ride to the Berber tent camp. Our guide Redouan joined by foot, and offered to take our pictures, with an amazing result! Be prepare for a hot night in the tent! Because we had to take an early bus, Redouan made sure that we left on time and helped us - after breakfast and a refreshing shower - to get our bustickets. Only downside was with the payment, which we had to do in cash, after Paypal didn't work on Jamal's side and we were too late for a regular bank transfer. This became more complicated because we didn't meet Jamal in person. However, all in all, we had a very good experience booking through Toubkalguide, with friendly, caring and knowledgable guides throughout the trip!"

Lesson learnt.. never judge a mountain by its height! I'd like to thank Jamal immensely for having organised our trip and giving us the best guide;Ridouane,to ease the climb and guide us through the steep edges! Ridouane... ur really the best! Thank you for all.your effort on and off the mountain! Hassan our mullette and Abderahim our driver were also as amazing and hospitable! Anyone planning on summiting Toubkal, I'd highly recommend Toubkal.guide. through Jamal. Make sure u ask.for Ridouane! ! All the best!"

The tour was really well organized. The driver came on time in a comfortable air conditioned car, the guide was friendly and spoke very good english, the food was tasty, most of our stuff (except our water and camera) were carried by a donkey (which appeared to be well looked after), so no heavy things to carry. In general, it was interesting, comfortable, safe - I would recommend."

Our guide in Imlil for the hike in the foothills of the mountains was Mohammad Ali who was excellent - supportive, informative, funny and friendly. We would highly recommend him. We were booked into the Imlil Lodge for the night but, following a wonderful lunch in Imlil Kasbah (also owed by Jamal) we took up Jamal's offer to stay there instead - see separate review.

Our two guides were very polite and knowledgeable about the local area. We were picked up at our hotel in the morning and were allowed to stop off on the way to the valley to experience multiple other small sights that we weren't expecting. One stop included a traditional market (nothing like what you'd find inside Marrakech) which was great to experience. When we got to the valley we were met by another guide who took us hiking. He was great company and very informative about the local area and cultures. The guest house we stopped at for lunch was lovely and the balcony view has to be seen to be believed, it was that beautiful! Being a vegetarian I wasn't sure if I would be able to eat the lunch but they were about to make me a vegetarian tagine which was huge! We both felt fit to burst by the time we left. Overall a great day out and we'd both like to come back to do more hiking over multiple days next time! and made everything to make our time memorable!"

Booking was easy and Jamal answered all of my questions quickly and with helpful details. The organizational elements of the hike (transfer to and from Imlil, hiring of sleeping bags etc) went exactly as planned \u2013 no small achievement for Morocco. Abdel picked us up at 8am from our hotel and we drove to Imlil where we began our hike, we collected sleeping bags there and loaded up the mules. It was really straightforward and we were hiking in no time.The food we ate along the way was great \u2013 fresh salads and delicious tagines on the menu throughout our three days, which was much better than we had anticipated considering we were camping. There was also fresh mint tea on offer day and night, and good snacks. Abdel was very knowledgeable about pretty much everything in Morocco and we learned a lot about local plants, animals and culture. It was much more than we could have ever taken in through guidebooks, and it really added to the experience. He also tailored the whole experience to what we were interested in and planned the days so we could see and do things we had told him about.I would highly recommend Toubkal Guide to anyone thinking about hiking Toubkal. Abdel was a brilliant guide and I wouldn\u2019t change a thing about the whole experience.Tenemmirt! (Thank you in Berber ;) )"

This was an extremely well organised trip, from a highly professional company. They helped us out renting the winter equipment (crampons etc.) that we needed to climb. All went very smoothly. Our guide Ridwan was superb. He was friendly and knowledgable but most importantly a very experienced climber. This meant that we were really well supported on our climb - he knew exactly what pace to take us at and we made it to the top even through I'd been really worried about my fitness. It was quite an incredible sight from the top! I don't think I could have done it without his help! The rest of the trip was excellent - we saw a lot more of the area than if we had tried to do it independently, which we were grateful for. The night in the desert was excellent and enjoyed the camel trek too! Everything was extremely smooth and well-organised, and the places we stayed in each night were really lovely. We felt very well taken care of. You could probably find it all for slightly cheaper through other organisations but it was absolutely worth the money for the amount we were able to do, the professionalism of the company and the truly excellent guide! I wouldn't hesitate to use their services again."

            "review": "three day trips in the mountains. Jamal's company was recommended to us by our friends, and at first we booked two day trips: one to the Ourika Valley, and one to Ouarzazate and A\u00eft Ben Haddou. We didn't like Marrakech itself (crowded, noisy and dirty - I guess that's what other people might instead call \"vibrant, buzzing and authentic\" - it just wasn't for us), so travelling into the mountains was a wonderful respite. We enjoyed it so much that on the second day we asked to have a third day trip, this time to the Imlil Valley.These were all private tours just for the two of us (we are a young married couple). At first we thought the prices were a bit high, but having compared it to other companies, and given the very high quality of the service, I think it was a good deal. On all trips we were accompanied by two people: a dedicated driver and a guide. All guides we've met spoke multiple languages with English ranging from \"just good enough\" to \"excellent\". (But if you also speak French, you'll have no problems whatsoever.) They were very open to questions and we learned a lot from talking to them about the country, the people and the culture! The trip costs covered almost everything, including lunch but excluded drinks at lunches, some entrance tickets - but these were minor expenses.In Ourika Valley, we had a very enjoyable hike/climb to the waterfall. Make sure you have proper shoes - the rocks are slippery and you do have to actually climb up a ladder at one point. There were a couple of places, which in Europe may be considered on the \"dangerous\" side, but otherwise the climb wasn't too strenuous and the guide was always there to support us and show us the best way. We really enjoy nature and outdoors and this hike was definitely time well spent! After getting back to the village we started from, we had a very nice lunch, and afterwards went back to Marrakech.The second day was certainly the highlight of the trip. We started at 7am in order to cross the High Atlas and reach Ouarzazate before lunch. We visited the Atlas Film Studios (was a bit of a disappointment) and then quickly passed by the Kasbah Taourirt for a photo. We didn't go inside as we asked instead to see Kasbah Telouet on the way back, which is quite similar but definitely much more impressive (and less touristy). Even though this meant we would arrive back two hours later than planned (because of bad quality roads at Telouet), Jamal and his people were very accommodating to our request to see Telouet. Before Telouet, we also visited A\u00eft Ben Haddou, which was amazing (just google some photos!). We had lunch there but the restaurant we were taken to was sadly not very good (a very touristy canteen, really - avoid L'oasis D'or, if you can). It was a lot of driving but we saw so much of incredible nature and stunning Kasbahs that I would definitely recommend this trip if you only have one day!The third day we spent in Imlil Valley, where Jamal owns the Imlil Lodge. We hiked for a couple of hours through the local countryside with amazing views of snowy mountains, a waterfall and local villages, and had a very tasty lunch on top of the Lodge (again, with amazing views!). A great day to enjoy nature, see how people in the countryside live and relax.Overall, we were very happy with our trips and if we come to Marrakech again, we'll definitely book more trips with Jamal! (Maybe a few days in the desert next time?)"

Yes, you can get cheaper trips up Toubkal, but why save money on a travel company if the price already offers value for money and you get a good bed in a nice hut with a nice meal and no surprises.. So I say: go with Jamal and Toubkalguides. Is there no room for improvement: yes there is: Ibrahim, please, one extra rest (if only for 10 minutes) on the final ascent of Toubkal would have made the climb a little easier for me. But you did a good job on the whole!By the way: going from sea level to nearly 4200 meters in a day and a half is probably too much regarding the acclimatization proces. It's possible but you don't sleep well in the hut and you'll go slow to the summit....."

We did two days trekking to summit Mount Toubkal, long days (16 km on day 1 and 23 km on day 2) but our guide was encouraging and kept us going through the difficult bits. The scenery was breathtaking and we stayed in a good refuge with hot showers.The last three days of the trip were very memorable, thanks mainly to our wonderful guide Ridouane. He was courteous, fun and well informed, and went above and beyond to make our trip special. We visited the Dades valley, Ait Ben Haddou, Todra Gorge and went on a camel trek in the Sahara. Thanks to the organisation of our trip, I would recommend Toubkal Guide to anyone wishing to explore Morocco."

Food and tents were provided - we opted for the tents, but there are options to stay in refuges along the way. There's small outlets selling water and snacks there, so no need to worry about bringing food - and the food was great - hot meals & salads with bread and hot mint tea. Whole experience was wonderful and very well arranged."

Lasin, our driver picked us up from the riad at 9am and we drove to Imlil. On our way there, he showed us famous spots and shared good information. Our trek began at Imlil and MohammedAli, our guide was great!! He let us stop several times to take pictures and made sure we were comfortable. The scenery was beautiful and it took away all the stress and tension from within. Lunch was at Imlil Lodge and that was delicious with great views of the snow-capped mountains. After lunch we were served mint tea and then we headed back towards Marrakech. On our way back we stopped at one of the feminine co-operatives where we were showed how they make Argan oil and its products. We even bought a few to give as gifts back home. The entire day was amazing and I am so glad we chose this excursion. A truly memorable experience!!"

            "review": "Two day desert trip - Fantastic!. GOOD VALUE - Expensive for Morocco, but worth it to have a private and personalised journey. Most tourists get caught up in large tourist buses. Considering we had an experienced English-speaking guide, driver and mini van, 150 euros for two was great. HIGHLIGHTS - Film sites, Zagora, conversations with our guide, local village, Sahara and night around the campfire. THE JOURNEY - We departed from Marrakech, visited Zagora and embarked on a camel trek to the site of our overnight stay in the desert. Everything was organised in advanced via email. Jamal was great at English and provided all necessary information without prompt. In Marrakech, our English-speaking guide picked us up at 7am from our riad. He then took us to our mini van that was driven by a seperate driver. Both were lovely men, we had great conversations in the van and over lunch, and they were mindful to stop us in the best locations for photos. Our guide also took many photos for us and often joined in. We also stopped in a small town for dates. This was extremely interesting as it was off the tourist route and I was the only female on the street full of men. Our guide was great at English and generally a really interesting person. Knew the history of the area as well as a lot about the film production that took place in the region. As he knew we were interested, he also made time to stop us at the outdoor Atlas Film Studio. Once we made it to the edge of the Sahara, our guide dropped us off with the young boys who ran the camel trek. Our camel trek was short, only 30 minutes, but it was lovely to journey through the small sand dunes during sunset. On the other side of one sand dune was a circle of Berber-style tents - our campsite for the night. When we arrived, we immediately felt that it was quite touristy. However, as our guide had explained, on such a trip to the outskirts of the Sahara, a group campsite to accomodate 20 guests amongst small dunes was all we could expect. However as we settled in, we quite liked the campsite. We had our own large tent structure, and the campsite had quite comprehensive bathroom and shower facilities. Soon upon arrival we were served a tajine and soup, in a restaurant-style tent. After dinner, was possibly one of my fondest memories. We all sat around a campsite and enjoyed singing and drumming by some of the boys who ran the camp. It was a beautiful site and sound. Early in the morning, we departed on our camels and met our guide and driver. That final day was largely spent in the van and we drove quite quickly back to Marrakech. We ended up tipping our guide 30 euros and driver 20."

We did a 3 night trek through the Atlas Mountains, staying each night in a Berber village. Everything went smoothly from the planning of the trip through the hike. Jamal was very responsive to my email questions, and was able to accommodate requests such as renting sleeping bags and starting on a particular date.We were picked up at our Riad, right on schedule, and driven to Imlil, where we met Jamal, our guide Cheddiri, and our muleteer/cook Hassan. We loved our trek; it was the trip of a lifetime. We hiked each day until mid to late afternoon. The hike itself was challenging but very worth it, as we saw gorgeous mountain scenery and Berber villages, many of which are inaccessible by car. Each day we stopped for a delicious picnic lunch made by Hassan. We stayed in gites at night, which are very basic guesthouses. Hassan produced delicious dinners: tagines, couscous, fruit, veggies. His breakfasts were good too.Cheddiri was a great guide. A guide is needed, as these are not marked trails. Cheddiri speaks very good english, and was a fun and interesting companion. One day he asked around a village and we had tea in a family home. The woman gave us bread and tea - it was a highlight. We were lucky with the weather the first 3 days. But the last day we had terrible weather; it rained, hailed, snowed, and was windy. I needed LOTS of help from Cheddiri. It was slippery and I was nervous. I don't think I could have done it without his help.After we returned to Marrakech Jamal arranged a day trip for us to Essouira. Again, everything went smoothly and we had a great day."

He stopped when we wanted to, we didn't go to the market but did go to the Argan Oil co-operative, at no time were we forced to visit, it was entirely our choice. When we got to Imlil we met Mohammed our guide who was excellent, he was very knowledgeable and answered all our questions. There was quite a pace, but am sure you could go slower. Lunch at the hotel was served on the terrace in the sunshine and there was lots of food! It was one of our favourite meals in Morocco. All in all a great day out and highly recommended!"

We were then introduced to our guide for the walk, Mohammed Ali. He spoke English really well, was very obliging, friendly and happy to proceed at a pace suited to our level of (un)fitness. We felt very comfortable with him. The walk was fairly demanding and took about two hours but it can be tailored to suit people's needs. We had several stops for photographs, which Mohammed was happy to take, and had a break at a mountainside cafe for mint tea. We then made our way back to the village and into the Riad. We enjoyed a splendid lunch of salads, chicken terrine and fruit followed by coffee. Mohammed the driver then collected us and drove us back to Marrakech. I am really pleased we chose this trip. A day in the mountains with fantastic scenery and people provided a wonderful contrast to the hustle and bustle of Marrakech. It was well worth the price and I highly recommend it."

We got to see all of the sites we would have seen otherwise, just at an accelerated pace. Our guide, Ismael was FANTASTIC.

But I would say that you need to allow 3 days for this trek: one to get to mountain refuge (allow 6 hours) from Imlil village, day 2 for attempted assent and descent (allow 9 hours) and stay at refuge again to recover, then day 3 return to Imlil village. It was very rushed as we did whole thing in 2 days and it was something of a race back to village before we lost light! What I would say is that the guides were very safety conscious on the trek, and dropped us off at our riad in Imlil . Beautiful views and the best tagine I tasted in Morocco."

We slept overnight in tents at the Toubkal refuge which was very windy so we didn't get much sleep before waking up early in the morning to summit for sunrise. The trek was hard work in the dark, against strong winds and with the altitude but our guide encouraged us and made us feel safe.

We did a 5 day trip from Marrakech to Dades, Merzouga, the Sahara desert and Ait Ben Haddou and the last day back to Marrakech. It was a wonderful and relaxed journey through the fascinating changing scenery of the Atlas Mountains. Our guide Abdellah was multilingual and very knowledgeable, and could answer all our questions along the route. The Atlas mountains, the Berber culture and Morocco in general has a really interesting history, and with a knowledgeable guide the journey became so much more than getting from a to b. Our favourite guesthouse of the trip was Riad Les 5 Lunes in Dades, where we received first class treatment and home cooked food from Daoud and his wife Fatima. It was the end of Ramadan, so it was a wonderful atmosphere in the village preparing for the annual fest. The next morning moving on to Merzouga, all shops and restaurants along the route were closed due to the festivities. We could see people dressed up in their best clothes on their way to celebrate, but the regular village life was gone for the day. This could have ended up as a long journey with nothing to see, but it turned out great, as our guide Abdellah went out of his way to organize a visit to a friends house. We were invited to join the traditions of tea and cookies with family and neighbors, and got a glimpse of how the locals do it. Arriving in the Sahara, we were to stay at the hotel for that night and go out in the desert to stay there the next evening. Sleeping under the stars in the desert was an experience worth the long journey from Marrakech. The wait in the hotel in advance was a bit long though, as it was really hot and not much to do in the heat. It is not easy for women to swim in the pool without drawing unwanted attention to one self, so cooling off in the pool was not necessarily a pleasant activity. I am not sure if it is an option, but I would recommend going straight out to the desert and stay there for the night, then move on the next morning after arriving back from the desert. No point hanging around in the heat. The last stop was Ait Ben Haddou, with its famous old Kashbah. This is an historical place and part of the city Ouarzasate, known for its film industry. I would have switched the day in the desert hotel with time to explore this city more. It seemed very interesting. All in all, we really enjoyed our trip. With our guides making sure we were ok and driving us safely around, we could just relax and enjoy the beautiful Atlas Mountains."

Leisurely drive into the mountains in the 4x4, just myself and partner. Guide was waiting and we set off at a good pace. Basically the trek was an 1 1/2 500m climb followed by a 400m descent then along a river bed until we stopped for some pastries and mint tea. After 30/40 mins we climbed up another 500m to a second pass for a stop/rest and then down to Imlil and the riad for a late lunch. The lunch was great, and Jamal took us back safely to Marrakech. All in all a great escape from the city, a good, tough trek that made us feel we had exerted ourselves rather than an easy stroll; fantastic views and experiences seeing the villages in the mountains. Guide (Mohammed Ali) was very knowledgeable but not intrusive which suited us. Also the pace was challenging, but again, this suited us and if it was too much I am sure he would go slower. So just what we wanted and impossible to fault."

The arrangements were excellent from start to finish. Drivers and guides were always on time exactly as arranged, all of the vehicles used were modern, clean, spacious 4 x 4s, our visit to Tin Mal and walk in the mountains were exactly as we'd requested and the guides who took us were local people who had grown up in the area so knew it well and were able to answer all our questions. Our accommodation was arranged by Toubkal Guide and was amazing: in Marrakesh we had a stunning house in the medina five minutes walk from the souks, with three good-sized bedrooms with ensuite bathrooms, wood and stone floors and tasteful Moroccan furnishings, a courtyard with a plunge pool, and a huge roof terrace with a view across to the minaret of the Koutoubia Mosque. In the High Atlas we stayed at Imlil Lodge, run by Toubkal Guide (I think), where we had spacious, characterful en-suite rooms, wifi (coverage is fine in the communal area downstairs but patchy in the rooms - but considering it's in the mountains we thought it was pretty good) and really tasty food (soup and meatball tagine for dinner, and Moroccan salad and chicken tagine for lunch - both accompanied by bread and fruit - all delicious). The staff were courteous and helpful (they let us use the kitchen fridge to chill some beers and wine we had brought with us, to enjoy on the roof terrace!); when the time came to leave, our transfer back to Marrakesh was on time as always, and provided by none other than Jamal, owner of Toubkal Guide. It was an amazing trip and incredibly good value - can't recommend them highly enough. (As if the trip itself weren't enough: on the drive back to our final stop we asked Jamal for advice regarding buying a tagine, as we were nervous of being sold a 'tourist' version that would break when exposed to heat. He said the best guarantee would be to get a used one, to be certain - we laughed and pointed out we would be unlikely to be able to get hold such a thing, but thanked him for the advice. He had arranged a driver to take us to the airport on our last day - when he arrived the driver handed us a carefully wrapped tagine (which proved to be perfect - scrubbed clean but clearly previously used and so assuredly heatproof). There was no charge - it was a gift from Jamal... truly personal service!)"

My wife and I booked with Jamal, from the UK, to do the Imlil Valley trek followed by travel to Taroudant the following day via the Tizi-n-Test road. This was by far the best experience of our 2+ weeks in Morocco! The Tizi-n-Test road trip wasn't one of the standard options on the website so I communicated with Jamal by email and he was very responsive.Abdul punctually arrived at our riad in Marrakech, as arranged, and our trip to Imlil began. He had quite a new air-conditioned Hyundai 4x4 for the whole trip so the journey was very comfortable, even when the temperature outside was around 40C. Abdul was very friendly, he encouraged us to let him know when we wanted to stop to take pictures and was very knowledgeable when it came to answering our questions about the local area, and Berber/Moroccan culture.When we got to Imlil, Mohammed took us for the trek, he too was very friendly and helped us along tricky parts of the route. He even got us a souvenir walnut or two from a tree when we asked him! There was the option to go on a more demanding route at the half-way point but we chose the easier option as my wife got tired. Mohammed was very encouraging and played along when my wife joked with him about not being able to walk any further. The valley itself was a bit touristy at popular spots, especially at the waterfall.After the trek we went to Jamal's Imlil Lodge guest house for lunch. Here we had our own private dining room at the top of the building, with a wonderful view of the mountains. The food was plentiful and the chicken tagine was probably the best we had in Morocco. We met Jamal here, who collected our payment. After lunch we met Abdul again, who took us to Ouirgane and the hotel we had booked for the night. On the road we passed Kasbah Tamadot, Richard Branson's place in the Atlas mountains where Abdul had previously spent many years working at, so we popped in for a cold beer and cocktail in spectacular surroundings, which was very welcome after the trek. It was interesting to find out that Abdul had personally driven Mr B and other high-fliers too.The next day Abdul met us at our hotel, again punctually, for the second, and our favourite, part of our trip. We travelled from Ouirgane and along the winding Tizi-n-Test road to the ancient Tin Mal mosque; one of only two available for non-Muslims to visit in Morocco. Abdul was again very knowledgeable and explained various aspects of this interesting ruin to us. We then continued our journey to the highest point of the road where we had a good but simple lunch at La Hotel Belle Vue; the views were breathtaking along the journey, and needless to say, quite stunning while we ate. The Moroccan salad was very good, and the watermelon, which I guess was locally grown, was probably the best I've ever tried! I usually find it quite bland but this was refreshing and sweet. It was surprisingly hot here, at an altitude of 2000+ meters.After lunch we continued our journey to Taroudant. When we got there our riad was quite difficult to find but Abdul very kindly asked some locals to ensure we got there safely. Earlier we had mentioned we needed bus tickets for our journey the following day to Agadir, so after we found the riad Abdul even took us to the ticket office to buy them!In summary, I would recommend using Toubkal Guide because all the staff seem to be very friendly, and go out of their way to ensure travellers thoroughly enjoy themselves, and have no problems along the way. If possible, I would also recommend doing a journey through the mountains and not just the trek."

Once we continued on our way, we started to climb the mountains & the winding roads made my stomach churn a bit, but we were soon at the village that would serve as our starting point. The trek led us through Berber villages and ultimately to a guest house where we enjoyed a delicious lunch on the rooftop terrace. On the way back to Marrakech, we even stopped to check out the nearby reservoir. Jamal went above and beyond to allow us to get the most of our day, and we highly recommend making it part of your Moroccan itinerary."

On the way we picked up our guide Hassan who throughout the day was extremely nice and engaging.

All in all one of the best days we spent in Morocco and will definitely use this company again in the future."

We got picked up from our Riad and set out on an hour drive to a small village of Imlil. There we met Jamal, our guide Mohamad and our mule drive/ chef Ahmed. We packed all the bags and things we didn't need onto the mule and set off up the mountain. We walked for about 2 hours and then we stopped for lunch, worth noting, on the trek we had the best food we'd had the entire week in Marrakesh. We then walked for another 4ish hours, stopping whenever we liked for a rest. Was a relief to arrive at the refuge where there were toilet and shower facilities and places you could sit around playing cards or just chill. After dinner (which was very very tasty) we went straight to sleep because we started the trek the next day very very early. We walked about 8 hours the second day- up to the summit and down the mountain, stopping at the refuge for lunch. The views from the top were incredible and it was really worth the hard walk. I have never climbed a mountain before and have a very average level of fitness for a 20 year old girl and managed to the top without much difficulty. Had a great time and sitting in the tent drinking tea with the guide and chef who were celebrating the end of Ramadan was definitely a highlight of our time in Morocco."

We only had 4 days on Marrakesh so we were keen to organise an excursion into the mountains before arriving. We booked through Jamal, who was always very quick to respond and provided excellent information of the day. We were picked up from our hotel at 8 am and driven to the starting point. On the way the driver showed us sights and stopped upon request to take pictures of the beautiful mountain views. We met our guide who provided us with snacks for the trip and we were able to get extra water. We walked for over an hour until we reached the first mountain pass. Along the way our guide told us lots about the local Berber villages and showed us Mt Toubkal. Upon reaching the pass the views were breathtaking. I was able to take a 360 panoramic photo of the unspoilt view. They only other people we saw were two local villagers taking their loaded mules across the mountain. We then made our way down from the pass seeing a falcon and a snake. We then walked along a dried river bed seeing Berber houses and watching a young boy herd his goats. Our guide explained the crafts and agriculture in these villages. Following this we began a steeper climb to another pass (there was an easier climbing option but we fancied the challenge). After scrambling up the side of the mountain, we reached an adorable cafe hut where we enjoyed some freshly squeezed orange juice whilst admiring another magnificent view. We climbed down the other side, which was equally as beautiful, until we reached the guest house in Imlil. We enjoyed a delicious lunch of Moroccan salad, tagine and fruit with plenty of mint tea. We requested a vegetarian meal in advance which was no trouble. We spoke to our guide about other excursions on offer which sounded wonderful. We wished we had more time because the experience was so fantastic. We were picked up by the driver and taken back to our hotel. The whole experience was thoroughly enjoyable. We both agreed it was the best day of the holiday. We were so well taken care of and everything was organised for us. I would definitely recommend using this company for day trips or if you have more time the longer trips. I hope we will be able to visit again for one of the longer trips soon."

There are other companies that offer similar excursions, however they do not always have great reviews. Jamal was very quick to respond to any emails and was very flexible during the booking stage. The trip was highly organised. A driver was waiting for us at our riad in Marrakech to take us to Imlil. From there we met our guide, Mohammed, who was absolutely brilliant! The trek itself is very fast, as you climb to a high altitude very quickly (i.e. climbing from 1500m to 4100m in less than 24 hours), so if you have not been at altitude for a while prepare for some difficulty towards the 3 - 4000m range (having climbed at this altitude before, I did not anticipate that the speed of our climb may cause lightheadedness/other symptoms). Needless to say it is not too difficult to reach the summit, and the views are amazing! All food was provided along the way, and there were plenty of places to buy water (including at the refuge). On the return to Imlil, the stay at Jamal's guesthouse was a perfect place to relax!The trip to the desert via Dades is a long hot drive (just looking at the map of Morocco does not make this clear, as a lot of the roads are slow mountain passes), however Jamal provided a very comfortable 4x4 to take us there. With tiredness from the trek, we found that day 3 of the trip was long and not as enjoyable as it could have been, so we did not really appreciate the gorges. However, arrival at the Sahara was well worth it. The hotel was a great place to relax before riding the camels, and the trek itself was amazing. Climbing dunes and sleeping under the stars is an experience not to be missed - just remember to take many bottles of water with you, especially in July!!!Overall we thought this trip was great, very well organised, and would highly recommend booking through Jamal, who will take care of everything!"

Throughout the four days we struggled to finish our food - because there was just so much of it, freshly prepared and delicious - no wonder the other trek staff wanted to hang out in our tent!Our accommodation was of a consistently good standard, with plenty of homely and traditional Berber hospitality included.

            "review": "Perfect trek culminating in classic ascent of Toubkal. I approached Jamal via e-mail to arrange a bespoke trek based on an itenary I put together to maximise the limited 5 days we had available. Because it was doubtful the passes would be clear, Jamal proposed an (equally acceptable) alternative but as it happened when we arrived my original plan was viable (first time this year). I was visiting with another keen mountain walker and we had asked for something a little more challenging. We were introduced to our guide, Mohammed, who not only looked and acted the part of a true Berber mountain man, but spoke fluent English too! and not to forget our mule and muleteer / cook, Abdul.Our route took us over high passes, through old Berber villages, and ended each night with a camp. Food was abundant (too much for lunch really as we are light eaters) and very tasty, served up in a variety of places complete with mint tea served from teapot on a silver tray!We finally climbed Jebel Toubkal in a concerted push from Lake Ifni, by then having acclimatised well to the altitude. At all times Mohammed had our safety and well-being in mind - these mountains are not to be taken lightly as much of the terrain is very steep on loose scree, and once away from mule trails you are very much alone. On the last day Mohammed took me up another nearby mountain called Jebel Ouanoukrim (4088m) which involved some nice grade 1 scrambling with lovely views back over Jebel Toubkal.I cannot recommend this company more highly - from start to finish everything was well organised and the people courteous and friendly. The guesthouse (Imlil Lodge) is also very nice, albeit a 20 minute walk from the town up a steep road! Additionally, the whole trip was exceedingly good value for money. We plan to return in the winter for more ascents."

He stopped whenever we needed to stop, kept up a great pace, and he was really helpful when I was struggling to stay on my feet during the descent (lots of loose rocks). We slept in a tent at the Refuge in sleeping bags that we rented from Jamal - they were very warm and worked out just fine for us. Food throughout the trek was very good. We opted to stay at the Imlil Lodge a night before and a night after the trek, and I thought that was a good choice for us, as we were never in a hurry and felt very relaxed. The only thing is that after the descent, you have to walk back to the Lodge, so it is still about an hour of walking through hilly villages after you've come down the mountain! A bit draining mentally, but the whole thing was really a great experience!"

            "review": "Awesome trip. We had an amazing 2 day trek up Mount Toubkal and I just wanted to let anyone who was thinking of using this service know that it couldn't have been better. Here's a rundown of what to expect with some tips along the way.We got picked up right at our hotel in Marrakech in a very nice van by a very nice driver who spoke excellent English. During the two hour trip to the small town of Imlil, where we were to start the trek, he offered interesting tidbits of information about Morocco and the towns and sites through which we passed, very fun to hear about. Once we got to Imlil we were brought to a small cafe where we met Jamal, the owner, our guide, Hassan, and our mule driver/cook Muhammad. They were all very polite and helpful, and over a nice cup of mint tea, gave us a rundown of what to expect. We settled the payment for the trek (which was what we had agreed upon over email and a very fair price in my opinion), stocked up on water at the local store, and got on our way. My wife and I are in our early 30's and are in fairly good shape with lots of hiking experience. I'd say it was mildly strenuous but was what we were expecting and really not bad at all, quite pleasant. We probably hiked about 5 hours total at a relatively leisurely pace, maybe 10km or so with about a 1500m elevation gain, and had a nice lunch/tea break halfway at a small town/shrine. We got to the base camp/hut with plenty of time to rest, enjoy the sites, get cleaned up (there are showers though they get crowded so we didn't bother), before sitting down to a great meal cooked by the mule drivers...harissa soup, tons of couscous and vegetables and big chunks of meat...a perfect pre-summit dinner. There was about an 80-person English group staying at the hut, but we stayed in a tent outside. Actually much more preferable since the hut was dormitory style sleeping...we had a private tent which was much quieter. Only small problem was the wind started whipping for about 2 hours and the altitude (~10,500 feet) also made it somewhat difficult to get a good nights sleep. Not much you can do about that though. We got up at 4am, had breakfast and left by 5am. This day was a lot different then the first, and an order of magnitude harder. The hike to the summit took us a bit under 3 hours...we were going pretty fast and I would classify it as very strenuous. The \"trail\" was mainly boulders for the first half of the climb...I don't mind them but my wife had a hard time navigating, especially in the pitch dark with just a headlamp. The boulders were occasionally broken up by gravel-consistency scree which was also very tough slogging. The bits of actual trail were very welcome and once we passed the boulder field, it was mainly trail the rest of the way occasionally broken up by steep rock outcroppings. The last hour to the summit was difficult to say the least, apart from the altitude, it was extremely cold and windy. I'd guess close to freezing temperatures with a wind chill factor making it 10-15 degrees colder still. I was actually feeling great. No altitude sickness other then sucking down wind, and the exertion kept me pretty warm despite having given my wife my heavy fleece jacket...I only had on a very light fleece shirt, a light wool hat and light wool gloves. My wife on the other hand was miserable...freezing cold and shivering despite having on a light fleece shirt, two heavy fleece jackets, a wool hat, and ski gloves. The severe altitude sickness she was feeling also much have been a contributing factor to her level of coldness. Extra warm clothes and a windbreaker would have been a good idea.  (Note to husbands and boyfriends...don't tell your shivering, altitude-induced nauseous wife/girlfriend how great you're feeling.)We spent about 20 minutes on top before heading back to basecamp...by the time we were in basecamp all altitude sickness and coldness has dissipated and we both crashed in our tent for about an hour and a half before having lunch and heading back down to Imlil. Took about hald the time to get back since we were booking it, but for me, the last leg from basecamp to Imlil was the hardest part of the hike. I've always preferred going uphill since my ankles and knees have always given me problems. I was in a fair amount of pain by the time we got back but I did make it and enjoyed the whole experience nonetheless. One more recommendation, I was only wearing lowtop hiking shoes, and had no poles. I would highly recommend poles and high-topped hiking boots, they would have REALLY helped the descent for me...no aching ankles and knees. In total, I would classify the second day as extremely strenuous, one of the harder days of hiking I have done and I've done quite a bit. I really enjoyed it but if you are expecting an easy jaunt to the summit, be prepared for a difficult day and 2-4 days of extremely sore muscles afterwards. My wife did not quite expect this level of exertion, and while lounging at the hotel pool afterwards said admitted she did enjoy the entire experience, that was not the tune she was singing when she was dry-heaving from altitude sickness with the entire return hike ahead of us. Anyways, that's the nature of these types of adventures and I will say Hassan, our guide did everything in his power to make her comfortable...going at her pace, taking numerous breaks, holding her hand on the steep parts, and even going so far as to give her his winter gloves when her wool gloves weren't doing the trick. Really cool move, thank you Hassan. Anyways, this was a fairly long review but I had a great time and wanted to share my experience with everyone who is thinking of doing this. These guys made the whole trip nice and painless (well the parts in their control) and I would recommend this to anyone who is in decent shape. Just be prepared, bring plenty of warm clothes, a good headlamp, windbreakers, good hiking shoes, hiking poles, and if possible, get a prescription for Diamox (Acetazolamide) for the altitude. Thanks Jamal, Hassan, and Muhammad!"

Our guide Mustafa and mule driver / cook Ibrahim were very friendly and helpful thoughout.Be warned that Imlil is at 1700m above sea level and the walk goes over passes at 2400m. This was high enough for one of our party to be affected by the altitude, and she arrived with a tummy bug (which I want to stress was therefore not the fault of Ibrahim). The effects were that she had trouble catching her breath when ascending, trouble sleeping, and was violently sick.The accommodation is basic, as you would expect at these prices in a mountain area, but that did not help when faced with frequent visits to the toilet all night. All the staff were very kind and helpful, doing all they could to make her feel better and less embarrassed by the situation. Mustafa changed the itinerary entirely to suit, including spending the second night in a different and better appointed hostel.So our experience was not a wholly good one. But none of the problems were in any way the fault of the organisers or staff. I, who was not sick, brought away some lovely memories of the walk in the mountains.If you have walked at these altitudes before without problem then this is highly recommended.

Jamal organised for a driver to pick us up in Marrakesh and take us to the village of Imlil which is where our trek started. Once there he introduced us Mustafa who would be our guide for the next few days. Mustafa was great and good at guaging what we wanted to get out of the next few days. The first day was around 5hrs of walking to the refuge - there was limitted hours of electricity and relatively basic sleeping (bunks) but couldn't really complain that far out the mountain particularly since it looked like a ski chalet and they lit a roaring fire and served good food! After a nights sleep we headed up to the summit on day two- this was a tougher climb but worth it for the incredible views. Just make sure you take enough warm clothes - we did it in April and it was still around -5 at the top! Having sumitted and returned to the refuge the plan was meant to be to stay there for another night before returning to Imlil on our final day. However, after having an hour's rest and some lunch we decided we'd prefer to keep moving and Mustafa / Jamal were great at being flexible and re-organising. We ended up going down to one of Jamal's guesthouses about 3km from Imlil. Jamal organised everything so all our main packs and bag we'd left in Imlil before leaving for the trek all arrived at the new destination. The guesthouse was beautiful - right in the middle of the valley and I hugely recommend it! A driver picked us up the next day and returned us to Marrakesh. A great trip and would definitely recommend Jamal to anyone wanting to do a trip around the Atlas- it was our best thing for our visit to Morocco!"

It was easy to organise with a couple of quick emails - Jamal responded almost instantly and it was all set in no time. Our driver Mohammed was cheerful and chatty, and recommended stops at a few extra points along the way for photos etc. Jamal met us when we arrived at Aguersioual to check we were okay before setting off, and met us again when we made it to Imlil for a delicious 3 course lunch. Our guide Hassan was lovely - he started off really quiet but was friendly and full of interesting information about his local area once we started chatting to him. We're regular walkers but not regular hill walkers, and the pace on the ascent to the first pass was pushing us a bit. Well worth it though, for a fantastic day in a beautiful part of the High Atlas."

We had lots of email correspondence with him before booking and Jamal couldn't have been more helpful. Jamal arranged for transport from our hotel to the start of the walk and back again. Our guide, Hishan, was a delightful young man who was extremely knowledgeable about the area and a pleasure to spend the day with.The walk itself was challenging in places but thoroughly enjoyable. Hishan provided a picnic lunch on the way and we were given a delightful meal at the end of the walk.We paid a slight premium as there was only the two of us, but it was worth every penny. You can choose to join a larger group to bring the price down.We had a fabulous day walking in the mountains and would highly recommend Jamal and his company to anyone."

We were 4 women trekking and could not have felt more comfortable and cared for. From our first night at the charming Imlil Lodge in the fun \"family room\", which has three sets of bunk beds we were made to feel at home. Our guide up the mountain, Mohammed was phenomenal. He met us the night before the trek to talk over what we would need in our back packs for the first day and what we could put on the mule. He discussed the plan for the day and answered any questions. Then for the next two days he was an impeccable guide. He paced our speed, suggested when to break, when to keep going, and ultimately set us up for success. He also turned out to be our awesome chef while at the refuge. I have several food allergies and he went above and beyond in the middle of nowhere to accommodate me. We watched quite a few parties trek without a guide and we felt thankful to have Mohammed with us- he knew which paths up the mountain were best for our level and he never gave up on us (like we saw some other guides with their parties). Never once did we have to worry about accommodations, food, or planning, Toubkal Guide Day Tours had it set! I'm thinking next up will be a trek through the Sahara and I'm going to book with Jamal and ask for Mohammed as our guide!"

The service was good albeit the waiter could not understand us ( english or French). The breakfast was nice as were the dinners. The picnic was very basic although did the trick! Our guide Hassan took us on 3 days of trekking and with his knowledge of the area was really able to take us to some stunning places up to 2300m. Thankfully we are fit as this would not have been ideal for someone who was not. You definetely need good walking shoes as there are some hairy moments!! He was brilliant at helping my wife when the hills got slippery and was always there to help. He even took us to have tea and breakfast at a local house which was a wonderful experience we even met his family on the way! A great guide and we would definetely recommend him although we would say he needs to be prompted to offer information. Sometimes there would be lots of silence but when asked was able to offer information. I would say that this is slightly pricey for what you get although a very enjoyable 3 days."

Jamal always replied fast to any emails and the information was very useful.When we arrived in Imlil, Jamal introduced our guide, Hassan. It turned out he was a great guide! He had a lot of knowledge about the area and the trek and he was good at adapting to our needs when it came to pace, breaks etc.Hassan suggested to get up early on summit day, to get on the mountain in time to see the sunset and after an early morning we got to see the sunset from Toubkal - the view was amazing and we were really pleased that Hassan got us up there in time for the sunset! The third day was flexible and several trekking options were laid out and we ended up doing a shorter walk in the valley and around Imlil - definitely also worth a visit to see the waterfall.We can definitely recommend this company and try to get Hassan as a guide - he is really good."

Our tour guide turned up early to our riad to pick us up, he seemed really polite but not very conversational. I thought maybe it's a cultural thing. As the tour progress he rarely talks and even when we tried to make small talk, he didn't get much response. The reason I gave this a 2-star is because I expected to hear and learn about the local history and I didn't get anything other than the transportation and a chaperon who led us the trek in virtual silence. The lack of conversation was so awkward that I was actually looking forward for the tour to end. At 60 EUR per person the price was steep for this type of service.During our trek we saw some other people who self-organized and came on their own. In hindsight we probably shouldn't waste the money on this tour and just spend it on car rental so we can visit Imlil Valley and other places nearby on our own."

As we left Marrakech, the scenery as we got closer to the valley with views of the Atlas mountains was beautiful. Hiked for around 3 hours before having an \"ok\" lunch (we were the only guests and I'm a vegetarian so perhaps a tad uninspiring for the chef?) we then ambled back to the pick up for our drive back to the nearest drop off point for our riad. Ismal was good company and adapted the route to suit our needs and was also happy that I wanted to visit the Argan oil cooperative before we departed. Basically it was whatever we wanted to do for the day. Once we had left the village, where our driver had dropped us off, we saw no other tourists - just locals including a few friends who were pleased to see Ismal! It is a lovely place to hike with the snow capped mountains within touching distance. The trees and blossom were just starting to come out when we were there (mid March) and in a couple of weeks will be even more spectacular. The only gripe was that I wish we had booked for a couple of days not just one!"

Our guide, also Mohammed, was a star! Encouraging and supportive and able to set a pace that worked for two people twice his age. Near to the top of the first pass, he said we were doing well because most people do the walk in 2 days, not 1! That aside, the scenery was spectacular and we passed few other people on the trail. Like other reviewers have noted, don't fill up too much on the pre-lunch snack (which is hard not to do because you will be very hungry!) We didn't get to the formal lunch place until 3 and weren't able to enjoy the meal because we had a dinner reservation for 8. So much depends on how fast you can do the two steep climbs! Overall, a first rate experience that we wouldn't hesitate to do again."

I asked for a long day walk in the Atlas and Jamal suggested the Aguersioal day hike. We were picked up on time in a clean and serviceable 4 wheel drive ( very necessary!) Our walking guide, Mohammed set a pace that we were comfortable with and was friendly and put us at ease by talking about the scenery and the Berber way of life. As we were walking with him for 5 to 6 hrs we had lots of opportunities to ask lots of questions about life, politics, religion,culture, farming etc in this area of Morocco. His English was very good and we felt that we learned a huge amount. This to us was half the pleasure of going with a guide as we wanted to learn about the `Moroccans. The route was hard work uphill in places, but the scenery and the villages we walked through were amazing and worth it! Mohammed had packed a picnic which was gratefully eaten about half way round. We finished at a lovely Riad with a very welcoming host who had cooked us a magnificent Moroccan meal! ( Don't over indulge in the picnic or else you will not manage the meal!!) You do need to have good walking shoes/boots and if you are worried about steep ascents/ descents, walking poles, water, and a windproof as it can be quite cold high up ( we walked through snow!)If we went back I would use the same company again, they are first rate!"

Our cook Ibrahim2 as we called him was lovely n he cooked delicious meals for us. The drive to Sahara was very long (spent 8-9 hours both the days on road) n had we known that we'd have spent extra days in the mountains instead. Would not really recommend doing the desert for a night. Would highly recommend Jamal and his company for the treks. We are seriously planning to go back and do the toubakal :-).

Guide's English was good. Both drives were quite scenic and about 90 minutes each. Imlil walk thru Berber villages was quite interesting. Really unexpected OUTSTANDING lunch at Jamal's guesthouse. Easily the very best chicken tajine we had in Morocco. Beautiful views overlooking the valley. I thought the scenery going to Ourika was ever so slightly better. Short walk thru Berber village, more of a tourist village, then a trail and a rock scramble up to the waterfall. There is quite a bit of scrambling. You need to have pretty good balance. The other possible problem: We went on a weekday in Dec. when there was a short transportation strike that morning. There was still a bit of congestion on the trail/scramble. You can't get that many people up/down at once. I would be concerned about going there on a prime time weekend visit. We had lunch immediately next to a small stream. I was amazed at the number of chairs/restaurants next to this stream for at least a mile up/down the river. Almost all were empty when we were there. I just don't know how the waterfall trek could accommodate so many people as to fill the available seating. The tour was supposed to end between 4 & 5. We got back at 3. I guess Jamal allows an extra hour or two for congestion. I liked Ourika slightly better for the scenery but you will need to scramble to reach the waterfall; be sure not to go when it's going to be real busy. With Imlil you get a better initiation to a Berber village and views of the Toubkal peak. The Ourika village is more a tourist stop. It's not why you would go on this tour, but the lunch at Jamal's guesthouse was SO, SO GOOD. I would happily have go back to eat there many more times."

It was nice to have the guide and driver to ourselves and did not have to wait for others before we moved on. The guide was knowledgeable in response to questions.

Jamal took us to a few different locations, each incredibly spectacular and the main one being the Cascades which were amazing. Jamal arranged for a lovely lunch and as we were walking around told us about the places in great detail, as well as making sure we didn't get tricked into buying things from the local hawkers. Towards the end of the trip he also took us out to visit a women's co-operative in a nearby village where they make argan oil by hand, which was a really nice end to the trip before taking us to Marrakech.I would highly recommend Toubkal tours, well worth the price for a pleasant, interesting and stress free trip around the country!"

            "review": "A good day's trekking. We booked our trip from the UK before going to Marrakech. Jamal responded quickly and efficiently to our queries and the booking. We were picked up promptly at 9.00 from our riad by our guide, Hassan, and a driver. The vehicle was brand new so it was very comfortable and safe. The journey to the mountains was about an hour and a half and, whilst not always pictureque, it was interesting. Our trek through the mountains was not too arduous but you do need to wear decent footwear (e.g. trainers not sandals). The views were lovely and we had plenty of opportunities to take photos. Hassan was happy to answer any questions. The lunch was excellent with some of the best Moroccan food we ate the whole time we were there. We were returned to our Riad by about 4:30.Overall, a good day out. If we were to return to Morocco we would definitely take one of Toubkal Guide Tours longer, multi-day, tours."

He always was very responsive and was very clear and informative.When we got there we were introduced to our guide, Mohammed, who was a real character. He smoked a cigarette as he told us that finished 4th at the Toubkal trail race last year, which is a 100km+ ultra marathon race from Imlil to the top of Toubkal and back. He also nonchalantly mentioned that he stopped smoking a week before the race so he would be in shape. We don't consider ourselves unfit (we had both done marathons before) but we were clearly no match for Mohammed.The trek itself was amazing, helped by good weather. We met lots of people and had a lot of fun. Mohammed and our cook took good care of us too. All that for a very decent, honest price, which sometimes I find a rarity in Morocco. I would totally recommend these guys to anyone thinking of climbing Toubkal."

I had booked a nine tour with Toubkalguide starting with a trek up Mt. Toubkal the morning after my arrival. When the airline people said my bag would arrive in Marrakech the next afternoon (after I started my trek) I told myself: \u201clike Bilbo Baggins in The Hobbit, you are on an adventure. Adventures involve both good and bad things!\u201d Fortunately I had reconsidered while packing and put my hiking boots in my carry on (having almost experienced this in Ecuador last year) so I had boots, pants, socks, underwear and some outerwear. However, I did not have the sleeping bag I had so carefully chosen and packed. No matter. Jamal took care of everything. When my friend and I arrived at the Refuge at base camp (10,500 feet) our tent was set up and I had a wonderful fluffy warm sleeping bag. I bought a hat on the trail. My friend decided not to try the ascent so I borrowed another coat and gloves from her. It was glorious to reach the summit! But this review is about Toubkalguide. Not only did they help me with gear I lacked, when I got to the guesthouse in Imlil (after three days in the same clothes) my checked bag was there! Jamal made the effort to get the bag for me at the airport and have it transported to the village so it was there when I returned from the trek. I felt like it was Christmas! (I also learned it is amazing what you can do without while traveling). From Imlil we headed to the Sahara. Our tour was a grand number of two: me and my friend. We had our own (nice) car, driver and guide. Hicham was our guide up and down Mt. Toubkal and to the Sahara and back. He did a fantastic job and was very helpful on everything from where to find an ATM to local customs to geographical and social history. He (and our driver Mohammed) hung out with us and we all laughed a lot. We felt more like favored aunts than clients. After the rustic accommodations at the Refuge (co-ed bathroom with two showers and Turkish toilets) I was thrilled by the rooms and amenities we had at hotels along the way. In the Sahara I expected to sleep on a tent floor with a blanket but we had a sectioned area with pallets and little pillows and the toilets were western style stalls built on a platform with lights that came on when you opened the door. Wow. This trip was an amazing value and a great adventure. I highly recommend Toubkalguide for a day tour or a nine day tour like we did. Just be sure to put your hiking boots in your carry on. And remember, attitude is everything!"

It was absolutely spot on! They made sure we did a trek suitable to our standard and we had a fantastic night in a mountain village gite before returning to Imlil lodge, which is lovely. The camel trek in the dessert was really well organised and all really really fun! The whole trip went off without a single glitch and was very good value for money.

Jamal responded to all my queries very quickly, arranged for us to be picked up in Marrakech and that was some 4 months before we arrived in Morocco. So the big day for our days trek in Toubkal arrived. The driver was on time and we drove out to meet Hasan our guide for the day. Hasan is fantastic, really knowledgeable and very friendly, what i particularly liked is that he paced himself with us, i was the slower one! We walked through the most stunning scenery for about 2 hours, the sky was so blue and the air so clean. We then stopped for a superb lunch of salads, olives, breads, fruits and tea whilst sitting on the roof top terrace taking in the amazing views. We then left to walk back down to the village stopping off at the womans Argan oil co-operative where the process was explained and the oil was so much cheaper than in the souks of Marrakech. The trek was so well organised and Hasan really was a fab guide. We hope to return next year to hike to the mountains sumit."

Jamal replies to emails really quickly and can accommodate your requests. Our guide, Hassan, is the best! We all truly enjoyed his assistance and company \u2013 he is from the local village, speaks great English and is very pleasant to share the experience with. Remember your warm clothes (hat, gloves), hand warmers if possible, a head lamp (you start the ascent before the sun goes up) and SPF. It is best to bring a backback in addition to your bigger pack. You put the bigger pack on a mule which walks a fair distance in front with its guide, so if you need something along the way (water, hand sanitizer, tissues, money for drinks and curios, etc.) you\u2019ll need to carry it on you. You meet up with the mule and its guide at points along the way, though. You can either sleep in tents or in a hostel at the base of the ascent, both which Jamal can arrange. It was quite chilly in October so I opted for the hostel but the trade-off is that it can be quite noisy since it contains several (narrow) bunk beds in a few rooms. The central lounge area is nice but toilet facilities are basic. You can buy chocolate, chips, soda and some other snacks at the hostel, but I didn\u2019t see any clothing or other supplies up there."

Our guide Mohamed visited us in the evening before the the trek in our hotel and clarified every detail of the trek. The first day we walked from Imlil 1740m asl to Toubkal refuge 3207m asl. It took us about 7 hours. On the way we had tasty lunch at Sidi Chamarouch prepared by our cook and muleteer Zouhir. At Toubkal Refuge after next delicious meal we spent a night in a tent. As a night was rather cold Mohamed and Zouhir arranged extra blankets for as which was very helpful. Next day after early breakfast we started at 5am. After 5 hour walk we reached the summit of Jebel Toubkal 4167m asl - the highest peak of North Africa. The weather was perfect sunny, no wind and not too cold and views from the top were breathtaking. We had a simple meal with hot mint tea, made a lot of pictures and 3 hours later we were back at our tent - exhausted but delighted and fully satisfied.Next morning we walked down to Imlil in 5 hours and our mountain adventure was unfortunatelly over.We are very pleased with trekking with Toubkal Guide. Jamal - the owner of the company replied very quickly for our emails and answered all our questions prior to the trek. He was present at the beginning as well as the end of our trip ensuring everything was OK. Mohamed Ali - our guide is the best mountain guide we have ever met. We hadn't been able to reach the summit without him. He was for us like a guardian angel.Zouhir prepared for us delicious and hearty meals and put up our tent. his mule Scooby Doo carried our heavy backpack.Big thank-you for Jamal, Mohamed, Zouhir and all others involved in preparing of our trek.

Toubkalguide.com proved to be an excellent choice. Already from when we first made contact with them, the owner Jamal Imerhane was helpful and quick in responding to our emails. All necessary information is also readily available on their website.We had booked a two day ascent of the Jebel Toubkal, and were picked up in Marrakech and driven to Imlil, which is the starting point of the trek. The trek was well organised, with our two friendly and knowledgeable guides Mustapha and Ali, who were helpful and attentive. From our guides we learnt a lot about Berber culture and life in the mountains. Our meals were prepared by our cook and was tasteful and nutritious. In fact, this was some of the best food we had while in Morocco! We successfully reached the summit of Jebel Toubkal, and thanks to a well organised trek, it was a great experience!The second part of our tour was to the south of Morocco, and the town of Merzouga and the Erg Chebbi sand dunes. Our company on this trip was our guide Omar Imerhane and our driver Mohammed. On the way to the south, we crossed the Atlas mountains and entered the desert regions. It was great to see the landscape change from mountains and green valleys, into sand and desert. We spent one night in a desert camp, and rode out to the camp on camels. A tip, if you wish to really experience the desert, would be to allow more time and ride deeper into the desert to really get away from the other camps in the area. Our guide and driver, Omar and Mohammed are great guys, and very good company. We learnt a lot about Morocco\u00b4s history and culture, but also about the life of modern day Moroccans. Mohammed was also a good driver, and we never once felt unsafe on the road. On this part of the trip, we stayed in hotels with en suite shower/wc.We can highly recommend booking your tour with Toubkalguide.com. Morocco is a diverse and fascinating country with friendly and hospitable people. Jamal and his staff made us feel welcome and safe, so that throughout the duration of our trip we always felt well looked after. Jamal is experienced in organizing tours and can be flexible, to accommodate your requests.We\u00b4d like to send a special thanks to Jamal, and our two guides on Toubkal, Mustapha and Ali, and also to Omar and Mohammed who was great company on our tour to the Sahara desert. We hope to travel with you again some day, \u0625\u0646 \u0634\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 ."

We did not get to the summit as we had camped in tents at base camp the night before and could not sleep at all during the night with the wind. we were so exhausted the following day we could not attempt the summit climb.An option to stay in the lodges at base camp would have been perfect as we would have slept and been psyched for the climb. the night we finished the trek we stayed in Jamal's riad which was beautiful our room was huge and beautiful. the food was also fab there and staff super friendly. the following day we had a long drive and stopped off in interesting villages on the way. that night we stayed in a fab hotel, with a pool and we had dinner on the terrace under the stars which was very romantic. the food was lovely too. the highlight was our over night in the Sahara. we trekked on camels for 2 hours then camped in Berber tents. we had dinner under the stars. our guide Rachid and his friend played the African drums with us on a sand dune in the middle of the desert which was great fun. thetour was so well organised and all the guides were just brilliant. we would recommend this tour to everyone. we will definitely go back to Morocco"

We checked the information about the Atlas on the web site of the Department of foreign affairs, which classified the area as problematic.

We turned up slightly less prepared than the others, who had bought all the hiking equipment and had trained like crazy beforehand, and at times the guides were generous enough to lend us their clothes when it got really cold (like at the top of Toubkal)! One recommendation: bring head torches. We did not. Very bad idea.Overall a wonderful experience well worth the money, I couldn't recommend the team more. Definitely want to go back, and when we do, we'll definitely be getting in contact with the Toubkal Guide lot again!P.s. remember to bring a bit of money for the tips, as well as to buy fanta and chocolate at random shacks on the way up - it gives you an energy boost and is well worth it, and v cheap.

Both my husband and daughter thoroughly enjoyed the day and for all 3 of us it was our favourite day in the week we spent in Marrakech. Right from the beginning Jamal responded to all my emails within 24 hours and was very helpful with all my questions, and believe me I sent him quite a few emails! His English is excellent. He prepared a full itenary and made sure that it incorporated all my wishes. On the day of the trip Jamal\u00b4s driver (Mohamed) and guide (Khalid) were waiting at the hotel to pick us up in a fully airconditioned and immaculate 4x4. Khalid is an extremely knowledgable and kind guide and spent the whole car journey and the walk explaining everything to us about the culture, the people, the geography, history, the terrain and much more. He spoke very good English, was very polite, kind and respectful, as well as humorous, and made sure that we were not hassled by the local traders as we also visited the weekly souk in Tahanaoute. He was with us throughout the day. I can\u00b4t praise him enough. Mohamed, our driver, was kind and polite and took us to see his family which was a lovely surprise and they made us delicious mint tea and offered us home made local bread with honey and olive oil as well as local sweetmeats. We thoroughly enjoyed this small interlude.We had lunch at Jamal\u00b4s riyad. The food was delicious and we sat outside overlooking the beautiful Mizane valley. Just paradise!I can honestly recommend Jamal and his team. You will not be disappointed. The price is extremely reasonable, in fact a lot lower than what some other tour companies charge. The fee charged is worth every penny. I am only sorry we couldn\u00b4t do another trip with Jamal, but next time we\u00b4re in Marrakech I will definitely arrange a couple of trips with him. Thank you to Jamal, Khalid and Mohamed as well as the chef and the girls who served our food for a wonderful day out."

We were picked up by Omar from the airport and transferred to Imlil Lodge where we were met by the owner of the Lodge and Tour company - Jamal. A very friendly man with one thing in mind, making your trip memorable and hassle free. Well, Jamal and his team managed to live up to all the hype. We climbed Jebel Toubkal in two days, albeit very challenging for a couple of older generation. It took 4 hours to walk to Toubkal refuge, all up hill but very scenic and a good general pace should see everyone manage it. Our guide was Ibrahim - he was energetic, knowledgable and a decent bloke! The food was seriously tasty and just what we were told (at the lodge and camping). We stayed in tents at the refuge but did manage a warm shower for 20 Dirhams at the Refuge. An early start (4am) and breakfast is served before heading up the Summit of Toubkal. I'm glad it was dark as the route was steep and you get to appreciate how steep on the descent. It total, we took about 3 hours to summit and about 2 hours to return back following a 20 minute Summit stop. We spent about 30 mins having lunch before moving back down to Imlil where we stayed the night before taking the 3 day desert trek. We asked for Omar as he is the equivalent of the Stig. The trip began with a drive over the famous pass and onto Ait Ben Haddou. We had lunch here before driving the final two hours to Dades Gorge. The hotel we stayed in was excellent as was the food. The next day was only 4 hours in the air-conditioned 4WD and saw us head to Merzouga. We arrived about 3pm and went straight into the pool. A few hours laying around in the sun before heading out on the camel and overnight Bedouin tent experience. The camels were well behaved and surprisingly comfortable for the 90 minute ride out to the campsite. Omar was a brilliant guide and driver. All in all, we got what we paid for - a private tour which was slightly more expensive than others marketed. However, the upside was the super organisation and hassle free private tour. Would we consider using Jamal and his team again? Of course, don't hesitate and go ahead and book. You won't be disappointed!"

Booking the trip was easy and Jamal was always very prompt answering my emailed questions as the vacation approached. The fee was very reasonable. The first day was a relatively easy hike up to the refuge where we arrived with plenty of time to relax, eat, and meet some of the other travelers staying in or around the refuge. We woke up at 5 in order to have time to make it all the way back to Imlil after summiting. I might recommend the 3 day tour if you aren't an experienced hiker, but two days was perfect for us.Our prepared meals were excellent. Make sure you pack plenty of water - we went through more than we expected. In hindsight, I wish we would have brought a UV sterilizer pen. There are plenty of locations along the way to refill from the pristine streams.I highly recommend having Jamal arrange your trip if you are thinking of doing any hiking in the Atlas."

He recommended a couple of itineraries before we arrived, which were discussed in person after we arrived. The flight was delayed and despite it being Ramadan, he stayed out there and waited for us. The transfer from RAK airport to Imlil Lodge (which is beautiful) was an hour and a half in a very comfortable private 4x4 (with seat belts, something lacking in a lot of places). The attention to detail was excellent in every aspect. The trek around Atlas mountains and summit of Mt. Toubkal was just perfect with the guide and cook taking good care of us. Couple of things to note:- I'd recommend you inform Jamal in advance of dietary requirements (something which we failed to do)- The guides speak a basic level of English and are pretty good at setting the pace for the trek (but not so good at stopping frequently enough so don't be scared to stop per your pace).We went during Ramadan which actually worked quite well for us when we went to Marrakech. The crowds were not around, not many had energy to hassle and you got an experience of the culture. Overall an excellent experience and I'd recommend Toubkal Guides wholeheartedly. Furthermore, if you need anything else, just ask Jamal. He can sort out Safari's in the desert (which we chose not to do in July but know a lot of people who did)."

At first, we were somewhat skeptical, especially when we were required to send a deposit of 100 euros... but these feelings turned out to be completely wrong in place.We were picked up at 8am (and exactly 8am!) in our Riad by Jamal himself and then he drove us to Imlil. There, we met our guide Ibrahim. When they found out that we didn't have breakfast (due to Ramadan and shops being closed early in the morning), he quickly organized some eggs, bread and coffee - for free.After breakfast, we started the trip. Ibrahim was walking very quick, but he adjusts his speed to the group's level of fitness. He also was very knowledgeable and told us much about Berber culture and the mountain life. Later on, we got to meet Abdul, our cook and muleteer, who prepared amazing, mostly moroccan food during the trek.We slept in tents at the Toubkal refuge, and we also rented sleeping bags from Jamal (10euro/perosn). They were warm and clean. The summit climb began early in the morning (but of course, not without breakfast!) and was an amazing experience. After another night, we literally ran down the mountain, because Ibrahim was so fast :-) After a last, extensive lunch, we said goodbye and were taken back to Marrakech.Considering all of this, it is safe to say that even though you are offered the same trek for (much) less money on the streets of Marrakech, it was worth every euro, since you really get a fully organized trip with a very friendly staff who are concerned with turning your trip into an amazing experience. Far more important to us were two points: first, Jamal only hires local guides and hence brings the cash flow to the Toubkal region. Thus, you support local people. Second, the group was concerned with food safety - every drop of water was heated, the dishes were cleaned with soap, the fruits washed with clean (!) water, etc. And, last but not least, this group was one of the few who actually collected their garbage instead of leaving it on the mountain - this was great as well.Hence, we would certainly and fully recommend this company. Do not hesitate to shoot them an email, as they will answer quickly and helpful. We would definitely book them again when going for a trek to morocco!"

It was the most beautiful experience and the service was seamless; it could not be faulted. The driver picked us up on time and the guide was knowledgeable and seemed to know everyone in Imlil; we were able to have mint tea with a local Berber family who welcomed us in their home.Definitely recommend this to anyone travelling to Morocco.

I found Toubkal Guide Day Tours online while in Marrakech and decided to book with Jamal because of the excellent reviews on tripadvisor.Having already been on a very disappointing excursion with our hotel to Fantasia we were a little apprehensive about booking another trip, but I am so glad we did!We arranged it extreeeemely last minute, but thanks to Jamal's great email correspondence we were able to organise it the day before the actual trip!We had a day trip to Imlil, there was a taxi waiting to pick us up from our hotel at 9am sharp, the driver was very friendly and was keen for us to take lots of pictures, offering to stop the car several times so we could get a good shot. His english wasn't fabulous but he was a genuinely nice guy and made us feel more confident that we'd made a good decision.Jamal actually phoned the driver while we were on our way and spoke with me to see what we would like to eat for lunch that day, making sure we were happy with how it was all going!Our guide met us in the mountains and bought us a big bottle of water for the trip which he carried for us. He was absolutely lovely, good english and very welcoming.My friend suffers with asthma so there were a few occasions where we had to take a brief pause but the guide was very understanding and ensured that she was always comfortable and hydrated.Lunch was amazing. The best meal we had by far in Marrakech. We actually ate at Jamal's family's home, they seemed really happy to see us and were, again, extremely welcoming. The food was never ending and so delicious, not to mention the interesting conversation and views that complemented it.Walking back through the valleys past the waterfalls, mountain goats and cherry trees was just perfect, a lovely tranquil escape from the hustle and bustle of the medina which had characterised the rest of our stay in Morocco. Our guide even picked some cherries for us to eat on our walk.Overall it was the most enjoyable part of our time in Marrakech, and I would recommend the company a thousand times over. If I was to return to Morocco I would not hesitate to book another tour with them. There was not one moment where I felt unsafe, unsure or unwelcome. It was also great that the company is all about giving back to the community. A real grass roots project which you feel good about being a part of.Thank you Jamal and team! :) xx"

We were staying in Marrakech for 4 days but wanted to get out into the mountains, based solely on the positive feedback on Trip Advisor I contacted Jamal who was exceptionally helpful. Originally booking for the summit trek shortly before arrival we needed to change our plans (altitude and exertion too risky for newly expectant mum!) and ended up doing only a day trip to the Imlil valley.I was a little disappointed for not being able to do the summit but Jamal was more than understanding and helpful in changing our itinerary and suggesting what we might like to do instead. Even just seeing the mountains and spending a day on a very short trek it was beautiful and a welcome change from the hustle of Marrakech.The trek was gentle stop start for an hour or so but with a moderate incline, am sure most people could easily do this and the pace is entirely your own. Our guide was knowledgeable and friendly allowing us as much time as we needed as we frequently stopped to take photos. This is finished off with lunch, maybe a short walk then return to Marrakech.For us we had a great day and so pleased that we went to the Atlas mountains but also that we went with Toubkal Guide Tours, the comments and reputation on here are all well earned."

He helped me plan every stage of our nine day trip covering central and southern Morocco which included Marrakech, Imlil, Mizane Valley, Aremd, reaching the sumit of Toukbal, Cascades d'Ouzoud, Dades, Todra Gorge, dunes of Erg Chebbi, Ait Ben Haddou and Scrabeo Camp. On the first day, we were greeted by Jamal at the airport and had the best meal at Riad Africa. I cannot recommend Riad Afriad enough for proper Moroccan food, unlike most of the places you find in the square. I believe we covered about 1500km in total and loved every bit of the journey. Jamal asked for a deposit to secure the booking. Naturally I was a little worried after reading about some tour guides pocketing the money and never hearing from them again. After reading all the positive reviews I decided to go ahead. Booking with Jamal you will have a trouble free holiday and you can trust him to ensure everything is arranged as agreed. One of my friends actually paid more than he should have by mistake but Jamal immediately informed us of this and gave us the money back; we wouldn't have known otherwise. Our mountain guide was Ibrahim, his English was good, very caring and made sure everyone in the group was okay along the hike. He set the pace just right depending on the experience of the group. The first day was about a 7 hour hike and the second day was about 12 hours; we're a slow bunch. Our mountain cook was Hassan. His English was not great but his meals were a delight and despite speaking little English, always tried to talk to us. Both Hassan and Ibrahim sang Berber music to us in the tent and even tried a few English pop songs. Our driver was Mohammed. His English was not the best but was always on hand to help us. His driving skills are amazing along the tight, winding mountain roads. We felt so at ease that most of us kept falling asleep in the car! Our main guide was Khalid. His English is excellent and he is currently studying at University. He knows so much about the country and was always happy to explain Moroccan culture and history to us. His energy kept the group going and we had a fantastic time even when we were tired due to the early mornings and long driving days. By the way, our trip was from the 1st to the 9th June 2013 inclusive. I will be returning to see the rest of Morocco and complete a winter climb of Mt. Toubkal. Jamal will be my first port of call without hesitation when the time comes. "

It's worth negotiating in advance with the very busy Jamal. we'd said we were vegetErian\u05ea, should have negotiated the whole menu, to exclude sugary commercial jams and processed cheeses. (Laughing cow cheese!), pushed for fresh fruit instead of canned (!), plain yoghurt. I brought my own maccinetta, to make morning espresso, a brilliant move,though somewhat to the distress of the donkey driver/ rather surly 'chef'. spaghetti and Frenchfries for dinner? it's odd having NO control over what and when one eats, and with only two of us in the group, it shouldn't have vee so difficult to make djustments. I wish I had insisted on going with them to the shops in Imlil to purchase the food, supplementing the costs as necessary. Some of the gites had great terraces with magnificent views, and one even had beds and toilet seats - others, just so you know, were mattresses and middle eastern style toilets.

An amazing experience, and a very professional organisation!Jamal, the owner of the company, picked us up at the airport and we stayed at his guesthouse, the Imlil Lodge - a very cosy, family style and Berber-authentic place. Great dinner and lovely breakfast in the sun at the terrace. Later on in the morning our giude Momammed and one cook with a mule (for carrying equipment) picked us up and we trekked up to the refuge Toubkal at 3200m. Since our summit attempt was in early April, we brought crampons and iceaxes, which was very useful at the steep section right above the Toubkal refuge. The weather was clear but there were incredibly strong winds, with gusts up to 22ms at the summit ridge. Although other parties turned around, Mohammad made it safe for us to gain the ridge and to reach the summit. An exceptional performance!I warmly recommend toubkalguide.com, the whole trip was organized with almost german precision and timeliness, and you feel really welcome and learn a lot about the Berber culture!"

The accommodations (especially in Dades Gorge) were outstanding as well as the hospitality and friendliness on everyone's part associated with the tour: our driver, our guide, the Riad workers in Dades, and the camel guides in the desert.Our guide was very professional, yet relaxed and easy going. We both felt very comfortable, safe, and content during every step! Beginning our trip with this tour was the best way to begin our week in Morocco since after the 3 days we had learned so much about the wonderful culture, languages, landscape, and people of Morocco.I was so enchanted with the trip and the Toubkal Guide Company that I hope to return soon to climb Toubkal with the same guides. Inshallah!"

Our lovely guide came to collect us from our riad and we set off to the foothills of the snow capped Atlas mountains. We were driven safely in a comfortable car while our guide chatted about the local area. We asked to stop at a shop to buy some argan oil and honey to find that it was a coop run by Berber women who crack the nuts by hand and grind to produce this special oil. Next we stopped at a busy saturday market in the foothills and wandered amongst the stalls selling everything from dates to sheep's heads. No tourists except us and no one pestered us to buy. We travelled higher and further into the foothills til we reached a village. There was a toilet here; hole in the floor type but clean. From here we climbed up though the trees and along the course of a river to waterfalls. I am in my 50's and my daughter in her 20's, you need sensible walking shoes or walking sandals and we clambered over rocks along the way. Very beautiful and very peaceful in March but were told it gets busy later. You will need to let the donkeys and carts pass as some of the tracks are narrow. We walked for 2-3 hours along paths and dirt roads, through Berber villages and orchards. Our guide chatted about local life and it was like walking with a new friend. Last stop for us was a road where we sat in the sunshine while our meal of salads, tagine and fruit were freshly prepared. We slept on the journey back to Marrakech!"

We were given the choice of having lunch in a Berber house or in a tourist restaurant, we chose the local house and the experience of meeting the family and having a home cooked meal was a plesant memorable experience.On both days the walking was easy, and the guide was happy to go at our pace which meant a lot of stops to take photos!I would definately recommend Jamal and his company and would have no hesitation to book with them again, hopefully for a longer 2-3 day trip into the mountains!"

I wanted to organise a trip for myself and 3 of my friends from work and having organised a few in the UK already, an adventure on foreign soil was the obvious next step. Having done a bit of homework on prices and flight times, Toubkal suited our needs perfectly. Toubkalguide was recommended to me by a fellow trekker and I contacted Jamal to see if the dates we wanted were available. Our trip was organised and off we went. We were met at the airport by our guide Rashid and taken to the Riad in Imlill, where we were fed more food than we could possibly eat. The next 3 days were just the best, from the walk up to the Neltner lodge, summiting Mount Toubkal was a fantastic experience and spending our last night in Marrakech at the Riad Africa was just added to the excellence of the trip.The walk side of it was very tiring and to spend the last day in Marrakech was a real treat.Riad Africa was a quiet oasis within the madness of the city, making our last night a very welcome and relaxing experience.Every aspect of out trip was an enjoyable experience (maybe not the sore legs though!) and I am certain that we will return to for another trek, Toubkalguide being the first port of call as Jamal really does give value for money and ensures you get just what you came for, many thanks to Jamal and Rashid for putting up with us."

Jamal (the boss) was very responsive and had everything lined up for me, from pick up from my hotel in Marrakech to hire of crampons and ice axe. He also arranged for a taxi to return me to my hotel.On the day everything went to plan and the climb was successful, albeit much harder than I expected due to recent heavy snow. Whilst the snow did make the climb harder, I think it also made it more interesting. Without the snow I don't think the views would have been nearly so dramatic.Jamal provided me with a guide and cook (with mule) and both were very satisfactory. There was certainly no shortage of food!I would certainly recommend both this trip and this company, but make sure you are fit as otherwise it could be a pretty miserable experience. I am quite fit (I jog 2-3 times per week) but did find the upper levels to be very challenging; not technical, just energy sapping. However, as I said, I think this was mainly due to the deep soft snow. I think it would be much easier in the Summer, or if the snow was firmer."

I first contacted Jamal in January to book a day trip to Imlil and the Ouzoud waterfalls for my group and a few weeks later we met at a travel exposition in Antwerp. From the first contact with Jamal, I already had a good feeling about the services provided by Toubkalguide and I was very confident that my group would enjoy the 2 day trips. The first day trip was to Imlil and our guide Idris picked us up at our hotel and took us to the minibus just outside the medina where the driver was waiting for us. During the transfer to Imlil, Idris provided us additional information about Morocco and he asked our preferences for lunch which he ordered in the meantime. After a short stop at a women's cooperative producing argan oil, we arrived in Imlil. Unfortunately 1 member of the group found the short climb at the beginning too difficult and Idris solved this wonderfully by taking her back to the driver who would drive her to the location for lunch. In total we had about 2,5 hours of walk that day and Idris explains a lot about the nature, mountains, etc... For most people the walk might have taken longer...Four days later, we met Idris again at our hotel for the day trip to Ouzoud. Again we spent another wonderful day with him. In the morning we stopped at a restaurant along the road for breakfast where some of us ordered scrambled eggs but quality was poor as the omelet was served cold and later that day some people would showed complaints with their intestines. When we arrived at the waterfalls, we walked down and saw some berber monkeys in the trees. The views from the waterfalls are amazing! Idris arranged a restaurant at the waterfalls for the group but unfortunately the food was not so good as we got in Imlil, this was a bit disappointing. But besides this, we spent 2 fantastic days with Idris and I will certainly recommend Toubkalguide to other people. They are really professional, 100% reliable, provide excellent service and they know their job! Thanks to Jamal, Idris and the drivers!"

We had a great guide, Mohammed and a very nice muleteer and cook, Hamid guiding us through the mountains. Although the temperature during the day was only about 5 to 7 degrees Celsius, it was very pleasant to walk. The night was quite cold. I think it must have been very close to freezing that night. The views were spectacular, the food was great. The gite was very basic, but we didn't mind as we were quite tired from the first day of trekking. I think we did about 13km the first day. I don't know how long the second day was. We only walked for about 3-4 hours.Being a grade 2 trek, I felt it was not too difficult, but, not being used to do a lot of sport, I was happy it was over after 2 days."

We had a great time with a great guide, who was so friendly and happy; answering any question we threw at him. He was a pleasure to be around all day. Lunch was exquisite on the terrace and as good as the 5* meal we had two nights previous that cost almost the same as our whole day\u2019s experience. We were so full we did not dinner that evening. The people we came across on the trek were so friendly making you feel very welcome to their villages and not at all like intrusive tourists. If I were to do my trip to Marrakech again I would love to do a longer excursion with Jamal as this really was a wonderful way to see Morocco and its people. To anyone who is going even for a short stay, this is a must to do for a day and this is a company that delivers everything that is promised at a very reasonable cost."

He has wonderful guys working for him and together they provide an experience that is both adventurous and very comfortable. After much indecision we booked the 3 valleys trek, because we were worried about snow and cold if we climbed Toubkal. After the first day, our guide suggested that we spend only 2 days in the valley and, on the 3rd day, hike partway up the mountain just to get the view. It turned out to be an excellent suggestion we had 3 fantastic days of hiking (and eating). I hope I can always remember the feeling of sunning myself on a rock next to the burbling stream while I gaze up at the snow dusted Atlas and blue sky above.While we were there (January) the nighttime temps hovered right around freezing. We spent one night in a \"git\" in a small mountain village. Our room had no heat and no hot water. Snuggled under a pile of blankets on our cots, stomachs full of a delicious home cooked goat tagine, my husband and I had the best time of our middle aged lives!However, one heatless night was enough. We spent the other two nights at Jamal's beautiful guest house in Imlil. Heat, hot showers, lovely decor and good food. We also met some nice and interesting fellow travelers.Although we had planned to do the two day desert tour, at the last minute we decided it was too cold, so Jamal arranged for us to have a day in Essaouira instead - which is a lovely city. The guide was knowledgeable about Essaouira and was fluent in English, so was able to answer a lot of general questions about Morocco during the car ride.We capped off our guided time with a visit to one of the Argan women's cooperatives located between Essaouira and Marrakesh.Overall an amazing and unforgettable experience."

We enjoy a good stomp, and emailed Jamal a few weeks before travelling for advice. He recommended Imlil, as previous comments suggest his response was prompt and efficient. Booking arrangements were easy and a last minute change of pick up organised without a problem. Great driver and a lovely drive from Marrakech out to the Atlas \u2013 about 90 minutes - it hadn't occurred to us that we'd be right in the heart of the mountains so quickly. Our guide, Omar, gave a us a choice of two treks - one easier, one more challenging - we chose the latter and headed up over a pass into a neighbouring valley which was truly breathtaking. We walked down into the valley then followed the river bed up, stopping at a refuge for a welcome cup of sweet mint tea and a plate of walnuts, before climbing up over a second pass and back to Jamal's gaffe for a very fine late lunch of Moroccan salads and tagine. The walk was just right- about 16 km, with a couple of hefty climbs, over about 5 hours. Views were magnificent, especially as we were blessed with a clear, warm day for December, teamed with a little snow on the ground. This really was a fabulous addition to a long weekend in Marrakech. We recommend Jamal and his team warmly."

Couldn't have gone better - highly recommended."

First trek was in the Amizmiz area (4 days), second trek was the more classic Toubkal trek (6 days). I recommend both treks; the landscapes are very different but both are treks that can be done by moderately fit people. Jamal's organization is very professional and well-organized, particularly demonstrated by their high degree of flexibility and ability to adapt to changing conditions or wishes (weather, health issue of trekking party members, requests for change in schedule, etc.). Jamal is a great and friendly host and we found all of the people employed by his organization (guides, cooks, etc.) to be generally friendly and very competent. In sum; I recommend Jamal's organization for trekking in the High Atlas without hesitation."

Communication was very efficient - I emailed Jamal from UK on the evening of 5th Dec (the day before we flew to Marrakech) to enquire about a day trip to Imlil on 8th December. He replied the same day. I made a booking, and he sent confirmation within a few hours, so I was able to print out the email before leaving for the airport. Ibrahim arrived at our Marrakech hotel at 9am, exactly as promised, and we had a wonderful day with him and the driver - there were just my daughter and me in the group, and Ibrahim and the driver were at our disposal for the whole day! Ibrahim spoke good English, and was able to tell us about the geology, the languages, the wildlife, agriculture, religion, history ..... in fact all sorts of things about the area that gave us a better understanding of Morocco, the various Berber groups, the Arabs, the environmental problems etc etc. The scenery was wonderful, the lunch very good, and the stop at the market on the way fascinating. We had a fairly gentle walk of about 90 minutes to the gite where we had lunch on the roof terrace, with a view that it would be hard to better! Our driver picked us up from there - I had been expecting another 30 minute walk after lunch, but it didn't matter. We stopped on the way home at a women's cooperative making cosmetics and various food items from argan oil - rather an odd place, but it seemed a good cause so we bought a couple of their (fairly expensive but probably good value) products. We were delivered back to our hotel at 4pm as promised. The cost was 120 euros (\u00a3100ish - payable in cash to the guide on the day) for the 2 of us. I thought it was good value, and would recommend the company to other visitors."

I contacted Jamal on a Thursday night and had the trip organized by friday afternoon. I did not have time for anything too long so he put together a 2 day trips with an overnight in his gite in the Imlil Valley.I was picked up on time at my hotel by Ismael and our driver Mohammed from there we headed up to the Imili Valley for a walk and to overnight. Safe driving and knowledgable guide. I was hoping for some mountain bike action in the afternoon but the weather turned bad. The hospitality and the Gite at the house were great (but cold with the storm). Nice comfy place with great guest rooms and views.The second day we headed to the Cascade D'ouzoud. They were in full flood and really amazing. The second day was a lot of driving but that was due to my choice of tours and where I was based. I was hoping for a bit more of a day trek than what the trips were but again that was due to my choice of trip.Jamal has his trips organized and run well. I am a guide myself and it was great to be guided by an organization that has got things sorted. I checked out lots of options and was really happy to find Jamal and his crew. If your looking for a guided trip these guys are the way to go.CliffGuide: Association of Canadian Mountain Guides"

I went on a 4 day trek with Toubkal Guide (http://www.toubkalguide.com/trekking/three_valleys_4_days/overview.htm) in mid-November with a friend and we had an excellent time. We're both moderately fit (but by no means seasoned mountain trekkers!) and found the pace and difficulty just right. I think our guide (Ibrahim) added in some extra walking and routes on some days as we were pretty quick, which is perfect: the guides will adapt the trek for the ability of the walkers to make sure you get the most out of your visit without breaking you if you're not 100%!The trek really is amazing value for money - you'd pay far more if you booked through a UK tour company, and this way you're putting the cash straight into the local economy too. Jamal was great to deal with - quick, efficient and really helpful. He answered all our queries and managed to organise vegetarian food for my friend too (which we thought might be an issue - but not here).The trek itself will show you stunning landscapes of different types - really different environments and natural features on each day. Snow capped mountains on one side, rocky outcrops on the other, grassy stepped farming, juniper trees and sumaq bushes, rivers and bubbling waterfalls and the constantly changing beautiful rock forms as you move through the landscape (you'll accidentally become a geology fan). Lots of wildlife: Mountain goats, sheep, birds, village chickens, etc. Highlight: walking over the mountain passes, emerging into sunshine into the smell of mountain air infused with juniper and pine. Ahhhh....The tour guide didn't mind waiting whilst we kept stopping to take photos and there was no rushing us on (and enough well-placed rest breaks). Food (cooked by our mule guide/cook, Zuhir) was excellent, plentiful and nutritious - we were always impressed by what could be knocked up by a riverside on on a hilltop mountain pass! We certainly never went short....The gite accommodation is pretty basic - but that's to be expected. But it's not too bad - running water and electricity, so one up from camping! Even basic hot showers. But cold at nights in November - they're unheated buildings - bring thermals, but there were extra blankets to borrow at each gite. I would recommend bringing some basic entertainment, as the evenings can feel long without a drink to finish off the day! (Particularly if it's raining, which it was for us on one day, and my word, did it rain: 15 hours of torrential downpour!)So, in summary, highly recommended - do it!"

I'd normally organise my own travels, but 350 Euros for 5 days seemed a reasonable price, including summitting Toubkal, and I'm really pleased we used Jamal's company. Before we went, we were slightly concerned that the Trip Advisor reviews were a bit too good to be true. In fact, Jamal has clearly put a lot of thought into exactly what travellers are looking for and everything about the trip was fantastic. Our mountain guide (Ibrahim) was very patient, and quickly picked up on our inexperience at trekking. We felt very safe and looked after, and I loved the feeling of achievement at the summit! We also noticed that the food prepared by our mule driver Zuheir was much more appetizing than what some of the other parties had, happily accomodating my friend's vegetarianism.We then embarked on a 3-day drive around Morroco, including visiting the famous Kasbah and camping in the Sahara for one night. Our guide (another Ibrahim!) was the best guide I've ever had. Very knowledgable and interesting, and quickly felt more like a friend than a paid guide. His English was brilliant, which I guess is unsurprising as he's a languages graduate. Mohammed, our driver, was safe and patient."

From the first communication to when me and my partner was dropped back at the hotel at the end of the day the service was great. We were met at our hotel by our driver (mohammed) and guide (ibrahim) at exactly the time arranged for a day trip to Ait Ben Haddou over the Tizi n'Tichka pass. Throughout the day everything was explained to us, all questions answered, with plenty of stops to stretch the legs, admire the views, take some pics and have a drink. It was especially handy having a driver going over the Tizi n'Tichka pass because it just allowed us to sit back and enjoy the views instead of concentrating on the road. I won't bang on about everything, but will sum up by saying that they knowledge and help was invaluable and we were made to feel more like friends rather than just punters. I will definitely use Toubkal again, but probably for something a bit more adventurous, like a dessert camping trip."

Although quite a long drive we were treated to seeing 'real' morocco passing through many villages and olive groves. We visited a beautiful natural bridge and then on to the falls. WOW! true natural beauty, i didnt realise there was so much in morrocco! The macaques came out to visit as we had lunch, great fun to see.

Jamal was very responsive over email and I ended up deciding the morning of the sharing group tour that I wanted to go on the tour and shot him a quick email to see if I'd still be able to participate. I didn't receive a confirmation email back from Jamal, but a different driver ended up showing up at my Riad to pick me up for the tour. This new driver whose name I can't remember was grumpy when I asked if we could pull over to an ATM so that I can get cash and he quoted me a different price for the tour than Jamal had said. I had to pay half Euro and half dirham and he didn't give me back my owed change saying that it was tip for himself. Jamal had said in his email that the cost included just lunch and transport to the cascades, but when we got up there, it turned out that we had to go with a tour guide and there was an additional cost for that! I spoke to other people on the tour and turns out that everyone was charged a different price. Shady dealings there, but the cascades were gorgeous so I'm really glad that I went. There are pink boat rides that take you under the waterfalls, but you will get wet! Also, women should be respectful when undressing into their bathing suits to get into the water. Wear your clothing and take off your clothes right next to the water. Overall, I'm glad that I went, but will definitely go through another agency."

We decided on the pre planned tour of the two day hike of mount Toubkal and a three day excursion across places of interest such as the magnificent gorges, ancient kasbahs and into teh Sahara on camel back.Jamal was a pleasure to deal with. He was very responsive to the many emails I had sent him before our arrival. On meeting in person I found him a very friendly socialble and professional tour operator. His team on the mountain was first class. There were four in our group so we had one guide, a cook and a mule to carry the necessary provisions. Most of our dealings were with the guide who was engaging, helpful when needed and most importantly patient. I have been on top of Kilimanjaro with the wrong team in the past and had felt in danger due to how I was rushed down the mountain for guides more interested in the inevitable tip ceremony. Jamals guide was nothing like this. A true professional only concerned with safety and enjoyment of the experience.The tour in a private vehicle was a very pleasurable experience and just what was needed after such a testing few days hiking. The places visited are pretty unaccessible to anyone without a car as the Eastern side of the country is seriously lacking in public transport. The driver and guide were extremely accomodating, always very friendly, and importantly gave us our own time and space. The trip into the Sahara was definately a highlight.The accomodation was top class throughout. Jamals guesthouse after the Toubkal hike was particularly stunning. We were well fed also, especially on the mountain.I have been travelling the world for the past 6 years and I honestly have not come across many tours that were so enjoyable and of such good value. I would wish Jamal and his team all the best in the future"

We felt in really safe hands with our experienced guide Ibrahim, he set the right pace for us and ensured our trip was pleasurable and safe. Great food cooked along the way by our cook and muleteer, well catered, we certainly did not go hungry.Before we left all our correspondance was with Jamal, the organiser and owner, he was efficient and prompt to reply to our questions and emails, his english was excellent and nice touch that he personally came to meet us as we set off on our trek.The only reason we grade 4 and not 5 is that there were some things we think could have been better explained before we left or while on the trek to help us be better prepared and not worry about things we didn't need to worry about and we did feel on the way back that Ibrahim rushed us a little and maybe seemed a little moody.Great value for what you got and we would definitely use this company again.We do quite a bit of walking at home but this was one step on for us and something we were a little nervous about before we left, we are so glad we did it though and will remember this for ever, it was such an achievement and the views were amazing, you are literally on top of the world. If you are reasonably fit just do it.Advice we would give if you are doing this same trek...- We did the trek in September, it was cool during day and cold at night at refuge ( we camped ) and very cold on the top of Toubkal, we packed thermals to sleep in, take lots of layers and something to rest your head on...no pillows. Pack gloves and a hat for the ascent and lots of layers and good jacket.- Walking shoes with good grip fine, or boots-Torch as you start final ascent in the dark-Tents supposed to be quieter than refuge for a good nights sleep, we slept well and comfortably. Although note, refuge door locked at night so check what you do if you need loo in night, we had to hold on. (They provided and put up and took down tent)-There are showers, and they were hot!, at refuge for small charge. But note facilities are rough, there are western style toilets though and ok for 1 night.-Water is available at 3 places between Imlil and the refuge so you only need to carry enough for 2 hours at a time on way to refuge. Water and snacks can be bought at the refuge too but nowhere to buy between refuge and summit so take enough for 6 hours when you do ascent on the second day. Some advice I received for altitude was to drink a lot of water and avoid alcohol beforehand-We stayed a night at Imlil before trek and I think this helped us aclimatise, I was worried this was not enough time from things I had read but we were fine, I would not want less time though as it was still very tough.-Mule carries all your things you just need small daysack for water etc-You do get some free time at refuge on the first day when you arrive, so take a book"

We were collected from our hotel in Marrakech and taken to Imill to start the hike with our guide Brahim. We thoroughly enjoyed the experience and we were amazed at the quality of the food we received. The climb to the summit is quite steep but within the capability of anyone who has climbed a Scottish Munro. The view at the top is stunning and worth the effort.Thanks to Jamal for organising the trek."

There was a lot of driving for the desert but this was necessary and well broken up by mini walks out to other places of interest. The Atlas mountains were incredible, our guide was really lovely and very informative. Jamal was so helpful to us in organising the tour, and on the tour we really felt that the focus was on us enjoying ourselves and having the best experience rather than trying to penny pinch. Both of us are on quite tight budgets and so were very happy that the tour was such good value, and there were no hidden costs that we have found doing other tours elsewhere, and we were very pleasantly surprised by how nice the places were in which we stayed/the quality of the food. Would definitely recommend it to anyone, a really great and not too touristy way to see some incredible landscapes."

The taxi from Agadir (organised by Jamal) was well priced, arrived early and driven by Omar, a sensible, safe driver. We met Jamal and guide Ibrahim at Imlil and without further ado got on with the trek. Ibrahim was always conscious of your fitness level and how quickly you wished to proceed. Ibrahim was also genuinely concerned about your happiness and well being. The stops on the way were relatively hassle free and the refuge was busy, clean, spacious with loads of friendly, interesting peolple of all nationalities. The Upper Toubkal Refuge facilities were really quite good considering the location. The food was good, thanks to Hamid, the wash facilities and toilets were basic but clean, the guides and the Refuge staff all had a cheery smile and would chat any time.Looking at the photos it is difficult to believe how far you are able to trek in a day. The last ascend to the summit is quite taxing and not to be taken lightly. We had 2 snow flurries on our trip.Jamal met us on our return and again the taxi was driven considerately by Mohammed on the pretty route (not motorway).I would recommend Jamal and his guides to anyone."

He listened carefully to the people within our group\u2019s interests and pointed out things that would interest us. Each day was very well organized with early rises so that we would miss the mid day heat. There where regular stops at resting points where the spectacular views could be admired. Well-earned lunch breaks are taken hiding from the midday sun beneath the walnut trees were a delicious meal was served followed by a snooze. We enjoyed the walks and though they were at times a little challenging (it gets hot!), in the August sunshine, each day was manageable and there was a good sense of achievement at the end of each day. The mules carried all of our luggage and we only needed to carry a bottle of water and day sack. We were drinking around 3 litres a day and you may sweat a lot so take plenty, It\u2019s cheap and the mules carry what you don\u2019t.

We were picked up from the airport by Jamal's driver and taken to our Riad in Marrakech prior to the tour starting, then taken from the Riad onto the tour. Our guide was Omar, and he looked after us brilliantly - a very capable mountain guide with good English and really good fun. The food provided was incredible - the cooks/muleteers would setup ahead of us and have meals ready just when we needed them. The stay in the Berber village Gite was basic, but to be expected, and made the subsequent stay in the Imlil Lodge even more of a delight (food again was excellent, rooms great, and wifi available). The treks were easy enough whilst still being challenging, covering about 25km(?) in total. The rest of the tour was a road trip to the toudra and dades gorges, then a camel trek into the Sahara, spending the night camping out under the stars. Fantastic experience all round - we would highly recommend Jamal's organisation, and would definitely rely on his guidance again, excellent value for money."

Everything went very smoothly, from the arrangements and information prior to the trip, the collection from Marrakech airport, the Riad in Imlil (Imlil Lodge - see other review), the guide (Omar - 5 stars) and supporting team. Jamal has a lot of experience and it is worth listening to him - for example he said stay in tents rather than the refuge, as a result we slept a lot better than the parties in the dorm rooms. The food was excellent in quantity, quality and even presentation at 3,200m. Be aware that this is still a physical trekking trip staying in a remote mountain area, so it will never be uber-lux. We also arranged accommodation in Marrakech through Jamal. When the Riad Africa fell through he found the alternative accommodation at Riad Zanzibar. Most impressively when I paid extra for breakfast at the Zanzibar, which had been included in the room rate, Jamal got his driver to pay me the money back at the airport. I have never experienced such service, or honesty, from either a tour agent or guide.Normally I don\u2019t go back to places or use tour agents, but I am very tempted to go back to Morocco to use Jamal on a trip to the Sahara as I have no doubt that it would be excellently organised at a competitive price. I have no hesitation in recommending Jamal and Toubkal Guide team."

I have to say it was the right choice. We were given the option of a group trip for 35 euros per person that wouldn't include a guide or a private tour for 60 euros each with a guide. These options were all given to us through very speedy and friendly email exchanges with Jamal, the owner (?) of this tour company. We decided to splurge a little and go for the private tour with the guide, and I'm so pleased we did. Our guide was friendly, helpful and talkative, but most importantly knowledgeable! Without him I don't think we would have gotten much out of our visit as the route to the waterfall is tricky and not clearly signposted. He led us brilliantly, setting a perfect walking pace (ideal for unfit me!) including breaks for rest and drinking water. We happily chatted with him about everything from the Moroccan economy, politics and religion to the weather and local animals (his English was very good).After taking us to the waterfall and letting us enjoy the coolness of it, he took us higher up, giving us a wonderful vantage point of all around us. He pointed out different trees, eg walnut or fig, and monkeys and other interesting features. Then we walked back down a different but gentler route to where he and our driver had parked and it was time for lunch.Lunch was amazing! First, the setting- in the hot 40 C weather we got to sit at a table and chairs set out in the river, essentially paddling while we dined. Then we had a delicious 3 course Moroccan menu- really tasty food.After lunch we headed home, full and very happy with our day. My only reservations about the day were that ourika's waterfalls weren't as impressive as I'd expected but that is more down to my not researching before going. Having said that, I wouldn't change my decision to go on that excursion yesterday. I really enjoyed it, and that is down to our wonderful guide!"

Our chef, Hamid, was very pleasant & prepared a variety of dishes including fresh salads, tagines, pasta & meatballs. We also had a mule, Katrina who was more than happy to carry me from the shrine back to Imlil, after I fell and injured my knee!! The mountain is completed in two days, the walk up to the refuge is fairly easy but up to the summit from the refuge, it is very steep and more challenging. This becomes more of an issue on the way down where in parts it is extremely slippery. Prepare to be exhausted!!!A downside to the trip is the many hours spent travelling! The car was more than adequate for the two of us, with fully reclinable seats making it comfortable, and (thankfully) air conditioning. It was a great way to see the beautiful countryside but personally, it was too much travelling in the car. We realise that this is a necessity, but be prepared for probably in excess of 24 hours driving over the 5 days. We round out the trip in the desert travelling by camel for an hour to visit the berbers. The food was very good, followed by an entertaining performance of some traditional music giving us a go later on. The heat was oppressive in the tents but we were welcomed to move our beds outside and sleep under the stars. Bring full length clothing in case of sandstorms!All in all would fully recommend the trip, it's a great way to see parts of Morocco you'd definitely miss staying in the cities. Thanks Briham et al."

Jamal generously provided us with a free night in his riad in between these two shorter trips.The food was excellent and healthy and well-prepared by our cheerful muleteer Hamid. The only gripe on the tour was the tent- barely wide enough for two sleeping pads and not long enough for my husband, who is 6'6\". It was also poor quality, with no vents, so very stuffy unless there's a wind blowing... unfortunately then the flapping was so loud that we couldn't sleep.

Jamal is based in Imlil and employs staff from the local area, so this ensured that our money was going directly to benefit the local economy. Originally we planned to trek the classic Toubkal circuit, but due the snow conditions in May the Ounoums/Likempt passes were innaccessible to the mules. We therefore decided on an alternative route via the Berber villages of Tachedirt and Ikkiss, followed by ascents of Aguelzim, Toubkal and Ouanoukrim, based on our own research and suggestions from Jamal. Jamal was very helpful prior to the trip and responded to our emails promptly and thoroughly. We were met punctually at our hotel in Marrakech and transferred to the trailhead at Imlil, where the trek started and finished. The trek itself was wonderful and we had a great time. The scenery is stunning and we barely saw another trekker until arriving at the Toubkal refuge on day 4. Our guide was helpful and informative and the cook was incredible - we were always amazed at how such fresh and immaculately prepared meals suddenly appeared out of nowhere (in very large quantities), especially considering everything was being carried by mule through a relatively remote region. We were also very grateful to the muleteers, who were always cheerful and worked very hard. We really enjoyed the route and would highly recommend it, although please note that Ouanoukrim requires some easy but exposed scrambling so should only be attempted with some prior experience (the south cwm route up Toubkal is completely non-technical though, so anyone who is reasonably fit should have no problems). After the trek we spent the night at Jamal's Imlil Lodge, which is really lovely and a perfect place to relax (and eat lots). Overall we would highly recommend Jamal's company to organise treks in the Atlas, and will definitely consider contacting him again for future trips to the Atlas."

After a couple of emails with Jamel our airport pickup was arranged for the four of us and so was our private one day trip to Ouarzazate with driver and guide. For anyone who gets car sick make sure you take pills beforehand as the roads are very windy and long and Mohamed \"2\" takes those curves fast! Mohamed \"1\" was very informative the entire trip and we learned a fair amount. Lunch was good however bring water and snacks as the day is long.As both services were on time and well organized we used Toubkal Guide Day Tours again for our trip back to the airport. Once again, no worries.Billylefish"

The highlight, by far, was trekking to the summit of Mount Toubkal (13,677 ft) with Ibrahim, our guide from Toubkal Guide. Ibrahim was professional and knowledgeable, helpful and funny. Our muleteer and cook carried our equipment and cooked tasty meals, always with a smile. Our trip was arranged through Jamal Imerhane, who met us at the start in Imlil. Jamal reviewed the trek in detail, making sure we understood what would be involved, and that we were properly equipped. Jamal retained Ibrahim as well as our muleteer / cook, who, as noted above, were absolutely invaluable. We literally would never consider doing a trek such as this (particularly not in April, when there was still snow on Mount Toubkal) without a knowledgeable guide. While we are both fit, this was my first high altitude hike, and Ibrahim both made sure I was ok to continue and offered assistance when it was needed. His great attitude really carried the day. I would highly recommend Jamal and his knowledgeable personnel for any trekking trip. Two thumbs up!!"

When we arrived in Imlil we were surrounded by people offering their services but, being British, we retreated to the hotel to gather our equipment and our thoughts and drink tea! We then walked over to the Imlil guides office and tentatively talked to Jamal. He turned out to be an invaluable friend. Ironically, one of the guy's who was pestering us when we got out of the taxi turned out to be a guide and an excellent chap too. First impressions don't always count! Jamal arranged muleteers for us and gave us a trekking route that turned out to be really good. We wanted to climb for a few days then go trekking but hadn't taken account of too much spring snow. The final two days of trekking were particularly good from Oukaimeden to Setti Fatma. The overnight at Timichi was perfect. The climbing didn't go to plan but Jamal got us out of a very difficult spot when one of the guy's had an accident on the way back down to the refuge. Jamal and his porters saved the day! P.S. Go at the end of April/beginning of May. All the fruit trees are in bloom and it's very green and lush but please take a down jacket. The temperature for trekking is lovely but as soon as the sun goes down it's COLD..."

Before we came Jamal gave us all the necessary info, always replied really quickly to our emails and basically provided everything we asked for (except the weather, can't really blame him for that!) We had brilliant guides for both parts of the holiday and also a muletier who provided really good food on the side of a mountain and an excellent driver (phew) for our trip over to the desert. Mohammed's driving made it possible for us to enjoy this part of the trip rather than needing tranquilizers over the Tichka pass and various other \"exciting\" roads. We just got the impression that all the team really wanted us to have a great holiday and they did their best to make sure this happened. I would really recommend the company and would certainly use them if we go back to Morocco - thanks guys!"

We contacted toubkal tours based on 1) being in the top 10 of trip advisor, 2) having a great website, and 3) having an office address that seemed reasonably close to where we were staying in Marrakech (turns out that this was not important). In total we emailed 3 tour groups in the TA top 10. Of the people we emailed, Jamal was the most reliable and responsive, and on short notice, he arranged a customized tour for us to cover a lot of ground in morocco for 7 days: Marrakesh to Draa valley to Merzouga to Fes to Casablanca. He took our needs into consideration and allowed us to also choose our own lodging in 2 of the cities. We had a guide and a driver who made for pleasant company. We were highly satisfied with the overall quality and value of our trip. We had considered renting a car and doing this itinerary ourselves, but in retrospect this would have been a huge challenge \u2013 road signage in the cities is unreliable, and not much English is spoken in smaller areas (French is, but ours was pretty poor). So, we instead got to nap in a nice big minivan instead of worry about how to get from place to place. The highlight of our trip was probably our 2 nights in the desert. Although it was very cold overnight and in the early morning, riding a camel, climbing a large sand dune for a desert sunset, and seeing the stars at night were memories we will not soon forget. Thanks to Toubkal tours for giving us a wonderful experience and impression of the country! Some parting advice when planning a tour in Morocco: 1) As there is a wide range of ability in \u201ctour operators,\u201d probably best to arrange what you can in advance of arrival. We met a fellow who arranged a private tour in Fes for his only day there, who was very disappointed with the poor English skills of his guide. 2) We met a few different day guides over our stay \u2013 including before and after our time with toubkal tours. Each local guide seems obligated to show you some co-ops (for example of ceramics, rugs, clothing). It is an opportunity to help out a worthy cause, and understand the process behind the development of the product, so that is good. However on flip side, a time-conscious traveler may worry about the amount of time lost being an awkward guest in an overstuffed shop, that otherwise could have been spent exploring. Be prepared for the co-ops, have some patience, and if you are opposed to the idea then ask to limit your time in them."

The day we were due to leave there was some concern that the driver would arrive as Jamal was in Holland and his business partner Rashid didn't seem aware of the booking. That said, executive style transport was at our hotel on time in the morning and we travelled to Imlil in comfort. We were surprised to find two other people on our trip as we were led toi believe we were alone but they were a nice friendly norwegian couple who were good company. There were some vagaries around the pricing depending on whether or not you were hiring axes and crampons. It seemed we paid for this in the price of 200 euro each, (even though I had my own) and our norwegian couple were given a 20 euro discount as the guy also had his own. I simply deducted this from the tips I gave !. The catering by Jamal's team was faultless, the food was excellent and plentiful and hot tea was supplied on demand. The cook/mulleter was great. The guide was a nice friendly guy but without too much conversation. His principles of guiding would certainly not earn him an IMG status. But depends what you expect. He basically showed us the route, even though he was often 150metres ahead. Don't expect ice axe or crampon technique explanations or any hand holding. The weather was great, the views stupendous. There are two refuges, the first (the lower one) is very warm and the staff very welcoming, the second is very cold and the staff a little more stand offish. Unfortunately Jamal uses the second one which is a bit of a a negative. I guess we were prepared for cold so it wasn't that big a deal in the end and the whole experience dwarfed these small niggles. Would I reccomend Jamal and his team ? If you are a novice then for sure he provides a good value service. If you have done a bit then probably you can do this one on your own. Oh, and take 3 days. Going back to Imlil the same day as you summit Toubkal is unneccessary pain."

Toubkal Guide and his local guide and mule driver were perfect company, and have tried all to make the trip a successful and pleasant one. - Overall: highly recommandable, BUT bring ultra-warm, rain- and snow-proof clothings and a WARM sleeping bag during this cold season - then fun is almost guaranteed...!"

Good on Jamal for offering a cheaper alternative to the other tour companies yet still a great tour. It is nice relaxing as the food is being cooked for you. Be aware the last day of this trip is difficult. The thing that I liked most was that my tour was going to be 120 euros but when more people joined Jamal knocked down the price despite us agreeing on the more expensive price. This is rare all over the world but in Morocco, for me, it was unheard of! Also you do not need to bring the two days worth of water, you can buy water around every hour or two along the way."

The service was first class. Jamal answered all my emails within 24 hours, providing clear answers to all my questions. He met us at Imlil and escorted us to his guesthouse, which I would recommend as a base or overnight stop. The guiding service was excellent as was the cooking. We stayed in the Neltner for 2 nights and were very well looked after both in the refuge and on the trail. At the end Jamal organised at very short notice a mini-bus from Imlil to the airport. All these services were offered without pressure and delivered exactly as promised. Jamal waived any deposit and in fact asked for payment only after we had returned from the trek - how good is that?Jamal really is a one-stop-shop for every visitor to Morocco, which means there is none of the hassle of having to organise each bit of your trip yourself. Do not think twice about using this Company - I'm sure you won't find a better service or better value - and I bet you could not do it cheaper yourself: I couldn't. Thanks for everything, Jamal."

We were accompanied by an excellent team of guides, cooks and muleteers, all of whom provided superb service. The food exceeded all expectations, and credit must be given to Raschid for this. The only negative point was that some of the tent sleeping mats were very thin! Before returning to Marrakech we spent a night in Ilmil, at the atmospheric Dar Ilmil, super luxury after our 4 nights on the trail.This is a trek for experienced walkers who would apprciate the challenge of the ascent of jebel Toubkal.

Jamal was excellent, responding very promptly and helpfully to our changing requirements from my first enquiry onwards, and putting together the perfect day trip for us. One of our party was not well, and we weren't sure until the day how much walking would be possible, so Jamal came up with different options involving walks of varying length or no walk at all, in the beautiful valleys around Imlil. He arrived within 15 minutes of our agreed time, despite our hotel actually being some distance along unsurfaced tracks from their advertised address which I'd given him before departing for Morocco. We then enjoyed a comfortable journey in a 4x4 car through the foothills, followed by wonderful walk with amazing views of the High Atlas peaks covered in snow and Berber villages clinging to the rocks above us - the contrast with the lush green woods in the valley floor and the arid mountainsides and snowfields above in Spring was fabulous. And after the walk, we had a delicious lunch - the best bread we tasted in Morocco and one of the best tagines. All in all, a day to remember.Jamal was friendly and helpful throughout, seemed to know everyone in the villages we walked through, and was able to answer all our questions about life in the Berber communities in the mountains from the perspective of someone who had actually grown up and spent his life there."

All we had to do was relax and enjoy the tour. i would do it all over again if i could , thank you for such an amazing experience Rasheed and Ismail!a must if you are in Morocco!"

He went out of his way to show us different things. The next day we met our main guide Hassan. He was also very nice and professional. Also friendly and willing to answer all the questions that we had. We got on a day long road trip with him and it was fantastic. He made sure we knew exactly what was going on. He was very accommodating with us taking pictures and pulled over multiple times. I got a little carsick and he was super helpful. He pulled over whenever I needed to get some fresh air. The dessert was breathtaking. Our camel time was excellent. The guides there were very nice and they tried to communicate with us the best they could. They all spoke some english and some spanish. They were very nice and festive. Our sleeping accommodations in the dessert were great. It was cold but they had everything we needed to sleep warm. The next day we got in the road again with Hassan and he truly went out of his way to get us back to Marrakech on time. The rains had flooded the main road but he found a way to get us back safe and sound. Every hotel that they took us too was absolutely beuatful in its own way.

The focus of our holiday was to relax relax relax...but you can do that anywhere and why visit Marrakech and not experience the hustle and bustle of the souks and the sheer a magnificence of the Atlas Mountains?! I found Arenas 4x4 on Trip Advisor and thought, although a perfect record sounded unlikely, it was a very good place to start! I emailed Hassan and had a very prompt, informative and helpful response. He kept in touch to ensure the trip was tailored meet our requirements, and even offered to meet us the night before the trip in our hotel to ensure we were happy with the plans.The morning of our trip Hassan was waiting for us at our hotel and within minutes had our little group of merry travellers at ease. His knowledge of his homeland is extensive, as one would expect. But his passion and reverence for the history and the very essence of what he calls 'real Morocco' is what marked him out as special and truly worthy of this 5 star review. Not forgetting our ever silent, ever careful, and ever tolerant driver 'Smiley'! This trip was the making of our holiday. The scenery as we wound our way higher into the Atlas Mountains was truly breathtaking and a glimpse into the Berber way of life that you will not find in the mayhem of central Marrakech. Arriving at the gateway to the Sahara Desert, Ouarzazate - my only regret was that we didn't have more time to spend there, and that we had to head back, rather than onwards into the desert. Hassan ensured we had plenty of stops to stretch our legs and take pictures. And our homeward journey was full of laughter as we told silly jokes, played silly games, and hooked up our iPod for a singsong...its testimony to his character that our lovely Hassan joined in everything from playing Eye Spy (with my little eye) to singing Prince 'kiss' as loudly as my sister and I! A fabulous day was had by all and I cannot recommend booking a trip with Arenas 4x4 more. A massive thank you to Hassan and 'Smiley' from Quililie and Lukatar!"

The tour is endlessly customizable, so you see what you want to see. The only limitation is your own imagination. Rachid was extremely personable, answering our every question and indulging our every whim. After learning that we would be traveling close to his hometown my wife asked if we could see where he lived and meet his family. So accommodating was he that we were invited into his home where we were greeted by his wonderful sisters and served lunch generously prepared by his amazing mother. We passed time in the car sharing music and telling jokes, as we made our way through the desert visiting historic kasbahs and beautiful riads. With Rachid's help we had a wonderful, Moroccan experience and we got a genuine taste of the culture of the Moroccan people. I honestly can't imagine having such a satisfying experience on our own.

The five of us on this tour would highly recommend this company for day trips and everything else they offer as they were so professional and personable. Because of this, we are thinking of coming back to have Rasheed take us on one of his desert treks. Thanks so much Rasheed from the uk's and Aussies!"

And boy, was it an experience of a lifetime! Although I was a solo traveller and went during the peak tourist season, I made new friends who made great company and now keep in contact with.The Arenas 4x4 team ought to be commended for their excellent hospitality and customer service, especially their guide Hassan, who guided and showed us through the beauty of the Moroccan landscape. We have deserts here in Australia, but none as beautiful as the ones in Morocco!I thoroughly recommend this company for anyone wanting to see a piece of Africa that is seldomly seen by travellers ... one word describes it all: MAGICAL. Much thanks to the Arenas 4x4 team for making my Moroccan trip that little bit special, I would not hesitate to take another tour with them the next time I visit the country!"

Hassan it's owner and I had long email conversations before we finalised. He was perhaps the only one of the operators who gave me detailed itinerary with the names and websites of all the riads and hotels we would be staying at, making me very comfortable with the choices we were making. The 4x4 wheel car was as good as brand new, the driver, Yidir was fantastic. Not only did he speak good english, he was young, not reckless and very friendly, sharing anecdotes and giving us insights into the lives of berber folks. The trip to the dunes was mesmerising, please do not miss it for anything, the camel ride does get a bit rough for the first timers, but if we survived it so shall all! You could ask Hassan for alternatives, i.e. shorter camel ride or a 4x4 ride into the dunes, but do do go there and sleep under the stars. I think this was once-in-a-lifetime experience for each one of us and the entire credit of such a pleasant experience goes to this tour organised by Hassan and Yidir. I just wish we had more time and could do some more aspects of Morocco. Next time I guess!"

It turned out to be very good decision! We started our 10 days tour in Casablanca. Our driver Mohammed picked us up on the airport and our good time in a clean SUV started immediately. Our driver was also our guide who told us many things about his country, way of life and habits. His knowlege of many languages was surprising so comunication was not a problem at all.On our tour we visited many different cities. After visiting a mosque, crowdy streets and fabulous market in Casablanca, we visited colorful Marrakech. We couldn't stop admire happening on Jemma el Fna and all crazy things of the main square. After visiting Jardin Majorelle, we continued our trip in to astonish Atlas mountain. Uau! The road was very winding but the view was really amazing. Our guide stoped every time we wanted, so we could admire the view and get reall high mountain feeling. On the other site of high mountains we meet palm tree oasis, dates and good food. After visiting fosile workshop and pottery stores we continued our tour to meet, for us most amazing landscape, the desert. This part of the trip we will never forget! The camel ride from Merzouga into the Sahara desert was really interesting and also staying overnight in tents was interesting and hot. There were also other people in a desert camp, so we spend good time together with turists, local guides, playing music and eating excellent tagine. But must incredible was night sky full of stars. Unfortunatly we needed to continue our trip back on the other side of Atlas again. On our way we meet Barbary apes and high pine trees, vineyards and dogs. City feeling occur again on the streets of Fez and in incredible medina with tannery. More than this, we admired streets of Chefchaouen with unexpected collors. You shouldn't miss this! But most of all I recommend whole holiday package: kind people, good food, nice music on our way, colorful cities, amazing desert and safe feeling with our guide and driver Mohhamed. On the end of our tour, he took us on the Casablanca airport, and wished us Bon vojage, you should come again. I hope, we will."

If I have to be honest, the only thing that didnt like of the tour was the welcoming in the desert when we got to the tents. There was almost nobody expecting us, no one to tell us what to do, and it would have been awesome to have people there wellcoming us by singing, dancing, etc. We just had to wait a couple of hours for dinner without having nothing to do. After dinner they started making a show with drums but anyone wanted to atend because we just wanted to sleep. Next day we woke up early to see the sunrise and go back to the hotel by riding a camel. Just as amazing as before.The tour continued with Moha in his 4x4 and it was excellent! He drives really well in the dangerous cliffs. The hotels were so beautiful and the landscape is absolutely unbelievable.He drove us back to the riad in Marrakech and didnt leave us until we were inside of it.

We were taken to just the right amount of stops on our way to the desert to help make the long drive not seem so long. We have spoken to other families who have taken similar trips and we discovered they didn't see and do nearly the same amount of things we did--we were given the royal treatment. We travel quite a bit as a family and we would rate this experience amongst the top 3 things we have ever done--truly exceptional. Ahmed feels more like family to us than a guide.

An early start ensures you beat the crowds at the waterfall and the lunch with a Berber family is delicious. The scenery is spectacular.Helpful tips:1. The hike to the waterfall can be challenging in places, wear sensible shoes.2. Bring loose change for souvenirs or tips for the Berber family. 3. If your a woman, wear something to cover your legs. Berber tradition is still quite conservative and short shorts could be offensive. My partner brought a light scarf and wore it as a saarong."

The trek up to the waterfall was rather wet - despite the forecast for Marrakesh being dry, it rained most of the walk. The local guide, Omar, was very helpful particularly when the rocks were slippy. He also gave us a simple plastic poncho although without a hood. My advice is to wear trainers and take a jacket. The scenery changes across the 4 valleys - plenty of photo opportunities. The Berber lunch was the highlight. It was really interesting eating in the house of a local family, and the meal was delicious.

Stopped at a argan shop where they show you how it's made, good loo stop!On to the first valley where we took a hike for an hour or so, no real path in places so trainers a must, not for the elderly but instead they can sit in one of the lovely little cafe stops and wait for the remainder of the group. Some small stalls selling usual Moroccan wares but no pressure at all to buy.Incredible small cafe to take green mint tea or a soft drink high up on a mountain side, accessing it involves a ladder which is fun. The guide helped assist where needed if you felt unsteady or needed a hand. Incredible views and fab photo opportunities. After this we travelled though the other valleys and stopped for an amazing lunch prepared by a Berber family in a house in a small village. Again fantastic views and settings, tagine, cous cous, salad, bread and fruits and tea to finish. Back to our hotel around 530.Highly recommend!"

He was a great tour guide and resource. We stopped at a place to see women make almond butter. I enjoyed that a lot. We hiked to a beautiful waterfall, drove to see the different valleys and stopped for the most delicious lunch we had in Morocco. The lunch was in a private building cooked just for people from this tour company. this tour was the absolute best part of my visit to Morocco. I would highly recommend this tour to everyone."

A great company to book with and excellent customer service.We were picked up on time by our guide Chakib who was very polite and very hospitable. He was very informative throughout our trip and a very safe driver.It was raining in the morning which did spoil it a little bit as it meant that it got quite cold. We had to wait a little before making our way to the waterfall with the local guides (who by the way were excellent, helpful and made sure to look after you). Make sure to try and check the weather before heading off for this trip \u2013 it would have definitely been better had the weather been good.The best part of the trip was lunch with a Berber family. The food was absolutely delicious and the views were stunning. Overall, this excursion was amazing and it was definitely worth a trip to the mountains."

We got a bit worried initially as we were not sure where the meeting point was as we were staying in the medina. We managed to get hold of someone by phone and we found out where to meet. Then we missed our driver by a couple of minutes as we were not there on the dot and then he'd gone to get the other people on the tour. This was the only issue at all with this company. The guide Abdul is so nice! Very chatty, open and knowledge. He says his French is not as good as his English which must be incredible as his French is extremely good. This trip was made really special thanks to him. He never rushed us and was really laid back. We had a fantastic experience. I would highly recommend this tour with this company. Lunch was great in beautiful surroundings."

We were picked up at 8.20am by our driver Chakib in and were two of a group of four. Chakib spoke perfect English and gave us lots of great information on the drive around four quite different valleys. As we left quite early we were ahead of a lot of tour vehicles and I would recommend this as it gets very busy. Not many companies leave as early. The mountain guide was excellent and he chatted and helped us up to the waterfalls and back. Plenty of photo opportunities the whole trip! We stopped to see Argan oil production and purchased some products under no duress and had a lovely lunch with a Berber family at their house with fantastic views. This company gets excellent reviews and I can see why - Chakib was excellent and his vehicle and driving left us feeling safe and looked after. He was relaxed and fun and took photos a plenty for us. Book with them...you're in knowledgable, safe hands."

I have never done a trip like this before, I didn't ever really feel there was any point, I was quite happy wandered around on city breaks and didn't ever want to do the 'tourist thing'. But this has fully changed my mind. I can not recommend this trip highly enough! We were picked up on time in the location that was communicated to us through email contact, the little van we were transported in was great and we felt very safe! Our highlight of the whole trip was our guide, Mostafa Zeroual. He really made the day for us, his enthusiasm for the area, his knowledge and attention to detail was incredible! We honestly didn't stop laughing from beginning to end! The sights, the local trek guide Kamal was fantastic too and the lunch with stunning views at the traditional Berber village was something we'd never have been able to see doing this by ourselves. I have no hesitation in recommending this tour, and would absolutely book again. A real highlight of our trip to Marrakech."

Overall, Chakib the guide was excellent, punctual, polite, informative and a very safe driver (important in this country!) We stopped often for photo opportunities but some of the latter valleys and an artificial dam meant we sat a lot in the car and didn't see too much that was different.The first half was awesome though, even when raining for a few hours. We visited a Argan museum for a bit, and then climbed up a waterfall for great pictures. The highlight without a doubt is the lunch with a local Berber family. The authentic local tagine and couscous was the best I've ever tasted and spending time in their home meant they got some income through the tour and we got excellent food.The second half of the tour tailed off with the scenery relatively average throughout. I cant fault the company or the tour guide who was amazing throughout. The four valleys tour would not be my first choice if recommending to friends or family."

We stopped on the way day to see the goats in the Argan tree, which is such a fantastic sight.Once in Essaouira we had our own free time to wander around and explore and the locals are less pushy to sell you things than in Marrakech.Abdul recommended that we ate lunch at one of the fish stalls and what a recommendation! We ate so much for about \u00a320 for both of us, and so fresh. I would not hesitate to recommend a day trip to Essaouira nor would I hesitate to book with Morocco Attractive Tours. A no time did we feel unsafe.We also booked a sunset Camel ride for the following day and were met by Mustafa (again on time) who took us to the Palm Groves for a wonderful experience. Again Mustafa's English was perfect and he was very entertaining. We chose the sunset camel ride so it would not be too hot which was a great choice as it was beautiful. All the camels looked very healthy and happy.I can see why this company have such a well deserved reputation."

On the strength of that tour we booked another one to the coast in a 4x4 with the same driver, Mustafa, who was great fun and gave us lots of interesting facts along the way. The drive from Marrakesh to Essaouira was interesting as you see how the real Moroccans live and not just in a tourist area. The landscape changes from baron rocky ground to the more fertile coastal strip and then you see the vast Atlantic Ocean. Essaouira was fascinating in the old medina and not so pushy as in Marrakesh. At the harbour we watched the fishing boats arrive and unload and sell their catch. Mustafa bought fish from the stalls and we took them to a place where they were cooked for us. We also took our own bread and olives. It was a long day but well worth it."

He connected us with our mountain hike guide, Omar, who was equally wonderful. We had so much fun! The hike up the mountain is a true HIKE, but so worth it for the views & experience.

Morocco Attractive Tours had a number of great day-trip options and let us book without a down payment or credit card charge (very few tour companies allow this flexibility). Our driver - Mustafa - arrived at 730am sharp for our Ourzazate tour. Mustafa was incredibly accommodating and happily made a detour for us to \"grab breakfast and coffee\". The drive to Ourzazate was absolutely gorgeous through the Atlas mountains and Mustafa even took us on a bit of an off-road route; some of the turns were a bit hairy but if you enjoy a little adventure, its an absolutely breathtaking detour from the usual highway route. During our trip, Mustafa was an absolutely hilarious travel companion and always kept things light and friendly. We really enjoyed our time with him and would highly recommend his services."

Our group consisted of 6 people. We drove up to the Amazigh (Not Berber) village and just saw the most amazing views with Abdillah explaining everything in detail. He speaks excellent English and is very knowledgeable about the history and information of Morocco and other things around the world. Then we stopped at an argan women's cooperative which I was not too crazy about. The woman explaining the process made me feel like I was in an infomercial. But it was good to see the process. I would say this was the only 'meh' of the trip.After that we drove to the mountain area and were led by Omar, also wonderful, tracking up and down the mountains and stopping at the beautiful waterfall. You will definitely need hiking boots or sports shoes for the climbing. After climbing up then down we met up with Abdillah again and he drove us to the home of the son of the Imam in a village to have an amazing tajin lunch with the most spectacular view. It did get a bit windy so you might need something light.We then drove to the surrounding valleys and finally dropped off at our Riad. Again, this is a highly recommended trip with amazing views and a great tour guide!"

We drove over the Atlas Mountains and the visited Ouarzazate & Ait Benhaddou. We also visited the films set for some famous movies & TV programmes, Gladiator, Cleopatra and Game of Thrones. We then headed to Kasbah and had a traditional lunch at Kasbah Tebi. Our guide then took us through the Kasbah giving us lots of information about its history along the way. We walked to the top of the hill and the views were fantastic. On the way back our guide stopped and bought us Apples and nectarines from the roadside fruit sellers so we could taste the local produce.

Abdul our driver took us up there earlier than most companies so we missed the rush. After doing the walk to the waterfalls (which is rough and not suitable for those who have walking difficulties) we took off on a different route to other trips and barely saw another vehicle for the rest of our trip.Abdul our driver was very knowledgeable about the mountains as he grew up in the area. He spoke excellent English and made sure we all had a marvellous time.Apart from the amazing scenery we had lunch in a Berber house, it was incredible. The food was excellent and this was the real deal not a tourist trap. We were fascinated by the amount of trees, peach, plum, nut trees and apples trees.I highly recommend to use this company.

He was very Knowledge and really listened to our wants and needs of the day as in water, bathroom, or food breaks. Kamal, our mountain guide, was so helpful in guiding us through the hiking trail. The rocks are a bit slippery and the trail can be a bit steep so be sure and wear nice comfy shoes with lots of grip. If you have knee problems or get tired easily, I would recommend not doing the hiking, but the water falls are insanely beautiful. I highly recommend doing this excursion."

He met us on time at our hotel and introduced himself before clearly explaining the itinerary for the day. As we made our way to the first valley he was engaging and knowledgeable, explaining the history of Morocco, the Berber people and answering our (many!) questions. The roads were steep and winding in places, with tight hairpins and drops, but we always felt safe as Abdoul sought out the perfect photo opportunities.Lunch in a Berber house was a highlight; traditional local food cooked over charcoal, with panoramic views across the mountains and valleys.Definitely worth spending a day on this tour; take some walking boots and sun protection if you are planning to climb up to the waterfalls, and ask for Abdoul as a guide for your trip."

Abdul picked us up from our hotel in a 4 X 4 . There was only myself & my wife which made it all the more personal. Our first stop was the argan oil co-op then onto the waterfall which includes quite a bit of a trek up the rocks so do make sure you have suitable footwear . Well worth the effort although trek is optional . Abdul made a point of stopping for us to take pictures . He was very knowledgable , informative & passionate about his culture. He was wonderful company & always encouraged us to ask questions which we did. The meal at the Berber house was excellent with fantastic views . It was as though we had gone back in time , peaceful & so relaxing. Thoroughly enjoyed the trip & highly recommend doing it. Big Thanks to Abdul for making our day so special."

It was finished off with Moroccan tea on a terrace with yet more stunning views. We could easily have spent hours taking in the scenery and drinking tea but we sadly had to head back to our hotel eventually.Thoroughly recommended."

Going by the reviews on trip advisor this looked like the best day excursion to do whilst in Marrakesh and I'm pleased to say the reviews were spot on. Mustafa was our driver and the other reviews about him being a funny and entertaining driver were again very true. The schedule includes a small trek up to a small waterfall which may not be everyone's cup of tea but is worth the effort. The views throughout the journey are great and Mustafa encouraged us to stop and take pictures as we went along.The meal at the Berber house was a traditional meal which was pleasant. We had a salad to start (with bread which seems to be a staple all times of the day in this neck of the woods) followed by a tagine (with more bread if you weren't breaded up already!) And then came couscous with vegetables. Followed by some apples from a local orchard and mint tea. (We came out stuffed).Other stops included one at an argan oil coop and an optional add on to see a lake and plateau which were nice but the highlights for me were the valleys and the Berber meal.I'd give this tour a yay."

The entire team, from our driver to our camel handler, was friendly, helpful and made sure we got the most of our experience.

He was attentive, thoughtful, knowledgeable and more importantly a really really good laugh. The trek in the Ourika to the waterfall IS a trek so wear appropriate footwear (I did see a young lady struggling in high heeled sandals). The journey to Oukaimeden valley was fun filled and so incrediblely beautiful that words cannot describe it. The views were spectacular all throughout the experience. We stopped along the way and Mostafa treated us to fresh figs and peaches. We had lunch on the top of a mountain with a Berber family. Everything was delicious and again, so fresh. The sights and smells of the Asni valley were amazing. I would recommend this tour to anyone visiting Marrakech. I will be talking about this for years to come."

Our guide was very intelligent and went the extra mile to make our day a day to remember. it was such an amazing feel to climb up the mountain by foot to see the amazing waterfalls, something that that I wanted to see since childhood, can't believe my dream came true, my family and i even went in the water fall just couldn't go to where the water was falling from the mountain as we didn't take extra clothing with us, if i'd know i would've definitely took extra clothing, my advise to people going to the mountain tour is take extra clothing then you can really get under the waterfall and enjoy to the fullest. Our car guide was a really wonderful person and spoke very good English language. He took us up to the highest point of the mount with his four by four and even helped some people who got stuck in the road. We also had a morocon meal at a families home which was delicious. I would highly recommend this three valleys mountain trip, if I go again I will definitely do this again, this take extra clothing."

We initially booked the day trip to Essouira straight from the airport with Morocco Attractive tours, and the pickup worked flawlessly with Abdoul retrieving us, rolling into a big black Prado toward the seaside port. The afternoon was full of memorable moments, from my mom picking up a mountain of argan oil creams and nut spreads and soaps (and my mom isn't girly!) from a woman-run cooperative, to my dad happily snapping away pictures of me holding an adorable 10-day-old baby goat in front of the famous argan trees filled with goats (that picture was worth a thousand Facebook likes), and to photographing the colorful city from atop an old fortress on the sea. My parents RAVED about this trip, so we knew we had to book another one, and with Abdoul! The next trip was even BETTER! The three valley trip to the Atlas Mountains is going to stick with us for the rest of our lives. You haven't lived until you have eaten the most delicious tagine in the world, with ingredients made in the tiny mountain-top village where you stopped for lunch, eating at a table overlooking stunning million-dollar views. Fifteen minutes further down the mountain, Richard Branson has his ridiculously luxe hotel with helipad built, but it doesn't even come close to breathtaking views that the place had where we ate lunch, with a local Berber family who invite guests into their home. My dad can't wait to start looking through the bajillion photos he took. Highly recommend this tour operator, and especially Abdoul for his knowledge, clear passion for his country and his people, service with a smile. I know my parents will hire this company again on their next trip back--there is still so much to see and do in Morocco!"

The guide was very friendly all the trip and always telling history costumes of Marocco. So it was wonderfull a true history live story. We stop for a coffe a toillets before we start to cross the valley. After that we stop to see local vilage and took some nice photos. You can see old people working in the farms and with goats... The view its wonderfulll trust it you will lose breathe. After that we went to Ouarzazate saw the local kasbah its good and you can take nice pictures of localconstruction. We prefered not to visit the studios because that was not the meaning of out trip we prefered local sights views and marocco things. After the visit to Ouarzazate we lunch in very good and also cheap place where they have european food. Abdul was kind to show us this place because we were tire of local marocco food.Next we got in car and went to Kasbah Ait BenHadoo This Unesco Place its worderfull local ancient village very old style we took Abdul advice took some water because the journey to the higher point with 40degrees you will need fresh water.We took excelent phots and stand to ser desert river and this wonderfull place. After that we return to Marrakech always talking to Abdul about diferences between Portugal and Marocco and history of these countries. This 3 hour trip was again a great history talk where me and my girlfriend learn alot abou marocco words food and traditons.ResumeTrip GreatDriver Very professional Helpfull and speaks very well englishThanks for the great dayRegards Joao and Helena"

We were picked up on time from our Riad, accompanied by our very respectful and knowledgeable guide and met our small group members, making four of us which was very convenient and personalized. The scenery, the views of green valleys, trekking the waterfall, taking pictures, Argan oil extraction visit, and crossing a bridge over the river were all things we've done in the first valley visit, Ourika! Then we went to the second valley through an off road that was not touristic where we saw Berber villages in the mountains, some even without windows that made us wonder of the tough life they live and the luxurious blessings we're surrounded with. There we had a delicious lunch with a kind Berber family in their house that has a breathtaking view over the mountains and was very authentic and clean. We didn't really \"do\" the last valley, that we just drove by and took some pictures of a famous resort there. There was an option to visit the artificial lake and the green plateaus, but our group members were exhausted after lunch and long day that we didn't take the extended version- yet I wish I had.

Great communication with the company (Sara) from the start and when in Morocco they were very accommodating when we had to postpone and reschedule the trip due to sickness of a family member.On the day we were met by Shakib on time and at the designated meeting point. We were a party of 4 and collected another couple nearby.Shakib spoke English very well and explained what the day had in store and continued to provide good commentary throughtout the day and answered all our questions.The itinerary for the day is pretty much as detailed in other reviews. On arrival at the first valley and where the waterfall is, we were introduced to our local guide who took us up the mountain to see the waterfall. Must say that without him some of us would not have got up the mountain. He was patient and very helpful and his cost was included in the overall price.The timing to the first valley was spot on as the crowds were building as we made our way down from the mountain and as we left the valley the traffic was increasing and I suspect if we tried the mountain climb any later it would have been manic.The lunch at the Berber house was excellent. Much has been said previously, but the food, our hosts and location were excellent. We had lunch with another party also from Morocco Attractive Tours. We will never forget the beautiful scenery and to top it all there was thunder in the background as light storm clouds gathered in the distance, but no rain. The trip continued to the last valley with plenty of stop offs for photos as required. Arrived back in Marrakeche on schedule. Overall an excllent day trip with a friendly and knowledgable guide who was professional, drove safely and we never felt rushed during the day. Thank you Morocco Attractive Tours."

They rang me back when I couldn't get through to confirm the day before and also rang me on the morning of the pick up to keep me updated on the arrival time of the driver.The morning started well with the happy smiling face of Abdul, our driver and guide. Although the trip was for 6 there were only 2 other people in the spacious and comfy minibus. Sunil from Paris and Emile from Tunis. My two children and I do not speak French but Abdul was brilliant at giving commentaries in French and English. He started even before we had left Marrakech with some background of the trip ahead and interesting details about the city as we were leaving it.Abdul knew good places to stop for photo opportunities along the way and gave good advice about the custom and practices of the street traders before we encountered them at the view points.We first stopped at the women's Argan oil collective. Very interesting to see how they use all of the plant without waste, even the husks of the nuts are used for animal feed. There are many products for sale from honey made from the flowers to cooking oil and cosmetics made from the nuts. Again the women spoke both English and French.Next was the trek up to the waterfall. It is about a half hour climb and is very steep and demanding. You will need stout footwear and a fair amount of energy to get up. Abdul handed us over to another guide for this bit. He too was very pleasant and helpful, with a hand up over the steepest and most slippery bits. I was amazed to see people carrying small children up here. At the top is a little cafe next to the lovely waterfall. I was also amazed to learn that all of the products for sale have to be carried up the same way we climbed. Nearly everybody takes shoes and socks off for a paddle in the pool. On the way down we stopped at the village craft co-operative. All the money raised from sales is shared fairly amongst the whole village. Worth a look around the craft stalls. After that, back in the minibus. Although it is climate controlled we sometimes chose to have the windows open. Next the scenic route to lunch. Many photo opportunities and Abdul would stop on request. He is very knowledgeable about the area and has done his job for some years. The guide books say not to give children gifts but apparently sweets, small coins and water during school holidays is okay.The Berber house was fascinating. Made from mud and straw and in a small village in the mountains, the women there managed to produce a huge feast, not just for our party but also for another group. We started with bread and olive oil with tomato and onion salad. Be careful not to fill up on that though because it is followed by tagine (my daughter had vegetarian by prior arrangement), then we were brought vegetable couscous with melon and mint tea to finish. Our table could not finish all the food. The surroundings and view for our meal were charming.The return trip past Jebel Toubkal, the highest mountain in the Atlas mountains and 2nd highest in Africa, was also spectacular. Abdul kept up his bilingual commentary all the way back to Marrakech. Even once back in the city he still had interesting facts to share about the palm trees.The two others were dropped at their hotel door. We were dropped as close to our Riad as a vehicle can get.I would thoroughly recommend this tour if you are in Marrakech and want to escape to the mountains for a day. Looking forward to our trip tomorrow to Ouarzazate."

Our guide Mustafa was amazing, good english, good spirit stoped everytime we wanted to take a picture and was very knowledgeable. The temperature is lower than in the medina and the hike to the ourika waterfall demands conffortable shoes and pants, if you do this you will be fine for the hike.The Lunch was better then a lot of the good restaurants we ate at the medina. And the view is just amazing. On the way back we asked to eat desert fruit and our driver Mustafa was lovely enought to select it for us. A must do trip for anyone coming to Marraquesh!"

It is along day and we went in July and it was very hot once out of the mountains so be warned particularly with children. The van was new comfortable, clean and the a/c worked properly and waiting for us when we arrived at the pick up a good all round start. Our guide / driver Abdul was excellent local to the mountains we were passing through, spoke perfect English (a big plus as This is often not the case here) and very knowledgable. The rest stops he chose on route were all immaculately clean and he stopped at the ideal photo points. He was not pushy but gave us the opportunity to buy when we wanted and spend extra time where we wanted, the secret of successful small group / private tours.The mountains and Ait Benhaddou are stunning and well worth the visit Ouarzazate less so but that's where Ait Benhaddou is. Ben Haddou is a world heritage site appropriately restored not overrun , in July anyway and some unusual souvenir opportunities, for example the burnt paintings. On the way back we had the opportunity to buy pure Argan oil directly from a women's cooperative. One of our party was sick in the bus on the return, this was dealt with by Abdul with the perfect mix of sympathy and efficiency, by the time we had finished with the sick person and ready to move on the interior of the bus including our bags etc had been cleaned and there was no smell left on the remaining journey. A job well done. With these small group tours the guide makes or breaks the tour and Abdul certainly made ours."

It was a long day, but well worth it, allows you to take some stunning photos and also being hosted by such a brilliant company makes the trip superb.

Having him there to guide us through the day really helped to enhance the experienceThe tour comprises a short drive from the centre of Marrakech to the foothills of the Atlas mountains before visting each of the three valleys before return to Marrakech in our case via an extended route taking in the Kik plateau and lake Takerkoust. Highlights of the trip include:- A short hike (approximately 20 minutes each way) to a local waterfall at the head of the first valley, Ourika.- Visiting a woman's compound where Argan oil products are processed with a range of cosmetic and culinary products are available- Taking a traditional Moroccan meal in a remote Berber village along the second Valley, Tahnaout (which was delicious and a bargain at only 120Dh)- Taking in the sights including North Africa's second highest peak, Toubkal, along the thrid valley, Asni. Along with many photo opportunities along the spectacular Kik plateau and by Lake Takerkoust.Overall our extended tirp (including the plateau and lake) took around eight hours and was a highlighly enjoyable experience and a great way to escape the hustle and bustle of the souks."

Me and my girlfriend felt so relaxed and happy without him the drive would have felt like forever, he was happy to stop and let us take pictures and everything nothing was a problem for him! Such a great man couldn't have asked for more!!!As for when we got to the waterfalls them self we were met by another brilliant man! His name was Ibrahim, a Berber native of the waterfalls for 17years! He knew everything there was to know about the place and spoke completely perfect English we thought he was from London haha!! He took us off the normal tourist route to show us all the olive trees and explain the color system etc, then took us to the oldest Berber house at the falls and gave us a tour which was amazing! He took us the long route round explaining everything on the way taking pictures for us and of us which was so nice of him! We took a long swim in the waterfalls and then lunch overlooking them - 3 course for 100mad! Bargain and super tasty! Our highlight was taking the little boat to under the waterfall and swimming in the waterfall where the water hits the bottom that was sensational and Ibrahim was taking pictures of us on his own back! We also got to meet WILD Monkeys! Came and climbed on us and gave us hugs etc and taking watermelon ( which Ibrahim had kindly bought to give to them). All in all this trip is an absolute must if your in Marrakech and you just have to go with this company! Couldn't fault in any way and cannot praise enough for everything! Thank you so much guys you made our holiday completely with this day your amazing!!!"

We did a 2 day tour to Ouarzazate to take in Ait Ben Haddou and to visit some of the old Kasbahs in that area. 2 days was a bit rushed, as we realised that you spent more time in the car than out, however, the scenery is without a doubt stunning.We had Abdoul as our guide who arrived spot on at the meeting point/time. He drove us over the infamous pass stopping at various vantage points to take in the mountain ranges and villages dotted around the mountain side.We drove to the Telouet valley to reach Telouet Kasbah. It costs 20DHM to get in per person and then you have to pay a guide 50DHM. I know it's not alot in pounds, but we kind of felt it wasn't value for money. Parts of the interior were beautful as the mosaics were still intact, but the guide's English wasn't that great, so he didn't really bring the story about the Kasbah and its history to life. We then had lunch in Telouet which was a tasty chicken tagine, but quite expensive (130DHM each) compared to prices you pay in Marakech, but one can only assume it's down to the fact that you are in the middle of nowhere. We were in fact, the only tourists there!We then went to Ait Ben Haddou where we stayed overnight at Riad Maktoub. As we were there late afternoon, the place was pretty quiet and Abdoul told us the way to reach the top. Unfortunately, it was an extremely windy day, so we didn't get a chance to sit and watch the sun go down from the top. We did however, manage to get some stunning shots of the different colours of the buildings as the sun went down.The following day, we briefly visted Ouarzazate and went to the Kasbah and the Cinema museum opposite it. After that, we went to Fint Oasis and visited a local Berber house, where mint tea was served and then it was back in the car for the long drive back to Marakech with a pit stop en route for lunch.I have to admit, not sure why anyone would do this as a day trip, as doing an overnight, doesn't really allow you enough time to get a better feel for the place. I reckon 2 nights in the region would be better to allow you to really soak up the feel of the place, which is different to uber busy Marrakech."

On other tours I have experienced drivers just get you to the destination without much interaction but not Abdul he was very kind and enjoyed teaching us about his country. When we arrived at Ouzoud Falls we were greeted by our guide for the day Abraham who was very nice. His English was very impressive! He was able to teach us a great deal about the Berbers, the Berber community and Ouzoud. We also enjoyed a nice hike through the mountain stopping at a nice Argan oil shop where they make it all by hand. Great experience! The restaurant we went to next to the falls was very nice, inexpensive with great food. There are so many tours that go to Ouzoud but this one was more personable than a large tour bus that only drops you off. I loved this tour. I give this company 5 stars for a job well done. I'm so glad we decided on going with this company."

Having a native of the region who cares passionately about the place and its people made for a great day whichever way you look at it.The walk to the waterfalls is challenging, but a big thrill, but the best bit was the Berber meal in the high Atlas without another tourist for miles. The contrast between the partched dry plains of Marrakech and the green river valleys of the mountains was magic."

My day in the Atlas Mountains was the highlight of my trip to Morocco, and it was all because of Morocco Attractive Tours. Prior to my day trip of the three valleys (booked via Viator) Sara from Morocco Attracive Tours emailed me to confirm my pick-up time and location, which I really appreciated. Our guide, Chakib, arrived right on time and took us to the three valleys where he provided us with plenty of facts and figures about each of the valleys we'd be visiting. Chakib was so kind to everyone, and always made sure we were comfortable and accommodated everyone on the tour really well (he's also a great photographer, too!). What I appreciated most was the thought that went into the design of our itinerary. We started the day a bit early, and it was worth it. By the time we had finished our hike to the waterfall we saw the hoards of tourists piling in to experience the beauty of the region, but because we had gone earlier in the day everything was quiet and just absolutely perfect, giving us what felt like a truly unique and personalised experience. Chakib informed us that other tour companies start later in the day, which means one's experience isn't as great. The lunch with the Berber family was absolutely delicious, and the views as we ate were spectacular! I was hoping for more interaction with the family, who did their own thing while we ate (maybe there was a language barrier?). We would've liked more of an in-depth explanation of how the tajine was prepared and more about their culture. Chakib did a good job of talking to us about their lifestyle, so that was good! Overall, the Three Valleys Tour with Morocco Attractive Tours was perfect, and I wish I had done more excursions with them! I'll be sure to book with them next time, and I encourage everyone going to Morocco to do the same."

We originally booked for the tour to one of the waterfalls, but when they confirmed with us they said that they recommended the three valleys tour which was slightly cheaper. They did make it clear they were happy if we wanted to stick by our choice but wanted to give us the option. So we ended up changing and I'm so glad we did. Our guide was friendly, knowledgable and his English was excellent. We stopped off to see Aagan oil being made and to taste the edible oil. We went to one waterfall and had a fun but tough walk to the top, clambering over rocks! Then in the third valley we stopped at a local house where we had a beautiful tagine. We were slightly worried we might feel a bit uncomfortable, like the family was \"on show\" like some awkward exhibit but it felt nothing like that. Infact our tour guide told us how they got to know the family as friends and how the money for the food went directly to the family (it was handed to them at the time, via the tour guide). The views were all beautiful and it felt so peaceful and relaxing, a perfect escape from the bustle of the Medina."

It was so nice to get away from the hustle and bustle of the Marrakesh. The valleys are all really different from each other but I though the third one was the best as it was the most peaceful and remote one. If you are staying in the medina they come and pick you up at a point close to your hotel (eg the central square). The guide was lovely and very knowledgable. You also stop for lunch at a small house (it costs 120d extra) and it was amazing. The view is simply stunning and the food is great and there is lots of it (you can skip dinner :) ). I loved the bread and the cinnamon orange for dessert was so good. I'm definitely going to try making this when I get home. The tagine was really good having been cooked properly over coals. The starter salad was also very refreshing. I highly recommend this tour it was the highlight of my trip."

He would open the car doors for us every time we stopped and take us to the best spots for pictures. He helped my wife carefully walk the trails as we went higher in the mountains, not pushing us past our limit. Overall, highly recommend doing this tour.

I was travelling with my daughter and our first two days in Morocco were not very impressive, since we were constantly haggled and felt very cheated. Although we hired a guide in the Medina we still did not know any history which would have connected us to the soul of the Moroccan people. We did the High Atlas Mountain and 3 valleys tour the day before we left and we were fully satisfied. Abdoul was so knowledgeable, kind and patient. He answered all my questions about the Medina, Riad, explained the history of the city, the people, schools and so much more. The Atlas mountains is a must see for everyone visiting Morocco. We had lunch in a Berber home and it was the most delicious food that we had eaten on our visit. We were graciously served and ate in the open air with an amazing view. My daughter is a camera buff and Abdoul was very patient and accommodating, we never felt rushed. Abdoul was simply amazing and the tour was the perfect ending of our trip."

We were picked up at 8am which meant we got to the first valley and walk to the waterfall before other groups got there. The trip is for up to 7 people but we were lucky in that we were the only ones on the trip so had a personal tour guide, Chikab, for the day. Our first port of call was to see how Argan oil is produced and was interesting. Next, we walked to the waterfalls in Ourika Valley was fantastic but you do need good footwear such as trainers as there are some steep climbs over rocks and a jump over the river which made it even more enjoyable for us. We were brought back down a different route. In total the walk was about an hour long. We were given time to have a drink by the riverside after our walk which was very welcome.We moved out to the Oukaimeden Valley where we had lunch in a Berber village family house with a fantastic view over the valley. The house is off the normal tourist route and the there were no signs of others except locals getting on with their normal day. It was interesting to learn how the Berber houses are constructed. Whilst driving along the valley we stopped to take photos several times, especially of the snow topped Mount Toubkal, the second highest mountain on the African continent after Kilimanjaro at 4,167mWe did not stop in the third valley, the Asni Valley, except to take photos but Chikab told us that it was an apple growing area.The contrasts between the three valleys was very interesting and Chikab kept us informed about things to look out for as we drove along.We added the trip to the Kik Plateau and the Takerkoust Lake which were interesting but, again, we only stopped to take photos.It was a really good trip out of Marrakech and was probably the highlight of our holiday."

On the day of our first tour, Abdul came to pick us up, on time, and we were on our way. On the way we were unable to pass because of dangerous weather conditions (snow on the mountains). Abdul seamlessly and graciously changed the tour to the Three Valley tour and worked with the other tour company to ensure that we were able to visit Ourazazate and Ait Ben Haddou on the next tour instead. To put the cherry on top, he was our tour guide again! We were especially thrilled because he is professional, VERY knowledgeable, and genuinely interested in learning about other cultures as well. Our long rides were always relaxing, safe, and entertaining. We had such a great time we plan to come back to Morocco and try out a few more of the tours with Abdoul (I'm not exaggerating).

It was one of the best decisions we made and this tour was just superb. We visited 3 valleys (Ourika, Oukimeden and Asni). Lunch which was served at a traditional Berber home in Oukimeden valley was awesome experience. Our guide on this trip was Chakib and he was very helpful, courteous and informative man who has so much passion for tourism, his area and nation. It's a 8 hour trip which picks you up and drops you at your hotel in Marrakech. Vehicle is a new Mercedes Mini Van which is very comfortable. Great Tour, a must visit on your trip to Marrakech especially for couples. Chakib, thanks for all your help and information."

            "review": "Superb way to see Morocco, highly recommended!. Booked two excursions with Morocco Attractive Tours before I left the UK as I wanted to see as much of Morocco as I could during my 5 day visit. Was called by Abdul the day before my first tour to confirm collection time outside my hotel to go see Ouarzazate and Ait Ben Heddou. Abdul was true to his word and was waiting outside the hotel first thing in the morning for the start of the adventure. We soon discovered that the police had closed the road to Ouarzazate, after discussions with Abdul we decided to see the 3 Valleys instead (which I was due to see 2 days later). Turns out that Abdul was born in the area and I lost track of the amount of local people that waved at us as we drove by! He was extremely knowledgeable and answered every question that we threw at him which made the trip even more enjoyable. Do not hesitate to book the trip to the 3 Valleys, beautiful scenery, fantastic hike up to waterfall (take shoes with good grip and a jumper), delicious lunch at a Berber house with more food than you can eat!Abdul was able to re-arrange the cancelled trip to Ouarzazate two days later and luckily the road over the mountains had reopened. This trip is even better for seeing more of the amazing scenery and mountain vistas. Would recommend this tour if you love film and want to see where Gladiator and Game of Thrones was filmed. The film studio tour itself was a little cheesy with props from films you have never heard of or seen! We were then recommended a roof top restaurant with fantastic food and views across the town and mountains. The owner took great delight in showing us a sign photo from Sir Ben Kingsley as he ate their whilst filming. Ait Ben Heddou was the highlight of the trip (just watch out of the guy trying to charge you 10 dirhams!), it is a world heritage site so complete free to roam around and take photos. Even though it was a long journey from Marrakech there is so much to see along the way the day flew by. I am planning to go back to Marrakech and will be booking another tour and requesting my new Facebook friend Abdul as my guide."

            "review": "Thank you to Abdul for being a wonderful guide during our stay in Marrakesh!. We initially booked Morocco Attractive Tours for a day trip to Ouarzazate and Ait Ben Heddou. On the day of the scheduled trip (which was on a Tuesday), the roads were closed due to snow. Our driver, Abdul, made the decision to take us on a trip to the Three Valleys instead. My friend and I had initially booked a trip to the first valley as part of a tour with another company two days later (on Thursday). We decide, however, that seeing the Three Valleys would be a great experience, given that we would be seeing much more than we would on our other tour. We were not disappointed. The trip to the Three Valleys was wonderful, and so was our guide, Abdul. He was incredibly knowledgeable about the area, and told us a lot about the culture, history, and geography of the area we were travelling through. He took us to hike the waterfall in Ourika, and then to eat at a Berber household in the mountains - the food was great, of course!After lunch, we were informed by the driver that Morocco Attractive Tours had contacted the tour company that we were scheduled to go to the first valley with two days later. Apparently, Morocco Attractive Tours informed the other tour company that we had already gone to the Three Valleys, and that we still wished to see Ouarzazate and Ait Ben Heddou. Abdul told us that the tour companies had decided that we could go to Ouarzazate and Ait Ben Heddou on Thursday and that he would be guiding us through that tour! Needless to say we were incredibly excited to have Abdul take us around again.As a side note, on Wednesday, we went to Essouira with another tour company, and the tour guide was not nearly as knowledgeable about the area as Abdul was. For example, when we met up with Abdul again on Thursday, we told him about our trip, and he mentioned areas that we should have stopped off at along the way, that we never stopped off at with the other tour company.Thursday's journey to Ouarzazate and Ait Ben Heddou was, again, very informative. Abdul was well-versed in the history, culture and geography of the location. He was a joy to be around, and recommended a restaurant that wasn't a tourist trap. Food was excellent. Abdul speaks several languages, including Berber, Arabic, English, French, and I believe he also knows some Spanish, and can understand a few more. If you travel to Morocco, I would highly recommend this tour company, but more than that, I would highly recommend that you request Abdul as a driver. You will not be sorry. You will come away with a much greater knowledge of Moroccan history and culture with him as your guide."

We've booked this trip as we thought we really wanted to see the other side of Marrakech.The trip started around 8am and we were picked up by the tour operator to explore three valleys of the Atlas Mountains. Our guide (Abdoul) was very friendly and informative, answered any questions we asked and overall made this experience one of the most memorable one. He was extremely knowledgeable of the local regions we were passing through and visiting as he grew up in the area; and was passionate about what he was doing. It was clear that he was enjoying his job and meeting lots of new people. This trip was not at all rushed - we were stopping by to take breathtaking pictures and enjoying our time. The scenery was unbelievable even if it was raining, thundering, snowing and hailstorm! Didn't matter - we still enjoyed every single minute. TIP: make sure you take some clothes with you and proper walking shoes as it can be quite dangers in a few places when you climb up the valley. Some places are quite steep, rocky and slippery, so take extra care.To sum up, a wonderful, fun and educational adventure you won\u2019t regret embarking on. Would highly recommend!!"

He was extremely knowledgeable of the local regions we were passing through and visiting as he grew up in the area; and was passionate about what he was doing.The scenery was breathtaking, and you were given ample opportunities to stop and take pictures or just take in the awesome sights around you. A couple of tips; there is a section where you are giving the chance to hike up to a waterfall, so make sure you are wearing suitable footwear, as it can be a bit of a rocky climb; and depending of the weather, the higher you go, the colder it gets! \u2013 So bring a spare jumper or something.To sum up, a wonderful, fun and educational adventure you won\u2019t regret embarking on."

Our fabulous guide Abdoul took me and 2 other people (who were just lovely) in a very comfortable 4 wheel drive. We left Marrakech in the morning. He stopped to explain what we would be doing and seeing. He might do this tour often but he made it fresh and alive as if it were the first time. His passion for Morocco and the depth and breadth of his knowledge made for such an exciting and educational day. I had no idea that Morocco was so gorgeous - cliffs the colour of the canyons in Utah and mountain peaks covered in snow year round and terraced gardens and irrigation and gorgeous villages tucked into hills and the mountain valleys. We had a grand hike up to a waterfall and later enjoyed a lovely lunch at the home of a Berber family. I look forward to taking more tours with Morocco Attractive Tours. Perfect day that I will treasure always."

We booked two excursions with the company, first trip was to the Three Valleys and the other was to Quarzazate & Ait Benhaddou. I can assure you both day trips were equally amazing. The company kept us update with meeting times via email. The tours were excellent and informative and this was especially credited to our tour guide Moustafa who made it one of the most memorable and best tours I have ever been on. Moustafa was professional, personable and polite but most of all extremley funny, his sense of humour was catching and he had everyone laughing throughout the day. The tour group was small with two other couples attending the tour which gave it a much more intimate experience. The trip to the Three Valleys was majestic with stunning views and captivating scenery with a visit to the Ourika waterfalls. The waterfall was amazing and the trek up there will be worth it. We then went to visit a village and watched some local women in the preparation of extracting the argon oil. We then went on to visit and enjoy the hospitality of a traditional Berber family who welcomed us into their home and whom cooked us a tasty, flavoursome and filling meal which was then followed by a refreshing cup of mint tea. It was really nice of the two lady's who cooked the food, to take the time and effort to give us a real taste of authentic home cooking. The views from the terrances were breathtaking with sections of impressive mountain layers, like most of the day another opportunity for a great photo shot. Afterwards we headed towards the Asni Valleys, high in the Atlas Mountains to soak up more of the beautiful Moroccan countryside and onwards to see the vivid sapphire blue Takerkoust Lake. The trip lasted about 9 hours, the time just flew by thanks to our guide Moustafa, who's enthusiasm, knowledge of the culture and fascinating stories kept us engaged all day. I would like to thankyou for showing us all the beauty of Morocco and Marrakech which was absolutely amazing, but the real hidden gem was meeting Moustafa the nicest person you could ever wish to meet, he has a real warmth and kindness about him and not forgetting his fantastic sense of humour. It has been an absolute pleasure getting to meet you and have you has our tour guide. I would like to say a big thankyou from Tash and Tracey. If you want a great day to remember for the rest of your life then I would fully recommend this tour."

These two other valleys felt very off the beaten track. We did not see any other tours for the entire afternoon and got to see some incredible views. The tour included a lunch that looked out on one of the biggest views I have every seen. The lunch was served by a Berber family and we were their only customers that day. Our guide was Mustafa who like others have written was full of fun stories, bad jokes, and enthusiasm for the entire trip. He told us so much about the culture of the Atlas Mountains and Morocco, and so much more.

If you're interested in Berber culture and its relationship to modern Moroccan culture, I recommend checking out this tour. The Berber meal was very good as well, although they served far more food than we could eat, and the price/quantity was non-negotiable (we thought we had opted out of the lunch, but that was not an option, and the only menu preference we could indicate was whether vegetarian, so not liking olives, for instance, was not taken into account...). Finally, I know it's unavoidable on tours like these, but the company clearly has deals with various people on the way, and we felt pushed to buy various products. All in all, though, this was a worthwhile way to get out of the city and see another side of Morocco."

But the whole trip gave an average feel for that day. We visited a waterfall which was a low drop one and more of a waste of our energy to climb the rocky pathway to see. We had good help from the mountain guide for a safe climb. The vehicle driver/guide was average in his guide role and most of the time we couldn't hear him as we were sitting in the 2nd row of the back seat of the 4x4 vehicle. I hope the company will take this point and install mic / speaker system for future tours as the drive/guide need to look forward to concentrate on driving rather than turn towards you at the back to speak. The only good highlight was to see the Berber community living and have a good lunch at a family house. Conclusion, we didn't feel that it was a great day out tour."

Informing us knowledgeably about everything we saw and taking us to the best spots! Argan Oil coop was so cool. As was the Ourika Falls hike. Absolutely unbelievable was the homemade Berber lunch prepared over the course of hours prior to our arrival and eaten in a cliffside home. Hospitality defined. If you don't take this tour, you've missed out on essential Morocco."

We met Abdoul at 8am at Jamaa el Fna (the main square) and we took a comfortable 3 hour ride in a spacious van to Essaouira. Along the way, we stopped for photos with goats grazing atop the argan trees (a sight to be seen)! We also visited a women's argan oil cooperative where they demonstrated how they produce the oil, and we had an opportunity to purchase authentic argan oil products as well. Abdoul provided us with a great deal of knowledge about the history of Morocco, so this further enhanced our tour. Upon arriving at Essaouira, we had some time to sightsee, visit the local souks, eat a seaside lunch and spend some time at the beach. A highlight was a camel ride on the beach, which is an optional part of the tour, but well worth the 100 Dhm ($10 USD)! Returned to Marrakech by 6:30/7pm in time to catch more activity and dinner in the Jamaa el Fna area. We highly recommend Abdoul, as he was an impressive and excellent guide!"

He has given us plenty of information during the tour and very helpful in everything. He is a fantastic guide and cannot complain about it. The highlight of the day was the traditional food served for our lunch (vegetable soup, chicken tajine & Morrocan couscous dish, fresh oranges + mint tea) while surrounded of the breathtaking view. Seeing the highest peak of the High Atlas Mountains (tallest mountain in North Africa) was a big bonus on our tour. A very unique experience for me & my husband."

We headed out to the mountains in his car and the conversation just flowed between all of us. The best part of the trip was heading through the Ourika Valley where Abdoul grew up, his stories from those times were awesome. I learned so much from him and he was very open to questions and answered them all wonderfully. He made sure that all of our questions were answered and he was very kind and thoughtful in his answers. We (my daughter and me) could hear the pride of growing up in his village, it was a great lesson for both of us.It was really great learning that Abdoul was on the 'neighborhood association' team, counting residents every week and working to make sure schools were available to all.The hike to the Fatima was not easy but Kamal made it very workable with all of his help, he was a great guide up to the waterfall. He helped pivot his foot to make our stepping up and down the rocks had good footing.Lunch in the Berber home was great, Adboul provided a lot of insights into the lifestyle and the food we shared, he was a great host for us.Abdoul was a wonderful guide, one of the best I have experieced in my travels. I would recommend anyone needing a High Atlas Mountain tour to ask for him."

So if you plan to take this day trip, make sure Mostafa is your guide who would make your experience a memorable one. :)"

Mostafa told us from the get go that it was \"our tour... our car...\" as to not hesitate to just say so if there was something we needed or something we wanted to see/spend more time at. You get to explore three valleys and hike to a waterfall, eat a delicious lunch in a village, and spend time at the lake. Mostafa knew some great spots to really take in the scenery and take photos.

Comfort - the vehicle was very clean and comfortable, which was great because the tour covers a great distance. The photo stops - an opportunity to take in the breath-taking scenery whilst giving your legs a little stretch. Our guide was patient, helpful and full of information. Timing - getting to the waterfall early was brilliant as it meant we avoided the crowds that arrived as we were leaving. The highlight - lunch in a Berber village. Lowlight - seeing the impact of climate change. Very little snow on the mountains at the end of December. It's quite sobering. Top tips: Wear shoes suitable for hiking. The waterfall is a bit of a climb, on sometimes slippery rocks. My trainers had insufficient grip. Wear a backpack and not a handbag or messenger bag. Again, a better choice for navigating the climb. Wear clothing that can be layered, esp in Winter. A (long-sleeved) t-shirt/top, a light sweater, a jacket and a scarf will ensure that you can respond to the differences in a) your body temperature (the hike will make you warm) and b) the variable climate. All in all a brilliant tour on my three-night Christmas break. Thank you."

Unlike many of the tours that just visit one Valley this one allows you to see how the landscape is very different across the mountain area. The pickup was on time, vehicle comfortable and our guide was awesome, the early start meant we had first dibs getting to the waterfall (it gets extremely busy later in the day). Our guide was always ready to answer any questions we had and was clearly well known with the local kids who were all very happy to see him.Our lunch inside a berber house overlooking the entire valley was a nice touch and the food delicious. My partner and i felt that this trip was not only informative and fun but ethical too with the local stops acting as support to the local people rather than just a tourist trap.We recommend this trip if you want a relaxed and informative day out.

Was picked up from the hotel early by our tour guide for the day 'Abdoul'. The mountains aren't that far from the centre really so the journey starts pretty quickly. There is so much to see that you had no idea existed so close to the driest desert! Abdoul would stop off (and always a gentleman opened the doors for us) to allow us good photo moments and would also take them for us, plus gave us information about the places. Remember to bring some good sturdy walking shoes as one of the stop offs is going with another tour guide (forgotten the name) who too us up the mountains to see some beautiful waterfalls. the higher we went the more amazing they are! You wont be going up the top of the mountain as that's a different tour. But where he took us was brilliant. He was very helpful, as quite alot of the walking included slippery boulders to climb! It's quite a brisk walk so not for those who lose breath easily. Lunch is provided at an extra cost (150d p/p). Mention at the start of the tour if a veggie as the lunch is in a Burbur house and they will need to prepare. The food was the best of the week and once again so much food was provided. Felt very bad for leaving some. It also gets a bit chilly, but the spectacular views make up for it. The ride back went through more villages and past Richard Branstons hotel in the middle of nowhere to another beautiful view of a lake. Adboul was very patient with us, as a young group of 6, we did take our time so the trip ran a bit late, but he wasn't pushy with us, just let us take our time. Would defiantly recommend this trip to all. Along day but if in Marrakesh for short time please squeeze this trip in."

He even captured the moments with great photography skills. Any questions we had were fully answered and it was like going on a trip with a friend. The entire day was spot on perfect, from the weather, the views and the splendid lunch served at a local berber house. Such great hospitality. even trekking up the mountain which was slightly tough was still and incredible experience and our tour guide was fully supporting us throughout with a help hand. Absolutely excellent excursion and fully recommend this, especially with Abdoul as tour guide."

This trip was the highlight of our holiday in Marrakech. Our driver, Abdoul, was very friendly and informative. He told us a lot about Morroccan history and society and provided a real insight into the people of Morrocco. He was punctual and helpful throughout the trip, and also a very good driver - essential when travelling on narrow roads through the mountain with numerous hairpin bends.We started out at 8am and drove straight to the Ourika valley, where we were met by a guide who took us up the mountain up to the spot where we could view the Ouzoud waterfalls. the climb was quite challenging but our guide was really helpful and always on hand to \"catch\" us as we jumped from rock to rock. The climb and the experience of venturing into the countryside of the Atlas mountains was one I will never forget. After returning back to the car we drove into the Oukaimeden valley where we went higher and higher until we arrived at a berber village where we were welcomed into a villager's house for traditional lunch of tagine and couscous. The view from the balcony was stunning and the lunch delicious.After lunch we drove on further through the mountains and were able to view Mount Toubkal which, in early November, had snow on top.The whole day was amazing."

We booked it through Viator and were very pleased. They used a local company named Morocco Attractive Day Tours. Our driver was Abdoul and he was GREAT!! His knowledge of the local area, Argan trees, the port area etc. was very informative. He's 30 years old, married and has a 3 year old daughter. Most importantly he was a very safe driver. He was punctual and delivered all that was promised. His suggestion for a restaurant for lunch was excellent. Great seafood. The fishing port was like going back in time a hundred years. We were there in October so the smell wasn't too bad. My guess is that in July or August the port would smell quite \"ripe\".One of the strangest things we have ever seen was on the way there. This is the only place in the entire world where Argan trees grow. There are goat herds in the area and they actually climb the trees to eat the nuts. They eat the husk and spit out the nut. Wouldn't believe it if I hadn't seen it myself. Google \"goat tree\" and you'll see. Pretty funny."

The car is very comfortable and even though all the seats were taken there was plenty of room for everyone (and I'm over 6ft tall). The lunch in Berber village was totally worth it so don't forget to take 15 euros or 150 dirhams in cash. Also make sure you wear comfortable clothes and shoes to climb the waterfall or you won't be able to do it. Bought some natural argan oil as well when we visited the ladies who make it. They will send you an email the night before about the pick up point so make sure you check it, especially if you live in the medina as the driver will have to pick you up at the nearest possible point. Overall it was totally worth it and I'm sure I'll use this company again when I go back."

The trip was not only a visit to the three valleys but also a cultural experience because we have learnt during this day a lot about the traditions of the moroccan people. This was mainly due to Abdoul, talking to him felt like talking to an old friend and he was very informative. We asked him a lot of questions about all the things that crossed our minds and he was very kind all the time and provided us a lot of details, even showed us photos with traditional weddings. The trip was very well planned: he picked-up us from our hotel at exactly 8 o'clock as it was agreed and after Abdoul presented us what we will see during the day just to give us a flavour about how things will develop. We reached the mountains and after telling him that we would want a camel ride he stopped in an amazing place for a 15 minute ride-enough to enjoy the experience i would say. After, we went for a trip in the mountains to the waterfall Fatima-very nice road and experience. the climb might be wet so be sure to take some proper shoes. Other highlight of the trip was the meal in a berber village! We ate traditional food (really traditional not what they sell in the medina under this name) in an amazing berber house from where you could see the whole valley. We stayed here enough to rest but also to enjoy the time with Abdoul when we found out a lot of things about the morocan lifestyle. We stopped in amazing places and during the trip Abdoul was very helpful and gave us a lot of advices about topics we were interested in.I know there are many companies with great ratings in tripadvisor but i can really say that this trip is something that i will remember always and we kept saying for hours after coming back in the hotel room what fabulous was the whole day."

Much of the credit for our memorable experience goes to our amazing driver and guide Abdoulaz who made us feel more like privlieged guests than tourists. Articulate, knowledgeable and passionate about his country and community, it was Abdoulaz who made our trip. The trek up to the waterfall was led by a local nimble footed guide (Kamil?) and lunch at the berber village was a highlight as we were driven through the Moroccan countryside with a different view and landscape at ever turn.

We went on a sunset camel ride which was fantastic. I was concerned the camels would be poorly treated but they seemed very healthy and well cared for and were super cute, especially the two babies who walked beside the adult camels. Our two guides were great fun and very informative, happily answering all our questions along the way. Every camel had a name and were happy to let us pet them. The second tour we did was to the Atlas Mountains which was our favorite day of the holiday. A full packed 8hours with Abdul, our very knowledgable and friendly tour guide. We visited the Argon oil atelier and trekked for an hour to the waterfall (we were in converse and saw one man in flip flops so not too extreme!) we were offered lunch at a local resto but chose to eat with a traditional Berber family in the mountains. Abdul promised it would be the best meal we have all holiday and he wasn't wrong! One tip, don't fill up on the scrummy starter, this was a 4 course meal! All for an extra 150d pp. Both tours were great value and so much fun! Must dos on both parts!"

Careful behind the wheel, amazing knowledge about places and their history as we drove along, stopping at great vantage points to take photos as we went. Included in our tour was a stop at a local co-operative to watch how argan oil is produced, well worth buying products as they are genuine.We then headed onto see the waterfalls, probably not the best and most exciting but the climb up to them was just great! Abdul, who was our guide, was friendly and very caring about all of us on the climb, helping each one of us to master some of the more steep slopes! The climb is not an easy one so wear good solid shoes and if you have any health or mobility problems, think twice before attempting it.One of the highlights was lunch with a Berber family - the food was absolutely delicious and their hospitality allowing us into their own home and being able to take photos was lovely.Having travelled fairly extensively around the world and taken various tours, I can honest say this is one of the better ones I have been on - the Company and their personnel are outstanding."

They were easy to contact by email and Sara fully responded to any questions I had about the trips. In the end I booked the Three Valleys day excursion as I was travelling with my mother who cannot walk very far, and that was the one they recommended for us. The guide Chakib, picked us up in the morning at 8:30am, not far from our hotel as we were staying in the medina, and it's difficult to get cars through the narrow alleyways. We were in a group of 7 people, and Chakib very expertly drove us to and around the mountains. We went to Ourika valley first where we had the chance to see some Berber women making Argan oil, and then onto the waterfalls. For this you need sturdy walking/hiking shoes, however since my Mum couldn't make the walk up to the waterfalls, we waited at a nearby cafe. Then onto the next village for lunch with a Berber family, which was excellent, a 3-course meal for only 150 MAD. The drive up to this valley was pretty hairy at times! I unfortunately, do not have a head for heights and was sitting in the front passenger seat, so had to quietly gulp and close my eyes! After the long relaxing lunch, we went to the final valley of Asni, where we stopped to take photos but not much else. Altogether it was a great day out to the mountains, with beautiful, stunning scenery. Our guide Chakib, was incredibly friendly and pleasant with a lot of knowledge about the mountains and Berber way of life. Most importantly, he was a safe and expert driver, getting us all back safely to our hotels. Would definitely recommend."

He expertly navigated the tricky Atlas mountain roads, all the while pointing out breathtaking vistas and sharing fascinating stories about Berber culture and life in the High Atlas. I would highly recommend this trip with Abdul as a welcome respite to the heat and bustle of Marrakech."

Here are a few of the more noteworthy issues or things that my friend and I feel a bit mislead on:- the drive out was 4.5 hours and back was 3.5-3.75 nowhere near the 3 hour mark listed on Viator's site where I booked the trip.- we never even had the chance to go see the film museums. The driver simply pointed at the studios and drove past. This was disappointing to say the least. - the Berber museum was closed for Ramadan, which we understand but should have been communicated to us with an option to decline the trip. Our driver didn't understand our surprise it was closed. - in Ouarzazate we drove next to one castle and then went to a 'museum' where the merchant spoke for a few minutes about Berber culture and then hounded us to buy rugs and other items. Not a museum by any standard. Our driver was nowhere to be found until he was done with his nap (understandable during Ramadan but gave us no option to leave this 'museum' early).- our driver was late. Not by a whole lot but still not a great impression. He drove quite fast (still the ride was longer than stated) but barely said a word the entire trip. - the UNESCO site was nice but our driver basically said it was old and a UNESCO site. Pretty obvious to anyone looking at it.- when I contacted the tour company to inquire about a refund they were responsive, offered a camel ride in 105 degree weather (wasn't possible for our itinerary), and said our driver was one of their best. No offer of a refund, totally lacking in sincerity. I've been to over 50 countries and this was easily the worst experience I've had concerning a contracted tour."

Guide had good english and communicated well when he wasn't fixed on keeping us on the road - although we had the advantage that most of us speak reasonably good French as well. A really hot day 44 C in Marrakech, but cooler once we had some altitude. The walk to the Ourika falls (with a separate guide) was not easy - and occasionally challenging for those of us into our 60's - and good walking/trekking footwear should be advised in advance. The climb into the higher Atlas mountains was visually spectacular - but only people with a good head for heights should sit on the valley side of the car. The setting for the Berber lunch was breathtaking."

This seamless service was fantastic, easy, and quick to book the tour. The tour itself was amazing and we had a fantastic time! The wild monkeys were a personal highlight of the trip, along with the little boat trip out to the waterfall itself (this was at your own cost but well worth doing) Abdoul our driver made our holiday in Morrocco, so much so we booked another two trips through him and the company! He is a credit to this company and takes great pride in showing the real Morrocco to his customers. We also went on the Three Valleys trip which was again brilliant. The lunch was amazing - real authentic Moroccan cuisine, in a typical berber house! We finished our holiday with a Camel ride, a must when visiting Morrocco. These trips are worth every penny and are 100% worth booking. Thank you Abdoul and Attractive Day tours for excellent service! This really is a company you can trust to deliver prompt, personal, and quality service."

Abdul took his time to explain what we would be doing on our trip (plus any options available to us) before we set off. During the trip we were offered every opportunity to get out of the vehicle to take photo's when we wanted. Abdul spoke very good English and, having grown up in the area, was very knowledgeable and enthusiastic. The Ourika waterfalls were worth every minute of the walk to access them. I did notice that some people in other groups were wearing flip-flops which I wouldn't recommend. The scenery in the valleys is absolutely stunning. Lunch was superb. I am not a particularly good passenger but I felt safe and confident in Abduls driving throughout the tour.I would thoroughly recommend this day trip if you have the time."

We highly recommend this tour for anyone wanting to experience a well organised and authentic experience beyond their Ryad or hotel. Our driver Abdul spoke excellent English and was a very accommodating host. He took the time to ensure we had comfort and photos stops and spoke very knowledgeably about the area he grew up in. He knew many of the local people and arranged for a guide (Kamal) to escort us up to the Ourika waterfalls. Kamal was a great help especially as we got closer to the top of the trail which was quite steep. It was not a difficult hike but certainly got you breathing a little heavier as we neared the top. The scenery was well worth it and we were very happy to have done this early in the morning as opposed to later in the day when it was hotter. We noted many people chose not to use a guide but we were very keen to support the local people involved in tourism as a thank you for letting us share their wonderful environment . Many of the tours only do one valley but the addition of two more and the lake is well worth it if you have time. We really enjoyed the lunch in one of the villagers homes which was so tasty and was all local organic produce - a welcome introduction to Morrocan food. The scenery is stunning and so different from what we have seen elsewhere. Thank you Abdul and Kamal for making this trip one of the highlights of our three month travels through many countries."

They were both fantastic especially drinking mint tea by the river and the mountain village lunch blew my mind!In last valley, Chakib gave some quality details on the local village and discussed the many fruit orchards. We stopped for a brief photo opp along a switchback and saw Richard Branson's Hotel glimmering in the distance.

I booked this for myself and my two fellow travellers before we left home, but I wasn't really sure what to expect because I could only find a few reviews. Well! What an experience! All went exactly as planned. We were collected exactly on time by our driver / guide in an SUV and then driven to the Palmerie on the outskirts of the city for our hour-long camel trek. The guide had great English and provided a running commentary about the areas we passed through as we drove. When we arrived we saw the camels and their handlers. We were kitted up in headscarves and tunics and shown our camels. There were lots of opportunities for photos before, during, and after the ride. Our camel leader who had no English but did speak French offered to take our cameras and took loads of photos during the trek. He even took some video on one of our cameras that we didnt see until the next day! One of the camels Shakira had a baby who was three months old who walked alongside her for the trek. It was very cute! In fact all the camels were lovely.Halfway through the trek we stopped at a traditional Berber house for tea and a small pastry served by the lady of the house. It was lovely, but the house was hot! Then we remounted for the rest of the trek. As he walked, our guide picked long grasses which he made into camel shapes amazingly skilled! and he gave each of us one as a souvenir. He was very sweet and clearly loved the animals. We were then collected by our driver who stopped on the road home so we could take photographs of the beautiful sunset. We were all stiff and sore the next day because camel saddles are not soft, but it was so worth it! I highly recommend the trip. Indeed, I would say its a 'must-do' if you go to Marrakech!"

They took us first thing in the morning before it got busy. The Berber village lunch was also great! That was the best tajine we had whilst in Morocco with an amazing view. Based on the description, we expected to eat WITH a Berber family but it turns out that they MAKE and SERVE you lunch. Still, we loved this tour and would absolutely recommend it. Abdul was an excellent guide and safe driver!"

We made the original booking for the trip to the Ourika Valley, Kik Plateau and Lake Takeroust via Viator, and a lovely gentleman called Abdul came to pick us up in a 4 x 4. Abdul, our driver and guide was a friendly and knowledgeable chap, who hailed from Ourika Valley itself, so it was absolutely fantastic. He told us all about the atlas mountains, the ways the Berbers live in the mountains, the climates, fauna and landscape, everything else you needed to know. The drive through the Atlas mountains was simply breathtaking. The scenery and landscape was outstanding. We encountered hail, snow, sleet, rain, wind, sun, absolutely everything on our drive. We also made stops along the way for photos.During the trip we also visited the Argan Coop. Although it was a pleasant learning experience, we didn't buy anything as we found it expensive (genuine Argan is quite pricey according to Abdul). Our visit to the Setti Fatima waterfalls, was quite something. To our surprise, we found ourselves actually rock climbing vertical cliffs (jumping over waterfalls, crossing broken rickety bridges, wet rocks, and sometimes going on all fours) with our guide who promised to keep us safe. Several visitors did not have appropriate footwear or clothing, and the trek was a bit dangerous. I wouldn't recommend the trek to Setti Fatima waterfalls for young children or the elderly, or those who lack a certain level of fitness. The lunch at the Berber village was amazing and delicious. Unfortunately it turned a bit cloudy as we drove across the Kik Plateau so our views of the Lake weren't as impressive. But the trip wasn't a disappointment, far from it. I highly recommend this tour.."

Our tour guide Abdul immediately introduced himself and made us feel welcome. We drove up to the Atlas Mountains where we had regular pit stops for taking pictures. Be prepared to have your breath taken away! The scenery is stunning and the relaxing atmosphere makes a nice change from the craziness of the medina markets. If it's a bit cloudy, we'd recommend taking a light jumper or sweater as it gets a bit cold up in the mountains. We had our own tour guide take us up on the Atlas mountain, as other reviewers have said, make sure to wear sturdy walking boots or trainers. It took about an hour to climb up and down, it's definitely not for the faint hearted, think rickety wooden bridges and crossing the waterfall streams with a good metre between each stepping stone. I did fall in a few times (not extremely, wet socks were the worst I had to complain about!) but our tour guide was very experienced and I had my utmost confidence in him guiding us. The views are stunning, particularly the waterfalls, haven't experienced anything like it, it's been the highlight of our trip so far! We then drove for about an hour (which was the perfect opportunity to sleep off the exhaustion of climbing a mountain) We arrived at a traditional Berber village up in the mountains and had an amazing lunch. I don't want to give too much away, you just need to experience it for yourself!! We then drove back down and got back to the city around 6pm. Feeling exhausted, exhilarated and happy. Maybe don't plan too much for the evening as you'd be surprised by how tiring the day can be, or maybe that's just us! Wholeheartedly recommend this trip, you won't regret it!"

The guide Berber Abdul spoken excellent English, among his Berber, Arabic, French, Spanish and Italian!! Without his amazing knowledge we would not be able to understand much of what a beautiful country it was. He has driven us all through the three valleys, sent us for a hike to the waterfall and finished off the day with homely cooked lunch at the Berber house up high in the mountains, we were truly lost for words. The hospitality, the views and an absolutely wonderful weather made this trip very memorable. If we ever decide to go back, it will definitely be with them again to see the Sahara."

It is a long day, but it is completely worth it to see more of the country than just Marrakesh and close surroundings. Our guide spoke excellent English, knew a lot about everything we came across and was willing to take us to any of the places we wanted to go see and stop along the way whenever we wanted to take pictures.The trip started with a stop at an Argan oil producer, which was quite commercial, but luckily also an opportunity to have a drink and a stretch after the first two hour drive. We made several short stops along the way before arriving in Ouarzazate, which has several movie sets (gladiator, mummy etc.), a film museum and an old kasbah. We also had lunch here in a restaurant with a nice view.We continued to Ait Benhaddou, which has several old kasbah on a mountain top. The landscape around it is just beautiful to watch.Most impressive is the landscape changing so often during the trip. We didn't feel bored one single bit during the trip and were looking out of the window all the time, just taking in the views of the desert with the snowy mountain tops, the berber villages and the green plateaus along the river. Even though the route is quite touristic, it was an amazing experience!"

Without hesitation we can recommend the trip and would be happy to go on another tour with our guide. If you are considering booking this trip, please note that there are many web sites offering exactly the same tour with great differences in price. Make sure to compare them and also check for their e.g. tripadvisor ratings. We've read many bad reviews from other agencies and were very happy to have found a solid offering from Morocco Attractive Days."

I also agree with previous reviewers that although I have absolutely no objections to paying the 'extras' on the day, I would have preferred to have paid the guide directly for escorting us up to the waterfall and the Berber family for cooking lunch.However the costs for this was all paid to the guide so I wonder how much they actually received? Perhaps the tour can answer this question for us? Still, if you visit Marrakech you must do this excursion."

I think we saw all four seasons in one day! It was interesting to stop and see how Argan oil was made in the Ourika valley and the Berber lunch in the second valley was by far the best meal we ate on our whole entire trip!!

There were only 6 participants in addition to our guide so we each got a lot of personal attention and were so well looked after. To be noted as well is that we traveled in a very safe vehicle with an extremely cautious driver--there are many hairpin turns on the journey.The scenery is absolutely spectacular. While there are some challenging areas to climb and hike, we were given a lot of help and well advised if we should not take in a part of the strenuous hike.We learned a lot about life in Morocco outside of the big city and of the Berber culture and life style in the small mountainous villages. Also we enjoyed a fabulous authentic meal which will never be forgotten.If you have a day to spend touring outside of Marrakech, my family and I would highly recommend that you make this adventure a part of your Moroccan experience."

Many companies could learn a lot from our driver/guide's customer service skills and he was also an excellent driver. This was useful on a sometimes hair-raising trip (a number of rocks on the road after heavy rain the night before). We unfortunately had to miss out the walk to the cascades, due to the wet conditions, but got some exercise when we volunteered to help clear the road of rocks at one point. We then drove higher into the mountains and into heavy snowfall! From sun to rain to snow and then cloud/fog...certainly an eventful day weatherwise, accompanied by some stunning scenery.Lunch at the Berber village provided the best food we have had so far in Morocco and we were happy to pay the additional amount direct to the Berber cook for this service.All in all a great day out from this small, but perfectly formed, tour company."

A guide is not essential but beneficial.Berber village lunch is excellent- the views are stunning.The points to ponder:-it's a nature tour so I don't understand the obligatory argon oil cooperative visit!!!!-stops at stalls on the climb to the waterfall-include the additional prices to the tour -approx 25 Euro and advertise with this inclusion (it's not possible to have lunch anywhere else or decline a guide to the waterfall)-if the above additional payments are not included on the advertised tour rate then let us pay the guide (to waterfall) and the Berber women (for lunch) directly rather than pay the driver at the end. (As I am uncertain how much the guide or Berber women actually get for their service)However I would highly recommend this tour or a similar if you are in Marrakech.

In our Riad, unfortunately the guy didn't know where it was and sent us to the wrong address. Eventually we managed to find it, but when you have a pick-up time of 7:30am it can be very stressful. I would recommend the company to provide a more appropriate and informative email. A hyperlink or image to a map showing the exact point would be nice. Everyone uses google maps in Marrakech, including our Riad and taxi drivers, but they couldn't help us finding the pick-up point provided by the company.Anyway, this was just a minor inconvenient which we were lucky to solve.

Most valley tours cover only one valley so this tour was one of the very few. The excursion was with 4 people including us in a comfortable 4x4. At the Ourika valley we had a stop-over to hike up to see the waterfall. It cost a bit extra to have the guide take you to the top (not for the faint-hearted) but was a great experience, and well worth it.At the Oukaimeden Valley, the views were amazing, driving along the roads carved on mountains. We had a stop-over and saw how argon oil was made then, we stopped and had lunch (extra expense) in a Berber home, it really was an excellent authentic cooked lunch. While we ate we had spectacular view of the valley.We then saw the last valley (Asni Valley) which was uniquely different. Through-out the day there were plenty of stop-overs to take pictures with the camera.Our guide deserves a special mention, he was very professional and well-spoken english. He mentioned a lot of interesting facts throughout the day and it was very easy for us to ask questions. During the drive, whenever he noticed that we want to take a picture, he would stop for that moment. Before the trip day he also went out of his way to recommend us to have the tour on another day due to the forecast so the mountains were clearer to see and Oukaimeden Valley was open. The email communication was also quick.I would highly recommend this excursion with Morocco Attractive Day Tours."

We are so glad we took his advice, as this was a spectacular day out.In the first valley, Ourika, we crossed a wooden bridge hanging above the river, and then climbed with a local guide to see the waterfall. The climb was challenging in some places, and we were very glad that we had sturdy hiking shoes and were reasonably fit. The waterfalls were pretty, the view was lovely and we enjoyed a drink at the top before making the descent. Along the walk there are several local Berber sellers with jewellry, woodcraft, rugs and ceramics. There was no real pressure to buy anything, and we enjoyed watching the Berber wood craftsman using his 'Black and Decker' original drill to make holes in stone lanterns.In the second valley - Oukaimeden, we saw a totally different landscape. Flooding of the rivers in November had destroyed some of the roads, but we felt totally safe with Chakib's careful driving. He took us off the main road to do some 4WD and take a different route to the village where we had lunch in a local Berber house. This was the best part of the day - the people were very friendly, the view from their roof terrace was absolutely spectacular, and the food was amazing. This was by far the best tagine we had in Morocco - there was plenty of food (soup, tagine, couscous and fresh oranges for dessert) and it was tasty and hot. It was great to see how the family live and to meet some of the local children.The third valley was Asivi. We chose not to have a camel ride, but enjoyed going through one of the main villages where it was market day and it was amazing to see the organised chaos of all the men in the market.I can't praise Chakib highly enough - he is a safe driver, very knowledgeable about the local area, traditions and people and very happy to share what he knows and answer questions. We had a wonderful day and will be recommending this tour to others."

It was really worth seeing a different side of Marrakech, which overall was a fantastic experience. A big plus was the small group of only five people. However, I would advice to bring good walking/climbing shoes and comfortable clothing. Even though it was a sunny day, it got really cold up in the Mountains. With that said, I would also highly recommend eating at the berber-house, the tagine was one of the best I've eaten so far during My stay in Marrakech. Thank you for a very memorable experience!"

I had booked the 3 valleys tour via the British Airways website as it looked the most interesting.The tour was well organized and we were picked up from our Riad inside the Medina, and our tour guide Jawad made it even more special. He was lovely, helpful and accommodating. Ourika was the first valley we drove to. The children got to enjoy a dromedary ride on the way. The valley was beautiful, the mountain tops were covered in snow! We decided to take the trek up to the waterfall under the expert guidance of our Berber guide Kemal. On the way we decided to make a quick stop to cross one of the hand made hanging bridges and take lots of photographs of the mountains.The next valley Oukaimeden was my favourite. We drove nearly 2000m up into the mountains, and the view was simply amazing. The rainbow colours of the mountain, the little Berber villages clinging to the mountain side and the snow on the higher mountains made me feel like I was standing in the middle of a beautiful painting. We had lunch at a traditional Berber house. The house and the hammam really intrigued me. I wish I could have spent a night there, it was so peaceful. The food was delicious, traditional Tagine, Cous Cous and the most delicious oranges. The third valley Asni was beautiful too. We got to see Mount Toubkal the highest mountain in the Atlas mountain range.I highly recommend this tour, it was the highlight of our short but wonderful trip to this beautiful country with beautiful and kind people. Especially the children up in the mountains, they stole my heart! Thankyou Jawad for making this trip so memorable."

We booked the trip online a few days in advance. As the weather was forcast to be a bit foggy & rainy, they emailed us to ask if we wanted to re-schedule for a different day which was a really nice touch. Fortunately for us we went ahead on the Tuesday as planned & the weather was wonderful. We were picked up right on time at our hotel & our driver was excellent. Due to the flash flooding the weekend before some of the roads were blocked or unsafe & this meant we were unable to see the waterfall - but there was still plenty to see & enjoy. The womens co-operative producing the Argan Oil was very interesting & all the women there lovely & very helpful. The driver was happy to stop as often as we wanted for photos of the scenery - the views - wow! I expected lovely views - its spectacular. Being in a car rather than on a bus meant we could go up & down 3 valleys on tiny twisting & turning roads. We had the option to have lunch at a Berber village for an extra charge This was by far the best meal of our stay in Morocco. The young woman who cooked had prepared the most delicious meal of soup, tagine (meat & veggie options available), cous cous & fruit. The setting was spectacular - a table is set on the roof terrace with amazing views over the valley and the only sounds are from the animals & the occasional passing car. We would highly recommend this trip - a great day out, beautiful scenery & amazing food. A real highlight on our trip to Marrakech. "

We booked a three-valley tour (including a hike to a waterfall, a visit to local Berber ladies making Argan oil, and a homemade lunch - by far the best of our trip - in a Berber village) and it was fantastic. Chakib, our fluent-English driver, was helpful, wonderfully friendly and really informative. He also gave us the flexibility to see and do what we wanted, including stopping off just to walk across one of the old rope-and-wood bridges crossing a melt-water river below. The views were fantastic, we saw so much in one day, and it was brilliant both to see the snow-capped Atlas mountains, and to put Marrakech in its geographical and historical context. Fantastic value for money (I felt sure I must have converted the currencies incorrectly, but no) and we can't thank Chakib enough."

In order to fully visit Morocco, I did a lot of research online and came across this company, with an excellent offer of tours and inherent price, and boy, I was completely right!From Sara, during the booking, to Chakib and Youssef, the staff was impeccable. Chakib was our first acquaintance providing the airport transfer, and the first day tour in Marrakech. He is a really easy going guide and you can naturally see that he is enjoying what he is doing. By checking our tour he was proactive and also advised us to visit the desert, and at the end that was one of the highlights of our trip.Youssef was then our driver for the rest of trip, driving around 2000km around Morocco, to visit the highlights and get to know all kinds of realities and landscapes that the country can offer. Youssef was a bit more reserved person, compared to Chakib, however was also able to provide valuable information and navigating us around easily, in the chaotic Moroccan traffic. If you really want to visit the country this is the company to use! The riad/hotel selection was great, specially in Fes and Marrakech. The meal selection is something that I would improve during this tour, since the quality has differed a lot, from very good to less good.I want to leave a big thank you to Chakib, Sara and Youssef for making our stay in Morocco safe and memorable.Some tips for you travelers:- Not related to the tour but remember that the first thing you need when you arrive to Morocco is... a pen!! That's right, you need to fill a form and there is no pens available anywhere (and the airport staff will not be willing to help you). To not relay in a friendly tourist do not forget to carry one.- When you book this tour you are booking a driver and not exactly a guide. Guide's are optional and come with a price. A guide for Fes is almost mandatory to know the city, and Adib (if I remember correctly), was a perfect guide there!- I would only advise the company to make the prices more clear in the website. The shown prices are without accommodation, and additional costs like guides. My budget had a lot of flexibility but the extras may scare some people that would be willing to book with you."

I have wanted to visit Marrakech and the Atlas Mountains for 12 years, finally made it!The tour was wonderfully organized and we were picked up on time by our guide, Jawad.He was very charming and I was able to practice my French with him. Besides my husband there was only one other passenger,we picked him up in the Medina.We were driven in the 4x4 to the first Valley,this was breathtaking, the mountain tops were covered in snow! We headed up to the Waterfall, we opted to take this optional tour (extra cost) with a local guide. On the way we stopped several times for photographs and also at a Berber village to learn about the Argan Oil,of course we ended up making a purchase! The track up to see the waterfall was a great experience,there were restaurants and shops on the way, the trail was a little precarious so one needs to wear either hiking boots or shoes with good soles, I did not, I was wearing Toms! The tour then continued to the next Valley where we had lunch at a Berber house,exclusive to this tour operator. The food was delicious,hot vegetable soup, we needed it because we ate on the roof and it was cold, followed by Tagine of chicken and fruit then Cous Cous with vegetables,to finish local apples and tea. The trip back through the third valley was also spectacular, a windy road that Jawad mentioned he knew every curve and could drive it with his eyes closed,to which we exclaimed,please no!!!!He pointed out a hotel owned by Richard Branson that was by the side of the river.I can highly recommend this tour, do not go to Marrakech without experiencing it! One final note everyone we met was very friendly and the children adorable,it was a holiday so they were not in school.Do take some sweets for the children in case you should come across them."

Our guide for the first three tours, Chakib, spoke excellent English and his knowledge of the areas we visited really made each tour interesting and informative. His driving skills negotiating the High Atlas mountain passes and the medina of Marrakech was superb. The trip to Ait Ben Haddou and Ouarzazate were fabulous trips with spectacular scenery and superb examples of traditional Moroccan towns, villages and \u00a0Kasbahs. The three valleys trip was amazing! Three totally different landscapes with so much to see from cascades of water from the snowy peaks of the mountains in the Ourika Valley, to wide open spaces of\u00a0Oukaimeden valley with a lunchtime reservation overlooking a landscape that will stay in your memory for ever. The meal, specially prepared by the Berber family was delicious and well worth the additional cost. Finally the trip ends in the green Asni Valley where each turn of the road produces another heart-stopping view. The final trip with Chakib to Ouzard Fall's (probably my favourite tour) will amaze you! 100 metre high falls that tumble into a lagoon of crystal clear waters below will mesmerise you with their outstanding beauty. Macaque monkeys watch over you as you take the winding steps to the bottom of the falls and once again we were treated to the best table in the restaurant over looking these majestic falls. The last trip to Essaouira which was led by Muhammad is \u00a0well worth the visit. The journey through wide open spaces of the country is breathtaking, and the arrival at the seaside town is clean and tidy. Again the guide suggested places to visit and eat and even gave tips on haggling for decent dinner prices! All in all I would have no hesitation of recommending all of the tours we attended. And by no means least, I would certainly recommend the drivers. Both Chakib and Muhammad were courteous, well spoken and excellent drivers. They were extremely punctual and got us back exactly on time each evening. Excellent value for money and the only real way to appreciate the wonderful scenery of Morocco! \u00a0"

            "review": "Fun and scenic excursion led by an entertaining guide. Recommended.. My girlfriend and I had a fantastic time on this excursion, given by our driver Chakib who was friendly, made great conversation, and was a safe driver. His English is also fantastic, which made it easy to communicate.Our day started with a prompt and easy pickup in the Jemaa el-Fnaa square. On our particular excursion we were given the following options for experiences: 1) a camel ride 2) an Argan oil shop run by a women's co-op 3) a hike to a waterfall and 4) lunch in a Berber home.On the way to our first visit, we opted to skip the camel ride. Honestly the camel experiences seemed set up like taxi line for various excursions by the side of the road and didn't look that scenic. We didn't feel like we missed much.The Argan oil shop was basically mandatory, and was incredibly touristy and basically a gift shop. We had expected as much. It comes with the territory when you book any excursion - and both having been veterans of bus tours in Asia, I have to say they were incredibly laid back when it comes to the sell. It could've been way worse. After watching a demonstration of the manufacturing process, we were given mint tea and samples of different products. We were courteous and bought an item. Overall this stop was an expected and necessary hassle of day trips and we were glad it wasn't too time-intensive.When we arrived in Ourika Valley, we took the hike. The guide for the hike was extra (I can't recall the exact amount but it wasn't too much). We opted for the guide, and were actually glad we did. While the hike might not be difficult for some, it is a steep and endless stairmaster that went on for about 30 minutes. The lower part of the hike went through gift shops filled with artisanal crafts (much like you'd see in the souks of Marrakech), but the upper part was all trail. Some parts are a little technical requiring some climbing over boulders and putting your legs through narrow spaces. We noticed a lot of Moroccans doing the hike too. At the top, there was a small pond at the base of the waterfall and plenty of people wading in to cool off, and taking selfies. It wasn't much to look at but it was a pleasant and entertaining experience. After the hike we took a break. Locals apparently love to hang out along the riverfront and IN the exposed riverbed. We grabbed some sodas to cool off after the hike down.After the waterfall hike, we drove to the Asni Valley for lunch. In fact, this was probably the longest drive in our excursion (I think it might've been a 2 hour drive), filled with gorgeous views of the mountains, occasionally interrupted with quaint little hillside adobe Berber villages. We stopped for lunch in one of the last Berber villages along the drive, near the highest point on the road. Chakib informed us their lunch at the Berber home was an exclusive arrangement with the village elder's son, and no other excursion outfitter had such an option. In fact, few even drove to these 3 valleys - which was evidenced by the fact that we didn't see another 4x4 SUV on the road or during the hour we sat for lunch outside. Lunch was superb - one of the best tagines and certainly the best couscous we ate while visiting Morocco. Chakib joined us for lunch and we learned a lot about how he and his business partner run Morocco Attractive Tours. Honestly that was probably more interesting to us than learning about the Atlas Mountains, or the Berber village life. What is it like to be Moroccan? How do you run and grow a tourist business? Anyway, I digress. Lunch was great - the view was amazing: 360 degree views of the entire valley. We even had a brief thundershower to watch while we ate.The way back was pretty uneventful, but equally beautiful as the rest. We drove through the Oukaimeden Valley on the way back. One highlight was passing through the set of Mission Impossible 5 as they prepared to film on the road.Overall, we had a fun day in the mountains and were glad to have chosen this company. Sure there are some usual day trip tropes - like the shop - but the scenery was spectacular and we learned a lot about Moroccan life as we chatted with our driver Chakib."

            "review": "Stunning ride - underwhelmed by the destination. We travelled on the day tour to Ouarzazate & Ait Benhaddou from Marrakech. This was booked through British Airways, and all the booking and arranging pickup (which we did by email) worked like a dream - we were picked up at our hotel right on time. After a detour into Marrakech city to pick up another couple we were off onto the road, and the trip out was stunning, through the breathtaking and massively scenic Tizi-n-Tichka pass. Our driver was expert and obviously knew the road well, so we made good time despite the twisty, winding road which somehow forged a path through the Atlas Mountains, doubling back on itself multiple times and clinging to the side of ridges, often with a sheer drop on both sides. It's not a road for the nervous traveller, but it's a wonderful experience.There were also plenty of stops, for toilets, refreshments and sights on route and the guide was friendly and helpful with superb command of English and all the trip was relaxed and informal. So much for the journey - but the purpose of any journey is to arrive somewhere, and that's where this experience went slightly awry. We'd initially selected this trip because of the Atlas Film Studios, based in Ouarzazate and home of the Morroccan film industry. On arrival in Ouarzazate we drove past this and it was pointed out, and we went into the town centre, where we had an hour to ourselves, either to visit the kasbah or visit the film museum. We opted for the latter - but it was closed for lunch (!) so we explored, had a quick wander around the kasbah and grabbed a snack. Once back in the 4x4 we went off, stopping to take pictures of the Atlas Studios but only from a good distance away, and we then went off to Ait Benhaddou. This is a stunning UNESCO World heritage site, a Berber village clinging to the hillside and a must-see experience. However, we were allowed 1 hour 50 minutes there, which is a bit odd as it could easily be visited in less than half this time. We found ourselves spending the best part of an hour sitting in a cafe at the foot of the town, effectively killing time. The journey back was uneventful and we got back to our hotel at 7.15 pm after a very long day (11 hours & 45 minutes, with a lot of travelling). A day worth it for the experience of the pass, although I can see how many might find it long and wearisome. The 4x4 was comfortable enough, but, let's be honest, any vehicle with three adults in the back will get a bit uncomfortable after 8+ hours of travelling on winding roads. So you do need a certain amount of stamina for a trip like this.The thing we're more than a bit miffed about is that things seem to have got a bit lost and confused in the middle of the day. For instance : - being taken to the Museum of Cinema when it's closed for lunch (surely it closes for lunch at that time every day?);- not being offered a visit to Atlas Studios (our main reason for choosing this destination, and - annoyingly - we now see that Atlas Studio Tours are available, they're even listed on the company's website!)- we're not quite sure what happened to the promised \" lunch in a restaurant with a panoramic view \". This seemed to evaporate somewhere in the day;- having nearly two hours at Ait Benhaddou. Lovely place, but not sure it's a place worthy of nearly 2 hours. If only some of that time could have been used for lunch, or for a Studio Tour, then this would have been a much. much better day out and we'd not have come back with regrets of what we might have seen - but didn't get the chance to."

We initially booked this trip because we were looking for a good deal, and it was slightly cheaper than other day trips of its kind. We were so happy with the trip and it turned out to be completely different to other similarly-advertised trips. We were picked up by our guide Jawad at our hotel and he was immediately friendly, informative and helpful. There were 4 of us in the 4x4 and it was very comfortable, with good aircon. We drove up to the waterfalls, which was an energetic but not too difficult climb uphill for 35 mins. A separate guide takes you up to the waterfall and it is well-worth the extra money for the tip - definitely choose this option if you go! Following this we travelled through various valleys to a berber village, which was beautifully set in the rolling hills of the lower Atlas mountains. No other tour companies were stopping in this area and we were alone, apart from the local villagers, which felt very authentic. One family have allowed the company to bring people to their roof terrace for a cooked lunch, which was truly fantastic. The lunch consisted of tomato salad with homemade bread and oils, a traditional chicken tagine with cous cous, and fruit. After lunch we drove down through the multi-coloured valleys into the plains below, Jawad pointed out all kinds of landmarks to us and explained the reasons for the colourful soils. The whole day was around 9 hours and I think anyone visiting Marrakech should choose to get out into the mountains in this way, and definitely choose Morocco Attractive."

Would absolutely recommend that you take up the option of the walk to the waterfall and the lunch with the Berber family.The walk to the waterfall takes about 30 minutes and although uphill all the way is not too taxing. The lunch at the Berber family house really is quite special. High in the Atlas mountains, lunch is served on the rooftop of the Berber house, with fantastic 360 degree views of the mountains and valley.Although this isn't guaranteed as a private tour, as there was only 4 of us it certainly felt exclusive. Thanks girls and thanks Jawad for a great experience."

We booked the Three Valleys sightseeing trip from NZ before we left for our holiday and were looking forward to seeing more than just the centre of Marrakech. We were really impressed with the entire service provided by this company. Punctual pick-up, friendly guide, informative narration, unique and authentic experiences all contributed to a superb day. The highlight of the trip was the exclusive rooftop lunch in an Atlas mountain village cooked by a traditional Berber family. Huge thanks to Shakib and the team for an unforgettable experience!"

The journey was very comfortable, we went with a 4x4 car instead of a van (many agencies use vans), so it made a difference because we had much more space and it was more stable. The best part of the trip was the guide. Our guide Adbu was a very kind young Moroccan man who shared with us many aspects of the Moroccan life. It was enriching because we were only 3 people in the car and we were able to have a closer conversation with a local guide. The time was very flexible, as we were a small group we were allowed to go back whenever we finished. Very enjoyable and I definitely recommend it!!"

We were two women, alone...paired with a LOVELY Egyptian couple. We also happen to be jewish and american, which made for a whole lot of laughter amongst all. 4) he quickly adjusted the tour when all of us decided we didn't want to do the waterfall, so we had coffee in the middle of a stream in the Atlas Mountains.We will use him again in the coming months for a Sahara Trip. We want to thank you for a lovely tour and a lovely day. We recommend this company to our friends often."

The Moroccan landscape is beautiful and we think it is a definite must to see it if you have time. We were very hesitant at first about going ahead with the tour as we did not have a great time in Marrakech. People didn't seem very friendly and some were quite frightening. However, this tour showed us a different side of morocco that we did not expect to see. The hotels were most unexpected and a great experience. They were mostly traditional Moroccan hotels which were very clean, beautiful and cozy. Their locations were amazing and the people were very hospitable and helpful. The tour consisted of many activities (the following is the link to itinerary if interested). Our driver and tour guide was amazing and very helpful. I had severe food poisoning from watermelon at a restaurant which caused me to feel very unwell but the driver made sure that my health was taken care of by taking me to the local medical centres which were away from our route and helped translate for us. Despite the food poisoning the trip was very pleasant and I would definitely recommend anyone interested to go with them.Few bits of advice:1. Avoid wearing shorts or revealing clothing as you will be passing through small villages. No kissing or anything intimate either.2. DO NOT eat fruits from the street stalls and DO NOT eat watermelon. I was told that not only foreigners but locals get severe food poisoning from them.3. Do not acknowledge groups of children sound the streets as this can cause problems.4. The journey is very long so be prepared for drives throughout the whole day. (Some may be up to 4 hours long)."

The excursion was to the 3 valleys and lake (but it was end of May so there was no Lake) so we only did the 3 valleys. The guide Chakib is a very friendly man and he is pretty conversational. Moroccan landscape is beautiful so if you like nature and you appreciate sightseeing this might be for you. There is one stop in one Argan shop so I guess this was the delight of my girlfriend. I think the tour is highly enjoyable, although the berber lunch felt a bit fake. Say... you are in the middle of Morocco and only 2 umbrellas surrounded by adobe houses but there we had a gorgeous lunch and it is pretty refreshing, although the sun might be an issue if its intense. The waterfalls are nice to go, but be careful, its a bit slippery. Chakib was there to assist us so I would recommend that you take some trekking shoes if you decide to go to the waterfalls. In addition to the excursion expenses, the berber lunch costs 13 EUR and the waterfalls 7 EUR. You would not do bad to ask about the cost of these activities, just in case my info is outdated.I think this a recommended tour if you want to be free of traffic and the crowded busy Medina. Also, you will enjoy more this excursion if you like outdoors and you enjoy mountain air."

He went that extra mile and made sure he spent more time on the parts of the tour we were more interested in. We were able to see the beautiful (and very different) three valleys, do a trek to the waterfall and have the most amazing lunch on the rooftop of a traditional house in an unspoiled Berber village. It was actually one of the highlights of the holiday \u2013 we had 360 degree views and the home-cooked meal was absolutely delicious! This was a really unique part of the tour as most tours around the Atlas Mountains don\u2019t offer a similar experience. Chakib also generously shared fresh cherries for us to try and any he hadn\u2019t eaten he shared with children in the Berber village. It was a wonderful trip I\u2019d highly recommend!"

We did the three valleys tour first, where we saw the quite touristic but beautiful Ourica Valley and had a small hiking tour with a second guide, who took good care for our safety on this quite slippery way. We also enjoyed lunch in the berber house in the second valley. Food was good quality and the tee ceremony was quite interesting to see. Especially the latter as well as the three quite different valleys made this tour unique and absolutely recommendable. Apart from that Chakib drove us very safely, gave us useful information and cared for our needs. On the way we also had the opportunity to do a camel ride, which we did not do or to buy argan products, whereas the argan products were quite expensive, so it is recommendable to either negotiate a reasonable price or to buy somewhere else. Anyway it was also nice to see the oil mill. Be aware that the food and the hiking tour makes 20 Euro extra per person, whereas it is worth to do! The second tour led us to Essaouria. Our driver Abdul was also very nice, he cared for our needs and we enjoyed talking to him during the drive. In Essaouria he gave us recommendations about where to eat and where better not. Apart from that Essaouria was also worth to see with the harbour, the old town and the beach. Sellers were less aggressive than in Marrakech and prices were often much more reasonable, so it is worth to do shopping in Essaouria. Thanks to Chakib and Abdul for the tours!"

Our guide Chakib was friendly, patient, very knowledgable, and a great driver (which seems hard to find in Marrakech), and picked everyone in our group up from their own most convenient locations. Every view was more gorgeous than the last, and we had the most delicious Moroccan food in the Berber village, with a panoramic view of the mountains and villages surrounding. Our only complaint was that we had to pay extra for the walk to the waterfall and for lunch in the Berber village. Both were definitely worth the money and must-dos if you do the Three Valley Tour, but it was a bit misleading to market them as optional--if we hadn't hiked up to the waterfall we would have just been sitting in the village waiting for the rest of our group to come back, and I'm not sure what we would have done if we had opted out of the Berber lunch. Once again, these were two of the highlights of the trip and we would definitely recommend them, but just expect to pay 20 euro more than the listed price. Also, if you go to the waterfall try to have sturdy shoes you can hike in--we both had unsupportive shoes with no traction and we ended up alright, but it would have been easier and more enjoyable with better shoes.Overall, Morocco Attractive Day Tours did a great job with this tour and it was a great way to get out of the city and see the Moroccan countryside and traditional Berber life.

He even offered to drop us off at another location other than our hotel if we wished. The first valley in the Berber village was a definite highlight. This included a trek to the waterfalls - this was fantastic although we were not quite expecting the amount of rocks but rather a small trail - even still it was great fun! Lunch with a Berber family was a unique experience and something which is not offered by other companies. This was definitely the highlight with the best food we had tasted during our time in Marrakech. The tour is worth this treat alone.

Morocco is really a beautiful country! Regarding the organization of the tour I only have two notes to make. One concerns the night in the tent in Merzouga for which I had very different expectations: the toilet was shared, no shower available, we had breakfast at the hotel and not in the desert (as planned) and, the most important thing that we ignored, was about the lagguage that we had to leave in the car. At the end everything was fine but I suggest Chakib or Sara to give to their customers more detailed information about this kind of accomodation in the tent. The second thing si about the hotel in Todra Gorges (riad dar ayour): the staff is very friendly but the cleaness in the rooms is very poor. For other things nothing to claim, indeed... Starting from our guide who has been really patient, kind and reliable. So a special thank to Younes, we will keep Morocco in our hearts also thanks to you... :) !!!"

We had 2 other couples with us that we luckily got on well with.We first drove for about an hour to get to a Berber village where we watched them make Argan oil and had pictures with the Berber ladies there. All very touristy and I felt like they were out to make whatever money they can from you - the shop selling Argan products was very expensive. But it was really interesting to see.We then went to go on a \"walk\" to the waterfalls, that costs about an extra \u00a37 per person as you have to hire a guide and takes up to 2 hours. Well this was not a walk but more of a rock climb! Make sure you wear good shoes as you have to climb slippery rocks and cross small streams. I'm not sure the waterfalls are really worth the climb, as they are not that impressive. But the walk was a god experience that we enjoyed. We then drove for another hour and 15 mins to go to Berber village in the next valley, which had completely different scenery and wasn't touristy at all. The lunch we had was a amazing and so filling. But the Berber house did seem a bit fake and set up just for us. This costs an extra \u00a313 per person. After this we got back in the car for some more driving on to the next valley, and we were all getting very tired and sleepy after our meal. We drove to the lake and stopped briefly for a few photos. To be honest this seemed more like a tick the box activity so that we could say we'd been to the third valley.Over all, we would recommend this tour as long as you are fit enough to enjoy the climb to the waterfalls. We had a good day out and Chakib was a good and knowledgable tour guide. Be aware that with all the extras it will costs you at least another \u00a320 per person to do everything in the tour."

He was happy to stop at any point for any pictures and was very helpful. We saw how morrocan oil is produced and were given a chance to sample and buy the products. We had a lovely scenic lunch. I thoroughly enjoyed the day and would definitely recommend! The highlight of our trip"

We visited the women who made Arganoil products, and bought some small gifts made from the oil.Abdul was polite, knowledgeable and assisted us throughout the day. The meal prepared for us at the Berber House was authentic and excellent. A great trip with all arrangements going smoothly from pick-up at 8.30.to the drop off at 4.30. Shukran to all involved."

            "review": "Stunning, amazing, do it now!. We booked the Three Valleys Day Trip from Marrakech with Optional Visit to Takerkoust Lake and Kik Plateau Tour with Morocco Attractive Tours via BA and are certainly glad we did. We were picked up at Jemaa El Fna as the 4x4 could not fit down the Medina road to our Riad. Our guide was excellent and kept up a running commentary throughout the tour about where we were and what we were going to see. He was happy to answer any of the questions of his six passengers and stopped regularly on the drive so we could take breath takingly beautifully photographs.We hired a guide as a group to take us up to the waterfall at Setti Fatma - a walk not for the aged or unfit. It took us around 35 minutes to get up there but would have taken up to 2 hours if it had been during the busy season as the \"path\" was very narrow. It is worth the trek. We could probably have done it without a guide if our drive had just pointed us in the right direction but it certainly made it easier with one.The three valleys; Ourika, Oukaimeden and Asni where stunning. The totally different geology between them was amazing and in places reminded us of Malta or Gran Canaria. We enjoyed the stop off at the Berber village to see how Argan Oil is extracted and to buy some (of course) I thought it was a little expensive at 150bh but my daughter was happy with it when I gave it to her as a gift and it was good to see how they lived and worked and we helped their economy a little.We chose to stop for lunch at a Berber House and we greeted with Harira (soup) followed by a chicken and vegetable Tagine (cooked on charcoal) with vegetable couscous and followed by fresh sweet oranges and Berber Tea (an acquired taste). So much food we all were quiet and a little sleepy afterwards.The views of Takerkoust Lake and Kik Plateau were equally stunning. I'm sure if we'd had time a dip in the lake would have been lovely but we had to get back to Marrakech (maybe next time).If you want to see stunning scenery, not worry about driving yourself and have someone there to answer you questions this is the trip for you.You will need to pay extra for the guide to the falls and for the lunch but you settle that with the driver so no haggling required."

We booked it whilst still at home on the strength of the positive reviews on TripAdvisor and we're so glad we did.We were picked up at our hotel on time by our driver/guide, Gawad, in a clean 4x4 in great condition. Throughout the entire day Gawad was friendly and informative and spoke faultless English. He took time to point out the good stuff and explain lots to us, without being over-talkative or intrusive. We collected another couple from the medina and headed into the foothills and ultimately the mountains themselves. Gawad was happy to stop for photo opportunities and also to take photos for us. We stopped off to watch some ladies making argan oil, then headed up to the cascades where we took the trek up to the first waterfall - make sure you have decent footwear if you're doing this, it's not a gentle stroll and scrambling over rocks is to be expected. Our guide up to the waterfalls (Hussein) also spoke great English and was very friendly and patient, helping us up and down over the trickier parts and was happy to pause for breaks along the way.Lunch on the rooftop of a traditional Berber house was a particular highlight, with the most breathtaking views of the mountains and the valleys and the food was by far the best we'd had during our trip! On the way back we were offered the opportunity to take in the Lake as well - not part of the trip we'd booked - which we did before finally heading back to Marrakech.Gawad offered to drop us off either back at the hotel where we'd started the day, or anywhere else in the city and was kind enough to stop off at a Pharmacy for us on our way back to the hotel. We were collected at 0830 and dropped off at 1700 and thoroughly enjoyed our full day. The guide up to the waterfall, the lunch and the added stop off at the lake were all additional extras, so make sure you take some extra cash with you if you want to do them. None of them were particularly expensive though and all were optional extras and we didn't feel pressurised into doing any of them. A really great day and if we ever make it back to Marrakech, we'll definitely be getting in touch with Morocco Attractive for some of their other trips. Great stuff. :)"

Everyone was friendly and never once did I feel uncomfortable being by myself.I cannot fault the tour, even if I did get a bit sunburnt! The meal on the side of the mountain was spectacular and also brilliant, by far the best food I tasted during my entire trip. I can only hope to recreate the tagine with the various spices I bought home with me.Sara also made the organisation really easy and always responded to my emails quickly. It was great to have everything arranged before I arrived. They also collected and dropped me off at my hotel, which was really convenient particularly on my first day when I was unfamiliar with the city. Overall I would definitely recommend this trip to anyone that is thinking of doing it!"

As soon as we had paid immediately all the information came via an E mail. This company only has two vehicles a family business so small but professional we confirmed with them the booking before we left and again when we arrived at our Riad again cant be to cautious. Our 4x4 arrived dead on time our driver Johab was a pleasure to be with not over bearing but always very helpful. The vehicle took 6 passengers of which we were two. We left for the tour at 8.30am and returned at 5pm for the Three Valleys Day Trip and paid an extra \u00a316.92 for the guide to the water falls and meal eaten on the terrace of the Berber house with views to die for which is a must.

My husband and I pre-booked the Three valleys tour in the Atlas Mountains and I have to say it was the best day of our holiday in Marrakech. We travelled in comfort in a new 4x4, our guide was very friendly and professional. His English was outstanding and he gave us a lot of very useful information and tips throughout the tour. The scenary is breathtaking, and the best part of the tour is the guided hike to the Waterfalls in the Ourika Valley. I would say here though that the tour company did not mention that this is was quite a big hike with lots of climbing over and around boulders, and through streams, it was fine for us as we are able bodied, but anyone with a health problem (back, legs etc) might have a few issues. Hiking boots or very strong boots A MUST! Saying that, it was totally worth while doing and the fews are tremendous.We also lunched at the house of a Berber family in the middle of nowhere and that was totally charming and the home made food delicious. If we came back, I would very much use this company for another tour."

At the oil producing village very pleasant lady gave us to taste some oil with freshly baked bread and then we had some smelling experience of il used for skin and hair and so on :) :) loved it and bought some. Even though they do accept Visa cards, there was no connection so I had to pay in cash - take some extra money, as we didn't. At the second Berber village we had 3 course lunch at the most amazing terrace with a 360 degrees view of the mountains and valley. Local woman was serving us and her food was something special. We had to pay \u20ac13 per person extra for it, so once again, take some extra money, because there are some extra things you would want to buy and experience.We have also stopped at the small village by the river were we had mint tea and just chilled :) very pleasant.Overall, great experience.

I come from NZ which has lots of beautiful mountains/landscapes and this was pretty close to being equal. The walk up to the waterfall would be a little difficult for those not overally mobile, however the guide that took us up was very helpful and if not keen on the walk the village it starts at is very interesting, set on a river and very unique. Lunch was very nice, the best tagine we had on our trip, the 360 views while having lunch were breathtaking. Definitely recommend doing this day trip and as per above, this company and our guide were brillant. Cheers. Daniel & Rosie."

Driver spoke excellent English and was informative and interesting but didn't chat incessantly.The views were stunning. The actual trek up to the waterfall was hard going. You need proper walking boots or walking shoes - trainers not good enough. VERY steep and slippy, more a scramble over rocks than a walk. The local guide for this trek was excellent - spoke little English and was very helpful with a much needed sense of humour - he practically dragged us up some bits! Lunch was the highlight of the trip. Sitting on a terrace with 360 degree views of Atlas mountains, silent except for the sound of sheep and the local farmer ploughing with his donkeys. Food was tasty, plentiful and authentic. A welcome escape from the noise and bustle of Marrakech and interesting to see a bit more of Morocco.Highly recommended!"

Anyway we were looking for a plan B, escape from the hussle and bussle of the old town and drive around in the mountains just outside Marrakech. On TripAdvisor our resource to find (and analyze) almost anything for my trips, we found this company organizing day trips. We've heard the combination of the 3 valleys and the lake was recommended highly. So we send out an e-mail to the company for information and got a call the same day and were able to get on the trip the next day. Great Toyota Landcruiser 4wheel drive, nice and just the thing we needed to relax a day among nature's treasures. We enjoyed the guidance, his comments and the special \"private\" lunch at a Berber family's home, well to be more precise on their terrace overlooking the valley, just beautiful. Really this is worth considering when you're out there. They do have other programs, two or more days out in the desert. Haven't done it, but when I get stuck out there this will be my next trip."

He also brought us to some of the best tasting restaurants we've been to during our Morocco stay. 3) While the driver was knowledgeable about the surroundings to a degree, at different locations, we were introduced to local experts who gave us more details on that locations' attributes4) We were the only ones in the vehicle (a comfortable modern 4x4), which was especially nice since we could dictate when we were ready to move on5) Customer-satisfaction mindset: was met by the owner, with the driver, the first day to make sure we kicked-off properly; mid-way through the first day, received a call from the owner making sure everything was still going smoothly; on the last day after being dropped off at the hotel, realized we left some personal belongings in the car and were leaving on a flight the next day. The owner dropped off our belongings at our hotel that very night.Highly recommend this tour company!"

Before we left the UK I emailed Chakib and asked was there anything we needed to bring for the trip and he suggested sweeties and pencils for the Berber mountain children.

We were traveling with Grandma, age 87 and Adil really made an effort to make the tour great for her as well"

He was a very helpful guide all day, and took us for an amazing lunch cooked at a local Berber house, which was delicious. It was very cold in the Atlas Mountains so some blankets would have been appreciated, or take a warm coat. As a note to others, the hike at the waterfall is more like mountaineering and you should wear good stout foot ware and be physically fit. This part of the tour would be unsuitable for small children or the elderly."

We traveled with a 3 year old and were pleasantly surprised as Chakib, our driver and guide, had arranged a car seat which wasn't done of any other tours. There was another couple who traveled with us in the SUV.We had a trek to the waterfalls in Ourika valley and our guide there, Omar, was very helpful. He helped us with our son and even carried him on his shoulders. It is around a 30 minute trek and not for people with arthritis or mobility problems.There was an option to do the camel ride but we skipped it as our son was asleep.The highlight of the trip was the lunch in the berber house. It was an idyllic location with the view of the valleys. We felt as if we were having lunch in the Grand Canyon. We then drove past the Takerkoust Lake and Kik Plateau with a photo stop with the lake in the background.I would definitely recommend doing this trip."

            "review": "Memorable day trip - highly recommended. We booked the 3 valley day trip (which is apparently one of the most popular and I can see why!). We emailed Chakib from England and made arrangements, he then phoned us when we arrived in Marrakesh to confirm what time he would collect us. We were lucky in that it was just the two of us on the trip which was, in effect, a private tour. The car was comfortable and Chakib himself spoke perfect English, imparting some fantastic information as we drove along (and with a good sense of humour). He was very knowledgeable, full of facts and figures and answered all of our questions.The drive took us through fantastic scenery, where we stopped en route in order to take photographs (Chakib either stopped when we asked him to or knew where to stop in order to get some good shots). The visit to see how Argan Oil is extracted was very interesting as was the explanation of all the different herbs and plants grown in the gardens and the explanation of their usages. We continued on to Ourika valley, stopping to cross a bridge for photos (which Chakib took for us). The scenery was almost surreal with cafe's and restaurants dotted along the river with colourful armchairs, settees and parasols set amoungst the water for diners to sit and also many stalls at the side of the road selling local handycrafts and carpets. Then we met our guide for the treck up the waterfalls. This was truly worth doing and we took tons of photos (our guide also took lots of the pair of us together). we loved the was they used the water from the falls to cool their drinks and fruit like a fridge and enjoyed looking again at the stalls on the journey and were handed free tasters of fruits and sweets by the sellers (however we misunderstood and thought that all the stalls were run by a co-operative which shared money amongst the village - when in fact it was only one of the main stalls, so had we known that we would have purchased our souvenir from that stall in preference to any others, however there was no pressure to buy anything). It is not a particularly easy treck and I would recommend that you wear trainers or walking shoes and leave any bags in the car for Chakib to watch for you, also do not take small children or attempt if you are not too agile, as some bits are a bit tricky or slippery (although the guide is patient and will help you up or down difficult bits). We then drove to a Berber village to have lunch at a family's house. I must say I felt a little bit intrepid as was not sure what to expect, especially due to the very basic layout and the fact their was no running water etc - however, the meal was delicious and plentiful with a starter of bread and oil and tomato salad, followed by a large chicken tagine, followed by a large vegetable and couscous dish then pomegrannate, finishing off with mint tea (so do not have a big breakfast that morning!!). It was so peaceful sitting on their roof terrace away from the everyday noise of London! I would recommend that you take a bit of change so you can tip the lady that made the lunch (we didn't realise and only had large notes so felt a bit mean not being able to give her anything) we then continued on our way traveling along mountain roads and experiencing very different views and terainnes. All in all a very good trip and well worth doing. (we had been to Marrakesh earlier in the year and visited the town and the souks and the hustle and bustle and noise etc, so this was a major contrast as was so peaceful). Thank you Chakib for a memorable day, we thoroughly enjoyed it."

He was very patient and let us take our time when we wanted to stop for photos and admire the views. He never pressured us into doing any of the additional activities. These activities were; a camel ride, a guided walk to the waterfall (7 euros extra) and a Lunch in a traditional Berber village (13 Euros extra). If you do not do the additional activities, you will be limiting your experience as you will be spending most of your time in the car (albeit comfortable). We chose to partake in the guided walk and the Berber lunch. The walk was very scenic, looking down through the mountainous valley. The waterfall was smaller than we were expecting, but the view of the valley was worth the walk. The lunch in the Berber village was certainly a highlight. The location was stunning and the food was delicious. It was a rare opportunity to be welcomed into a Berber home and gain an insight into their culture. This is unique to this tour company and should not be missed! After leaving the village, the scenery of the third valley was incredible."

We stayed in Marrakech for 5 days, but by far the day trip to the Valleys was the highlight. Picked up from our hotel at 9am by Chakib (6 of us) and taken to the first valley. Chakib is happy to stop along the way to allow you to take photos. He explained at the very start, with no pressure, that if we wanted to go on a hike up to the waterfalls at the first valley he can arrange for a mountain guide to escort us (essential) - 1hr 30 mins in total and worth every single second - stunning views and experiences. The next optional part of the trip is to have lunch at a traditional Berber home. Not only was the food delicious, but the setting blew us away. we had a table set for 6 of us on a rooftop which had 360 degree views - No restaurant in the world will match this place for location.!! Would we recommend this trip - absolutely. Would we recommend Chakib and his company - oh yes!! A truly genuine guide only interested in your enjoyment as opposed to many other places where they are just looking to fleece you for as much as possible!! Chakib even bought us all a mint tea at a riverside cafe as he needed 15 minutes to pray ( we had delayed him on the mountain hike !!) A lovely guy and a fantastic day out - Thank you Chakib!"

Quarzazate is a bit far from Marrakesh, it takes almost 4 hours to the destination, but the scenery along the route is just amazing. You won't feel boring and tired at all. Chakib introduces us the background and histroy on the way to Ouarzazate and he answers all our questions about Morocco culture and histroy. On the way back to the hotel we ask Chakib to suggest us a decent Moroccan restaurant. He help us to make a reservation at \"Al Fassia\", which is a nice restaurant inside a boutique hotel but not expensive at all. Their \"mixed salad\" and \"lamb tagine\" are must-try. Having such a good experience on Day 2, we immediately ask Chakib to arrange a half day tour for us on Day 3 to visit Medina city and to have a 1-hour camel ride. The camel ride is really a fun experience and it makes our trip more memorable. Chakib is very helpful and he always try his best to satisfy our needs.

It was so inspiring to see and learn about their way of life. Chakib was a safe driver, entertaining and attentive to each one of us on the journey. The price was reasonable at 60 euros.

The visit to the Argan oil press (perhaps the only less fascinating stop),the guided climb to the waterfalls, the authentic dinner in the Berber home, etc; at first sight, it looked like your typical tourist trap.. But luckily, all other reviews of this organisation turned out to be quite accurate: the mountain guide took us to the waterfall trough a small mountain pass ( only the vendor stalls along the way made it seem a bit tacky ), to arrive at a beautiful little waterfall, far away from the hectic city life we left in Marrakech. The next stop was lunch at the Berbers' house. Having tried several tajines on our trip, this proved to be the best one yet! Whilst heading back and typing this review, my girlfriend and I both agreed that this episode was well worth the price: our driver/host proved to be a well rounded guide, who was able to answer all our questions and knew the nicest places to visit along the way.

Booking two excursions through http://www.moroccoattractivetours.com/ was the best decision I ever made for our recent visit to Morocco.I looked on various websites and emailed people some time ago. Chakib, from Morocco Attractive Tours, emailed back very soon after sending our enquiry, he wrote good English, advised what would be the best trips for our stay and answered my numerous questions.In the end we settled for two day trips - the first to Essaouira and the second to the three valleys.Both were fantastic days out. We were also lucky enough to get Chakib as our driver/tour guide for both days. His spoken English (which is his third language) is as good as any native English speaker (if not better than some!!). His knowledge of Morocco is amazing and he is happy for you to ask questions, he will point out interesting things, but also he is more than happy for you to sit back quietly and enjoy the ride.Ok so about the two trips - Essaouira - this was a nice (but long) day out. The straight road of 170km to Essaouira takes about 2 hours 30 minutes to drive (this includes a 20 min stop at an Argan oil producing co-operative). It is well worth going to Essaouira to see what is holds (very different to Marrakech). My only advice would be to do this trip early on during your stay as you may not appreciate the long drive after you have been in Morocco for a while,Three Valleys - this trip was amazing. So many different landscapes along the way. This trip includes a lot more stops for photos, to ride the dromedaries (approx 100dhms per person), to climb up to the waterfalls (approx 65 dhms per person) and to have lunch at a real Berber home (approx 400 dhams for 2 people). All of these extras are worth adding to the trip. In particular the lunch part was amazing. This truly was a real Berber house, in a real Berber village with the most fantastic landscape to sit in and eat lunch. We were apprehensive about what it would entail before going, but it is honestly the best experience. You eat alone (or with another couple if they are on the tour with you) and are served outside by the girls from the family. You get chance to look around their house and you get to have possibly the nicest Moroccan food you will every taste.We cannot recommend Chakib and Morocco Attractive Tours more highly. Avoid the rest and use the best!Thank you for making our honeymoon even more special!"

I have to admit I did regret my decision when I saw the food they were cooking for other guests, it looked really good. Another note on this, it was the price that put us off, but the money goes straight to the family, and I believe is quite an important revenue stream for them. The tour company doesn't take a cut.Chakib, the tour guide really was great. One of the stops was at an Argan Oil producing womens co-op. They also have a shop (expect a bit of sales patter, but not too pushy) that offered essential oil for a skin condition I have. I didn't buy it, but was given a free sample that actually seemed to work (I am definitely a sceptic...). I phoned Chakib later in the evening, and he said he was touring to the same place. He agreed to buy the oil for me and drop it off to me! We were on our way to the airport just after, and he offered to take us there for free!

The port town was cool after the heat of Marrakech, a welcome change.Shaqid told us about the points of interest on the journey, and was happy to talk to us on a variety of topics.He gave us suggestions for exploring in the Medina, and around the port, then left us to discover this interesting place.He was on time for our return trip. His driving was excellent, and he was quick to make sure we were not too hot.The car was comfortable.We would recommend Shaqid to anyone !"

We planned 2 excursions to Essaouira and the Ourika valley with this company months in advance and were really excited to kick off our holiday seeing some great sites. Our driver, Chakib, had plenty of knowledge about everything the country had to offer and would always answer any question we asked him. He drove very safely in his air conditioned 4x4(which is good when navigating the tricky windy roads of the Atlas mountains) and was happy to make adjustments to the itinerary(eg if we wanted to stay longer at a particular site). Overall, the tours were excellent, so much so, that we booked a tour to the Imlil valley on the last day in Morocco and were dropped off at the airport. The company are swift to respond to all emails and are always willing to take into account your needs. Would highly recommend them!"

As others have said, Chakib is friendly, chatty and a safe driver, and really adds something to the trip. Again, to be unoriginal and blatantly repeat what others have said, you have to take dinner in the Berber house, it really is a highlight of the tour. It's also worth walking to the waterfall, though only if you're steady on your feet and have decent footwear. If you have a day to spare, I'd definitely recommend this tour."

A day before the trip he rang in the evening to confirm everything and we met the following morning. Chakib is a very pleasant man with good communication skills in English, this was important to us as I wanted the children to get more out of the trip about Moroccan life than just a road trip, Chakib did not disappoint in this respect offering us insight into Morocco and its people on the trip. Chakib uses a relatively new 4x4 which was very comfortable. Before we set off he confirmed the plans for the day and asked whether we would like to amend anything, this was a nice touch. On the way to Essaouira we stopped several times for picture opportunities and also visited an Argan oil cooperative, this was great for the kids and there was little or no pressure to actually buy any of the products.Essaouira is a fantastic place and I would really recommend it as a break to the hussle and bussle of Marrakesh, we had some great food and an easy day in the Souks and the beach. Chakib brought us back safely to Marrakesh to end an excellent day out. If you are planning a trip then definitely book with Chakib, you will not be disappointed."

Our booking was confirmed promptly by e-mail and arrangements made to pick us up close to the riad in which we were staying.The excursion is really enjoyable and interesting. It is good to escape from the madness of the Marrakech medina for a day. The beautiful and sparsely populated mountains do feel like a different world. We undertook the optional walk to the waterfall in the Ourika valley. The \"walk\" was quite a challenging scramble up steep rocks but our guide, Kamal, was most helpful in ensuring we did it safely. The scenery and clear water of the waterfall made it worthwhile.The trip included the inevitable shopping opportunities at a Women's Co-operative making argan oil and at a Berber pharmacy. The charm of the young women who showed us round mitigated any feeling of obligation to buy the products.We were offered lunch with a Berber family or in a restaurant and chose the former. This was most definitely the highlight of the trip - an opportunity to meet a local family and to see their home, delicious food (Moroccan salad, chicken tagine, vegetable couscous, melon and mint tea) served on a terrace with a stunning view of the surrounding countryside. The family was welcoming and hospitable and we felt privileged to have had a glimpse of lives very different from our own.The trip continued through varying kinds of terrain, villages and vegetation.We were most impressed by our driver, Chakib. He was courteous and informative, a good, safe driver and happy to share information about his own life and Moroccan society in general. Our vehicle was a very comfortable 4x4.The cost of the trip was \u00a350 plus \u00a36 for the guide to the waterfall and \u00a312 for lunch per person as well as tips for the guide, driver and Berber family.Overall, the trip was extremely good value and a fascinating glimpse into a different world.We would not hesitate to recommend this company and would happily use them again."

Our tour started with Chakib picking us from our hotel at the precise time promised. We made our journey but shortly thereafter I had an issue withdrawing money from my card to pay for the trips entrance fees. Chakib offered his own funds but I felt truly uncomfortable and he made a detour to help us find the right ATM. The trip is an all day exercise. There is so much to see and do and Chakib gives you ample time to see and do it all. The landscapes are truly magnificent and frankly difficult to describe with words and to be honest even the pics. What was quite surprising was how much the landscape changed from the morning when we left and on our way back. As the sun goes down the countryside glows a unique red illuminating everything around it. Overall Chakib is incredibly good value. We found him to be considerably cheaper comparatively speaking. Furthermore, we really wanted to see the Oasis (17km) away from the designated route and seeing our excitement he made the exception. This resulted in him finishing a hour and a half later after the tours expected finish. Truly a testament of his commitment to the customer and their experience in Morocco. Well done and thank you Chakib."

We also stopped by a Berber market (not aimed at tourists) and had a lunch at the home of a Berber villager.Booking - done easily via email. Meeting Point - the guide, Chakib, met us outside Caf\u00e9 de France in the main square (Jemaa el-Fnaa). Just be careful that you don't get let away by another tour company as it's a busy meeting point.Tour Introduction - Our guide explained the options for the day and was flexible with the agenda and explained the associated additional costs.Guide - Our guide spoke excellent English and gave a commentary highlighting interesting features as he drove us around. He was able to answer questions about the local geography, economy, and society.Vehicle - we were driven around in a modern 4x4 vehicle which was very comfortable even when driving off-road.Lunch - we had the choice of eating at are restaurant or visiting a Berber villager's house for a home-cooked meal. We took the latter which was well worth it. This was a three course meal sitting on a terrace with a beautiful mountain view. Lunch is not included in the price of the tour but this was made clear.Price - Morrocco Attractive Tours seems to be in the middle range price bracket. You'll find cheaper but we found this means a driver who speaks very little English and a forced visit to his uncle's carpet shop. So it's well worth paying a little extra for a tour from this company.All in all this was an excellent day excursion."

It was a customised day trip - the company was happy to be flexible about this, and we paid the same price as the advertised Ait Benhaddou / Ouazarzate trip for a somewhat different itinerary. We went southeast into the Atlas Mountains. Our targets were three Kasbahs at Telouet (mountain fortress with exquisite interior decoration), Ait Benhaddou (fortified village like something out of the Old Testament; and the location of many iconic films!) and Ouazarzate (more of an urban castle). Despite being the same kind of structure, each was unique, and expressed the variety of Moroccan mountain architecture. Also splendid was the scenery of the Atlas Mountains glimpsed en route - we drove through very remote regions and were astonished by the contrast of green trees against red rock.The company is owned by a gentleman named Chakib, and it was he who we dealt with to make the booking via Email, which went smoothly. But our driver was a young man called Adil, who was a wonderful guide and companion. He was knowledgable and thoughtful, courteous and kind, and gave us lots of information about the sites, region and country. He also drove tirelessly through a very long day, and when my travelling companion became carsick on the mountain roads, found us a chemist where we could buy some medicine!One tiny quibble - when we reached Ait Benhaddou, we were fixed up with a local guide, who showed us around the village. He too was knowledgeable and interesting, but we were then expected to tip him, which was an additional cost to that we'd already paid. I didn't mind this, and it felt like we were helping to support the local economy, but it might be reasonable for this possibility of extra costs to be highlighted on the website.Still, this was a fantastic day. I'd recommend this company wholeheartedly."

We were not disappointed! The evening before our trip Chakib, our driver and tour guide, rang the hotel to let us know that there would be a large Berber market two days later which we could visit if we wished to change our days. Unfortunately, this was not possible as the following day was our last in Marrakech, but it was a good omen! Chakib's attentiveness was evident throughout the trip. He arrived to pick us up from our hotel the following morning very promptly and we discussed our itinerary. We were given the option of enjoying lunch specially prepared for us in a home in a Berber village - what an experience, certainly not one to miss. Apart from savouring excellent local, authentic food, we were given the opportunity to meet members of a Berber family and be entertained in their house.Throughout the day Chakib showed his detailed knowledge of the area, of which he was very proud and explained everything in perfect English. He made sure that we got the most out of the tour - leaving us in the very capable hands of a knowledgable guide at the Argan oil co-operative, stopping to give us the best views and, where appropriate, allowing us to walk and enjoy the mountain air, picking us up further down the hillside. On our journey back to the hotel Chakib gave us the bonus of a quick tour of the outskirts of Marrakech, again accompanied by detailed knowledge. To sum up, the scenery is spectacular, the village life fascinating - a trip not to be missed - and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a memorable day in spectacular surroundings, accompanied by a professional but fun guide driving an extremely comfortable vehicle. If we ever return to Marrakech we would definitely use this company for another trip.NC"

When we contacted them several months ago, they answered promptly with quotations and were very serviceminded in their efforts to understand our requirements. They even offered - at no extra charge - to take us from our Marrakech hotel to the aiorport when we left. They arrived promptly at the agreed times, their cars were clean, nice, and comfortable, and the drivers knowlegeable , polite and friendly - but most importantly careful drivers. We have no problems in recommending Morocco Attractive Tours for any kind of personal transportation and outings in Morocco. Andersen, Copenhagen, Denmmark"

We did waterfall trekking, stopped at a local aromatic garden and had dinner with a Berber family with wonderful hospitality and food - overlooking the amazing views of the mountains. Chakib was a careful driver and spoke great English. He was most informative about the history of Morrocco and local traditions and the day was one of our best in Marrakech. We highly recommend this trip."

The driver, Chakib, was very friendly and knowledgeable and spoke terrific English. He took us to various points of interest including a Berber market, a co-operative spice farm, the three valleys that surround Marrakech, a waterfall, a Berber house and more. The scenery you see is breath-taking with many vibrant colours.Bring a pair of trainers/hiking boots if you have them because at the waterfall you are handed on to a local guide who will take you on a 30 minute trek up to the top. You will be scrambling over some slippery rocks but your guide will look after you and if you are careful you will be fine.The lunch we had at the Berber house was a very humbling experience and a fascinating insight into the life of the Berber people. The food was delicious and plentiful.The trip to the spice farm was extremely informative - we were given a thorough history on Moroccan Argan oil and got to view their wares. There is no pressure to buy anything if you don't want to, but we bought some tea and oils.Fantastic experience, we really enjoyed ourselves. Would thoroughly recommend it."

Probably the biggest plus point is Chakib himself. He is gracious and skilful in his understanding of clients. We never felt pressured to opt for \"tourist opportunities\" and we were able to tailor a day's proposals to what we wanted. His English is very fluent and he generously shared with us his knowledge of Moroccan culture, including some of the pressing social and political questions of the day. No mean feat for someone speaking in his third language. We thoroughly enjoyed his company during our two days with him."

We were picked up from our hotel on time by our English speaking guide, a really nice guy who was keen to make sure we had a good day. Nothing was too much trouble. The Atlas Mountains were awesome and we saw a lot of them. This trip covers three valleys which is well worth the travelling. The Toyota jeep was comfortable, clean and appeared well maintained. The hike up to the waterfall in the Ourika valley is welcome chance to get out of the jeep and stretch the legs. Walking shoes/sandals recommended. We opted for a lunch at a Berber house, rather than a restaurant and we were glad we did. It felt like unique experience as we lunched on a terrace in a remote mountain village. The food was fantastic and we genuinely felt like special guests at the house and not tourists.I wholly recommend this trip. I thought it was good value for such a full day of travelling and exploring"

Our journey started in the morning in Marrakech where we met our driver and guide YounisWe want to say to him our gratitude. He is very modest, charming young man and he showed us the country with a love. Thanks to him we\u2019ve seen a lot of interesting things and loved this country.During 4 short days we visited Atlas mountains (the fantastic Todra Gorges), a small oases, hidden in gorges of the mountains, collected fosils, went down to the dried bed of the underground river, greeted the sunrise in the Sahara, wandered through the narrow streets of Ait Ben Haddou Kasbah \u2026 It\u2019s impossible to list everything !Sahara left unforgettable impressions! We rode camels to reach our camp. In the evening there was fire with some people playing music whilst others cooked dish. The night some of us slept in hessian Berber tents, and another under stars! At about 5am we were woken to watch the sunrise over the sand dunes. It was beautiful !Everywhere along the way, we met very friendly people. And of course, we can\u2019t forget the fantastic cuisine: the best tagin we tried to Gorges, in a village in the oasis Feint we were treated exceptionally tasty olive oil, and in Erzuga we tasted a famous Berber pizza!!!Also we would also like to write a few words about Morocco Attractive Tours. I would also like to write a few words about the company. From our very first contact (in 4 months prior to a trip) everything was very accurate and professional. The tour was perfectly organized, hotels on a route were very good and conveniently located, the program very saturated.100 % of the recommendation!"

Chakib arrived promptly at 9am and we headed off in his very comfortable land cruiser. Chakib asked us what we would and wouldn't like to do with our day so we felt it really was tailored to us. We opted to have Mint tea in a traditional Berber house which was a real eye opener as to how little money these people have and how much we, as Westerners, take for granted. The family we met only spoke Arabic yet this wasn't any issue as Chakib translated any questions we had and showed us round the home. We were then served the tea together with home made bread and olive oil made from home grown wheat and olives and it really was yummy. We were under no obligation to leave a set sum of money but left around \u00a38 from the 2 of us which is over the odds for bread and tea but not given the hospitality and their circumstances. We also opted to take the optional waterfalls hike in the Ourika valley. This really was well worth it and I would say anyone with good mobility and with flat comfy shoes can do it. The waterfalls trip was an extra \u00a37 for 2 and this was led by another guide called Mohammed who lived in the village of the falls. Chakib himself could have done it but under tourist industry regulations, he should give work to locals where possible which I think is a great idea. Mohammed was also fantastic, his English was great and he was instantly likeable. He taught us so much about the area as well as the Country and the culture. Both Chakib and Mohammed answered the numerous questions we had and I felt like this was the one day of our week long trip that we came away with a real feel for Morocco as a country. The scenary was stunning all day long and Chakib stopped at various points along the route to allow us to take photos. I thoroughly recommend this firm for a brilliant day out that you won't forget in a hurry. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0"

I was a little worried when I pre-booked from the US and was asked to send a deposit via Western Union or Moneygram, never having used such a method (typically use credit card). Obviously, we were both relieved and pleased when we were picked up promptly (via Land Cruiser) by Younes, our guide, a delightful, young man who speaks English very well. It was truly a pleasure to travel with Younes as he was able to share so much information and insight into the Moroccan culture and way of life. It was also nice to get away from the crazy chaos of the Medina and see the incredible Moroccan countryside and its' people, many living as they have for centuries. Our trip included visits to the Kasbah Glaouet, Ait-Ben-Haddou, where we over-nighted in a very simple but friendly hotel, then a tour through Ourzazate where we also toured the Atlas film studios. The last stop on our tour was a trip to Fint Oasis, a lovely hidden gem, where we had tea with a Berber family in their home - a truly authentic experience. Overall, the trip of a lifetime which we highly recommend! (Am happy to share further information should you have any questions.) Thank you again, Younes and Morocco Attractive Tours!

This one sure won't break down in any terrain and we saw some cars that did!We saw amazing things.. drove through the High Atlas over the Tichka pass through the Telouet Valley to the Kashba of Ait Ben Haddou.. a very impressive tour with beautifull panarama views. Seconds day we proceeded to the studio's, Ouarzazat and (definitely a highlight!) the Fint Oasis. Words can't express, you must see it yourself :-). Chakib was the perfect guide. Very friendly, very personal and very informative, not only about the things we saw but he also took time to answer every possible questions (about Marocco) in general. He took us to the best little restaurants for diner and lunch. He gave us some good tips for Marrakech as well. All in all perfect, thank you Chakib!"

            "review": "great way to explore area beyond Marrakech. I ordered two tours from \"Morocco Attractive Tours\" and both were a lovely addition to our stay in Marrakesh. Our tour guide was always on time, courteous, and full of helpful information. The highlight of my first tour was a traditional lunch with Berber family -- the best food we had while staying in Morocco. Drive to three valleys gives an excellent overview of geographic areas around Marrakesh. Our trip to Essaouira brought many memorable experiences. The beach town is more relaxed, and picturesque with boats and ships surrounding the port. Wished we stayed in Essaouira longer..."

We visited a traditional Berber home and trekked through the mountains to a waterfall. The trip was seamless. We didn't have to think about anything. The weather turned a bit rainy as we were about to take our camel ride at the end of the trip, but Chakib arranged for us to go the next evening at sunset, at very little inconvenience to us. It actually turned out better because the sunset ride was absolutely beautiful. Chakib was very friendly and very helpful."

We had an unbelievable time in Marrakech, Fes, Meknes, Volubilis and Casablanca guided by Chakib from Morocco Attractive Tours!We had rented a car but fortunately before we take it from the agency, we followed an advise and took Chakib as our guide and driver, and cancelled the reservation for renting a car: WE WERE EXTREMELY LUCKY!!! You should not try to drive in Marquise streets, neither go with out a guide!!!In conclusion, with Chakib we had a VIP driver with a Toyota 4x4 every day at our entire disposition. Thanks Chakib for being such a professional and a kind person with us!"

Very friendly tour guide, had mint tea with a berber family, lunch by the river and trekked to some waterfalls with another accomodating tour guide, who had to practically carry me both ways because I was wearing inappropriate footwear. Don't wear sandals or flip flops on this trip! Definitely add it to your trip list!"

            "review": "Excellent tour!!. my partner and I were recently in Marrakech for a few days and decided to go on an Atlas Mountains Tour with Morocco Attractive Tours. We emailed them to ask which tour was recommended and Sara promptly responded that the Ourika and Asni valleys one was the best. Sara was excellent and responded to all my (many) questions promptly.the tour was fantastic, we got to see both mountains and valleys, and a waterfall. We were taken to a cooperative of Argan oil which was interesting (although be warned, I spent a small fortune in their shop by accident!!), we were also able to have mint tea and bread in a Berber home (which were delicious). We then stopped for lunch at a restaurant in the valley which served delicious food (this is an extra cost - although not expensive), and we were then taken up to the some waterfalls by a local guide (this too at an extra cost - also cheap) although the trek to the waterfalls isn't for the fain hearted, as there was a lot of climbing involved!! Anyway, I cannot recommend this tour enough, the whole day was fantastic,and Chakib was great, he had excellent local knowledge, and answered all of our questions. If we were to come to Marrakech again, we would definately use this company."

The price had been agreed before hand and he was happy for us to pay in either pounds sterling, euros or Dirhams. Thw tip we took was to the Atlas mountains and then to the valleys. It was lovey to have someone who gave us brilliant attention, explaining traditons and what we could do. As my husband has mobility problems he expalined that we might struggle to get to the wtaterfall as it was a 40 min walk along rocks which in some places might be difficut to pass. Our visit to a local Burbur home ws so personal, not something that could have been acheived if we had been in a large group. We stoppped whenever we wanted to, whether to take photos or for a walk round. We paid only a fraction more than the tour operatos charged and their trips were either by coach, hci took a lot longer or with cars being completley fall. If we go back to Marrekech we will certainly be using Morocco Attractive Tours for all our trips."

As we were looking for a day trip we asked him if could suggest something and we were so glad we did. Chakib took us out on a day trip to the Atlas Mountains, a Berber house on route for some tea, a real Berber pharmacy, organised a great spot for lunch and good guide for the short trek to the waterfalls. As a guide to Marrakesh he is professional, courteous and knowledgeable just what you need when you are a stranger in town. We highly recommend using Chakib"

We reached out to all top rated tour agencies in trip advisor and we were very impressed with Chakib\u2019s prompt response and great service. He was willing to adapt to our needs and create the perfect circuit for us. The driver/guide was simply outstanding. He is extremely nice and respectful and knows the country\u2019s history and geography very well. We learned tremendously about this great country and its rich culture. Every part of the trip was just perfect; the SUV was very comfortable, the choices of restaurants, riads and hotels were great and the food, ohh my, to die for. This was the best trip of our lives, we took tons of pictures and videos and we can\u2019t wait to share these precious memories with our family and friends.If you want to discover the real beauty of Morocco and have trip that you will never forget, I highly recommend Morocco Attractive Tours."

His tours are obviously well planned out as he has been doing them for some time but also takes into account your specific wants and needs. As we were a couple on his tour he gave us plenty of space to enjoy places alone when we arrived as well as giving plenty of information on the areas we visited in the Atlas mountains. A genuinely good man that loves to show people his country and what a beautiful place it is!"

This was a very good day out , went to Ouzoud waterfall, about a 3 hour journey but the guide came on time and his driving was good, he did stop along the way as I had my 9 year old, so we stopped for a break. The guide also told us about things we drove past and gave an insight, which was good. The guide that took as around the waterfall was very experienced and carefull this made the trip even more enjoyable, the car we had was also nice and clean and comfortable. If I went to Morocco again I would call Chakib to arrange another tour as I felt comfortable in his presence, he was well mannered and had very good English so communication was very good. I had already booked him before I made the trip and agreed on the price beforehand, he did not once mention this to me on the trip. Most people would probably try to get more money but Chakib was not like this. This tour company is very good and reliable, keep up the good work Chakib."
