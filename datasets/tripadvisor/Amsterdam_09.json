You can sit back and enjoy the view rather than doing it on foot\u2026walking around gazing everywhere and risking a collision with one of Amsterdam's many crazy speeding cyclists. The glass roofed canal boats can make photography a bit difficult, so be aware of reflection off the glass if you're planning on taking photographs. You're also down pretty low on the canals so much of the view is the building fronts.The commentary provided by the canal boat operators in English is informative and occasionally droll. The routes are planned to take in particularly unique points of interest, such as the narrowest house and explanations of the many types of gable style.Prinsengracht, Kaisersgracht and Herengracht are the great canals of Amsterdam - a must-see, but the city should be cautioned\u2026two former Amsterdammers remembered Centrum differently, observing that Amsterdam has become a dirty city - with a lot of cigarette butts littered between the footpath flagstones and wrappers and food scraps littered everywhere. Drink cans and rubbish was noted floating in the canal. Spitting on the street appears to have become a 'new fashion.'"

Here you will see many tall and narrow homes lining the canal on both sides all with characteristic hoist beams which were used for bringing in large furniture items. Since the houses are so narrow the people could not bring in anything large up the staircases, and so had to hoist large furniture straight in through the windows. Moored alongside the canal are many flowed bedecked houseboats which are permanent homes for many people."

First, it is beautiful, day or night. You get to see the hustle and bustle of the city along this canal. Between bicycles, which have the right-of-way, lots of pedestrians, and a few cars, there is always some activity. Secondly, it is a great location to walk to almost anything, close to lots of museums (including one of my favorites, the Anne Frank House), shops, and many restaurants and bars. The houseboats which line the canal give the Prinsengracht a special charm. Most of the houseboats are permanently anchored along the canal. Each has a unique d\u00e9cor reflecting the owner's taste and/or sometimes humor. When we return to Amsterdam, we will definitely stay on the Prinsengracht again. Depending on your stamina, you could spend hours walking along the canal, stopping for a cup of coffee or beer, and enjoying watching the people. Although I wouldn't recommend it for a rainy day, if you've got an umbrella or rain poncho, then why not? It rained one day while we were in Amsterdam, and the pedestrian traffic along the Prinsengracht didn't seem to be affected."

I did not want to waste the opportunity to at least experience some of Amsterdam before our flight the next morning. So we took a taxi into town and asked the driver what we must see in the short time we had to visit. Without hesitating he said, \"Prinsengracht.\" I told him, okay. Take us there. It was ten o'clock at night, but the area along the canal was still hoping. But it wasn't loud and over crowded. It was quiet and beautiful. Lots of cafes, bars and restaurants to explore and we walked into almost all of them before settling on \"Gespot\" but that's left to another review. The canal banks are lined with hidden shops, cafes, houseboats and of course the inevitable bikes. Canal cruise boats are constantly passing along with the smaller vessels. Life revolves around all of the canals. The architecture along the canal is very varied, including the odd rooftop garden? Just breathtaking. It's a must see."

I cycle along most of it on my way to work and everyday it provides a new vista. Of course the Prinsengracht is where you find the Anna Frank museum, check my review, but there are lots of interesting cafes in the vicinity, also the Negenstraatjes cross the Prinsengracht and it digs deep into the Jordaan. What's not to like?"

The enormous Saturday open markets are not to be missed. Many don't take credit cards so be prepared to have euros.  We hired a real estate agent Anke de Vries who can be contacted :YourAmsterdamhousing.com Anke set us up in a third-floor apartment, open and spacious with two bedrooms wonderful bathroom, washer dryer, full size refrigerator. Huge windows that overlooked the canal. It was within walking distance from our friends who live there and it was a safe area for our 13 year old granddaughter to walk alone to and from her friends home. Anke could not have been more helpful. She met us at the apartment, took her time giving us a full tour and helped us orient to the neighborhood. When we had phone problems Anke kindly contacted the airline to confirm our flight home and also printed our boarding passes. We were traveling with a stop in Iceland and she even confirmed our hotel in Reykjavik. I don't think we could have found a more perfect realtor. We highly recommend Anke.

The canal side is beautiful, the architecture is incredible, and every so often there are a number of quaint boutique shops. A really lovely place to walk, explore and get the feel of the city."

This time we decided to try and rent a houseboat on one of the many canals. At the last minute we found a houseboat for rent through House-Boat Hotel website. We want in the spring time so hotels can be very expensive in Amsterdam. Luckily we were able to rent a houseboat B124 which was a brand new listing. We were completely pleased with the houseboat. It was very spacious with 2 bedrooms/1 bathroom, kitchen, washer/dryer, and a large living room. It was located on Prinsengracht canal which had patio chairs on the deck of the boat which we used to sit outside and see boat after boat pass right by us. - that was a lot of fun. Prinsegracht is a great location because we were literary 1 minute away from the street cars. It also had restaurants all around the area and a grocery store around the corner.the houseboat was so spacious and private that it best any hotel plus it was 'cool' to be on a houseboat. If you ever get the chance -try one- you'll love it!"

Take a guided canal-tour and enjoy all those great Canalhouses. The prinsengracht is also the decor for a few famous events: The Prinsengrachtfestival (Classical music), when a floating platform is built in front of the Pulitzer Hotel. During the grand finale people lay their little boats around the platform and enjoy the music while sipping their white wine. On the first Satuerday of August huge crowds watch the (GLBT) Canal Parade, More than 80 decorated barks with their GLBT crew and many 'straight allies' (Police, Armed Forces, political parties, etc)sail in a parade through the Prinsengracht Further, every year in December and January there is the Amsterdam Light Festival with many light sculptures on the Prinesengracht. One secret tip: allthough the main streets in the old centre can be quite crowded, the canals are often really tranquile."

I would head for Haarlammerdijk close to Central Station and wander its speciality shops. Assuming you can tear yourself away, follow Prinsengracht for as long as your inclination takes you. Lots of history,architecture, bars and eateries. Trip boats maneuvering, pretty houseboats -even pedal boats and canoes! Boutiques, galleries and shops with lots of opportunity to people watch.But before your daydream completely overtakes you remember you're in Amsterdam. Watch out for the kamikaze cyclists! They will sneak up on you silently and scare the pants off you! Walk carefully and enjoy!"

If you start walking the Prinsengracht form the Haarlemmerstraat direction, than you find at least three of them at the left side. Usually covered by a big huge double door.

During our stay in Amsterdam, we travelled along this canal both via a hop-on, hop-off canal boat and also on foot along the streets next to the canal. It is a fairly narrow in places but still manages to accommodate a large number of canals boats either travelling along it or moored on either side of it. The streets alongside the canal are tree lined which generates a nice atmosphere and they provide shade on a hot day. We appreciated the scenery which included quaint canal houses, interesting bridges and despite the busy waterway, quite a bit of birdlife.Anne Frank\u2019s house, one of Amsterdam\u2019s premier tourist attractions is located on one side of the Prinsengracht. We were amazed by the hectic activity in the vicinity of this attraction. Whether is it was the canal boats coming and going, delivering and picking up visitors from the quay or the crowds of people queued along the roadway, it certainly was quite a hectic place! If people are seeking a bit more \u201claid back\u201d activity, we noticed that there were foot-propelled paddle boats for hire from an office, just along from Anne Frank\u2019s house.The Prinsengracht is certainly a picturesque and interesting canal. There are plenty of things to see and do there. You just need to be aware that in places, it can become a bit crowded and busy."

The most amazing thing about the festival but also the Prinsengracht,is that the people sing a long on a song which tells the story about the grachten of Amsterdam: the lyrics are: Aan de Amsterdamse Grachtenheb ik heel m'n hart voor altijd verpandAmsterdam vult mijn gedachtenals de mooiste stad in ons landAl die Amsterdamse mensenal die lichtjes 's avonds laat op 't pleinniemand kan zich beter wensendan een Amsterdammer te zijn. Any gracht in Amsterdam is beautiful, but the Prinsengracht has of course Anna Frank's house and the already mentioned festival. Except from Anna Franks house: free of entrance and beautiful to look at, to walk along or to visit it by boat. When you go by boat you'll see the amazing typical houses of Amsterdam in a better perspective as from the streets. A must see in Amsterdam."

Sadly, as we had a finite amount of time before getting the plane home, we had to give it a miss, and instead went for a stroll around the Prinsengracht area.We has floated through this part on our canal cruise where you are immediately struck by the fantastic looking buildings and architecture. Apart from Anne Frank House, the area was far less busier than, say, Dam Square, and we were grateful for it, as it meant we could wander around the streets (with luggage in tow) without being hindered by great throngs of humanity.We sat by the canal and watched boats and other contraptions float by - the only thing spoiling this was the massively overflowing public bins. We pressed our faces against the windows of many a caf\u00e9 or bakery to get a view of their wares. We took pictures of funky looking buildings and waved at other tourists as they drifted by on their canal tour. In short, this was a lovely area to visit, and in stark contrast to the bustling city centre."

Close to fresh water, the canals are mostly clean and fresh. A few of the tours get out onto the harbor - make sure you do that! See the Nemo building, and the Central Station's bicycle parking that holds 2500 bikes! Holland is a great country to be outdoors, and enjoying Amsterdam from the canals is a great way to do it. Pick out a nice sidewalk cafe, where the all seem to have awnings, and sip you drink watching bike riders, boats and life!"

That method is still used today. There are also a number of wonderful houseboats on the canal.Most boat tours will take you along all or some of Prinsengracht, but a stroll in the early evening or morning is pleasant too. If you are an architecture or history buff this should definitely be on your list of places to see in Amsterdam."

There are quite a few cafes, restaurants, shops around this lively area. If you walk around Prinsengracht you will come across some of the key tourist attractions like Anne Frank House, Van Gogh Museum, etc. However we couldn't visit any of the museum as we didn't prebook the tickets. If you want to visit these museums, it is advisable to book the tickets in advance. Overall, this place is definitely worth a visit."

I came for a three month stay in Amsterdam some decades ago with my band from India and happened to live close by the Prinsengracht. Prinsengracht is the furthest of the four main canals (from Central Station) and has two main attractions on it - the Westertoren and Anne Frank House right next to it. The Westertoren symbolises Amsterdam for me. When I stayed close to it the first time, the church bells would enchant me. The swans sliding by and surrounding fairy tale Jordaan area would really thrill me. So much so that I had a dream of one day coming to live in Amsterdam one day.This dream actualy materialised. I live in this charming city for the last fourteen years. I discovered very soon after coming to live here that on Tuesdays, a boat comes by and circles around, close to the Westertoren. The carillion player plays rock and pop tunes on Tuesday afternoons! Around 12 noon a boat comes by - there is a musician in it who plays the organ and the trumpt and does duets with the carillion player in the tower. Spectators are wonderstruck at this experience."

This canal is also the gateway to the other (outer) parts of the city of Amsterdam (including: the Jordaan and the Oud Zuid, and Amsterdam Noord region). One may easily get to many destinations within this canal such as The Anne Frank House, Cheese Museum, Monet museum, Westerkirk, Tulip Museum. This canal is much quieter and more relaxing than the canals closer to the city center and has more locals strolling the streets. Great place to have a drink at a brown cafe and people watch."

Our hotel faced this canal, which radiates round the centre of Amsterdam, and it was lovely to look out of the window and see the houseboats and restaurant boats moving along, and the houses all along the canal are individual, with amazing gables and huge windows. Some have steps up to the front door, and most have cellars, which must be below the water line. There are many bridges along this canal, which offer photo opportunities, and at night they are lit up. It is atmospheric and delightful. The cobbled streets are narrow, with one way traffic, and more bikes than cars come along, so you have to keep your wits about you, and keep on the narrow pavements!"

I found Amsterdam to be a very clean city, felt safe at all times and enjoyed admiring the character of the architecture. I never visited the 'seedy' area (not for me), but the flower market was large (would love to see it in the summer), There was a small Christmas Market (10 stalls) mainly food. I would definitely return to Amsterdam. I particularly found the whole concept of very few cars and thousands of bicycles quiet a curiosity, so very easy to get about on foot unlike other cities."

These days, there are only few cars roaming around in this area, but if you have kids with you, beware of bullet bikes that seem to be coming from nowhere.This being said, the walk is really enjoyable, and many cafes are on the way for a quick stop in a real Dutch atmosphere.However, before starting this tour, I would strongly advise to visit the Grachten Museum (located on Herengracht, near Leidsestraat). I am happy I did it, because it explains quite well how, when and why the canals were built. There are also many house reproductions and it is possible to look at their interior through peep holes."

We took one of the many canal boat tours which comes with a reasonable charge, however if you are used to walking it is not an unreasonable distance to cope with.We found the whole city to be equaly historicaly enjoyable and very interesting.Our break was for four days and depending on your interests, a week is probably enough for the average visitor, however there is enough to keep the more intent visitor enguaged for much longer."

Anne Frank House should be the top of anyone's list (I suggest getting tickets a couple months ahead of time to avoid long line up, you can see my review of this). There is also the Amsterdam Tulip House (which I'll have to see next time), the Houseboat Museum (that was neat, see my review on that), and Westkerk Church, built 1622 (see my review).Plenty of restaurants to choose from and you can sit outside people watching and admiring the canal. I patronized Cafe Marcella (see my review on that) and Cafe Kalkhoven (see my review on one of oldest in Amsterdam). Unfortunately it was still raining when I was at this cafe to sit outside but I sat by the window enjoying the view.Prinsengracht is between five or ten minute (well depends on fast or slow you go) walk from Dam Square (see my review on the square).Make sure you have comfortable walking shoes and don't forget the camera!Depending on what you want to see, I'd bank on at least three hours maybe more exploring what Prinsengracht has to offer. It took about 45 minutes to an hour to go through Anne Frank's House.I was on one of end Prinsengracht one day as I explored areas near then a couple days later on the other end."

The solidarity of everyone in the city with the gay community is commendable. Literally thousands of people line Prinsengracht and Amstel and the bridges over those waterways to watch the boats and floats go by. Only 80 entrants are chosen annually from industries, banks and private groups which apply. Several hundred people man the floats, some of which look precariously over-full. On board there are men, women and men who appear to be women. Binoculars help in that game. We did not plan to be in Amsterdam for Gay Pride, but we are very glad that it worked out this way, because this event is so \"one of a kind\". Boaters stake out their viewing location days in advance. Those on foot choose their viewing locations hours in advance. One day there's empty space and the next morning 10 boats have tied up to watch the Canal Parade. You don't have to be gay to enjoy this event. It's very entertaining for everyone. This is the best free entertainment you can find in A'dam. The floating parade entrants start arriving around 11 AM, and by about 1:30 the parade starts from Prinsengracht near the Jordaan. It is more like 2 PM or later by the time the first floats make it up Amstel and beyond, towards Centraal Station. The entire parade of the 80 boats, plus assorted hangers-on, goes on till nearly 6 PM, and the party continues into the evening with loud music and lots of pedestrians all around the parade route. Even the tram service was suspended on at least the 4, 9 and 14 lines, that we know of, and quite likely others. Now, 4 hours after the Canal Parade ended, the trams are still not running yet. This is a big holiday here in Holland. There are portable toilets in many locations along the parade route and venders, especially of food and gay-friendly paraphenalia, are ubiquitous. The police presence is enormous. The crowd was super-friendly and totally non-violent, so the presence, for example, of \"paddy wagons\" to take away those who might be arrested was totally unnecessary."

Don't expect smelly or polluted water: all the city canals have their water cleaned every three days! Quite impressive! You could even swim on it, but it is not allowed.It's very interesting to notice the way of life of the near-by residents of the Amsterdam canals. They simply sit by the canal, chat a little, some have their boats for a ride, others even do barbecue on the boat with their friends! So different from the busy city center (Dam).And, of course, bicicles everywhere. It's Netherland, after all.Prinsengracht is one of the famous canals from Amsterdam. You will find there the tradicional houses architecture and bridges. It's a good idea to do the boat tour. You will have access to a lot of information about the canals and the city.Enjoy it!"

Prinsengracht is the next canal over from Herengracht both canals traverse the Jordaan area of Amsterdam and will eventually guide you to the Anne Frank House and the lines that extend from its entrance. One of the real pleasures of Amsterdam is the opportunity to walk through some beautiful canal bordered neighborhoods and admire the architecture(and the leaning row houses that are shifting on their foundations) and the peace and tranquility away from the Dam Square and Newmarket/Oude Kerk areas. The Prinsengracht is also home to some excellent restaurants and canal side caf\u00e9s that offer a nice respite after your walk. Make sure to stay on the sidewalk and avoid the bike paths or risk incurring the wrath of the Amsterdamers as they speed along to or from work."

We started off at the boat stop near to the central train station and by the time we reached the canals, the sun was setting. As it was dusk, I started to feel a little sleepy (a little jetlagged) but what kept me awake and fascinated was at dusk every house was lit in their warm lighting. It was a dreamy experience peering into the rooms of the well-to-do.... a grand piano in what seems like a music room.... Many homes with a special reading room with a wall to ceiling library of books.... beautiful art deco pictures draped on every wall. It was almost as though Amsterdammers WANT people to see their rooms from the outside and everyone's competing to out-do each other! Nonetheless, I was really appreciating the effort that Amsterdammers take to decorate their houses. And of course, when the evening lights are on ... and you are sitting in a boat holding the hand of the man you love.... ah! Dreamy Amsterdam!! I couldn't ask for more :)"

You get to see so much, a great mix of residential, businesses, shops, cafes, bars and restaurants.You can of course get a boat cruise that will take in this canal amongst many others."

Prinsengracht is one of the main canals of Amsterdam, and the longest one. You can find small specific shops and cafes/restaurants along this canal. There are 3 churches are still used as a church, Noorderkerk, Westerkerk and Amstelkerk (on Amstelveld) and 1 church, \"de Duif\" is used for some events. The most famous events at this canal is \"Prinsengracht Concert\" and \"Gay Pride\". There is a flea market at Noordermarkt on Monday morning and an organic farmer market on Saturdays. Also Flower/ Plant market is held at Amstelveld on Mondays. The Houseboat museum is at Prinsengracht nr.296 , Amsterdam Pipe museum at nr. 488 and Anna Frank House at nr. 263-267"

The Prinsengracht, Herengracht and Keizersgracht are 3 of Amsterdam\u2019s most famous streets located on canals within the city center. These 3 streets and canals are south of Central Station (train depot) and Dam Square. They radiate south and outward from Dam Square in a curved or convex pattern, akin to the 5 lower sides of an octagon. Large sections of all 3 are walkable in a morning or afternoon. The ambiance of the canals, the architecture, the bicycles, the people and the shops, bars and cafes are what Amsterdam is all about. They are the contemporary live museums of Amsterdam. If you are interested in how and when these canals and houses were built, and good stories about some of the people you know that lived in these houses, along with the history and culture of Amsterdam and its place in the world, then read Russell Shorto\u2019s Amsterdam, a wonderful and inspiring book, that will also inform you about the roots of individual freedom and the great advances of the Enlightenment."

The streets are lined with warehouses; you can recognize the warehouses by the simple (aka non-decorated) hooks on the top section of the houses. The other two canals; the Gentleman and the Emperor, are mostly lined with housing for the rich. So although the houses on Prinsengracht will not be as pretty as the other two canals, it is certainly a nice place to stroll down for a walk, especially at night. Furthermore, Anne Frank house and the Tulip Museum is within close vicinity. I had the pleasure of staying in one of the houseboats on Prinsengracht during my visit in Amsterdam through couchsurfing. The view is particularly stunning (and you can find this on many postcards) during the night when the nearby church (Westerkirk) and bridges are lighted up. Highly recommended if you want to take photos or just take a breather (it's the furthest canal of the three from the city and hence much less crowded)."

Be sure to stay on what little sidewalk there is or you may be side swiped by a bicyclist - they come from all directions. Also watch your step for \"presents\" left by family pets.

Art; Music - some amazing street musicians! One of our highlights was hiring a bike for the day - it took some courage, but turned out a lot more straightforward than we anticipated for two reasons: (1) The bike is 'king' in Amsterdam - everything else has to give way including pedestrians. (2) The locals were very forgiving if you made some mistake - e.g. stopping instantly because you forgot back-peddling was the brake. Perhaps it helped too that the bikes were lime green. But wonderful to cycle through the Vondelpark, stopping at cafes for refreshment, on the way to see the Stedelijk Museum 's collection of modern art. Sunday, we went to Hillsong Amsterdam, the contemporary worship church. Slightly out of the town centre, it allowed us to discover the great tram transport system; and great to see first hand how Hillsong, a modern church community, does things.Very slick; very welcoming; and the ubiquitous good coffee of the Netherlands. Four services every Sunday each with over five hundred attendees. Sigh!"

Tons of cozy caf\u00e9s, restaurants a small shop scattered in between the classic dutch canal houses on Prinsengracht and the adjacent streets.

I would highly recommend visiting those areas but not necessarily locating your hotel near those attractions. The Prinsengracht canal, its bridges and the streets & parkways paved with bricks, were fairytale-like! There are great restaurants & bars with lovely seating areas along the canal and shops to enjoy throughout this area. Just remember, as you enjoy this beautiful area, always keep a look out for bikes, cars, motorcycles, open stairwells on the sidewalk, etc., etc., etc. One must always keep alert when in this area on a beautiful summer day when everyone heads to this area!

It felt that the Amsterdam canals and the houses that line them did not vary much from \"'gracht to gracht\", being all pretty with lots of opportunities for photos. Spent most of the time strolling in the central and western ring areas. In Prinsengracht, found a stretch of similar looking houses that were clear of trees in front (this turned out to be the Red Deer Brewery), plus there were also boathouses here, a few of which are open to travelers for a small fee. Of course there are many cafes and restaurants lining this canal (though preferred going into adjacent Jordaan neighbourhood) but the benches are fine for sitting and whiling away the time too, if you don't mind the parked cars behind you.In the western canal ring side, the major attraction is the Anne Frank House which can be easily spotted by the long queue outside the building. Nearby, Westerkerk is also along the Prinsengracht and its Tower can be visited however only allows a limited number of visitors per day it seems. Behind Westerkerk is The Homomonument which is an easy 2-5 minute look-see; it is located along the next main canal Emperor's Canal/Keizersgracht and can provide a turning point for strolling to other areas of the Grachtengordel."

The Prinsengracht (Prince's Canal) is the longest, outer canal of the 17th century major canals in Amsterdam. The other two are Herengracht (Patricians' Canal or Gentlemen's Canal) and Keizersgracht (Emperor's canal). It is named after the Prince of Orange. Most of the canal houses along it were built during the Dutch Golden Age of the United Provinces. This canal was largely used for warehouses. The bridges over the Prinsengracht canal do not connect with the streets in the Jordaan.If you travel around Amsterdam very much, it is hard to avoid encountering this large canal. It is a bit hard to tell one canal from the other, having a map and giving it a look before traveling the city is probably a good idea. This canal can be seen by various means, one of the canal boat tours may be the easiest."

I took a picture of Sherri and you'd swear it was a postcard- bikes all over, a beautiful church in the background, and boats in the canal. Grab lunch here in one of the many eateries, stroll hand in hand, or take the canal tour, you can't go wrong. It is hard to say which canal is the best, but we seemed to always gravitate back to this one."

The typical richman's homes facing the canal have elaborate facings, large windows and interesting entrance doors. During the golden ages the rich merchants lived here, and they really exhibited their wealth. Just be careful whilst strolling along the canals, it is easy to walk into a bike-rider or even.... fall into the canal [yes- it happens] We enjoyed our strolls here as it generally is quiet and peaceful.

The walk is so peaceful because of the canals and the beautiful architecture along the way. If you want to look away from that for a moment, you can take in the sights and sounds of one of the most vibrant cities in the world or just sit in a cafe and take it all in from there. One of our favourite things to do"

There are several cheese shops located all around Amsterdam and in the department stores, which are very good, a bit pricey, but again, the same brand shop is all over. I shouted w glee when we ran into the Cheese Museum, which a across the canal and down 1 block from the Anne Frank House. The minute I walked in I thought to myself, \"Yes, something different . This is what I was looking for.\" An older gentleman was dressed in traditional clothing of the Nederlands, wooden shoes and all. But, he was there to answer any of your questions, give you samples and of course, sell cheese. The prices were about 3E less for similiar sized cheeses from the other shops. Also, being the cheese is purchased from the cheese museum, any of it could be brought back to the states, so they said. There is a cheese museum downstairs which is 2 E and gives you a 10% discount on your purchase, so figure out if its worth going to it or not. I spent a long time in the shop. Ate tons of cheese and purchased 2 rounds, which they vacuum seal for you for your travels. How fun!"

There is nothing to visit in particular, I would recommend to take some time off and just stroll around. You will never feel disappointed.Another unique part is that you can rent boats at this place - there may be other places where you can rent the boat and explore the vast network of canals, but it was really a good sight to see young couples together on boats moving around. This was the first place where I noticed traffic lights for boats and later I saw in Hamburg (Germany) also.Do not miss this place. It has a charm, a character and a lot to offer."

You may see someone moving into their new apartment using the steel beam at the top of the house with a pulley to move large furniture in through the windows.

Part of Prinsengracht intersects Raadhuisstraat and Rozengracht where the Westerkerk landmark is and Anne Frank huis. If you go north towards Central Station you'll pass by or enter into popular areas such as the Jordaan; Westermarkt; Lijnbaanmarkt; Noodermarkt; Haarlemerdijk; Haarlemerstraat. If you are going to visit one specific site - such as the markets, perhaps 2 hours is ample enough. If you want to take in as mmuch as you can - better to mmake half a day or mmore out of it. There is so mmuch to see - the picturesque canal, buildings, and shops. At the end of Prinsengracht (just steps away from Haarlemerdijk) you'll see a cool old cannon fromm the Amsterdam Defence Line!

Great for people watching, not so great for sleeping. While we did not travel along the canal by boat, we did walk along the canal on several occasions. Amsterdam is not my favourite city in the world but the area around the canal provides a real contrast to the cultural wasteland around the train station and the red light district. Walk along the canal, look up to appreciate the buildings, tall and thin to maximize water frontage. Enjoy an afternoon meal, pastry, or drink along the canal. Find a street vendor selling Stroopwafel or herring. This is a much more relaxed part of Amsterdam. While I would not call it the best attraction in Amsterdam, I did find it to be the one place where I could appreciate the beauty of the city."

A search in Tripadvisor led me to this canal. I felt that this canal was the same as the other two main canal. The architecture of buildings along the canal is very picturesque. All the houses have 3-4 floors and their fa\u00e7ade is different from another one. Everything looks miniature like. The houseboats are another interesting feature of Amsterdam canals. There are lots of cafes along the canal and make sure to sit back and relax and sip a cup of coffee while watching people biking around. The best way to explore the city is by bike or canal cruises. Don\u2019t miss them."

At this very point, I would like to indicate that, one of the most meaningful museums in the world, the Anne Frankhuis, is also located at that very canal.

We loved looking in the windows of the art galleries and coffee houses along the way and watching the boat traffic go by. The sidewalks are narrow and the cars and bikes zoom by! There is a fun gift store just down the street from the Pulitzer with kooky gifts, papergoods and fun trinkets. We walked to the Anne Frank House early one morning to get in line for the 9am opening-there is a coffee house with bagels next door and the line starts at 8am. Well worth it as we were able to walk through the house and museum without large crowds."

So close to a tram, walk to Leidesplein, grocery store, sandwich shops, a couple of small cafes, a reknown bakery, even a mellow yellow - all within a couple of blocks. It's a wonderful neighborhood to walk in the early morning and evening. Well, anytime of day!"

            "review": "Prinsengracht - Princes' canal worth several visits. The Prinsengracht - included in what the Dutch call \" National Monument\" site - is worth several visits in one day. What you see on your canal boat trip, would be totally different from what you will experience, and more, when you go strolling down Prinsengracht - the Princes' canal.Apart from the historic buildings, the different architectural styles and the cobble-stoned width of the road beside the canal that could not be further widened since a few hundred years ago, one gets a glimpse of a certain life-style of the Amsterdamers, for example, as per the following:1) The shops, art galleries, the restaurants, etc. along the \"gracht\" (= meaning \"canal\"), also in the various side streets branching off Prinsengracht and the other canals - these establishments are not there just for the tourists, so here you can shop and eat like the locals do (not at tourist prices);2) on Saturday mornings in the Lindengracht (off the Prinsengracht) there is a \"mile long\", \" wet-market\" - there you can find stalls selling fresh fruits, veggies, fish, cheeses, breads, etc, including stalls selling arts and crafts, clothings, shoes, etc AND you can buy and taste Dutch herring and other fish delicacies at local (not tourist) prices;3) also on Saturday mornings, near the Lindengracht market is a \"farmers' market\" selling organic products;4) on Monday mornings (but not in the winter months) at the location of the \"farmermers' market\" is where you find an arts and crafts, antique and second-hand goods market. Who knows what \"gems\" you can find there ?Please take note the abovementioned are happenings \"in the mornings\", which means if you go in the afternoons you are likely to miss the \"real thing\".Suggestion:Do go in the mornings - to survey the place and visit the markets that the locals go to eat, then have coffee, bagles, and rest by the open-air terraces serving refreshments and drinks.In the afternoon, check out the shops - there are many quaint specialty type shops (most have been there for many, many years) - for example, shops selling nothing but candles, nothing but board games, nothing but cook books, vintage clothes, vintage books, and so on. Also do check out the restaurants where the locals eat ( menus and prices are usually displayed outside).In the evenings, stroll down the lighted canal and pop into one of the \"brown cafes\" for a drink or night-cap, and see how the locals enjoy themselves.We visit Amsterdam every year and we find the time spent strolling along the Prinsengracht, the Herengracht (=Dukes' canal) and the Keizersgracht (=Emperors' canal) as time well spend at different times of the day, because the scenery and the flow of activity changes all day long. Hot-tip:1) If you plan to come to Amsterdam in the late summer, do search online for the opening times and dates when several of the historical buildings along the canals, which are \"still-in-working-order\" and classified as \"National Monuments\", are open for viewing to the public, free of charge. If you can can get into some of these buildings, it will be truly a great \"Dutch\" experience.2) If you go to Amsterdam in early August, check out on-line for dates of (a) the gay (day-time) parade, (b) Prinsengracht open-air on the water classical music (evening) concert performance - these are both free of charge and an experience that is second to none."

You'll walk south away from the station and eventually curve around east - it's a long walk! On the way, enjoy the shops, the cafes, bars and restaurants. You'll pass the outer edge of the Nine Streets shopping district - do some exploring and check out, for example, De Kaaskamer on Runstraat (I think the best cheese shop in Amsterdam.). If you're into the coffeehouse scene, do stop at La Tertulia for a smoke - very friendly, welcoming, pretty and relaxed. If you keep going you'll come to Leidsestraat and can take a short detour south to Leidseplein, or keep on truckin' to Museumbrug and take that to the Rijksmuseum. Tired? Catch the tram or a canal boat to take you back near Centraal Station. One of my favorite walks anywhere."

Look out for the entrepreneurial Dutch and the little ice-cafes that pop up everywhere. And please, please, please, do not stop to take photos of the ice when walking under the bridges! That ice isn't all that solid and it makes the locals nervous! Keep on walking!"

We walked along it nearly to the RIjksmusem and Van Gogh Museum--a long but pleasant walk--and back. The Pulitzer Hotel has a private canal boat for once-a-day tours at 5 p.m., which we didn't do as our time was limited and we did an extensive canal tour a few years ago (AND we were just off a 24-day transatlantic cruise, so water was not our primary objective!)--but being ON this well located canal was a highlight of our 3 post-cruise days in wonderful Amsterdam."
