I have to say I was a little dissapointed with this library not too far from the central train station, and I have been all around the world multiple times, and every single library I have ever walked into internet service is generally free, just show them your id or passport depending on what country, BUT this location they charge now, which is quite a shame, BUT other than that book selection is massive, toilet is .20 euros downstairs."

We were there for the view and didn't feel out of place just enjoying the it."

That said, I didn't even touch a book, as we were just here for a drink and treat.The cafe on the top floor is superb. It's more like a posh market. Plenty to choose from and wonderfully presented, with a farmers' market feel to it. There's a small balcony area which despite the building's exposed position is quite sheltered. It offers views across the city, though with the flat topography and most buildings the same height there's little to see (pleasant enough, mind)."

The children's area has an amazing doll house inhabited by toy mice (behind glass, alas) that even adults could gaze at for a good long time to take it all in."

The building is incredibly light and there are lots of cool chairs and it's very calm inside. But then we went to the top and saw the amazing view of the city! We decided to have lunch there and it was a great meal for really not much money and it was prepared freshly in front of our eyes - I'm a vegan and I had a fresh pizza without cheese with tomatoes and mushrooms for 6,50\u20ac, and it was delicious. I'd really recommend coming here to anyone!"

Eat at the top floor cafe - cheap, good, stylish food and a terrific view of Amsterdam. Oh - and did I mention the public piano in the foyer, for those \"I simply must sit down and play a piano\" moment.

The library itself is quiet and peaceful and a wonderful escape from the busy city. On the top floor is the caf\u00e9 where the food is not expensive but truly delicious, with an outdoor seating area that provides wonderful views over the harbour and the city. My only disappointment was that we went there on the last day of our holiday and not the first!"

So keep it for a rainy dayOr when you are hungry and want something fast. The cafe is one of the best in the area.I wouldn't go out of the way to visit but worth it if you can make it.And there is a piano, which if you are lucky will have some visitor playing it beautifully."

It's very modern, and has quite a few floors. They even have a cafe on the top floor where you can grab a bite and a view of Amsterdam.When I visited in April 2016, they had this exhibit where you could use your phone to take a 360 selfie. It was kind of hidden, so I don't think a lot of people knew about it.If you're in the area, you should definitely check this place out!"

On the same floor is a restaurant where the food is okay and is not spectacular but is definitely convenient. On the bottom floor there is a reception like area where you can buy tickets for many of the sites and theatre shows, so it is indeed a well visited place.

So all kinds of digital media are available here. The result is quite good. Also remarkable are opening hours, being all 7 days, 10-22h. To lend material you have te become a member, but on the spot many more is to be consulted, like a large number of magazines and newspapers, and there are workplaces for the Internet."

However, this striking building near the Central Station came highly recommended by a friend. We admired the open access on all the floors and found the cafe food very appealing even though that wasn't what we had in mind. The rows of fresh fruit smoothies were irresistible and we found the sandwich selection to our taste as well. It was good food and reasonable. Sitting on the terrace and then spending time at the fixed viewing stations of the city was well worth a break from the August crowds."

Being a nerd means that you've got a brilliant perspective towards library. The only problem was as a solo traveler it wasn't possible for me to lend any books I was fond of from there. I sat and read for a few hours there and went to the top floor which provides a spectacular view of Amsterdam and some authentic meals there.

I tried several times to print a document here, but every time they tell a different story. But of course I am the stupid guy, that doesn't understand how you're supposed to approach them. Actually I think they use this place for unemployed women to get used to working in an office. As a boss I would avoid hiring any of them and as a customer I would avoid this place at all times.

Its a must visit.The children's area in the basement is one the most charming areas I have ever seen - if I was a child I would be delighted to visit this library. There is also a great store of music and movies on the higher floors and a live FM station running from the library (which seems logical as the RJ can pick out any music he or she may like from the library itself)There is also a free piano accessible to only those who can play reasonably and when we were there a young pianist was playing the most wonderful music that was resounding in the background making our library visit all the more enjoyable.The mouse sculpture is art!

I did not anticipate bring so stunned by a library but it's truly incredible, more of a library-museum hybrid. The cafe on the top floor is not cheap, but 100% worth it, good handmade food, sandwiches were really good. The lady on the till told me in good English that if I wanted soup with my sandwich, there was an offer meaning it was only 5 cents more, which I thought was kind of her to tell me. There are also multiple pianos dotted around which 'experienced pianists' were free to play. And people do play them! I regret not playing myself now. Definitely worth a visit."

(Just past the floating Chinese Restaurant).It is free to enter and is a great place to enjoy lunch and have a rest from walking round.The Library has 6/7 floors connected by an illuminated free standing escalator. It is ultra modern and I have never seen anything quite like it. It's a very impressive sight. Each floor represents a different subject etc. If you get the escalator up to the top floor there is a lovely restaurant called La Place which is reasonably priced. There is an outside area which affords great views over the harbour and parts of Amsterdam cityWhen we visited last year there was a free art exhibition on one of the floors. Well worth a visit.

However, if you are going to work in a library, the Amsterdam Central library, down the street from the train station, is the one worth going to. The architecture is amazing. There is a restaurant on the top with view overlooking the city. The glass fa\u00e7ade on every floor also affords people with laptops to sit in comfortable chairs and stair out over the city. And if you are caught short and you need to do a little work, they have tons of free PC's. Internet cost is minimal. Its a great place to relax, or catch up on some work. There is also an excellent video floor, as well as an arts section. You can reconnect with the culture and history of Europe here, in a warm environ which is free for anyone seeking a little respite from the rain or cold. This is truly a special place."

The escalators just keep going up and up with different resources on every level. The actual resources given to the people of Amsterdam are really great, lots of reading material in book and electronic form and little hidey spaces to rest/read/study in.We were just there as visitors on a cloudy day and spent a good few hours just enjoying browsing the books and people watching. There is a radio station on one floor, an old man was napping on another and someone else was happily (not sure about legally) smoking cigarettes while listening to music on another floor. Book selection for browsing offers a number of english options and a diversity of subjects.The wifi in the building is not free but it is a great space to rest unmolested by staff or the general public.There is a cafe on the top floor with an open air deck offering a panoramic view of the city, obscured to an extent by the structure. The cafe has a reasonable selection of cafeteria style food options, a bit chaotic in system regarding collecting and paying. The day we went although the food looked appetising, it smelt a bit odd in there.Alternatively, chain pizza/pasta restaurant Vapianos is on the ground floor along with another few unfranchised bars/restaurants that may or may not be open. They all form part of a new build district along the shorefront.It's a fairly easy walk to the library from the town centre or train station but not necessarily always pleasant as you have to cross a few main roads at some point.Worth a browse though if you like books and modern buildings and want a peaceful 'attraction' that is free."

Nothing quite delivered (literally in terms of service) sadly. You'll get fed but it's not a treat. Much better places in town to splash the cash. It did seem popular with young families with lots of smoothies and fruit for the littlies. As a library, I'm guessing it's pretty much perfect."

What a view over amsterdam! I love a good view and marvelled at it from all angles.After this, I worked my way down the floors marvelling at exhibitions, I had some tickets to print out which the staff were very helpful with, and lots of quirky art and design.

It has some signals so you can easy identify what are you looking far from there.

The customer service is in my experience fine. They are willing to help, though fairly \u2018neutral\u2019. The views are good though; both from the top balcony and from the terrace. There is also a small restaurant on the top floor and another Italian one at the terrace. There are food and drink establishments at walking distance outside. The library is also situated in a fairly favorable spot; Science Center NEMO (aimed at families and kids) is close by, The National Maritime Museum, the Schreierstoren, Central Station, etc. So overall it is just a regular, modern, library. Maybe worth a visit if you have time to kill or enjoy exploring libraries; entry is free after all. I personally would not know what you could really experience in the library as tourist attraction (aside from the views), which would make it worthwhile to make a detour for it."

It can be a little tricky to find a seat on Saturday, but even then you can almost always find a corner to enjoy a few books in or just sit and enjoy the view.The cafe on the top floor has some of the best hot chocolate around, the milk is steamed through real chocolate chips while you watch. They also have good, cheap, fast, and tasty pizzas for around 10 euros. During the warmer months, they also have an outdoor terrace with an amazing panoramic view of Amsterdam from seven stories up.Both the library itself and the cafe are incredibly family friendly. The kid's floor of the library is well organized for a range of ages, with plenty of quiet corners to sit down and read a book to your child, and lots of fun things to climb on or through. The cafe has high chairs and has enough corner tables that you can generally find a place for even a large stroller.Best of all, it's right next to Central station, so it's perfect if you have an hour or two before your train."

We didn't eat there on our first visit but did go on our last evening in Amsterdam, as we were tired and not wanting to spend much time and money. The food was great considering it's a food court, not to mention they sell alcohol (In a library? We liked that!) Definitely plan on eating there as a quick, delicious meal in the middle of your day or for a relaxed evening. It's not cheap but still not as expensive as a traditional restaurant."

Since it's getting harder to find places with computers, what was once called \"internet cafes\", libraries are the next best thing especially if you don't have your own device. The charge is one Euro per 30 minutes for using either the computer for Internet or using the WIFI with you own device. I was on floor three I think where I went to use the computer. I was ready to hand my Euro but the librarian said she didn't handle cash anymore. I just wanted to use the computer for no more than 15 minutes and she let me use for free (I happen to be lucky at the time so don't expect that to happen to you).I didn't know until I came home and have read this on their website \"As from the 1st of January 2014 the OBA does no longer accept cash payments\" So unless you own a Dutch debit card, then a credit card (MasterCard or Visa) will be the next best thing.There are seven floors in this building. I briefly visited each floor. The children's is on the lower floor. On the seventh floor is a huge cafe. Go outside to the patio for a spectacular view of Amsterdam. The day I was there was very rainy and windy so I did stay outside too long, just a quick glimpse.On one of the floors they had a neat display of books about different people, one of which was Nelson Mandela.There is a huge a/v section. There is this massive amount of DVD's on this huge round shelving unit. The library is about a five minute walk from Centraal Station. This main branch is open from 10 am to 10 pm seven days a week.There are a total of 26 branches in Amsterdam. There was a branch near my B&B that I went to visit as well. It is a short five minute walk from Museumplein.You can visit for free BUT there is a fee as I said for the Internet and if you're staying for a while in Amsterdam and want to borrow materials there may be a fee for that but you'll have to ask at the library."

A great place to eat if there is a large group of you, La Place is a buffet style restaurant with something for everyone. You'll need to join the library to borrow a book, but you could easily spend a long time hanging out there for free."

We did not eat there so I cannot say anything about the food, however the art work, the extensive English book section, the children's book section and the media library sections were very impressive. They also have art displays that change from time to time. Great place to visit even if only in town for a short period. The escalators to the floors make is a welcome break from all the walking and stairways normally found in the buildings of the historic community."

Especially, when you are at the 6th floor of this building where there is a cafeteria you will have a nice view of the city. If you are a book lover, this is the right place for you. Wonderful collection of worldwide books are there. Also, you can have a yearly pass for reasonable price and take the books for subscription with you. After all, if you are a tourist it is also one of the good attractions of Amsterdam to visit."

It might seems to be quite boring to visit a library as a tourist but it is really worth doing. The entrance is free, and you only have to pay if you would like to take a book home (I have no idea if it is possible for tourists). There are 5 or 6 levels in the library, and you may access any book shelf inside. While you are in the library, you are allowed to sit or even lay with a book and read it. There are some computers and I assume there's Internet access there. On the top floor there is a cafe with an open terrace for the warm seasons."

They had an entire floor dedicated to just CD's and dvd's. The piano in the foyer of the library, which you were welcome to play on was very nice (especially since I quite miss my piano at home). The cafe on the top floor of the library was a highlight with their wide range of menu items (at reasonable prices), free wifi and excellent views of Amsterdam.

The ground floor boasts a piano that anyone walking by can sit down to and show their skills or complete lack thereof. Have you ever been to a library with a piano? Library was once for reading, reading requires concentration, concentration requires absence of a piano on the ground floor. The genius of an architect who designed this place also made sure that you can hear the piano three floors up.The last floor has a terrace with nice views of the city of Amsterdam--for free! Many tourists read tripadvisor and come to this building for the views. What this means in practice is that the library is filled with tourists on their way to the terrace, shouting in excitement and anticipation of the views and on their way down screaming with anticipation of food, drink and more excitement at their next destination. These people were never told to keep their mouths shut when in a library.But wait, it's not just the hysterical tourists, the genius of an architect who designed this place thought--why don't we add insult to injury? So he put a playground inside this abomination of a library. Playground! For kids, you know. To slide down their slides and scream off the top of their lungs due to either pleasure or discomfort of the experience.In short, you can spend here the whole of 15 minutes on the terrace staring at the Amsterdam city views, but do not even try to come here to read. You're better off at a construction site or at the nearby central railway station."

The layout and open design of the whole building defies my previous knowledge of what libraries look like and the atmosphere is great. When we arrived there was someone playing classical music on a piano so we sat in the very comfortable seats and listened. The range of books, cds and dvds is really outstanding and if I lived in Amsterdam I could quickly see this as becoming one of my favourite haunts!"

We had read about the view from the library but were surprised at what a modern up to date place it was--with some ususual designs and lighting. Also suprising was that fact it was open to 10 PM, even on a Friday (you usually do not have that in libraries in that states). On the top floor is a great view from a patio looking over central Amsterdam--it has a great buffet restaurant called \"Le Place\" which operates other restaurants in the Netherlands. There are also a calendar of events of many lectures, music, etc. taking place here. The library is a few hundred yards to the east of the Central Staation along the water. Another plus--rest rooms are free here."

This was a really interesting visit.The library here has a really unique, user-friendly design. While there are tons of quiet areas to work (and a variety of different seating options), the library also has a lot of central areas where people can meet and talk. It was great to see this incarnation of a library; I have never seen anything like it.However, I suspect that this is so highly ranked because of the seventh-floor terrace with views of the city. OK, Amsterdam isn't the largest or even the sexiest city, but the views are free. The barrier is fairly high - definitely over a meter tall - but below that, there is clear plexiglass, so kids can easily see through. Shorter adults may have trouble, though. I'm 5'7\"/ 170 cm and the top of the barrier was at chest-level.The food in the cafeteria looks good (lots of different food stations to choose from, including a pizza oven!) and the price seems to be OK; however, we stuck to drinks. A well-lit cooler showed off a decent variety of drinks, alcoholic and non-. If you're in Amsterdam with a group of picky eaters, this would be an excellent, affordable place to go. Admission is free and on a rainy day, it kept a friend and I occupied for almost two hours (including a drink in the cafeteria). However, I am giving it four stars instead of five because I wouldn't consider it a \"must-do\" in Amsterdam, like taking a boat tour of the canals."

The view is okay, but really not great for photographs (in my opinion). Cafeteria style snacks/food on the top floor in case you are hungry or thirsty, but you don't have to buy anything to pop out to the terrace, just be respectful of people who actually did buy food there. If I lived in Amsterdam, I would totally come to this library often. There was live music on two floors, great stations to listen to music, a beautiful children's place, great light, etc."

Coming from the United States, I really didn\u2019t know what to expect when visiting the Central Library (Openbare Bibliotheek) in Amsterdam. To be honest, I was completely astonished by what I found. The outside of the building is absolutely beautiful with stunning glass windows as far as the eye can see and numerous floors that seem to never end. The inside is even better. Contemporary lighting is found throughout the lobby with beautiful hardwood floors and plush lounge chairs dotted throughout. Each level has different departments on it so be sure to read the directory to find what you\u2019re looking for or just have fun and explore the whole building. There is an elevator located in the back of the library that will take you to the different levels with ease. The absolute best part was finding the quaint restaurant located on the top level. They have an amazing outdoor platform from which you can see a panoramic view of the city. The views were stunning and definitely worth while. The library is very easy to find as it is located a short walk to the East from Centraal Station. Absolutely stunning and one of a kind."

Hard to rate this place: is this mainly an excellent lunch restaurant (loads of fresh vegetables, fruit, wonderful presentation) with a good top floor view? Or is it just a welcome break-away from the insane tourist crowd, just minutes away around the Central Station? Or a minor basement event for families with young kids - who will love the mice doll house-? The modern, minimalistic and thematic library concept is probably not the reason why quite a few international tourist show up. In any case: we enjoyed our OBA visit which lasted approx. 1,5 hours."

As a family of avid readers we were intrigued. The building itself is pleasant. The problems are how customers are treated:- One added service the library has is to sell tickets to tourist attractions throughout the city. We tried to buy. The first person at the counter said they do not sell tickets. We showed from the library brochure that it is a service. A manager (I guess) came into help and said they sell tickets, but only 2, they will not sell 5. What is this nonsense? So we walked to the tourist office at the central stations, about 300 m, and bought tickets.- WiFi is not free- The restaurants on the 7th floor have a good selection but incredibly the toilets are charged. 50 Euro cents does not matter, it is the principle.We were all very disappointed with the customer facing aspects of the library! The collection itself, especially the children's area, is nice."

I travelled to the Central Library because I'd read that you got an amazing view from the top - well, the view was indeed nice, but useless for photography, as the design of the building prevents you from getting any really good shots (the roof hangs over). That was a disappointment.However, the cafeteria on the top floor was amazing - you basically go along and pick up the things you want, then pay at the end. Tons of fresh juices and meals, staff standing behind the counter to make the food how you like it; I loved it! The seating was great, too. It was a nice place to sit and write some postcards.Other than that, however, there wasn't much else to do - and you had to pay to use the bathroom, which was a bit ridiculous!"

Most folks come to Amsterdam for the quaintness of it -- the canals, the domestic architecture, the weed, the fabulous museums -- but when all that wears you out, have a look at the most contemporary of places: the stunning Openbare Bibliotheek. It sits just east of Centraal Station, across a footbridge from NEMO. It's yet another testament to this city's dedication to its people first and foremost. Coming from San Francisco, where, sadly, the new (ish) main library is a travesty of lost opportunities and even more lost patrons, many of whom are homeless and encamped within it, I fully expected a similar situation in city that also has a fair share of social challenges. However, I found one of the most exciting public spaces full of engaged readers on every floor. At the top is a well-attended cafe with the most remarkable panoramas of Amsterdam imaginable. The view from here is reason enough to stop by. Inspiring!"

On my last day in Amsterdam, I received a text suggesting that I might enjoy a visit to the Amsterdam Central Library, if I could fit it in. Understatement! The Library is open from 10 AM \u2013 10 PM daily (yes, Sundays, too!), so it can easily be added to your itinerary at the end of the day when many other tourist destinations are closed. You can see the library from the canal boat tours \u2013 but on mine, they didn\u2019t even mention it. The library is an easy (5-minute) walk from the Central Train Station. Arriving after 8 PM, I first chose to check out the 7th floor cafeteria and enjoyed dinner on the outdoor terrace. Good food and a great view!Then, with less than 1.5 hours until closing, I slowly and methodically made my way down the escalators, circumnavigating each floor, delighting in the wonderful spaces, unique furnishings and offerings of a library the likes of which you\u2019ve probably never seen\u2026unless you\u2019ve been here before. There is a whole floor devoted to music and the arts that includes a radio station, and has an extensive and diverse sheet music collection. Unfortunately, my smartphone battery was running low and it was a toss-up whether to recharge so I could take more pictures or make a b-line for the phenomenal children\u2019s room on the ground floor before closing. One thing\u2019s for sure, next time I\u2019m in Amsterdam \u2013 the Central Library will be at the top of my list!"

I heard that the new(ish) library in Amsterdam had an excellent terrace on the 7th floor with spectacular views over the city. It's true, and the terrace is part of the wonderful cafeteria that abounds with fresh food and drinks.The functional library is beautifully laid out, with loads of space and an extensive resource of books, manuscripts (including a huge area of sheet music), CDs and DVDs. I particularly liked the display cases at the ends of most shelf rows, given over to themes of books or other ideas - inspirational. The museum also has art exhibition space.Students were making good use of the library for their studies.The library is less than a 10 minute walk from the Central Station."

We chose a chicken stir fry, and you choose your vegs, then hand to a chef who adds your choice of chicken, or seafood, and then a sauce and noodles or rice. A medium plate cost us 8.75 euros and it was a substantial meal - and so fresh. Staff were really friendly and helpful. It is well known by students and staff of the university, but not I suspect well known by tourists or visitors to Amsterdam. Certainly worth a visit, and it has amazing views of the city from large picture windows. A hidden gem."

The selection is positively bountiful and presented in a fabulously colourful manner. There are fresh fruit juices and smoothies; a salad bar with a selection going beyond the usual fare to include sun dried tomatoes, cooked cold aubergines and courgettes, & nuts (all delicious); they also have home made soup; a grill with meat cooked to order; pizzas cooked to order; delicious sandwiches made with excellent brown seeded rolls. All very reasonably priced - my salad plus large cream cheese roll plus banana and orange smoothie was around \u20ac10. This place is well worth making a detour for."

The \"stage\" can be used by more skilled piano players for maximum half hour per day and a soft touch is encouraged. We looked around and took a few pictures. It has got a lot of books of course.

Free education, come on in. This is a beautiful and inspiring place that everyone, especially families with young children can enjoy. The downstairs floor is home to a great many whimsical features including the jacks lighting above, a tee pee, a large glass enclosed critter home, big stuffed chairs, some small tunnels to crawl through and lots of space for curling up and reading a book. Not much in English here so don't think you can go and read books to your kids unless you read Dutch.My five year old met a little Dutch girl here and they were instant friends of different languages. They couldn't speak the same words, but they did manage to get by on their different languages, making up for it with extra enthusiasm and body language. They ran around, crawled through the tee pee and tunnel and had a great time. This is one of the few places you can take your children in Amsterdam and not worry about them getting hurt. While walking the city streets, we were constantly holding them by the hand and telling them to watch out for bikes, trains, taxis, walkers. It's a busy city that requires a great deal of hovering over your young children. But in the library, you can relax, let them move around and play without being right on top of them. And afterwards there is a delicious cafe on the top floor. There were just a few gluten free options up there - but not in the form of bread. Mostly salads and soups. Otherwise, a wide variety of foods to choose from - all of it looked delicious."

I ended up spending an entire morning perusing the stacks. The building is an example of what happens when good design, beautiful architecture and functionality merge. A gem of a building that invites inquiry and exploration. Not only a must-see for design and architecture buffs but a must see for anyone with a brain. This is a library that is truly a gift to the people of Amsterdam."

There's modern furniture and places to just settle in for the day of research and views of the river from the top floors. Very modern and I'd recommend getting the Leenpas for people who live in Amsterdam and it allows internet access and renting books, videos and English language movies and music too. There\u2019s a paid toilet on the first floor and also on the top floor where the restaurant \u201cla Place\u201d is located.

When you reach the top floor, spent from the dizzying amount of information and entertainment on offer, you find a stunning altar upon which you can celebrate the city forward enough to provide a home to this magnificence. The terrace overlooking Amsterdam provides such far-reaching views that, on a crisp, sunny day, you feel you must be looking at a mural. The pictures can't do it justice. Out of a fantastic trip to Amsterdam, this was, hands-down, my favourite location.

The Queen of nowadays the King attends this concert. But also without the concert this is a beautiful canal with lots of houses and buildings from the 17th century (The Dutch Golden Age). Stroll along the canal or make a boattrip through the canals of the city."

It was a hot and humid 30 degrees the day we went, it was just lovely to walk inside this massive building after being outside in the hot sun all day and a bonus was that we were greated by two friendly staff members. After reading reviews of the spectacular view and the cafeteria on the top floor this place was on our list of things to see. Definitely lived up to the positive reviews, we enjoyed relaxing outside, sipping coffee and taking in the views. Entry is free which is an added plus. Highly recommend."

The library is often recommended for its fabulous views of Amsterdam and it is true that the view from each floor is spectacular, especially from the top. But the building itself is a gorgeous example of contemporary minimalist architecture and the interiors are striking. You can take an escalator, stopping at each floor to walk around and peer out the windows. The top floor holds a cafeteria but that name hardly does justice to the establishment. You will find there a brilliantly colorful spread of fresh produce, salads, soups, sandwiches, stir-fries made to order, pastries, and many other delicious options. We greatly enjoyed the reasonably priced lunch we had there."

We had lunch at the cafe, good food but from a chain cafe so again nothing special. And after spending 15 Euros on lunch I then had to pay to use the toilet which I felt was particularly cheeky. There are so many other exciting things to see and do in Amsterdam. Don't go out of your way to see this one."

The tenth floor (top) boasts a panoramic view of Amsterdam, with delightful little cafes serving snacks, meals, fruit, dessert, smoothies, cookies and so much more. Really comfy plush booth style chairs with warm lighting. You can take books up there to read if you want.Open 7 days - 10am til 10pm.I love this place, I spent the whole day there, then went back a second day.Plenty of space to park your bicycle."

It's kind of a station-concept restaurant, with different lines for grill, stir-fry, pizza, etc. There are no directions to explain exactly how it works and the cooking staff were surly and/or busy. I didn't find that there was a lot of selection... pizza, stir-fry, hamburger, soup (sold out when we were there) and it looks like usually a fish dish and a dish of the day (a curry the day I was there). The outdoor seating area is lovely in concept, but I conclude Amsterdam doesn't have much of a skyline, given the flatness and low buildings. The library itself is pretty inspirational in both design and contents. My kids loved the teepee in the kid area, the Mouse House of miniatures (at least 8 feet tall), and the gorgeous curving, nook-like shelves."

The view of the inner harbor and older parts of the city is great, but somewhat limited by narrow opening on the outdoor balcony and by the windows. Only could locate view looking toward city, not the other way toward sea and harbor. The outside of the building has a popular IAMSTERDAM sign for photo ops. The library sits between the central train station and the NEMO or science museum. The library itself is very nice and modern, but use of its internet is limited for nonmembers such as a typical tourist. You can buy a ticket to use it for a limited time. Terminals are available. The receipt from the Cafe says there is free internet, but my phone could join in but not use the wireless so I found it not worth fooling with. The library has restrooms which cost .20 euro cents. Recommend checking it out for the view if you are in the area, especially if you think you might enjoy a coffee, drink or a meal at the library cafe on the top floor."

The top floor of the library features a good viewpoint of the city, just pick one of the many comfy seating areas and enjoy. The library itself is also worthy of your attention, with it's modern architecture and interesting sections. The library was constructed in 2007 and is the largest public library in all of Europe. All in all, for a beautiful free attraction so close to central station, it's a shame to miss. allocate about 30 min. of your schedule to visit the Bibliotheek."

The courgette with salmon soup was delicious as were the various salads of roasted vegetables and a good choice of sandwiches made with wonderful bread. Lots of choices if you want a healthy well priced lunch but go early (just before 12) as it soon gets busy with office workers and seems to be a popular business meeting place. The tables are communal and the views, if you venture onto the open area, are panoramic as it is on 7th floor."

The library is a very special building , with great sofa's, and a piano, that you can play for free, if you feel like it, your own private concert for all the visitors in Amsterdam. How cool is that. On the top floor there is a organic food restaurant with a salad bar, great chicken, and all kind of juices... water for free. Top location, top food, top architecture... you would even forget that you can also rent books...."

The building is designed by Jo Coenen and opened it's door in 2007.If you like architecture I recommend you to visit the Central Library, the structure and design of the building are very nice. Locals go here to study, borrow books, visit an exposition, play on the piano in the central hall (only allowed if you are a skilled piano player), or have lunch at the top floor of the building. The lunchroom on the top floor is catered by La Place, the food is good and the the atmosphere relaxing. In the summer you can have your food on the rooftop terrace while you enjoy a view of Amsterdam."

First of all, the self-service cafeteria on the 7th floor offers not only fresh, tasty and very reasonably priced food, but also an amazing panoramic view of Amsterdam. You can sit on the patio, sipping your coffee, enjoying the food and watching the scenery. They have free Wi-Fi, so while you are relaxing and having your breakfast or lunch, you can also browse the web, connect with friends or check the news. We used the library as our base in Amsterdam - the place to get some rest, unwind and have a bite before heading off to do more sightseeing. There also is a nice restaurant on the bottom floor, which stays open after the library closes - we ate a few dinners there, and the quality leaves nothing to be desired. The way it works is that you get a pager and a tracking card at the entrance, then go around to various cooking stations, order your food, take a seat and wait until your pager buzzes - time to pick up your meal and enjoy it. When finished, you return your pager and the card and pay for whatever you ate. We loved this casual approach to dining. I also like to see the food before ordering, and this self-service approach allows not only to see the food but also to see how it is cooked."

I just stopped here while on vacation to look around, but I know if I lived in Amsterdam, I would be here all the time."

There has been construction East of Amsterdams central station - forever - so getting here looks like something of a challenge even mid 2012. Pass by the rather soulless concert/ music venue, the movenpick hotel and hit the library it's sensational.Entires Floors of DVDs, CDs , magazines, Mac music stations. I found copies of both items I looked for. Then at the top a super friendly La Place cafe - think John Lewis top floor Oxford St. - More choice and better quality. If David Cameron ever wonders why there are higher levels of ENGLISH literacy in The Netherlands he could well start here. Without a parental credit card kids CAN download music , TV, DVDs for free but it's illegal , surely it's better to offer access , teach people to share care and appreciate culture in a great environment.

The first caf\u00e9 is at the entrance of the library and, in good weather, you can bask in the full sun with a view on the water.It's a great building, well designed, packed to the rafters with great material. Of course books :-) but racks and racks of CDs, DVDs and so much more! Free internet access for all, using Apple Macs, offered with various funky seating solutions.All the international daily newspapers are available to read in their huge newspaper & magazine library - why buy it when you can read it in great surroundings whilst sipping a tea or coffee from the adjoining caf\u00e9!There is a piano in the lobby where competent pianists are invited to play for up to 30 minutes - on a good day you can hear some gems.To top it all (literally), there is a brilliant caf\u00e9 / restaurant (a branch of La Place) on the top floor, which does delish food, from snacks to full-on freshly cooked pizzas, stir-frys, etc! Beer, wine, tea, coffee. The ambience of the restaurant is very nice, cozy, gezellig! No matter what the weather, you've got to get out on the terrace of the restaurant to take in the fab views of Amsterdam from up so high! You will look out across the water to the beautiful Old Centre of Amsterdam."

Fabulous building, amazing interior, great view of Amsterdam from the restaurant level outdoor seating area. We used the panorama feature on our new camera and had a great time playing with it from up there ! After about a half hour, we headed inside and selected foods from the large and lovely cafeteria style restaurant line, then sat to enjoy it. Fresh fruit drinks, salads, soup, entrees, desserts, burgers, coffees - just about anything you could want for a nibble or for a meal. We had used the escalators to go up and stopped at each floor for a look around. Descending, however, we just went escalator to escalator and had a great \"ride\" seeing each amazing floor again as we passed. We had no idea Macintosh computers were so popular there. Loved seeing the study pods, the lounging couches, the dvd collections, the 2 or 3 story reading rooms with great view from the top one. Take 20 or 50 cents for the bathroom attendant if you want a paper towel . . ."

The restaurant/cafeteria is on the 7th floor; the food is really good, prices very reasonable, and it's not a tourist trap (when we were there it was mostly locals). We went there around lunchtime to get coffee/snack and liked it so much, we went back for dinner. Stays open to 10 pm; is just past the Central Train Station, very convenient and terrific photo op!"

The Dutch manage to make a very modern building bright and inviting, and the mezzanine floor has a ring of laptops (or laptop stations) overlooking the main floor available for free access by the public. If you don't know Dutch, the person sitting next to you probably has better English (and with an American accent) than you do."

The seating is modern AND comfortable. Books are catalogued well that even when looking at the headings in Dutch I could find what I needed. You can access the online catalogue in English and sort by many different options including language. There's also a piano in the entry way that students from the next door music conservatory come and play. An absolutely lovely place and a great way to spend a rainy afternoon."

The food in the restaurant was ok, good for breakfast and lunch and not too expensive and probably the best view in town!."

The food was amazingly fresh and delicious and there was a great selection on offer - all at really reasonable prices. Hot pizza, fabulous salads and sandwiches, fresh juice and a glowing selection of fruits. It made my day! You can sit on the terrace which faces south and has a beautiful view of the city.

Or to the right as you look at the station facing it.It is fully accessible thanks to a chair lift and lifts, and indeed has many free computers offering internet access. Dont miss the restaurant la place, on the top floor of the library; excellent fresh cooked meals - top quality restaurant food at canteen prices. Also for food, there is a pasta house on the terrace - again good quality an cheap prices."

A concert hall on the top floor. A very spanky silent area that looks more Buddha bar than library.Lighting throughout is of the anti- SAD kind, making it a great place to go on a winters day.And to top it off? A couple of good quality restaurants."
