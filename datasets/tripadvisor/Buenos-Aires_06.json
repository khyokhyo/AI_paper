On a nice day, you'll find people working out, biking, roller blading, walking their dogs, taking yoga classes, drinking mate, and just enjoying the parks. The parks are also conveniently located near quite a few museums (MALBA, Museo de Arte Decorativo, Evita Museum) so you can enjoy some people watching and then easily walk to any of these museums. As the nicer days of spring approach, this is the perfect place to spend a sunny afternoon."

Exercise equipment is available, but you need to get there early....Also a little-known jewel of a museum - the Silvori - within the park featurig local artists and their works..which few tourists get to see Silvori has its own indoor and outdoor coffee shop and tables surrounded by sculptures. Art classes are available for children and adults. No crowds..and a beautiful diversion."

There are many people here taking advantage of the beautiful area, so it can be very busy with cars as well. We didn't get a chance to walk around, but drove through the whole park. I would recommend giving yourself at least 2-3 hours to explore. Beware that there are scantily clad hookers advertising in some areas, so do not go off the beaten path. There are bars and restaurants under the bridges, have fun!!"

There is a beautiful lake with many swans and ducks. There are also paddleboats, however I did not see anyone in them, perhaps because it is now their winter. Many locals come to this park to jog. There is also a beautiful rose garden, however you need to come in the right season to appreciate. There is an interesting art museum in the park (I don't remember the name), where we stopped to view the exhibits and have lunch."

They suggested a few ones as B.A. is quite a big city. So I took the subway and got there shortly after. Palermo is one of the upscale sectors of Buenos Aires so you can expect parks to be well arranged and most of the seing sites to be beautiful. Of course if you decide to stop and have a coffee in one of their beautiful restaurants you have to expect a higher price as the sector is a little expensive. But of course everything is relative! I walked for a few hours in Bosques de Palermo and the surrounding sites taking nice pictures and relaxing in it's beautiful nature. There are many monuments and pounds all around with nice trees and birds . . . everything you want to see. It was so nice ! It's quite a big place I can tell you that ! WSo don't miss it and go for a walk you'll love it."

It sprawls for acres and acres - and since we were there in Argentine summer, we enjoyed full blooms on every tree, plant and flower. The lake is quite lovely and there are flocks of long-necked white geese that sail around - in between the small paddle boats that are available for rent. There's a neat white iron bridge that connects both ends of the park and we walked over it and saw a small food stall that sold ice cream and soft drinks. A new addition, near the wonderful carousel, is a series of about 12 restaurants - Mooi is one, Lucca is another - that are housed underneath the red brick railway bridge. Mooi was very cute and had a Santa Fe style flair and what looked like good food. We had our standard cafe con crema outside under their blue umbrellas."

A mile long track is used by everyone that can move . . . whether walking a dog, in a wheelchair, on a bike, rollerblading, walking or jogging. The pretty lake which the track surrounds is big enough to take out a paddleboat, canoe, etc which can be rented at a reasonable rate. The highlight is arguably Rosedal, the Rose garden full of flowers and statues. Just as in Central Park in New York City, people can be found using the green space to picnic, sunbathe or play with a ball/frisbee, etc. It's a lovely urban oasis in the heart of Palermo."

Since 1875 the residents and visitors of Buenos Aires city have been enjoying the Bosques de Palermo (Palermo Woods) for leisurely time and outdoor activities in the heart of this mega city. The parkland incorporates the Botanical Gardens, the Zoo, the Japanese Gardens, the Rosedal (Rose Garden), the Planetarium, and much more open green spaces. Sundays are a particularly special day when the circular road around the Rosedal is closed to vehicular traffic and cyclists, joggers, bladers, pedestrians, enjoy the scenery without having to avoid traffic. Throughout the park vendors set up their booths to sell snacks and beverages plus, of course, ice cream. The Rosedal always has flowers in bloom year round and the Japenese Gardens provide a unique Feng Shui experience in the heart of the city. An Edwardian-style mansion on the grounds became the Eduardo S\u00edvori Museum in 1996 and includes a charming caf\u00e9 with sculpture garden. Boat rides are available on the three artificial lakes within the park. Close to the lake is the Poets' Garden, with stone and bronze busts of renowned poets, including Jorge Luis Borges, Luigi Pirandello and William Shakespeare. This green oasis in the heart of the city is one of the main attractions to escape the bustle of the city and relax and enjoy nature. Note there is a very small nominal admission charge for the Japanese Gardens for help with maintenance."

            "review": "Jogging in Buenos Aires 1. Bosques de Palermo. If you enjoy early morning jogging in a warm climate and among interesting scenery and places, then you will enjoy jogging in Buenos Aires. In this series of notes, I will recommend to you a number of jogging routes. I propose to describe the route pointing out some highlights along the way. Depending on where exactly you are and how far you want to jog, you will be able to determine where to join and if you wish to run the whole or only part of the route. You will need your map handy to highlight the route, or the part of the route you wish to cover. In this note I will describe a jogging route in the Recoleta / Palermo area. The route runs along Avenida Del Libertador and what is known as the woods of Palermo \u201cBosques de Palermo\u201d which are really a series of grand parks on the east side of \u201cAvenida Del Libertador\u201d. However, you will find it interesting to run on either side of the road. I usually start at the bottom of \u201cCalle Rodriguez Pe\u00f1a\u201d at Avenida Del Libertador. I run a short distance on the west side of the road with \u201cParque Carlos Thays on the right [east] side. I cross to the east side of the road at \u201cAvenida Pueyrredon\u201d and the \u201d Buenos Aires Design\u201d and run in front of the museum of fine arts \u201cMuseo Nacional De Bellas Artes\u201d. Continuing on the east side, the woods of Palermo will be on your right. As you run, you will see on the left side the \u201cArgentine Automobile Club\u201d followed by the museum of decorative art \u201cMuseo de Arte decorativo\u201d. The woods on your right will, after a while, give way to some elegant apartment buildings and soon you will pass by the museum of popular art \u201cMuseo de arte popular\u201d. All the way you will see on the west side of \u201cAvenida Del Libertador\u201d some of the area\u2019s fine restaurants and caf\u00e9s such as \u201cDandy\u201d, \u201cCroque Madame\u201d [in the museum of decorative art] and \u201cTabac Caf\u00e9e\u201d [currently being renovated]. At \u201cCalle Cavia\u201d, the woods reappear on the right. At Avenida Sarmiento and the magnificent white Statue in the circle of \u201cLos Espa\u00f1oles\u201d, you will see the \u201cBuenos Aires Zoo\u201d on your left. Cross Avenida Sarmiento and continue on Avenida Del Libertador. The \u201cPlaza Intendente Seeber\u201d is on the west side and next to it is the US embassy. Continue along Avenida Del Libertador till Avenida \u201cInfanta Isabel\u201d. Make a right and go around the famous Rosedal gardens [which are within the Palermo woods. The road will loop around and you will pass the entrance to the garden with its famous white wooden bridge. You will also see on your left hand side the \u201cMuseo Eduardo Sivori\u201d. Continuing around the small lakes of the Rosedal, you come back to Avenida Sarmiento. Now, you have two choices; either you retrace your route on Avenida Del Libertador, or you take a slightly longer route, making a left on \u201cAvenida Sarmiento\u201d and a second right on \u201cAvenida Alcorta\u201d. The latter route, along \u201cAvenida Alcorta\u201d gives you an opportunity to run through this prestigious and elegant part of Palermo. You will see magnificent apartment buildings and houses. From \u201cAvenida Sarmiento\u201d to \u201cAvenida Casares\u201d, the woods will be on your right. A few more blocks you will see on your left the famous \u201cMALBA museum\u201d \u201cMuseo de Arte Latinoamericano\u201d. Continue on Avenida Alcorta all the way back until you pass by the famous \u201cFloralis Gen\u00e9rica\u201d in the \u201cPlaza de Las Naciones Unidas\u201d, the park of the United Nations. Next you will see the Faculty of Law on the left and you will be at the back of the \u201cMuseo Nacional de Bellas Artes\u201d. You can cross through the park to Avenida Del Libertador, completing the route. You can also continue on Alcorta till \u201cAvenida Callo\u201d, where both \u201cAvenidas Libertador and Alcorta\u201d merge into Avenida Del Libertador.The full loop is just under 6 miles [10 Km], but you can choose the distance you want by crossing anytime from Libertador to Alcorta [or the reverse] on any of the many side streets and go back, or of course retrace your route on Libertador. I must say, however, that the Rosedal area is quite nice to run through. I would recommend starting the run around 7am. This will allow you to avoid any major traffic and it will not be quite hot at that time \u2013 you still will have a good sweat by the time you finish.In the next note, I will describe a jogging route in Puerto Madero. Enjoy your run."

There are so many Argentinians seizing the day: doing picniks, little shows, or just resting in the lawn. The park itself is beautiful and with plenty of things to do. Don't miss it, with or without kids."

            "review": "Come celebrate the 100 year anniversary of \u201cEl Rosedal de Palermo\u201d in Buenos Aires.. Yesterday, January 6, 2015, was a good day to visit the \u201cRosdal de Palermo or Paseo del Rosedal\u201d. It was warm and a bit overcast which gave the garden a delightful feeling. I usually walk from Recoleta along \u201cAvenida Del Libertador\u201d on the tree shaded west side of the Avenida, enjoying the beautiful apartment buildings and watching the diligent porters polishing the brass handles of the buildings\u2019 doors. Just before you get to Avenida \u201cCoronel Dias\u201d, you will notice what used to be Caff\u00e9 Tabak [yes with a double \u201cf\u201d] all boarded. Like many who have enjoyed the excellent food and service at Tabak, I am hopeful it will soon reopen after renovations. Shortly afterwards, you will arrive at the huge monument of \u201cLos Espanoles\u201d [picture 1] in the middle of the crossing of Avenida Del Libertador and of Avenida Sarmiento and to the north east you will be able to see, the \u201cParque tres de Febrero\u201d that the \u201cRosedal de Palermo\u201d is part of. The \u201cParque tres de Febrero, or Bosques de Palermo\u201d is just under one thousand acres and is located in Palermo between \u201cAvenida Del Libertador and Avenida Alcorta\u201d. It was proposed by congressman Vicente Lopez and by President Sarmiento and named after the date of defeat of Juan Manuel de Rosas, the previous governor of Buenos Aires 3 Febrero. The Idea of a rose garden within the park of 3 Febrero was that of Joaquin Anchorena and the park was designed by Benito Carrasco and Carols Thays and inaugurated in November 1914. 100 years later, the Rosedal garden continues to be one of the most important in Buenos Aires with its 3.4 hectares that contain ~ 8,000 roses from ~ 90 different species, numerous sculptures, a Greek bridge at the garden entrance, five fountains and an Andalusian garden [added in 1920] and patio [added in 1929]. In 1994, the Argentinean state oil company [YPF] and the government program to promote the green spaces of Buenos Aires, made it possible to renovate the whole park. In 2008, ~ 5000 new rose plants were donated by YPF. In 2012 and 2014, the gardens received the distinguished international \u201cGarden Excellence Award\u201d offered by the world federation of rose societies. I usually walk around the pond \u201cLago Del Rosedal\u201d anti clock wise to arrive at the main gate [east side] with a Greek bridge [the White Bridge]. I walk over the \u201cWhite Bridge\u201d crossing the surrounding lake [El Lago del Rosedal] into the garden and take the left path through the lake Pergola which is of a similar design to the bridge [pictures 2], watching the small leisure boats pass by. A large bush of Jasmine flowers fills the air with the smell of Jasmine. As I step down towards the centre of the gardens, I begin to smell the strong and almost intoxicating aroma of the roses. The roses bloom early in the spring [South American spring that is], late September early October when you can see the gardens in all their glory. Even in the early summer, the gardens are still gorgeous [pictures 3,4]. As I continue to walk towards the centre, I see the garden of poets on my left, and I turn to admire the sculptures [busts] of such famous Poets as Jorge Luis Borges [picture 5, note the bird standing on Borges\u2019 head], Dante Alighieri, Federico Garcia Lorca, Antonio Machado and Alfonsina Storni. I continue to walk west towards the Andalusian garden and Patio, a gift to Buenos Aires from Seville, Spain in 1929. The square patio has a fountain in the middle and the grounds, stairs and sides of the patio are decorated with colourful Spanish tiles [picture 6,7]. I spend some time in the shade of the trees surrounding the patio, humming parts of \u201cManuel de Falla\u2019s\u201d \u201cConcierto de la Aranjues\u201d and almost lose track of time. On the way out I have to walk back to the main entrance on the east side of the gardens; the west exit to the gardens is only open on weekends, so allow time to walk back to the main entrance and around the lake, if you go during week days.I hope you will go and enjoy these beautiful gardens, participating in the celebration of the magnificent effort of so many individuals, private organizations and different government departments who over the past 100 years made it possible for the people of Buenos Aires to enjoy these gardens."

However, if you want to do this for a more affordable and reasonable price, you can do it while visiting the city of La Plata, on its forest.The Bosques de Palermo are at walking distance from the Jardin Japones, the Zoo, the Botanical Garden and the Rosedal (Roses garden). They are all around Plaza Italia.You can use a whole day to visit them all, but make sure you avoid Plaza Italia"

This for us was the best park with so much to see and do. Walk around and watch (or join in) the sporting activities. We were fortunate to be staying nearby so could really appreciate the beauty of this place. Visit during the day but do not go there at night."

The park was designed for Thays, a very famous Urban designer. Excelent for kids and people that like to do sport ( Rollers, Bicking, Using Botes, Running )The local ZOO is close to Palermo Park. ( I recommend it )"
