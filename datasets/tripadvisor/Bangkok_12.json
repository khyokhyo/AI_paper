Now they have housed it in a special building and one can buy the ticket for just to see the Golden Buddha alone (50 bahts ? ) or for the museum as well. The Golden Buddha is on the 4th floor but there is a lift installed for the infirm and elderly. This is a pure solid gold statue not plated weighing 5.5 tons.On the ground level is a prayer hall with a big gold Buddha statue where local folks go in to get the blessings from the monks and give offerings. There are some good shops selling Buddha souvenirs. Please do not mistake the prayer hall Buddha for the golden Buddha which is housed in a separate building in the same place.One as usual needs to be dressed appropriately and leave their slippers outside to enter the temple."

Been to Bangkok a few times and have seen this marvelous Buddha before but it used to be housed in a rather derelict looking temple now it's centre stage in a beautiful marble temple. Impressive looking and interesting history. Be warned, if it's hot and the sun is shining all that marble gets super hot hot hot. As with all temples you remove your shoes. There are racks to put your shoes on then you need to scarper over hot marble and a flight of super hot steps to enter the temple. They laid out rubber matting which was Black. Who knew rubber matting had such scorching effects. Either way probably a good idea to take socks just in case :)"

But if you don't have time you can directly take the boat/taxi there.Dress Code: As usual. They will provide clothes so not to worryCrowd: Less crowd than othersTip: - The attendant inside the temple is very much happy to click your pictures, and she is very good. So hand over your camera to her if she is available.- No selfie stick can be used inside temple so be respectful of the rule"

That being said, I really enjoyed the exhibitions on the lower levels. One level contains a museum of nearby Chinatown and was truly excellent with lots of interesting and professional exhibits and information. The other level contains some information on the statue itself, though part of that was under repairs when we were there so it wasn't that spectacular, though still rather interesting. Spend the (not very much) extra money and get the combined ticket, the exhibitions are worth it."

At some point, the statue was disguised from invading armies to prevent it from being stolen. It was covered with a thick layer of stucco, which was painted and inlaid with bits of colored glass. The statue remained this way for over 600 years and was discovered in the year 1955 by accident, when it was accidentally dropped as it was being moved, revealing, under a casing of plaster, a beautiful solid gold Buddha.

But you won't be allowed to use it in case there is a ceremony as it is located in the ceremonial room. But the stairs are not too high to reach. Most of people made it.

Loved the museum about the statue, and the story of how it was discovered under the plaster. Unfortunately I didn't leave my shoes outside with everyone else. I removed them from my feet, but carried them inside, and got yelled at and told to leave, which spoilt the visit a little, but I was there long enough to feel the special energy in the room. I didn't see any signs saying to remove my shoes, and other places provided a bag for the shoes, perhaps they need to be more specific with their signage? The place is pretty crowded and there is lots of steep stairs, but well worth the visit. It is only a short walk from the Hua Lamphong train station."

When I first went, this incredible statue was in a concrete squat room, but a few years back they built a proper beautiful temple to house the Golden Buddha. It's my favorite because many others are amazing (Wat Po/Grand Palace, Wat Arun, etc.) but expansive and busy. I'll never forget seeing the Crown Jewels in London. You file through this long line through rooms where screens are playing documentaries and videos of the jewels close up, spinning around, from all angles. After 30 minutes of this, you finally get to see the jewels and it's a letdown after all the buildup and seeing the photos and videos nonstop. This one gets right to the point. 2 flights of stairs in a relatively small temple puts you face to face with the goods: A giant buddha statue made entirely of gold. It's simple but elegant and mindblowing to realize you are standing in front of possibly the single most valuable item you will see in your life. I try and swing by every time I'm in Bangkok, just for a quick glance and to be blown away again!"

It's a working temple and it causes offence to dress inappropriately, so give it some thought."

From the first floor to the third, apon arriving to the top you will see a very big golden budda- the shiniest one you will probably see.I would personally recommend on going here asap as several tourist will pack the attraction by mid day and also the peak temperature will make it alittle bit hard to walk up the steps. More work and less enjoyment.Be warned for both male and female, suitable clothing must be worn or you can't go inside."

Lots of local architecture which was very pleasant to the eyes. Ticket price was 100 baht per person. Its a tall temple and single building. It doesn't have a compound or a garden where you can take a stroll.Photography in the temple was also allowed unlike The Temple of Emerald Buddha. FYI we covered four temples in one day with ease:1) Wat Pho (The Temple of Reclining Buddha)2) Wat Traimitr (The temple of Golden Budhha)3) The Grand Palace & The Temple of the Emerald Buddha (Wat Pra Kaew)4) Wat Benchamabopith (The Marble Temple) - The The marble temple was the smallest and least picturesque though the Budhha Idol inside was equally mesmerizing. It can be skipped if you are time constraint.We paid 1500 Baht to the taxi driver who stayed with us for the whole day. You need not hire any tour guide to visit the temples, just a reliable taxi driver will do ( we were 4 adults and 2 children, so hired a Toyota Innova). We were free by 1600 hrs.This temple is definitely worth the visit. You should not miss."

It worked, for many years it sat untouched.In the beginning of the 18th century when Bangkok was established as a new capital, the Buddah was brought there. During the middle of the 18th century they decided to move it to a new place, and while they were transferring the statue one of the chains broke and the Buddah fell to the ground and was cracked.While inspecting the damage the people noticed a gold color under the plaster and with great care they discovered the figure was indeed made out of gold!In 2010 the Golden Buddah was brought to its new home, The Wat Traimit Temple where it now reside.It's good to know the history of the Temple's you visit. It makes it a more interesting visit."

When I first saw this back in 1999 from what I can remember there was this gold Buddha in a white room, can\u2019t even remember it being in a temple or much of a temple back then. The Buddha was just sitting there in this dirty white room and I knew the story about it and I knew it was a huge 5.5 ton gold statue made entirely of gold, made in the 13th or 14th century and covered in plaster until 1954 when someone chipped the plaster and saw a glint of gold. I remember thinking what an incredible find that was and that I was probably looking at the largest pure gold Buddha in the world and I think there was like one unarmed guard in the room. I guess they figured no one could possibly steal it. Well on 14 February 2010, a large new building was inaugurated at the Wat Traimit Temple to house the Gold Buddha. Now the temple fits the significance of the find. They have a very nice exhibition on a couple of the lower floors about Chinese immigration to Thailand and the Gold Buddha is on the 4th or top floor. According to Wikipedia there\u2019s suppose to be an exhibition on the origin of the Gold Buddha but I did not see it. It\u2019s really important to have this information in an exhibit since it\u2019s so interesting. The only info I saw was on my brochure. Anyway the temple is now fitting the Buddha and it\u2019s amazing. I think if in Bangkok you should make every attempt to see this and the Chinese immigration exhibition is really quite good also. No guide books were available in English. I am going to give this five stars and I\u2019m going to assume I missed the exhibition on the origin of the Gold Buddha."

The top shrine houses one of the largest solid gold Buddha images and is culturally and historically interesting. The Buddha image dates to the Sukhothai era of Thailand and was preserved from Burmese invasion and looting as it was plastered in stucco to hide its value from the invaders. The image only was discovered to be made of gold after the stucco broke off during an accident transporting the image some 50 years ago. Since then it sits within this temple. Admission is 40 baht. There is also a museum that covers the heritage of the Chinatown area and the Golden Buddha on a lower floor for an additional 100 baht. If you are in the area and not fatigued by the Buddha images seen in every Thai temple it may be worth a visit to see the Golden Buddha."

The temple structure of Wat Traimit is certainly impressive, a stepped pyramid rather like those ancient temples of Central America. There are museum displays inside the pyramid (extra admission charge) while the hall holding the Golden Buddha is on the top. Get ready for lots of stairs in the Bangkok heat unless you can find the lift tucked away at the back. From the top you get a good view of\u2026 Bangkok rooftops.We\u2019re told the Buddha image is five tons of solid gold and who am I to disbelieve them, but after you\u2019ve seen enough gilded statues this doesn\u2019t actually look any different. There\u2019s nothing special about the hall except that it\u2019s quite small for a major temple and can be very crowded. The statue itself didn\u2019t look anything special. In fact it was worse \u2013 the effects of harsh light coming in the doors can highlight features in a rather strange way that is exaggerated in photos. Some of mine came out as not just unattractive but with a Terminator look about them! (Out of respect I'm not posting any of those.)The temple is beside the entrance of Bangkok\u2019s Chinatown and if you plan for your visit to include that area (and perhaps its Little India extension) then you might like to visit it. But I wouldn\u2019t make the trip just for the temple. If you\u2019re looking for somewhere to go having seen the \u201cbig three\u201d temples by the river (Wats Phra Keaw, Pho, and Arun) I\u2019d suggest Wat Benchamabophit, the \u201cMarble Temple\u201d.

It was made about 500 or 600 years ago, and about 250 years ago was covered in plaster to camouflage it and prevent it from being stolen during an invasion by the Burmese who subsequently invaded and destroyed the complex where it was. The statue languised in the ruins for years and aparently its golden origins were forgotten. It mover to several places before ending up in Bangkok bout 200 years ago. It weighs 5.5 tons so I found it hard to believe that anyone would have thought a plaster statue would be that heavy. After WW 2 it was being moved to a new temple and it fell on the ground and some of the plaster was knocked off and lo and behold, the gold Buddha emerged. It is beautifully cast and appears to have very little wear and tear for all of its trials and tribulations over the years. Worth seeing."

For the wheel chair bound there is an elevator, left as you enter the main gate. Do inquire for the same.Level 1 houses the Chinese heritage museum. An excellent museum showing the entry of the Chinese in bangkok. The Giant Buddha on the 3rd level is magnificent. Kids will get bored. Non interested individuals should go just for their selfies to the third floor and the pics from a height.For the wheel chair bound there are steps involved.Would recommend a guide to make the visit purposeful.A must see for the history enthusiasts."

However, take lots of water where-ever you go as well as sun-hats, sun-umbrellas, sun-screen, fans, and cooling towels if you can get them.

This temple might be small as compared to many other temples in Bangkok but for the sake of the golden Buddha, it's really worth visiting. Apparently it goes all the way back 700 over years ago during the Sukhothai dynasty. And because of war, the locals used mud to camouflage the golden Buddha. For hundred of years, the 'mud-made' Buddha was left abandoned in an old temple. It's only in the 1950's then it was discovered that it was made of pure SOLID gold! Yes! I mean pure solid gold that's weight about 5.5 tons. From what I heard, the local were trying to move the Buddha statue and accidentally hit it on something. As a result part of it was chipped and it revealed the true golden Buddha. It's considered as Thailand national treasure and you can never find another pure solid golden Buddha that's weight 5.5 tons! This sacred place is really worth a visit and perhaps you may also ask for blessings regardless of your belief. "

Also architecturally and historically interesting is the imposing temple that was constructed for the golden Buddha, after being housed under a shed for a number of years in his presumed plaster days.

It is believed that the Golden Buddha is more than 700 years old. I was amazed at the holistic feel of the shrine and the ambience of the temple sanctum with golden Bhudda seated in the sanctum. The inner wall are well designed and artistically crafted The Golden Buddha was installed initially in Wat Phrayakrai in the Yannawa area of Bangkok in the reign of the KingRama III. It stayed there until 1931. When the temple had fallen out of use and was abandoned, The temple is open daily from 08.00 am. 05.00 pm. Admission is free Chinese Heritage Centre is also located and can be visited."

One of the must visit spots in Bangkok.Entry fees of 40 baht is applicable if we visit the temple only.We need to remove our footwear and also wear appropriate clothing( no shorts and sleeveless clothes allowed).Though if you do end up wearing shorts or sleeveless they offer you a coat or skirt to cover up. That's free of cost.The beautiful statue of Gautam Buddha radiates so much peace and warmth, calms us.Though the visit doesn't take more than 30 minutes do not skip it."

I just to Bangkok March 12-20, 2016.This temple is right in Bangkok and the juxtaposition is outstanding! Here you are in this busy city, and above buildings and small houses stands this gorgeous temple! The walk up is quite a ways but once you're up there you're just standing in front of an amazing temple. And that's before you're inside! The Buddha itself weighs 5.5 TONS! It is truly amazing to view! It is a beautiful statue of a sitting Buddha, all in gold. There truly are no words to describe it. The temple itself is amazing too the way it stands out over the city. Tip for ALL Thai Temples (some may be different but generally all are the same). I did my research before, knowing how religious Thai people are. Clothing: I cannot emphasize how important clothing is for all temples. You WILL be turned away for inappropriate clothing. They have a strict code for both men and women but I think it is best for everyone to stay covered. -No shoulders showing (absolutely no tank tops for men or women)-Nothing above the knee (I wore athletic pants and a t-shirt for all my tours and had no problems. Some websites prohibit athletic wear but I just went 2 weeks ago and found that that material doesn't matter at all because they are only looking for coverage. I think for women maxis are the best way to go, making sure your shoulders are covered! Shoes or sandals are fine to wear. They will tell you when you must take off your footwear)Do not touch anything. Everything in the temples is obviously old and historic and hand done. Also, do not try and mimic what the locals are doing. To you, this is an attraction, but to them, it could be their main place of worship. Be mindful of that and don't follow what they do since they will take offense to someone who isn't Buddhist or Hindu following their actions.They will tell you when photos are acceptable. This temple didn't prohibit photos anywhere, but there will be signs posted. They aren't kidding around. We witnessed a security guard taking someone's phone and deleting photos.I also read that it is considered disrespectful to turn your back to any statue of Buddha. Thai people will definitely appreciate if you follow rule.At the end of the day, these temples are sightseeing attractions to us. Look around and appreciate the detail. There is so much to see. If you are on a tour, your guide will take you to everything you need to see so don't worry. If you are not on a tour, go at your own pace, but remember that if you rush through everything assuming it's the same, you will definitely miss some stuff."

There are enough steps to negotiate with most people following the direction of flow. As others have asserted the floors that are exposed to the elements can get hot depending on the weather as visitors are required to remove their footwear. There are additional steps to get into the temple itself and a representative is present to stop people from using video cameras. Inside certainly the focus is the buddha itself but it is hard to not notice the dozens of donation boxes, most made of plexiglas, located in nearly every nook and cranny. Please also take in the view from this level of the temple. And if you do want to take video of the Golden Buddha with a video camera make sure the rep's attention is elsewhere while you stand at the a bit away from the foot of the stairs that lead to the front entrance of the temple.

After you see the golden Buddha on the fourth floor, make sure you see the two small but excellent exhibitions on the 2nd and 3rd floors. Admission is 100 Baht per person in addition to the fee for the Buddha - but if you get the Muse Pass these exhibits are included! This isn't mentioned where you buy the tickets, but there are signs in the exhibit entrances. The 3rd floor describes in great detail how the golden Buddha was made, how it was covered with lacquer and plaster, and how it was discovered inside the plaster in the 1950s. This is accompanied by excellent English-language descriptions and artifacts such as pieces of the plaster that was removed. The 2nd floor takes you through the history of Chinese people in Bangkok. It turns out that the Chinese traders had made a settlement in the area before the Thai king moved the capital to the area, and he asked them to move further east so he could build the Grand Palace where they were living! Again this exhibit is accompanied by excellent English-language descriptions and life-sized displays of people carrying out trade and other tasks. A great introduction to Chinatown and the history of Chinese connection with Thailand."

ALTHOUGH I have been to Bangkok many times before I have somehow never been to the Temple of the Golden Buddha, so I decided to remedy that during my latest trip to Thailand.I immediately wished I'd allowed more time for my visit because, despite getting up at 7am and being ready to hit the road before 8.30am, I met twin problems that I hadn't thought of.The first was actually being able to attract the attention of a taxi or tuk tuk driver willing to take me there from lower Sukhumvit. I couldn't believe it! Normally you are waving them away by the dozen, but the rush hour from 8.30am-9.30am meant they all seemed to be taken, so I did a bit of local sightseeing, went for a coffee and then tried again towards 9.30am.I succeeded in getting a tuk tuk but even that took a while and my driver then explained to me about problem number two, namely that the temple opened at 9.30am and would already be pretty full by the time I could there.What with my driver hacking his way across the city, it was pushing 9.50am by the time I was dropped off near the temple. What I should have done then was pay him to wait for an hour or so. That's the advice I would give to anyone visiting this sight because it is not on a busy thoroughfare and when I'd finished there and wanted to move on I couldn't find a sniff of a tuk tuk or taxi even by waiting at the drop off area to try and pick one up. Very strange indeed.Anyhow, once inside I found a ticket booth and bought entry to all parts which cost 140 baht or just under \u00a33.You will find simple but clean toilets in the lower area together with various stalls, stands and exhibitions. The latter are devoted to what is hailed as \"the largest Golden Buddha image in the world\".I could wait no longer and began to ascend steps to the viewing area in which this gleaming attraction was displayed.You must take your shoes off to go inside....and there it stood nearly 16ft high and weighing 5.5 tons, all solid gold.Even the tale about saving this valuable object is impressive since it was covered in plaster to conceal it from an invading enemy.It was not until 1955 that its true nature and value emerged. A new building had been constructed to enshrine the \"plaster\" statue but, while preparations were being made to move it, the covering plaster was partially broken, gold gleamed through and it was only then that people realised what was inside. The rest is history.My advice is to take your pictures to one side of the Golden Buddha or the other since worshippers and surrounds help to give perspective to the sheer impressive size of the figure.Away from the statue, there are a number of exhibitions -- both below and above that floor.One of the main themes is trade and there are some very clever displays depicting everything from the inside of a cargo vessel, the docks and workers unloading goods to the bygone version of shopping in Tesco!The whole site was so interesting that it was very easy to lose track of time and it was only my rumbling stomach that tipped me off it was nearly lunchtime.This wonderful attraction is well worth spending a whole morning seeing its various aspects and I would recommend a visit to anyone."

The main attraction however, is the statue of sitting Buddha made of pure gold. And it shines! Not just because of all that gold, it is also quite serene and beautiful. Well worth a visit. The ticket costs 40Bahts without the museum; there are toilets at the entrance and some vendors. We came by taxi-a convenient and inexpensive way of travel. Just make sure the meter is on. We combined the visit with a stroll along Bangkok Chinatown down to a Chinese temple (Wat Mangkon Kammalawat), which is working temple and not that easy to find hiding in a side alley.

The building itself is covered in marble and gold trimming, which glistens in the sunshine.Long trousers for men are requested but I saw many men wearing shorts who rented for a small fee shawls to cover themselves up.Ignore the tuck tuck drivers trying to scam you for small fees as you exit the temple and wake your way to Chinatown, which is a short walk away."

This was a very worthwhile payment because the historical data and visual displays were excellent. There was also a section that told of the history of the construction of the golden Buddha and how it was hidden under plaster for so centuries because of invading armies. This is also a sacred site for worshippers of the Buddhist faith and it is interesting to observe the rituals of this faith."

He ended up taking us down a small long alley to a private tour which wanted 2000bat. What a joke. When then had to walk out the long alley and try to find transport to a public ferry. We had no idea where we where so that was annoying. The next tuk-tuk, which was the only transport that would stop took us to another privet ferry dock. What a joke. Luckly my wife and kids stayed in the tuk-tuk so he couldn't take off and we were finally able to get to the public ferry which only cost 40bat."

It's very easy to get templed out in Bangkok, and after visiting the Golden Palace and Wat Pho we accidently stumbled upon this temple as we were leaving China Town. The temple is not nearly as busy as the others and also provides a nice view of the surrounding city. The statue itself is also quite a sight to behold, probably the most gold I will ever see at any one time in my life, beat that Vegas! Be sure to grab a free information pamphlet when you buy your tickets that gives a short explanation of the temple."

The stairs might turn some away who have mobility issues, but if you don't have a problem climbing, do it. The Buddha statue is worth the money for a ticket and the effort of the climb. The entrance cost is low so that isn't a deterrent. Because this site is clearly a must-see for all tourists and especially those of the Buddhist faith, the crowds, for some, will takeaway from being able to quietly appreciate the temple and statue. Take a deep breath and try not to get frustrated. If you are patient, you will get an excellent picture of the temple and/or statue. The views of the city from the perimeter terrace are quite good and fewer people are out there. Take advantage of this."

There's an elevator to facilitate tourists as needed as well. In the same compound, there're two schools, one primary and the other secondary...the latter is where I used to work as a teacher. What the whole temple shows to all is part of the Thai roots for temples in the olden days to play a key role in education, and for students to be very close to Buddhism through a number of religious ceremonies and discussions with monks and novices residing in the temple. In addition, the temple shows the harmony of the Chinese and the Thais with its proximity to Chinatown."

First we had to find the ticket booth, which took a few minutes because of poor signage. Then we quickly climbed to the top level to see the Buddha and main shrine. The building itself is gorgeous, as was the main attraction (the Buddha). There was a crush of tourists (from India, I think) inside who were all taking selfies and group photos with the Buddha. It was hard to get a good look without people blocking our view. We then took a quick stroll around the upper perimeter, which was blissfully people-free by comparison. The view was great. At that point, the temple was beginning to close. A rather grumpy looking attendant started rushing everyone out. I kind of brushed it off, but my friend was absolutely livid at his brisk behavior. Unfortunately, I think it rather ruined the experience for her.That was something that we noticed in Bangkok- the temples and palaces are amazing, but the staff sometimes came across as rude or indifferent. I wasn't sure if that was because of the language gap, cultural differences, or a product of the unrelenting heat."

It stands around 25 feet high and about 15 feet wide. The estimated worth of the Golden Buddha is over 10 billion dollars. But don't even think about touching that Buddha. The Thai's are extremely serious about disrespecting Buddha. They will put you in jail for just touching this Buddha. But If you enjoy seeing one of a kind things that are no where else in this world, make sure you stop by and see the Golden Buddha. Seeing the Golden Buddha is worth the price of a plane ticket to Thailand. People just don't understand that there is much more to Thailand than just the bar girls. If that is what you are only looking for, then you are missing out on culture that you will never see again anywhere in the world. Also go see the Reclining Buddha. That Buddha has to be at least 100 feet long and about 10 feet wide. Its truly amazing the things you see in Thailand."

The driver who shipped us from the airport to our hotel was such a knowledgeable and interesting man, and he made the Golden Buddha at Wat Traimit sound like it was a must-see. Well, I simply don't think it was ... when we eventually saw it. We decided - rather boldly - to walk there from Jim Thompson House, given it is only 2.5km. It was a cloudy, cool day. The walk took us through one of the more appalling neighbourhoods of Bangkok. You can always tell the true soul of a city when you see it this way, and Bangkok revealed itself to be a steaming, fuming, dump of rubbish, tin and scraps.As we drew near to the area of this temple, we noticed some very poor signage pointing us in the wrong direction for the temple itself. We asked a few people and were continuously told it was \"behind that building\". It eventually was, but you would never know it if you were on foot and even to drive there it's fairly well hidden.There was thankfully no crowd on arrival, but in true Bangkok style - something we have experienced everywhere - there was scant direction for tickets, few people on hand to help, and a general malaise and lack of enthusiasm that the whole experience is rendered rather mundane and laborious. It became one of things we \"had\" to do not \"wanted\" to do. The people of Bangkok should be proud of such a display and be singing it from the rooftops, much like other famous places of worship around the world. The Buddha is not as large as I thought it would be, and is - I'm sorry to say - just another shiny gold Buddha. I fully appreciate its history and value, but it took more time for my girlfriend to don a wrap around her knees and for us to remove our shoes than it did to actually see the Buddha from all sides. As we left, we negotiated unsuccessfully with three tuk tuk drivers to take us to the hotel. They were rude, arrogant and insisted on going via a \"sponsor\" for a cheaper fair. I had been warned about this. You'd think in a so-called tourist city they'd have a better approach. Sad, really. We took the next pink taxi that came along and asked politely for the meter, as you do, and paid THB60, forty less than the cheapest of the tuk tuk crooks."

We sat and prayed for a while and looked around inside the temple. We made offerings and once snapped few photos, we left to get blessing from the priest inside the hall. One can donate and get the blessed mini Buddhas from the priest. The priest blessed us by sprinkling holy water and tying the holy string on our wrists.

Nice story about this Buddha . It had beens hidden by monks under a thick layer of plaster to protect this treasure from potential invaders in case of conflict. .The Buddha at Wat Traimit was discovered by accident when accidentally dropped as it was being moved, revealing, under a casing of plaster, a beautiful solid gold Sukhothai style Buddha. . Pieces of the plaster are still Kept on display. The Golden Buddha was taken to the Chotanaram Wat in Bangkok. In the 1930's the picture finally ended up in the Wat Traimit, still covered in plaster. Was erected in 1955 to house viharn the image. When the Golden Buddha was moved to the new building using a crane, a cable broke and the picture fell to the ground and into the mud. The workmen are said to-have run off fearing bad luck.The next day, when a monk returned to the temple he found the picture still in the mud, with plaster coating Reviews some of the broken revealing the gold, thus revealing the true identity and value of the picture.Outside of the Golden Buddha, this temple in Chinatown is very interesting for its religious fervor, the Chinese neighborhood from praying Buddha favors for their business......Came here after walking out of National Stadium (40mn) ...Fantastic statue ..A must"

A massive-golden Buddha, worth US$ 250,000,000.00 just in sheer gold, that survived the times by being plaster-covered would already be worth seeing. But this is an extremely beautiful image of the Buddha - and also a spiritually rewarding one. It is housed in a modern, quite beautiful temple. Here are some logistics hints for your visit, based on what I noticed to be problems in the most recent reviews (if you scroll down't you'll find the same hints many times over I'm sure :-)):1. Take the boat, not the BTS or MRT, as there are no stops close by. Take an orange-flag riverboat and get off at stop #5, Ratchawongse. This costs you 14 or 15 Baht from wherever, i.e. 40 cents. 2. From the pier, walk up the street until you hit the main road (4-lane traffic); then turn right and follow the latter until you see the temple, unmistakable with its golden spire, on left. Most of this street is covered, i.e. you don't need a parasol (but why don't you have one as a Bangkok tourist? :-)) There are several nice shops and street vendors on the way, most with a Chinese theme; also the top TCM pharmacies are here (such as the famous Tongrentan's branch). As you cannot walk very fast on these sidewalks, to get from the pier to the temple may take you about 20 minutes.3. Alternatively, get a tuk-tuk at the pier; the highest tourist rip-off price is 30 Baht, i.e. less than a dollar (if the driver approaches you, 20 or less can easily be done), and three can sit in most tuk-tuks comfily.4. At the Wat, go through the gate, get a ticket for 40 Baht (unless you're Thai) at the ticket booth (or 140 incl. the exhibition if you're interested - I liked them, but I had a lot of time), and then head to the pagoda, and up you go.5. As has been mentioned here, this is quite a climb - if this seems unappealing to you for health or age reasons or whatever, especially if it's hot and sunny, ask the guards for directions to the elevator - there is a nice one and you can save yourself all the hassle. (Same for the way down.)6. HAVE SOCKS - as in all Buddhist temples, you need to take your shoes off on all three levels if you want to enter. During the day, the white marble becomes really hot, and the rubber mats which are meant to insulate a bit seem even hotter to me. :-) The distance between the shoe-leaving area and the inside is too great to be comfy. Thus, socks are de rigueur for this visit.7. The Golden Buddha is, as I said, amazing, impressive, and spiritually powerful - but the shrine itself has become a tourist place, so that some devotion has become very difficult, because of the not-really-reverent masses with selfie sticks and so on. If you are a good Buddhist already, you will not mind, but if you are still imperfect and impatient (as I am), I would advise not even to try here but to go downstairs and head for the hall just to your straight left (say 10 o'clock) once you are all the way down. This sanctuary houses another version of the Golden Buddha (not from gold, but never mind), and this is much more quiet, subdued, and there will be also an officiating monk who will bless you and give you a wristband (small donation expected); if you revere and respect the Buddha, you can do that even if you are not a \"card-carrying\" Buddhist. Just watch the others a bit if you're new to this and then go. On the way back, if you walk a bit rather than taking a tuk-tuk all the way back to Ratchawongse Pier, there are some nice Chinese-style street food carts especially in the side streets directly from the main street, as well as some nice massage places; half an hour of foot massage hereabouts is 100-120 Baht and it is nice to get one after the visit. If you did the Buddhist devotion and want to eat something, stay vegetarian.Enjoy the Wat Traimit, it is a great place!"

In comparison to other famous temples of Bangkok premises of this temple are quite small. The temple sits high on pedestal.There is another small temple right in front of this one where, monk passes on blessings. It also has smaller golden statute.The premises are quite neat and clean. Since this is not simply a tourist site rather temple is actively visited by locals, do keep in mind the restrictions and compliance applicable to religious temples, like appropriate clothing and removal of footwear.

This was our first temple which we have visited with our guide.I have not thought that it would feel so different to a church or mosc.. but in buddhism everything is bright and \"happy\" and all you do is for luck and for getting a wish fulfilled. They bring flowers.. clothes for the monks.. and give it as a sacrifice to the buddha.This buddha was once in stone and as they tried to move it, it fell down and broke open.. inside was the pure gold buddha. Really amazing."

The Golden Buddha is an extraordinary sculpture of the Buddha, in a large size with about 5 tons of solid gold...It was made in the 13th century but subsequently hidden inside another sculpture of Buddha, which hid it from view during a war. Afterwards the ones that knew the secret must have died during the conflict as it remained encased in the plaster figure till the 1950's when it was being moved and accidentally the outer sculpture cracked in a corner, revealing the golden Buddha within.It is beautifully carved and makes a huge impact on seeing it, somehow one realizes right away that it's just not another golden Buddha, but there is something strangely magnificent about this realization, the fact that the metal was used as if it were bronze or any other metal, and that the one who renounced throne and fortune for the salvation of mankind should be remembered in the most valuable of all materials.It is a miracle that this wonder of the world has survived. It is housed in a beautiful temple that is complimentary to it, but does not take away from the Golden Buddha being the center of attention."

The building is quite beautiful as well. for 40 Baht it's worth the trip."

Wat Traimit is located in China Town, and we found that our taxi driver was unsure about it's location (maybe because of the language barrier). We decided to catch a metered taxi to Bangkok train station and walk the rest of the way. Once we were there, we purchased our tickets (40 baht to see the Golden Buddha alone, or 140 baht for the Buddha and the museums). I would recommend taking the time, and spending the extra money to explore the museum. It is very informative, spotlessly clean, and full of pictures and statues. The Golden Buddha itself is wonderful. Almost 3 metres in length, and 4 in height, it is spectacular. It is important for tourists to be aware of people trying to convince you into their taxis or refusing to start the meter when you get in. We got in a taxi and he refused to use the meter, instead insisting that the journey would cost 300 baht. We got out and tried another taxi and the same journey with the meter running was only 87 baht. Like most temples, ladies are required to cover-up when entering. I slung a light shawl over my shoulders and elbows and this was accepted."

Many people walk around and take a general look; but if you take your time and look in the corners, edges, and less noticeable areas; you will see some truly amazing talent and beautiful artwork. Two major suggestions: 1. Women and men are required to have no skin showing on their legs and this requires you to rent a wrap for women, and pajama like pants for men before going in. We paid for our wraps and stood in a very long line both in size and time; in order to enter the temple. While waiting in line to enter, my wife was pulled out of the line and a very terse language we didn't understand, was stopped from going in. As it turns out, her wrap was too small and she had a very small slit going down her leg where the two ends met. Because of that they were refusing her entry. He expected us to go all the way back (about 2 blocks away) to the beginning and get a larger wrap. The terseness and demanding tone of the guard in a foreign language and country was very unnerving. Long story short-with a minor adjustment, we passed inspection. What is truly interesting is that we felt had she put the wrap on with the opening in the back or to the opposite side where the guard was on; she would have passed. Also, we noted that there were others with the same issue, but because they were in the middle of the crowd of people instead of on the edge like my wife; they passed muster. Later while in the temple we were shocked to see a young girl with a very short skirt and no wrap. How she got through is beyond us. 2. We just happened to hit it at a timing when there was a special holiday in the country which brought out gobs of people. Suggestion, while planning any trip would be wise to first check if there are any holidays or celebrations scheduled/planned so you can avoid the mobs. You truly haven't experienced mobs of people until you travel to a country that has a high density rate!"

I'd forgotten my shawl that day and it was just my luck there was none to rent. A group of us were locked outside and I was soaking wet. When they opened the doors they harshly turned me away for not being covered up. I pleaded but had the door slammed shut in my face :( No one could help me! I'd already bought my ticket, made the mission there, and was soaking wet...I wasn't going to leave so easily! I managed to pull up my maxi skirt over my shoulders (don't ask how awkward that looked). I was allowed in and after all that i was disppointed to see its just a small room with a big gold buddha. I'd already seen a lot of impressive buddhas by now and while this one is solid gold, it still wasn't \"wow\".

The Golden Buddha is pretty amazing. It's made of solid gold and weighs almost five tons. It's worth in gold is over fourteen million dollars and it's historical value is worth probably even more.Like all temples in Thailand and elsewhere, shoes must be taken off before you go in. Because there was such a crush of people, I came up with the idea to take off my shoes, but take them with me in my satchel. My idea worked perfectly. After we were finished with this part of the tour, I went outside and promptly put on my shoes, while many of my cohorts were trying to figure out where their shoes were.There are certain areas of Thailand that attracts a lot of tourists, and this is one of them. It was crowded and it was difficult to get good photographs with so many people milling about. Also, the temple was in the middle of a minor reboot so there was scaffolding on one side of the temple, which through off the overall ambiance of the place. Construction will do that.It does not take too long to see the Buddha and the outlying temple areas. A typical person could see everything in two or three hours and that's taking their time."

Then rethink your situation as you realise that you have broken a simple plaster cast that covers a 700 year old, 3metre tall, solid gold Buddha. This is the story of Wat Traimit where an amazing Sukhothai style Buddha was discovered hidden under plaster when the statue was dropped when being moved. Apparently, the gold image was covered with plaster to conceal it from the invading Burmese and it was rediscovered accidentally about 45 years ago. Pieces of the plaster coating have been kept and can still be seen on display. Interestingly the Buddha is made up of 9 component parts and the purity of the gold varies from about 40 to 99%.In 2010, a new building called \u201cPhra Maha Mondop\u201d was officially opened and the Golden Buddha was moved here. On the first floor the Yaowarat Chinatown Heritage Centre tells the history of Chinese immigrants to Thailand and their culture. The Temple is located to the west of Bangkok\u2019s main railway station Hua Lampong Station on the East end of Yaowarat Road. It is open from 09:00 - 17:00 each day and although it is free to visit the Buddha, there is a modest 10 BHT fee to visit the museum.I recommend combining a visit to the Temple with a walk around the neighbouring Chinatown. It is amazing and the food is incredible."

If you visit, explore the temple grounds and you might find more interesting things other than the massive statue? Either way, worth a visit.

Well if you want a real treat, you must visit Wat Traimit for a view of a really impressive gold Buddha. There are lots of steps to negotiate but the hike is well worth it. You have to be mindful of the people praying in front of the Buddha and do not stand in front of them. You can get great photos from either side of the Buddha. The Buddha was originally encased in plaster and in 1955, after dropping the Buddha it was discovered that some parts were made of solid gold and others sections 40% gold. It was a delight to visit the temple. There were plenty of Tutus outside so you can get to your next temple easily. Visiting Wat Traimit is a must see."

It is amazing to see such passion in the people when talking and touring around this and other temples. It also is strange to see such immense wealth trapped in a buddha form, when there is such poverty in the city it is in. I understand the historical and cultural significance of this Buddha, and how important it is to them.It is a must see!"

There was a line behind us so we just let it go. It was the first of many times people attempted to short-change us or tried to avoid giving change back--especially by the taxi drivers-- but at a temple? That ticket seller is going to have some bad karma!!! The temple was quite nice and the buddha was beautiful. It was a little confusing getting around so you may have to ask for directions."

The displays along with video provided a great historical context. It then went into how the Golden Buddha was concealed...then rediscovered as it was being moved. The minimal cost to visit this site is well worth it. And to get pictures of the actual Buddha were amazing. Well worth the time should you happen to be in the local area.

As temples go in South East Asia this ranks as one of the average ones but you have to visit it to the the impressive Golden Buddha. On purchasing my ticket I was offered the choice of 40 baht to see just the Golden Buddha or the 140 baht ticket which included the exhibitions. I plumped for the latter. I thought the exhibition on the 3rd floor explaining the origins of the Buddha image and how the Golden Buddha was made was very small and I did not take long going round as was slightly disappointed. Next floor down was the Chinatown Heritage Exhibition which was a lot larger and for me a lot more interesting with a large model layout of Bangkok in the past. The best part by a long way was the Golden Buddha gleaming in the mid afternoon light with monks in orange robes sat down in prayer in front. That was well worth the 40 baht but I am afraid 100 baht was too expensive for what there was to see in the exhibitions. It is easy to find from Hua Lamphong Station as there is a signed walkway near to the western exit."

There's some sort of a ritual chant that is available for believers to take from the altar and chant to it but unfortunately all in Thai. No footwear inside the temple however and ladies need to wear knee length skirt/trousers else you will need to rent a robe to go in. For guys no headwear allowed inside the temple.

The temple itself is quite small, but the Buddha statue is spectacular. Please be respectful of those praying and just take a seat (feet AWAY from the statue) to contemplate how serene it is. Next door there is a museum, though I have never been...."

Either way, this is a good place to visit if you want to see exceptional local heritage and an unusual spiritual site in the middle of thriving Bangkok. Admission is 40 Baht. This doesn't include the mid-level Exhibition area, but only the upper level shrine. There are very limited grounds to walk, very limited. It is in the middle of busy streets. Also note that there are numerous stairs to climb if you want to see the Buddha. This takes less than an hour to visit, but -- depending on where your hotel is located and time of day -- traffic to the Temple may take longer than an hour. (Remember to wear sandals or other easy-to-remove shoes if you have them. Temples are great for barefoot monks.) Try it."

Now-a-day a visit to the temple become quite difficulty since the Asian are strongly attracted to gold. Hence the tourists from Asia which involved with mass tourism flocked to this famous temple to see the Golden Buddha. So if you are interested in gold, the visit is a must otherwise there are many other temples to visit without fighting the Asian tourists for standing space. If you still like to visit the temple, make it there early after breakfast to avoid the crowd."

I know that it is the world's biggest and that it's over 700 years old which of course is incredible but going off looks alone you wouldn't know this and would therefore find it hard to be intrigued by it. It is centrally located so easy to get to but considering it's importance, I'm surprised that it's not housed somewhere more remarkable as the Buddha's surroundings are sub-standard. At 40 Baht a ticket (approximately AUD $1.50), if you're in the area then of course go and take a look."

Although the temple was really busy access was well organised. I was very impressed with the Golden Buddha and keenly watched the locals expressing their thanks and offerings and prayers.

One of the most well constructed buddha, the Golden Buddha is made of pure gold and can be disassembled into nine parts but also be put back together smoothly. The Golden Buddha status has experienced quite a few moves after being constructed around the 13~14th century. Not originally housed in Wat Traimit, the status used to be covered in stuccos and plasters. During a move in 1955, the Golden Buddha broke the ropes that were used to lift it and its true materials were discovered. Worth about $250 million USD, the Golden Buddha is a work of art, real treasure and hard to come by.Also enjoyable was the patio area surrounding the temple where one could walk around to take in the view of China Town and enjoy the hard to come by breeze in Bangkok."

There were tables full of people who had obviously just finished a meal, people queued up to get a blessing from a monk, and many monks and other people obviously of high rank. We stayed there for almost an hour and found it fascinating.Afterwards, we climbed up the stairs and looked at the Golden Buddha.

At one point I was pushed aside by a fellow Hindu, to my surprise, just so he could get multiple pic of one of the Buddha's within the temple. I stepped aside and waited and then thanked him and said; \"is it okay if we pray now\" as he finished his last few snap shots. Please remember, this is not just a tourist site, it is a Temple, a place of Worship and Prayer the equal of any shrine for any other faith. The Buddha is Holy to both Buddhists and Hindu's alike so this was a wonderful place to visit for us and the energy and feeling is very peaceful even with all the pushing and shoving of tourists, maybe that explains why I have visited more than once."

Essentially, when Thailand was at war with Burma hundreds of years ago, they covered the golden buddha with concrete to hide it from the enemies.

Everyone seems to make allowances for the others, though in this well mannered society. There is a friendly staff to advise and answer questions, direct traffic flow and to warn that you may not wear your footwear inside on the polished marbles. Now, the elegant Golden Buddha is the purpose of our visit and well worth the trip into the city center to find, but I was caught up with watching the devotions of the Thais who lowered themselves to pray, hands clasped, eyes closed oblivious to the passing and flashing of innumerable tourists. Go on a weekday as we managed for the holidays can become crowded. I stood mesmerized by the elevated golden Buddha's smile. Did the sculptor plan that knowingness , that little gleam which is telling me that he knows that I wish to take more than a digital flash from this place as memento? Avaricious as always I had thought of the tremendous monetary value of five and a half tonnes of nearly pure gold. Then contritely,I put a couple hundred of those Thai Baht in the collection bin to help the monks polish it and keep the grin flashing for those who follow. It was all good clean fun and the view of the city around it is well worth the climb to the top floors, sans sandals and glad of the cool breeze."

I was on roaming mode on my phone or you can get tourist SIM card for your phone from the Tourist information (left side from the exit door, there's a sign \"Tourist information\", you can get it free - downside is you have to figure out where to refill the credit and cut the simcard to iPhone 5s size). anyway, finding this temple is easy! getting out from the MRT station, a local stranger was kind enough to approach me and show me the direction, but he said the temple was closed for the day since there is ceremony. Do not believe him! I was warned by my friend that it was their trick to bring us somewhere.Once you reach the temple, purchase the ticket for only THB 40 per person (This is the entrance fee to the Golden Buddha only). They will give you flyer for short explanation on the statue. I think this is better rather than go to the museum.Before entering the temple, you will need to take off the shoes and ladies, if you dressed with short pants or sleeveless tops, you will need to use the coat provided as they want to keep the temple sacred. Hence, dress politely (I know it was such a torture with the humid weather and the sun).If you want to take a photo, make sure you don't step on the carpet as it is only for praying or the guard will scold you.

The temple itself is 1950s traditional Thai Wat: nice, but not jaw-dropping architecture. The attraction is the lacquer Buddha on top. This particular oversize (15 feet high) lacquered Buddha sat quieting gathering cobwebs for 700 years. The Wat it was in went to ruin and was decommissioned in the 1930s. The lacquered Buddha was put into storage, but because it was very, very old, over the next 20 years a brand new Wat was built to house the lacquered Buddha. They were hoisting the lacquered Buddha for the trip to its new Wat when there was a hoisting disaster; the hoist slipped, the Buddha fell, and the plaster and lacquer broke off of part of it. Revealing what no one alive had the foggiest was inside: a 5.5 ton solid gold Buddha! To fool thieves and Burmese (or both simultaneously) monks had plastered it over and lacquered it. The secret was so well guarded that NO ONE knew the plaster and lacquer was simply a thin facade. Gold IS a beautiful metal--as jewelers have appreciated for at least 4,000 years. This Buddha is absolutely stunning!Here's my problem. I went there today, and rarely have I been so ashamed to be a member of the human race. Despite extremely unmissable instructions that absolutely no photographs of the Buddha were permitted, when I was there a tour bus full of Indians showed up, and every last one started whipping out cameras, smart phones and tablets, and taking photos left and right: the wife in front of the gold Buddha, the mum, hubby. (For the record, I am 100% certain that not one of the Indian women was Muslim, and not one of the Indian men was a Sikh.). The ticket-taker tried to stop this, but they blew her off and refused to stop, oblivious to the grievous outrage to Buddhist sensitivity they were perpetrating. No sooner did they finally leave than a tourbus-load of French arrived, and did the same thing! (For the record, while the statistical odds are that they were mostly French, one or more of these bozos may have been Swiss or Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois).It goes with saying that every lady one of them also stood with their feet pointed straight at the Buddha. I would very much support the Thai government passing a law that required tour operators to instruct their customers on basic etiquette when visiting wats, and documenting having done so, or forfeit their licenses to operate. But it was shameful and painful! Outrageous misconduct! You don't HAVE to be crass to appreciate a work of art and of sublime religious spirit made out of 5.5 tons of gold.So I strongly recommend you see this Wat if you behave with due decorum, and strongly recommend you do not, if you cannot."

The bad thing about it is if you are a woman, they make sure you cover every inch of your skin before going inside the temple, therefore making you sweat profusely for the 5 or 10 minutes you are there.

Our visit was limited to the visit of the Golden Buddha and we did not visit the rest of the museum complex on the 1st and 2nd floors. In hindsight, I wished we had time to visit the rest of the exhibits on the first and second floors.I would recommend visiting the Golden Buddha.I would rate this attraction at 3.5 out of 5. Notes and Tips\u2022 You should check out the history of the Golden Buddha. It is interesting.\u2022 You will have to remove shoes before entering the temple.\u2022 There is a separate admission fee for the museum.\u2022 If you want to spend time visiting the museum, I would consider adding up to 60 minutes.\u2022 The first floor contains a museum about the history of Chinatown and the Chinese immigrants in Bangkok. The second floor contains an exhibition on the history of the Golden Buddha.\u2022 There\u2019s a foreign exchange outlet across the street.\u2022 Chinatown centre is nearby \u2013 approximately 800 meters (1/2 mile) away\u2022 The Golden Buddha is approximately 2.8 kilometers (1 \u00be miles) from Jim Thompson House.\u2022 According to one website: At US$1,400 per troy ounce, the gold in the statue (18 karat) is estimated to be worth 250 million dollars. The body of the statue is 40% pure, the volume from the chin to the forehead is 80% pure, and the hair and the topknot, weighing 45 kg, are 99% pure gold."

Pay for your ticket round the side of the temple complex, away from the road, and make your way to the top level for some great views of china town area.Put your shoes in one of the bags provided and make your way into the room containing the Golden Budda. The room its self is quite small and very hot. The Budda is amazing and very highly polished. Try not to forget this is a buddist temple and the normal rules apply for visitors. Apparently the image weights 5 tonnes, made from solid gold and is valued at $250 million. Didnt visit the exhibition on the level below so cant comment but the Golden Budda is definately worth a visit."

Off course it's a site dedicated to Buddha which has a temple on the 4th floor, which is made of its highest quality of gold.You feel like it's gone melt. Gold work looks so amazing. However the 3rd and 2nd floor also are equally interesting where you learn about the origin of Chin town in Bangkok, and the relationship of China and Thailand from the ancient time. It's has also an exhibition floor, where 1 can learn about how this great statue was done and the story of its origin. One also get a deep insight of Thailand's well preserved chain of Royalty and there kingship. It's really an great architecture marvel but also an great place to learn on Buddhism and About Thailand country, there past relation with china and there business ties, it's simply fantastic!"

But nonetheless, it's at the very least, not daunting to look at. When you think the world's largest seated Buddha, you would imagine it to tower over you like a giant and an ant, but it's surprisingly not. To climb up and see the Buddha is free, but to enter the Yaowarat Heritage Center, you'd have to pay an admission fee. Overall, just climb up (good exercise for those who works behind a desk all the time) to see the Buddha, plus the view above is pretty decent too."

This four-storey temple with a big golden Buddha on the top level after going up three flights of stairs is pretty close to Hua Lamphong (the main train station of Bangkok), so definitely worth checking out if you're at the station waiting on your transit or if you've just arrived in Bangkok by train from somewhere. Go out the side entrance on the right (as coming from the train platforms), cross the canal, turn left, walk a little bit and it's like the second street that you should take (kind of not turning, just bearing right), and it will be on your right.Likely, you'll see tons of tourists like I did when I went there with souvenir vendors selling small Buddha statues on the left as you're going toward the temple, and also on the far right side near the back exit, there's a cluster of more souvenir vendors and what I noticed there was their Thailand souvenir keychains were about three times less (!) than what I had been quoted for pretty much identical ones at the MBK Center where I had gone to just before arriving at this one, so this would be a nice place to buy souvenir keychains if you collect those like I do. Also, there are tons of food places along the street right outside the main entrance.The Confucius statue on the temple grounds near the entrance on the opposite side from the side of the main entrance is also noteworthy, in my opinion, as Buddha and Confucius were from about the same period in history (around 500 BC)."

Visit the gift shop for really nice bracelets and mini gold Buddhas. You would think you can find these at the market JJ but trust me they are not the same quality.

A pure gold Buddha that is from the 13th century, that had been covered in PLASTER and then, one rainy night in 1955 as they were trying to put it in a new location, it fell and the next morning they found pieces of the plaster and underneath it was PURE GOLD!It is just amazing! Not only that, but there are two museums that you must see! Do not just go to see the Buddha (It costs 40 baht....one dollar and thirty cents) but go to the museums as well.Here is the plan........Take the BTS to ASOKE station. Then go to the MRT and go to the station for HuaLampong, about 7 stations away.Then walk up EXIT ONE, and then you will see signs that lead you there. You must cross the road, and there will be TUK TUK drivers who will tell you it is closed until 3PM, but do not believe them, it is open all day on the weekends..... and if you take a TUK TUK it will just be about a minute ride...So walk across the street, follow the signs, and it will be a quick zig zag of a walk.When you arrive buy the whole museum pass which includes the two museums and the golden Buddha....Go to the museum that tells all about the Buddha. You will learn how they made it, you will also see photos of it covered in plaster! If you go see the Buddha first you will miss the big build up so try to go through the museum first.Then go up the steps and WOW!!! It is awesome!!!After that you can go eat lunch at a nearby restaurant, or go to a cafe. Then plan on spending an hour or two at the other museum on the first floor. It has to do with the Chinese history in Thailand. It is so cool! It really goes into all the intricate details of how the Chinese came over, and even has some special life like exhibits, like a ship that goes through a storm while people are yelling in Chinese (the Chinese immigrants sailed on a junk boat for ONE MONTH to get to Bangkok, and they each brought a pumpkin with them so they could eat it on the way, and if there was a storm they could use it to float on!)This museum was like a missing piece for the whole Thai culture. You will see why the city has so many Chinese themes, why the gold stores are painted red in Thailand, why the Chinese saved the city,etc..etc..etc....I spent three hours at this cool attraction, and it was a blast!"

It's a combination of a museum, Buddha and gift shop. The Buddha was stunning and local people where there praying which made it seem real. Outside you are presented with a fridge magnet with your image on it with small images of the golden temple surrounding it from those photographers that took your picture earlier. Haggle and you 'll get a good bargain."

So be prepared for some stair climbing. Sitting for a few minutes with eyes closed gave me a bliss that I had experienced in very few places. I'm not theological or something, it just happened. Try it yourself! I found people smoking inside the temple premises. I am not complaining but it is a rare sight in Hindu temples.We happened to meet someone at the ticket counter, a friend of the guy working there and he had given us enormous and useful info about the temple and Thailand in general. Thai people in general are really nice, chatty and really down to the earth. Just sit at a bar and talk to a few of them and this makes you to really get connected to their world. Wonderful land.

A 'WOW' escapes you when Wat Traimit comes into view, awesome building, which is amazing considering it's historicall speaking 'new', It is interesting to read about the events leading to the discovery of Thailands Largest Gold Buddha in the exhibition, (you pay seperately for this), Up the stairs, lots of them, floor gets VERY HOT when foot wear removed, so do it right up close to the door entrance!! Eventually, on the top level of this Wat, you will be in the presence of the GOLD BUDDHA, it is very awe inspiring, gets busy up there, with many people of the world doing exactly like you are, don't feel rushed to go, have a little sit down in a 'quiet' corner and just 'be', its great, moving and worth it"

The Buddha was amazing and apparently is solid 18 carat gold and weighs over 5 tonnes. It's not a massive temple, but just an amazing experience. China town is quite near by and if you have finished in the temple, just go down the steps and make a left and go out the back of the temple and cross the road - you may think you've found China town straight away, however that's a Chinese temple, you need to walk further up the road :-)Certainly worth a visit, just a lovely example of a temple."

This was our first temple of the trip. We removed our shoes as we went inside. The Buddha was almost 10 feet tall and very shiny, made of solid gold. The story is interesting. The statue had been covered with plaster to hide it from thieves. It had been discarded, until one night a monk had a dream that the lump of plaster had important value. As he looked through one of the cracks in the plaster in the light of day, something shiny appeared. The statue was recovered and now on display here. Five tons of gold.I also love the story of the position that Buddha sits in at this temple called Calling the Earth to Witness. It was the position of his last temptation right before his enlightenment.We got a new year\u2019s blessing there from a monk. They were sitting at the foot of the stairs to enter the temple. We weren\u2019t sure how it worked. Our guide told us what to do. We gave a small donation, 10 baht, by putting it in the donation box, and sat down in front of one of the monks. He looked very jolly, almost like the Buddha himself. First he doused us with water, shaking it from bamboo sticks on us. It was a very hearty blessing. The he let us pick out a bracelet, color of our choice, and he put that on our wrists. It went on the left wrist for women and right wrist for men. It was a highlight of the day.We exchanged money here because the banks were closed for the New Year\u2019s holiday. The exchange rate was comparable to what we found at the banks so it was a convenient and good place to exchange money.There are vendors outside the temple selling various items from food to trinkets. As you enter, there are vendors selling on the inside as well. Our admission was included as part of our tour so I don\u2019t know what it cost. There is no shortage of tuk tuks outside so it would be easy to get a ride here and find a ride to your next location if you weren\u2019t on a tour."

To think about the size and weight of this solid golden Buddha statue is mind numbing.It is not as crowded as the Wat Phra Kaew, Wat Pho or Wat Arun but still provides and excellent view. We visited this place via the Hua Lampong MRT station. Once you are out of the station cross the bridge and look for the sign that leads to Yaowarat Road. Best time to visit is in the afternoon after which you could go to Yaowarat (Chinatown) and enjoy the various street food there."

This temple is close to the main railroad stain (Hua Lamphon) and Chinatown. It is a revered place for Thais as it dates back to the Sukothai period in the 13th-14th century. The shrine that holds the golden statue is beautifully decorated. There is a nice view on the surroundings from the platform, where you enter the temple. Really worth seeing in Bangkok too."

Amazingly enough, the Thai people are so trusting that they have no cameras, security checks, no screens, and no doors keeping us away from the majestic statue of the Buddha! We could even take videos and pictures at no extra charge. Talk about trust.......it was such a humbling experience, being so close to such a historical statue that has been there for centuries......it's amazing how down to earth the Thai people are to keep such a lovely work of art in such good condition, and in such close proximity to the public. The temple is intricate and charming. Places like this are a symbol of peace and unity throughout the world and remind us of the beauty that this world is filled with!"

It really is a pretty spectacular sight to behold. It's also set in a really nice terraced temple. I recommend buying the ticket that includes the museum. The top floor of the museum is actually pretty good and puts the Buddha in a very nice historical context. It also gives some context to some of the other religious sites you see in Thailand. The lower floor with an exhibit and movie on Chinatown is totally skippable. This temple is slightly out of the way, but not all that hard to get to from the MRT and totally worth a detour. If you're in Bangkok when the tourists are slamming the Grand Palace and Wat Pho, this is kind of a nice respite where you're likely to see as many Thais as Farangs."

Also noteworthy is the gallery in the temple that explains some history of the Yaowarat area -- Chinatown; it's well worth the nominal fee to see the dioramas, short film, and exhibits. When visiting the temple, try not to let your picture-taking and gawking interfere with the worship and prayer rituals of the Buddhists there."

Being an Indian, the first thing that hit me about the Temple of the Golden Buddha was that the idol is made of; hold your breath, a few tons of solid gold. That is a lot of gold. The temple is worthy of a visit definitely but with some precautions. Take plenty of water, cover your arms with full sleeves shirt, take a good guide to ward of pesky hawkers, and try to make it in the cooler mornings. The entrance to temple reminded me of the Chamundi Temple in Mysore, India. There is a lot of history to be learnt and the guide adequately transfers the knowledge. Did you know that the solid gold idol was covered with plaster to dissuade marauders from taking away the gold? The original plaster is displayed for us visitors."

The Golden Buddha is in walking distance to the Grand Palace, Emerald Buddha, Chinatown is a bit further but easily assessable by ferry! taxi or a longer walk. Temple of Dawn in just across the river, a ferry cost of about five Baht to get there.The entry fee to see the Golden Buddha is 100 Baht if you are a visitor, Thai visitors and monks in dress do not pay entrance fee. There are bathrooms and a free 250ml water bottle is available for visitors.Ensure that you are appropriately dressed. I wore a t shirt and long short reaching below my knees and that was even suspect, if they do not believe that you are dressed appropriately they will give you coverings to wear. Upon entrance to the temple housing the. Golden Buddha you will need to remove your shoes. If you would like to avoid getting planters warts or athletes foot bring socks to wear!The Golden Buddha is simply amazing! To think that it is made from real gold (and there was no visible security?) was incredible. This was definitely a temple (What) worth visiting. There are many other shrines that can be visited and many, many other golden Buddha images at this location.There has been cases of pickpocketing in he area so be aware of your belongings at all times, especially when taking photographs or praying."

At the ticket office they suggested my tshirt was showing too much arm, so you can rent a scarf there for 20 bahts which was ideal. It wasn't too crowed and no queue so we were straight in.

If you visit chinatown from the ferrystation you just have to make you way through all of it to come to the Wat.The wat has several levels so after you purchsed the entrance ticket you will have to climb up several stairs but every level has interesting facts and offers a new view of the surrounding city. On the top you find a Buddha which is not so beautiful (it has an extreme nose) but completely made of gold. As the building is pretty modern it does lack the kind of decor which are typical for older Wats but here your attention will be focused on the main thing."

I skipped the exhibit only because of time constraint but from what i read about it, it is interesting to understand the history and architecture of the Wat Traimit temple (Temple of the Golden Buddha in Thai) That said, if you have limited time in your itinery, there are other more spectacular Golden Buddhas around Bangkok that is worth the time to visit so you can skip this.

So this was the time that the Golden Buddha was probably brought from Ayutthaya to Bangkok."

This would only take about 5-15 minutes to enjoy, so I wouldn't plan too much time around it. For me this is a positive because I wouldn't want to waste much more time than that to see it. There is plenty of culture, food and exciting activities in Bangkok, so I would plan a quick morning stop off that doesn't throw you off from all the other things to see and do in this city.-RyanNomadic Adaptation"

We caught the ferry to Chinatown and walked to the temple (remember the sarong) through Chinatown. The Sukothai Traimit Golden Buddha is the largest Golden Buddha image in the world and is over 700 years old. It is made of pure gold and weighs about 5.5 tons. Its value has been put at 28.5 million pounds.Originally the image was covered in plaster to conceal it from the invading enemies. But on moving it to its present location in 1955, it was dropped when a rope broke and was found to be made of gold underneath the plaster. It has been recorded in the Guiness Book of records as 'Sacred object with the highest intrinsic value'.The temple has four levels, with the Golden Buddha on the top level. Beneath this is a an exhibition on the history of how the image was made and also an animated demonstration of the 1955 incident when it was dropped and cracked to reveal the gold underneath. On the second floor is a history of Chinatown, with life-sized models and sound animations. It was very realistic and extremely interesting.Just be careful of the tuk-tuk drivers frequenting the temple. Don't go with them. They offer very cheap fares but take you to restaurants where they get commission and you get ripped off, and also to gem factories. It is a real scam. Get a tuk-tuk or taxi from well away from the temple and ask for a non-stop trip."

Remember that these are places of worship and to be respectful. I believe admission is free.And can I also say, I do not understand the people who complain about 15$ to tour an ancient temple or palace. If you are going to travel 1000's of miles to a foreign country and then complain about a small fee? These places are incredible and require maintenance and care for the future of humanity. I cant even see a movie for much less than 15$ these days. Come on people!"

The Golden Buddha Temple (Wat Traimit) is an amazing architecture and a beautiful place to visit but do you know the secret that is hidden at the dome. Ok let\u2019s go back to 1920 in Tibet and monk who is being sent to Bangkok to study and spread the word, he stays in Bangkok for ten years and loves the people and country when again he is asked to take over a temple in India and of course he goes.Now he has spent a couple of years in India when he read a story in the newspaper that a British farmer in the far North West of the country was clearing his land to plant crops mostly tea and have come across some rubble on his that had an ancient script which he was having problem deciphering and put a notice in the Indian Times Paper that he was going to remove the rubble unless anyone could read the script and published a few lines in the paper.The monk had been studying this script in Bangkok and understood it; he straight away went to the far North West to visit the farmer. And got permission from the farmer to read and dig the stone and read the script. The stones said below lays Gupta, he then asked permission to excavate the site this required the High Commission to get involved and they agreed so under supervision he excavated the site and found a jade coffin a small one and in the lid was written here lays Buddha light of the world. Inside the small coffin was an Urn and in which was ashes. This was quite a sensation at the time, he asked and was granted permission to give the ashes to the then King of Thailand. He was given an escort back to Thailand where he gave the King the ashes. The ashes were split into 50% 25% 25% with 50% being put into the top dome of the golden Buddha temple and 25% being put into the emerald Buddha temple and the last 25% being given as a gift to the king of Japan. When the ashes arrived in Japan it was given a state procession through Tokyo to the palace where a specially constructed temple was built to deposit the ashes. And today in Japan there is a public holiday to commemorate the arrival of Buddha\u2019s ashes. In Thailand no holiday but the Golden temple was built to house the ashes, and in Japan even today a holiday to remember the ashes. "

What we found most interesting is that this Buddha has been around they estimate for appx. 800 years and it was only in the last 50 or so years that they knew it was gold! It has been moved around and some plaster or white covering chipped off revealing the gold beneath. Since it's solid gold, they weren't sure how to move it. By accident, an arm came off at a joint and then they realized the architect so many years ago designed it to be taken apart in 9 pieces. He even put extra cold inside the Buddha for touch ups. From what we were told, currently, they can only figure out how to disassemble 2 or 3 of the body parts. If you look close, you'll see the joints.Enjoy!"

It's hilarious. Then once you are done seeing the Golden Buddha, they'll be waiting for you, ready to sell you pictures of yourself.Additionally, inside the temple, you can give a donation and pick up a bottle of Buddhist Holy Water.

The general artistry of the statue is not that pretty to look at, you can tell the casting process used was not that sophisticated, but anything cast in 5 tons of pure gold looks beautiful. be mindful while you're there, devoud buddhists and locals will be praying, so careful while you're surepitously attempting to snape a photo, or you might find out how devout many of these guys really are."

During the ensuring wars, the temple had been afraid of conquerors taking the 5.5 tons of golden buddha away and melting him down, so they encased him in plaster. Move forward 400-600 years, and when he was taken from the Cambodian temple to Bangkok, and efforts were made to clean him up, they discovered the gold underneath and realized how precious this buddha was, not just spiritually, but what he traveled through to reach them now in Bangkok. When we toured the temple, we were blessed by a monk, just across the path from the main temple. Since monks are not allowed to touch women (or vice versa), when he was tying the string bracelet around our wrists, we were very careful that he not have to touch us. He blessed us with a quick sprinkling of holy water and then tied the bracelet on to wish us good luck going forward. A very cool experience and a great way to start our tour of Thailand and Cambodia."

            "review": "Interesting site, borderline spiritual experience. Fun history fact: the Buddha was originally covered up in layers of clay/cement during an invasion on its original temple to avoid being stolen by criminals and wasn't rediscovered to be golden until several years ago when the Buddha was being moved to its new temple. It was accidentally dropped and the outer cast cracked open to reveal the golden making. As it is a running temple, many locals visit to pray and provide their offerings in front of the golden Buddha so its important to be considerate. Was kind of a spiritual experience sitting in silence admiring the golden Buddha and watching the locals honor their faith.TIP: If you want to wear a tank top during your trip (which is highly advised to beat the heat) but plan to visit temples and holy sites always bring a sarong (bottom) and a cardigan (top) for instant cover-up. Better to wear sandals so taking your footwear off at certain cites isn't inconvenient."

The story of how it was hidden to protect it from invaders for years under layers of plaster/masonry is also interesting, including how it was discovered that it was made of pure gold. It is an imposing attraction and one not to be missed."

This temple, built between Bangkok's main railway station and the entrance to Chinatown, was erected to house a Buddha statue being moved from a temple north of BKK which was being closed. When the statue was dropped, a chunk of the plaster covering it broke off, revealing that it was, in fact, a 15-foot high solid gold statue. That's a whole lot of gold, and it's fashioned into a truly beautiful statue. On a floor lower down than the statue is a fascinating exhibition about the history of the Chinese community in Bangkok--a great introduction to an exploration of Chinatown itself."

For some reason, the first time we visited Bangkok, we had given Wat Traimit a miss, possibly because we had done major part of our sight-seeing via the Chao Phraya Tourist boat and Wat Traimit was missed out on.So this time, the Golden Buddha was the first on our list of places to visit and it was stunning! It started off though with an unpleasant experience, whereby we were accosted by some touts, right across the road from our hotel (sukhumvit area). It was the morning rush hour and our star hotel rightly advised us to take a cab from across the other side of the hotel. No sooner we had crossed the road, a gentleman approached us as a cop claiming to be incharge of the area, to ask if we required any assistance. On hearing our destination, he asked us not to visit the place before noon, as being a Sunday the monks were preparing and feeding lunch to poor people in the morning! And hence we should take a tuktuk from across the road (and one was conveniently parked there) to visit the Trade Centre. Having read and warned on the net, regarding such incidents, we thanked him and tried to walk away. And within a few seconds, a lady approached us and tried to befriend us as a nurse.....with the same story of lunch by the monks, Wat Traimit being closed till 1pm for visitors and pointing to the same tuk tuk who will show us around only for THB40 before taking us to Wat Traimit ! We ignored her ofcourse and walked away to take a cab to the Wat Traimit. And what a visual treat the Golden Buddha is. Its amazing and as if by magic, the unpleasant incident of the morning, was erased, as we looked with awe at the impressive Buddha made of gold. One can either climb the stairs of the temple or for the elderly and impaired, there is the option of an elevator too. Its a must visit in Bangkok, for sure."

The first floors are a museum dedicated to understanding the Chinese infuluence in Bangkok. Didn't explain it very well, but I assumed this was where the Buddist influence in Thailand came from. There is a short movie at the beginning of the tour ... 70% propaganda, 30% interesting fact ... skip it. The very top level is the actual Golden Buddha image. Worth a look.

The giant statue of the Buddha is in solid gold, 12.5 ft in diameter and 15.9 ft high, in the Mara conquering style. The whole temple complex is fascinating, and the architecture is quite stunning. Please take a guide along to better understand this fascinating place and its history. As it is a sacred place of worship, respectable clothing is required to be worn, covering arms and legs.

One of our last days in Thailand of a two week trip we decided to visit the temple of the golden Buddha after wandering a bit around Chinatown. By now we had been to plenty of Wats and seen plenty of Buddha statues. We were a bit apprehensive at first, because we kept thinking \"how could this be any different than the others?\" But my cousin (living in Bangkok) suggested we go for a visit anyway. The treasure of the Wat is actually the museum. The museum not only describes the story of how the golden Buddha was made and how it was found, but it also goes through the history of Chinatown and how it was formed. Both areas were well laid out, intriguing and interactive. The bonus to this museum is that all the exhibits are also in English. The Buddha itself is all the way at the top, which also gives you a bit of a look of the surrounding area. The golden Buddha itself was nice to see, but I wouldn't miss the museum (even though it cost a bit extra)."

The Buddha itselt is the world's largest solid gold statue, weighing in at 5.5 tons! It stands 3 meters tall, and is awe inspiring to view. This is especially true when it is considered that for hundreds of years the Golden Buddha had been disguised beneath a thick outer shell of plaster in order to protect the precious gold Buddha within. It was not until 1955 that the plaster stature was in the process of being moved to the new temple at Wat Traimit, that a cable broke and the statue tumbled to the mud. The plaster had cracked, and miraculously, the solid gold Buddha was discovered within. Now devout Buddhists come from all over the world to pray before the Golden Buddha, and Wat Traimit is no longer of temple of lesser importance."

Also near The main rail terminal and the end of one of the Metro lines.Now the Temple is most beatiful and so are the external terraces even if the surrounding Chinatown is a bit grotty but fun.You take your shoes off to enter and no photos inside to be taken. But the air of peace as people squat, kneel and pray is palpable. I also found this depiction of the ideas of Buddha's character to be one of the most attractive in all Bangkok and as I expected this Buddha being solid Gold as opposed to Gold plate made no difference at all. I did not bother to pay extra for the various museums one can go to but if you are a culture vulture make sure that you allow at least 2 hours for this place. Not nearly as busy as the Imperial Palace and the offering areas outside, where people light incense and make offerings to their God or is it Gods is a great photo opportunity because you are outside. Shame about us foreigners, as we get everywhere and I cannot get them out of my photos. Hmmmm may be I should listen more to Jesus Christ where he says \"Love thy neighbour as thyself\". Hmmmmm it is ok loving God, it is the neighbours that challenge me. Maybe if I spent more time worshipping God in a quiet place, I would reach enlightenment but 30 minutes a day at dawn sets me up fairly well. A fair walk from the river but easily approached by Metro.Chris."

Arriving is hard to imagine that the largest Buddha made \u200b\u200bof gold around the world is there. Still worth the visit. It's great view. Important is to respect the local tradition and not move in space forbidden to take pictures, as I saw many people doing. The Buddha is beautiful and certainly has to be considered."

            "review": "Amazing history with many mysteries.... Weighing more than 5 tons, the largest gold Buddha image in the world makes an incredible statement about giving up wealth to create a spiritual object. Even at 5 tons the image consists of 176,000 ounces of gold...about US$285 million at today's prices!The story behind the Buddha is nothing less than extraordinary. No one knows who cast the huge gold image during the Sukhothai era of the Thai kingdom in the 13th century (the date is theorized based on its artistic style). Nor is is known how such a huge quantity of pure gold was acquired to cast a single image -- an extravagant gesture for a young expanding kingdom that must have needed funds for government buildings, defense, trade, infrastructure like roads, irrigation and schools, and countless other projects. But the essentially priceless object was cast...and then it disappeared in plain sight!At some point in the ensuing centuries -- evidently to hide it from enemies (most likely the Burmese) -- someone covered the statue with tar and plaster. Incredibly everyone connected with this act died or chose to keep the secret. The gold inside was totally forgotten until the statue was cracked during a move on May 25, 1955. Since then, the statue has inspired millions as an icon of the birth of the Thai nation.On Sep 22 2008, HRH Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn and the royal consort HRH Princess Srirasmi presided over the ceremony to install the Buddha in its new image hall at Wat Traimit. Just below are two museums with excellent displays about the history of the image and the growth and importance of the surrounding Chinatown area.Full admission for foreigners is 140 baht and photos are permitted. For those of Thai, Buddhist and Chinese heritage this is an essential pilgrimage. For all other visitors it's an amazing sight that raises many provocative questions about ancient times."

The golden Buddha sits in a new building/temple and is on the upper floor, when you enter as always you have to remove your shoes and walk through via a little museum detailing how this iconic image came about. As we all know the story of the Golden Buddha being encased in cement to hide it from warring tribes 400yrs ago, and the Buddha being discovered accidentally when some cement fell off to the shock of everyone at the time.When you have finished here you will find there are lifts for the disabled as its two flights of stairs up..! On arriving upstairs you enter the temple and are confronted by this magnificent image looking down at you, all around are many people praying with this in mind as long as you respect the Buddhist's praying you can walk quietly right around this 22,000lb of solid golden image and take as many photos as you want. And spend as much time here too , but as we were on a tight schedule we got roughly 30 mins but, even at that you get a real feeling of peacefulness around you . And yes it was busy but in a quiet way, outside there was a very discreet stall selling everything Buddhist if you want anything, also there are several flights of stairs leading down to the main street but, remember the lifts are there too. This Temple is well worth a visit and is very easy to find as it's next to China town , it's one of these must do things while in Bangkok..!"

The grounds of the temple are, in my opinion, rather ordinary. The building that the Buddha is housed in is on the impressive side (see photo as well as short video I've posted). You pay something like 400 baht ($1.50) and climb to the top to see the Golden Buddha inside. You can also pay an extra 1000 baht (a little over $3) and tour some \"museum\" related to the history of the temple. For some reason, the Buddha statue itself wasn't quite as big as I imagined it would be, but then it's purported to be solid gold (or something along those lines), so anything larger than a fist would be impressive, I suppose. I'm giving this a low rating for the following reason: I felt that the statue and the shrine that housed it held little sense of tranquility or sacredness to it. It truly did feel to me like a tourist attraction and little else. I'm likely biased in this regard, but in my travels, most temples in Japan, for example, have a deep aura of peace, reverence, and quietness to them that draws me into a contemplative state of mind. This place had none of that for me. It could have been the tacky Chinese music blaring through the speakers of the shrine (you can hear it on the video I've posted). Or it could be how most visitors just take a few pictures, then saunter around. Although a few will make prayers and offerings, I just couldn't connect to that sense of awe or reverence here."
