            "review": "Fantastic half day (4 hour) tour! SO much fun!!. This was so much fun!!! The tour was well organized and the quads were in great condition. Our tour guide Sean was amazing and showed us so many different terrains and villages -- a great break from Siem Reap proper. They provided us with masks to keep mud and bugs from hitting our mouths, and water bottles for drinking. I would highly recommend wearing clothing you don't care about or need for the rest of your trip. Also, we wore water shoes which were perfect! Your socks/sneakers will get wet and muddy and flip flops are not secure enough to be good in the mud and water. Don't worry if it rains! It rained for the last 20 minutes and it only added to the fun! If you bring electronics, make sure to have a waterproof bag or something else to protect them from water and mud.  This is a must do!"

            "review": "Quad biking round Siem Reap. This is a must do the tour is well organised and safe, The team ensure you are capable of handling the quad bike before departing. They have a crew that travel with you ensure that speed and and risk are minimized. There were a group of 9 and 3 people were accompanied on their quad bikes by staff as they were not completely proficient. The scenery is excellent the experience is great and the value for money is great. Even if you have not been on a quad bike before this is really worth while doing. there is no way you will get to see the sites you do by any other means. If you think age is a problem we had some people in their 60s so give it a go. To the staff and crew great job and great service. Will do this again"

            "review": "Enjoyed every minute. A very professional organisation that offers excellent quad tours around the countryside. Our group of 9 comprised 4 adults and 5 children, all under the age of 14. We rented 5 quads, with an adult and child on each machine, and an instructor to accompany the extra child. After a description of the machines, driving rules, and short practical test each we were off on our adventure. It was so much fun for all of us - the surroundings are beautiful, really getting out into the fields and local villages. The tracks are muddy, bumpy, wet, and provide a lot of adventure, although all completely safe on the well maintained quads that we were provided. There was a guide on a motorbike to lead the way, and the extra guide on quad number 5 took turns with the children driving so they got a chance to be hands on. Our guides were Davy and Niko, both of whom were great with the children and took a real interest in showing us the beautiful surroundings while having loads of fun. Very highly recommend this activity and specifically this company for anyone wanting to get out into the countryside in an adventurous way. We loved it."

            "review": "See a different side to Cambodia from the back of a quad bike. My wife and I did the half day tour with Pov who was a great guide, and showed us the real Cambodia we were looking for. After some initial checks to make sure we could handle the powerful (350cc) quad bikes, we were off, using both local roads, and then some much more deserted and rough, single track through local villages, fishing lakes and rice paddies. We stopped in a couple of places and were able to interact with the amazingly friendly local children. This included being able to buy a box of noodles to hand out to all the kids. The half day tour takes about 4 hours, with a couple of stops so maybe 3-3.5 hrs total on the machine. This is enough for sure as unless you're pretty fit and your right thumb is made of steel, you'll need the breaks. The whole experience from pickup to drop off at the hotel was great. I'd recommend following the advice for long trousers, decent footwear and be prepared to get muddy and dirty, cos you'll have a great time if you do. Highly recommended."

            "review": "Incredible Adventure in Siem Reap. I usually do not feel the need to write a review on the same day, but I had such an incredible experience with Sean Piseth of Quad Adventures that I feel the need to share today. My fianc\u00e9e and I did a half day tour, she rode as my passenger, which I thought was the perfect amount of time to witness the countryside of Siem Reap on the ATVs. I grew up riding ATVs and dirtbikes, but beginners should not have much trouble on these fully automatic ATVs. The vehicle was in great shape (a Yamaha 350 grizzly) and handled very easily through rough roads and flooded fields. The tour was an incredible way to see the way people live in the more rural villages. On our tour we stopped and walked around several locations including floating village and the crocodile farm ($3 entry) both of which I recommend. I also recommend bringing candy or snacks to give out to the cute kids of Cambodia who will greet you in each village with smiles and waves. Our guide was great, and tailored the ride to our level of experience. If you're up to it, you will be able to drive through flooded fields and will get very muddy and wet, so dress accordingly. Our guide took incredible photos as well. I highly recommend this trek for the adventure seekers."

Saren our tour guide was brilliant he made it clear from the beginning if we wanted to stop to take a photo we were welcome to and that he would stop until we caught up. The tour took us to a Buddhist temple and through rice fields and villages. We stopped for refreshments and had a chill in a hammock while we talked to Saren about life in Cambodia. Overall it was an amazing trip out and represented great value for money. I'm sure all the tour guides are just as great but I would highly recommend Saren if he's available."

Our guide 'So' took us right out into the countryside, where we saw so many wonderful sites. Children swimming in the rivers, people fishing, baby water buffalo, lots of villages with people going about their daily business. It was a wonderful insite into daily life in Cambodia. 'So' was a very patient guide (my husband was stopping every 5 minutes to take photos), there were so many photo opportunities. Bikes are well maintained and you are taken for a test ride before you set off to make sure you know the basics. Would definitely recommend this for everyone. We are in our 50's and on reflection 3 hours probably would have been enough for us but we managed 4 without any problems."

He explained things to us and walked us through everything step by step. It was great. We had two boys with us ages 14 and 18 and they both thoroughly loved it. Their comments were 'that was sick!' (The 18 year old) and 'that was fully lit!' (The 14 year old). The old man loved it too. The only negative is the bumpy old ride out to the office, so if you've got a bad back maybe take a pillow. It's not very far to the office and then you are shown safety procedures and then tested on the bike to see if you are confident or not and basically able to turn the handles of the 350cc quad. 'It was awesome'. (My words) and it was one of the cheapest rides on Siem Reap. We went through the 'real Cambodia' and it was what we wanted to see all along. Not the touristy stuff. Thanks for a great day. We might even come again before we leave. Great Guide, Great bikes, great day."

It was a fantastic experience - not only being my first time on a quad, but getting to see the locals way of life - children waving at us as we rode past, and seeing a beautiful sunset. I will agree to tips I read to wear long pants and sturdy shoes as your legs do get hot near the engine; but wear ones that can get a bit dirty. We rode through alot of mud and even a pond! My hand got a bit strained holding the accelerator - but get over it - it's too much fun!!! (And you can always head off for a massage after!)

My husband and I each had quad bikes, and we each had one of our kids (11 and 13 years old) riding behind us. Pros - They pick you up and drop you off at your hotel. We stopped and visited people fishing, women cooking rice in bamboo (yum!), and a monastery. We rode through beautiful villages. We stopped and handed out pens to children in the villages. That was the best part. The kids came running out of their houses when they heard the quad bikes. They were so happy to get pens. It was precious! It was wonderful seeing they way people really live in the Siem Reap country sides. We saw farmers plowing their rice fields with water buffaloes. Our guide/leader, So, was wonderful. He let us stop as often as we wanted for pictures and he helped create great experiences for us. I highly recommend So as your quad bike guide. Cons - the road leading up to the Quad Adventure Cambodia office was horribly bumpy. I would have rather been dropped off and walked 50 meters then ride in the back of a truck on that short road full of potholes. Really, it was bad. Also, we did not know in advance to bring gifts for the kids (it was optional), so we stopped at a market and pick some things up. I would have rather been prepared in advance. I think anything short of a four hour tour is too short if you really want to get out and see some things. The eight hour tour might have been too long. When our four-hour tour was over they gave us cold wet towels (heavenly) and cold water. It was a great experience."

If you combined weight is under 130kg you can use a smaller bike. Our tour guide let us choose what types of things we wanted to see. We could add stop offs if we liked. We chose to see local country side, rice paddys, animals, farmers etc. We weren't disappointed. Got some great photos and memories. Our guide drove ahead on a two wheel motorbike, checking for traffic etc. Would definitely do it again. Next time I will bring some notebooks and children's pencils and stationary for the children that come out to wave at you along the way."

I'm a novice on quad bikes but they are very easy to use and my guide So dictated the speed up front to suit my abilities. We spent most of our time on dirt tracks, very wet and dry ones. Some short spurts on Tarmac roads were involved but you get use to the Cambodian way of driving ( very few rules and no road rage) very quickly. Be prepared to get wet and muddy if you plan to go off road at this time of year."

Not only was it plain fun, but the tour also afforded the closest interaction with the culture of the countryside.Here are 10 reasons why you should go on this tour:1. Great guides. Our guide, David, was well informed, kind, earnest, funny and fun. 2. If you have an adventurous side, you will have fun. You will roar through puddles and go over bumps. My 15 year old rides dirt bikes and even he thought that the riding had enough challenges to be really fun. And, I, his mother -- who am somewhat cautious... also had fun... And, my 7 year old had the time of his life.3. You'll get a little dirty. What better way to experience a country than to really get dirty in it?4. You'll see little bits of real Cambodian life.5. People will smile and wave at you.6. You'll feel a little bit like you are in some kind of travelogue / adventure movie.... roaring through backroads... 7. Water buffalo... You'll get really close to water buffallo... 8. You will be close enough to people and their real lives to get a sense of living in Cambodia... Cooking, going to school, farming rice paddies, harvesting lotus, repairing a temple, scaling fish at a local market, playing soccer, etc... 9. We saw other quad tours and their machines were not as well maintained and powerful as those operated by Quad Adventure.10.You will get GREAT pictures! The greens are so green in the countryside. My pictures from our tour are some of the most vibrant and crisp I have ever taken. The quality of light was superb -- probably helped with the contrast of the red bikes against the green landscapes... (Also, you are going slow enough on roads that passengers can take lots of pictures... especially if the driver will stop or slow when asked... )"

We rode tandem on a larger and more powerful quad than they typically use - however you can ride tandem on the smaller quad if your combined weight is 130kg or less. We thought we would be part of a larger group trip but to our delight we discovered that every group has their own guide, who rides in front on a motorbike, leading the way. We stopped three times; once at a temple, then at a local village for juice, then again at a rice paddy field. Our guide was fantastic company and a great conversationalist. It was such an interesting and fun way to spend the afternoon, and very insightful to get a glimpse of village and countryside life. Really it was probably the only way to get such an insight into village life as cars and Tuk Tuks would struggle with the quality of roads - all the more fun on a quad bike though! Would highly recommend this company. Tuk Tuk pick up and drop off to our hotel was very efficient also."

We booked the Easy Ride tour in the morning, and our guide picked us up at our hotel 3.30 pm. When we got there they gave us some information about the ATV and how to drive it, and then we each had to go for a test run so they could decide if we could drive ourselves or if we had to have a guy with us. I have never driven anything but a car, so I had to have a driver behind med on the ATV (cause I sucked basically :P). I didn't mind though, as I could ask him questions on the way and I also felt i bit safer. The tour itself was great! You get to se the real countryside of Siem Reap and how the farmers live and work. It gives you a completely different experience of the country and the culture. It had just rained heavily for two hours when our tour started, so we drove around in some mud and water, but we didn't mind, as it made the tour more authentic. Because you are driving yourself, you can stop anytime to take pictures or to ask questions. We also stopped at a buddah temple and by the huge rice fields, and our guide told us about the the temple and how the farmers work. The Easy Ride tour is 21 km, and we spent about 1,5 hours. I thought this was perfect, as it's quite heavy to drive the ATV, especially in the mud! All in all a great and fun tour I would recommend everyone to do! :D"

It was my first time ridding an ATV and i definitely enjoyed it! At first my companion and I were put through a test to see if we could ride on our own and we both passed. For me it was mostly thanks to the instructor who was very clear in explaining the mechanics of the ATV and the do's and don'ts. (This coming from someone who has never learned how to drive a car). We were also given wet towels and cold bottled water after the ride which was really thoughtful of them. Overall the experience was great! Definitely a must do when going to siem reap! PS. It began raining during our ATV tour which added another exciting element to the experience. So don't worry about the weather too much :)"

At the two hour mark we stopped for a drink at a local stand. At about the three hour mark, we visited West Mebon temple. Over all, it was great fun. We only wished we had more time to take photos of the countryside. This is a great break from temple fatigue. Be ready to ride, get a little bit dirty, and you'll have fun. The quads have no problem plowing through water that is almost knee deep, while you are sitting down on the quad. Bring a small backpack if you want to carry anything, as there's no where to put anything on the quad (unless you bring a rope or bungee cord to tie it to the back rack). Wear sunscreen and bug spray, as there is no where to buy it along the way. Also, bring a bottle of water with you, since you ride for 2 hours before stopping.The route that we followed did not match what was posted online as the suggested itinerary, likely due to the weather and muddy tracks. If you are curious, it might be useful to ask your guide about your destination."

I had the good fortune to do a full day tour with the guide Saren the day before I went to Angkor Wat, and it was a dramatic contrast to the crowds (even in low season) of Angkor. Saren is an excellent guide, and gave me a lot of options on things to see as the tour progressed. At my request, Saren also took me to places he would eat at, resulting in excellent roadside meals in places I never would have found otherwise.I'd highly recommend the all day tour if you have the time. From a drive perspective, there are places where you have to crawl forward through a field, and others where you can speed along a dirt track with no one else on it. On tarmac/pavement, it feels like you're flying. I was there in April--when the heat is at its most oppressive--and zipping down the road was instant relief. One thing to bear in mind, however: you will be absolutely covered in dirt at the end of the day.Lastly, I'd never previously driven a quad bike, so the straightforward instruction they gave at the onset was appreciated, and let me feel sufficiently competent to drive on the roads. About five hours along, in a small village, I rode over a bamboo stake and drove it in to the rim, leaving a thumb-sized hole in the tire. Within about 20 minutes two of the other staff members from Quad Adventure had arrived to replace the entire wheel. They even offered me the quad they arrived on, so I wouldn't be held up while they worked (I declined, as I had bonded with my quad by that juncture). Excellent service all around."

The guide rides a motorbike in front of you and constantly looks back in his rear view mirror to make sure you are okay. He stops so you can take pictures, and checks in with you to make sure he tailors the ride to see what you are interested in. It had rained heavily the day before our tour, and a little bit during, but the mud puddles and flooding on the path made it so much more exciting!

Vijay was an incredible tour guide and gave us a great look into the everyday lives of Cambodians.We started with a rainy ride through the rice fields (he promptly provided us with full rain gear). After which we entered a small village where we took a short break with a lovely family. The entire village welcomed us with smiles and waves and their energy and positivity was so heartwarming. Fortunately, we were there during a time when water levels were low so he then brought us through the low level West Baray Lake where he turned into a true cinematographer and took amazing posed/action photos and slo-mo videos of us. Every stop we made he gave us insightful and truly memorable stories and knowledge about the culture and scenery around us. We did the 2hr tour, but as it was low season, he let us ride for a considerable amount over that.While we absolutely loved seeing the temples - this was really the highlight of our time in Siem Reap. Highly recommend it for anyone looking to fully immerse themselves in the Cambodian culture and have a ton of fun while you're at it and don't forget to ask for Vijay!!"

We booked the sunset tour on Monday, unfortunately it was pouring and our driver came to our hotel to inform us and suggest us to postpone the quad bike tour. It was very nice of him to come over to our hotel to tell us that instead of going ahead with the tour and make money. We eventually did the tour on Wednesday when the sun was shining. The driver picked us up at the hotel to the quad bike centre by tuktuk. Upon arrival, we were given a short introduction and practise session on the quad bike. As I wasn't confident with my driving skills, a coach sat behind me and guided me all along. Along the ride, we passed through some quaint villages and some locals' home. The road to the paddy fields was muddy and it was all good fun when the mud water splashed on our legs! Arriving at the rice paddy fields was the highlight of our adventure. The view there was spectacular with the water reflecting the maginificent sunset. All in all, definitely recommend the sunset tour."

For those who have any experience or are comfortable riding quad bikes then you will find it a piece of cake. My wife was able to control the bike but we decided to get the instructor (I'm so sorry I have forgot your name after such a long time) to ride tandem with her so she would be more comfortable. This was an excellent decision as the instructor was very skilled and a really great guy so he put her mind to ease very quickly.It was great riding through the back paths and we got some great photos tearing through puddles. Our guide (it was more like riding with a friend) was great at taking photos and videos and really made the experience enjoyable for both my wife and myself.The tour itself goes through many back paths and covers a lot of area, so you get to see what goes on off the beaten track and let's not forget how awesome it is to ride the ATV's! The kids in the villages are keen to say Hello and don't worry about the noise as some people have mentioned, as some farms play prayer music at full volume all day! So I don't think noise is much of an issue.The easy rider tour was enough to satisfy me thrill-wise - if I wanted to go fast I would just drop behind a fair distance then floor it to catch up, and the scenery is fantastic. If I ever return to Siem Reap (hopefully one day!) I will definitely seek these guys out again for another tour!Cheers guys! Troy"

My daughter was small enough to ride in front of me, while my son rode behind my husband. They had helmets of all sizes, face masks, even helmets that accommodated our go pros. There were other people there as well, but it was so nice how private they made the experience for us. We saw so much beauty...local homes, villages, children playing, animals, nature... I never felt unsafe, they kept us off main roads and let us control the pace (we were slow as we tried to take everything in). They took group pictures for us when we stopped at a field to view the sunset. It was a perfect amount of time and we all LOVED it. Thank you to Quad Adventure Cambodia.

Really a great way to properly see the country - navigated farms, regional areas, many small (& often very different) villages & headed out to the Floating Forest & the Lake. The locals were all really friendly along the way & the guides really nice & informative. Unfortunately didn't make the Crocodile Park as it was deemed too hot & sunny, so they'd all be submerged. The quads were fully auto & in great condition. Went with our 2 boys - 10 & 11 YO, who both can ride dirt bikes - and they rode the whole way with the guides on the back and they loved it. It'll be very dusty if you go during the dry season, so a bandanna & sun glasses are a good idea, but be prepared to come back filthy."

Done with all the sightseeing for the trip, we wanted an activity that involved less admiring and more action, and Quad Adventure definitely fulfilled those requirements. Chauffeured to the location on a tuk tuk, we met Frank, the owner of the business, who gave us a warm welcome and short introduction to what's in store for the next couple hours or so. We were then given a short crash course on how to operate the ATV and test drive just outside the compound. Throughout the introduction, safety was emphasized constantly, which was thoroughly appreciated.Our guide, Pov (I hope I remembered correctly), spoke fluent English and tended to all our needs. We stopped by a little run-down convenient store of sorts in the outskirts to hydrate and fed ourselves with delicious bamboo sticky rice while Pov informed us about the kids in the villages we were going to visit, asked us if we wanted to buy a box if instant ramen for the kids, and briefed us on safety riding around them.As we reached the village we were greeted by kids rushing out, and packets of instant ramen were distributed in a flash. Pov was quick to grab one of our phones to capture memories of us spending time with the kids (really well taken pictures, too) while translating for us.Our Discovery tour then took us to the countryside. It was the dry season, so there weren't much rice fields to look at, but we still had tons of fun riding into dusty horizons, enjoying the desert-like scenery with occasional buffaloes chilling around.All the while Pov kept a watchful eye on us from the front, promptly stopping as he noticed we made short stops along the way to take pictures. He was also swift to suggest ideas on how our photos could be taken to capture valuable memories of the tour. Truth be told, Pov was better at using my camera than I was, and it was awesome!Once we were done taking all sorts of silly pictures to commemorate our trip to the countryside, we rode our way back to the compound via a different route. We were once again greeted by Frank as we returned, along with bottles of ice cold water and a chilled towel, all of which were very welcomed. We were chauffeured back in the tuk tuk by Pov to end an amazing tour. I'll definitely revisit again during the rainy season in the future for a totally different experience of the same excellent and memorable tour.Quick tips: - Wear clothing to cover up as much as you can, I got bitten by bugs during our ride. The coarse sand also scratched my legs up when there were strong winds.- Sunglasses are important to protect your eyes from the sun, and more importantly, the dust and dirt. Just grab a pair of $8 knock-off Ray-Bans in the city if you don't have any and you're good to go.- Bring a small bag you're willing to have dirt and dust/mud on, so you can at least bring along a bottle of water or rations on the trip if you get hungry quickly like me."

Our guide was at our accommodation to pick us up 15 minutes early, took us via the scenic route to the office where we were guided through how to use the bikes, set up and signed in. We thought we'd be in a group but it was actually a private tour. Heng was on a motorbike while we followed - and the hour that followed was sensational. As well as a whole lot of fun we got to go through all the villages, with children running out of their homes to give us a high five, farmers transporting their cows and women carrying their laundry. It was a great glimpse into the real life of Cambodians. We stopped at the most beautiful rice field - the only green we saw during our trip as it was dry season - for sunset. Heng said it was his favourite secret spot, and took lots of photos for us and came up with ideas for different shots. The trip back was great and we saw another side (the busy city streets with local markets etc) then we returned, were given a cloth and cold water and greeted by the tour operators. I can't recommend this activity and company enough for couples, families and friends."

A lovely family invited us into their house high up on stilts to see there house from the inside. Highly recommend this activity to anyone who is interested in getting off the beaten path and getting a real sense of village life.

Once we arrive at the place, we will be given basic training and also to see if there is a need to have a guide on your ATV if you can't really operate it. The journey to the rice fields to watch sunset, we get to see animals, families and plenty of kids along the way. We bought sweets and cookies to distribute to the kids. They kinda expected all these goodies as you can see their anticipating faces as they wave at you. I would recommend visitors to bring stationery to encourage the children there to write and study (Didn't strike our mind when we were there). Overall, we had a great afternoon with Quad Adventure!

Back in January, I booked the quad + zip-lining package for me and my girlfriend, which consisted of quad biking in the morning and zip-lining in the afternoon.My girlfriend and I were picked up by our guide in uniform, Vilay, at the hotel fresh in the morning. After about 15 minutes on the tuk-tuk, we arrived at the quad biking place and were given a quick lesson on how to work the thing. The bikes themselves were very new and in good condition. After a short test drive around the block, we were off!The scenery around Siem Reap was beautiful and Vilay was very informative, friendly and helpful. Apart from helping us take photos, he was also well-spoken in English. He shared lots of stories with us about Cambodia and himself. It turned out to be much more than quad biking around for fun, but was also the closest we got to be able to learn about what Cambodia was really like from a local's point of view. After a brief chat next to the rice patty fields, we were off again, and before we knew it, we were back to where we started. The scenery was breath-taking, and seeing the happy faces from the kids in the villages is something I'd never forget. All in all, a superb experience!Word of advice - expect to get dirty and maybe bring your own bandanna or something to cover your nose and face, as you do get a lot of dust and dirt from the dirt trails."

I booked this activity because I was intrigued how it topped #1 when this city is based on Temple visits, but this was such an amazing experience that I totally understand why. The booking process was easy, the team is really responsive. Pee, was our guide and he was super friendly, informative and would take photos of us, no problem. We saw the countryside, which was a peaceful trip after spending the last few days in packed cities. So many kids waved at us as we drove by, it was really heart warming. We did a private full-day tour in April. This is 8 hours of riding in 37 degree heat. If you don't like the heat I'd recommend going for a shorter ride but while I was worried initially, the air flow from riding helped a lot and we made it through the day and enjoyed every moment. A few tips: Because we went during dry season it was very dusty, so your clothes and backpack will get dirty. I would advise long sleeve shirts/pants to help protect from the sun and bringing a plastic bag to wrap your camera is good if you have one that hangs around your neck. I'd also recommend bringing a protein bar, just to help boost your energy because it's a long day. Overall, had a blast, the ATVs are super fun and Pee made it really interesting."

We did it on our second day in Siem Reap, after having spent a full day at the temples. It was a great way to break things up. We were able to see the Cambodian country side, the villages, and a fish farm. Our guides were thorough with our safety training, stopped whenever we wanted to take pictures, and even took pictures for us!I highly recommend this adventure as a way to see more of Siem Reap than just temples and the city!"

The instructions were clear, and my boyfriend, a first time driver had no problems. We really enjoyed seeing the villages (excited children), countryside and rice paddies. The machines have plenty of power and are well kept--we both felt plenty safe. Upon return, we were happy to have cool towels and cold water. Highly recommend this!"

My husband and I each drove a child (7 and 8) and we had a great time seeing local community. Was sorta bumpy but it added to the fun. Very hot and dusty, so we were a sweaty muddy mess at the end, but it was lots of fun. Souath and Pov were our guides and they took great care of us - stopping traffic as we went around a curve and always going at a speed that made us comfortable. At one point my daughter was feeling woozy and Souath rode ahead and got her some water and came back. Great trip!"

We went and bought little chip packets from the market and gave them to the village children along the way. Everyone was so friendly waving and smiling at us as we drove past. The bikes are in good condition and easy to ride. Our guide Samrong was lovely and very patient with our constant stops . Will definitely do this again on my next trip to Siem riep."

Was great to get a little taster of Cambodian life in the countryside. Saren was very safety-conscious, ensuring that we were both riding safe throughout the trip, but also made sure we had lots of fun. Saren gave us several options of how we could spend the morning, and we decided to make our way to the Tonle Sap Lake Floating Village.You will get very, very dirty and dusty during the trip - and so make sure you dress appropriately (trousers + firm shoes). Wear and bring sun screen. Limited space to stow your personal belongings on your quad bike.Couldn't help but feel that we were being a little disruptive on our noisy quad bikes, charging through the peaceful villages, casting up dust. However, Saren ensured us that different routes are taken on the quad tours each day to minimise the impact of the tour on the local communities. Excellent way to spend a fun morning in Siem Reap. Highly recommended."

We told our guide, Piseth, what we were looking to do (generally) and he did not disappoint. He was a fantastic guide who took us to remote Temples and villages, as well as an amazing spot for lunch. We learned about Khmer customs and history, as well as the current socio-economic climate of the region. The quad bikes were better quality than expected and handled the rough terrain well. Having ridden on similar tours before, I didn't expect the ride to be too exciting, however, we found ourselves racing along back roads and flying across dry rice fields, making this tour an all around must do. Our four hour tour was worth every penny. This company takes safety seriously, without compromising the fun. Only advice is to be prepared to be covered in dust/dirt during the dry season. The company provides surgical masks for dust, but bring a scarf or bandanna."

We were SO GLAD we didn't as this was definitely a top 2 highlight of our vacation. The tour starts with a pickup at your hotel in a tuk tuk (we did the sunset tour, pickup was at 4:30pm). They bring you about 10-15 mins out of town to their location. Everyone is extremely friendly and professional. They give you a quick lesson on how to use the quad (I had never been on one before) then a hands on driving \"test\" to make sure you get the gist - they are VERY easy to operate. The tour got started and we were the only 2 with our guide. This tour is outside the main city center and out in the country where you get to see a different side of Siem Reap. There are wide open spaces, small family farms, lots of farm animals (roaming cows, chickens, pigs, even a duck farm!), rice paddies and much more to see. I was smiling the ENTIRE trip. This is definitely a more scenic tour vs a fast paced action adventure tour, which I was happy about. There was so much to see. We stopped by an amazing community temple in which the murals rivaled anything we had seen in Bangkok or Chiang Mai, just stunningly gorgeous paintings. Our guide was very informative and knew a lot about the paintings and the surrounding area. Toward the end of the tour, you arrive in a clearing just in time for the beautiful sunset, it was awesome. Be aware that these are extremely dusty country dirt roads and you will definitely be FILTHY at the end of the tour. They provide a dust mask and helmet which you should keep on at all times. Sunglasses are a plus for added protection. If you have a Go Pro, bring it! They offer helmets with the mounting attachment. The tour was just over an hour long, perfect length of time. I'd say this is a MUST do in Siem Reap."

The sunset itself, seen at a rice field, was beautiful. You do get very dusty so be prepared. You get a mask and water etc. My only suggestion is that the guides tone down the pitch for tips. Right away they ask where you are from and then compliment your country because people from there give good tips while people from (fill in the blank) don't give good tips.

The countryside view was awesome and I loved the peaceful atmosphere (I hope they weren't disturbed so much with the loud noise of the ATVs). Most kids we passed by would happily wave to us, and this was heartwarming for me. The last stop of the ride was to enjoy the sunset until we could barely see the sun -- a sign for us to go back to HQ. Definitely a recommended activity when you're in Siem Reap!"

He is a wonderful soul and understood exactly what I wanted and took me on a journey that was one of the highlights of my trip.After passing paddy fields, he took me to a little visited temple with great views over the countryside (we were the only people there). He then took me the back road route to the floating village. I met local children and fishermen and went out a a small boat to see the catch. The bike and his instruction were fine. If you are going in the dry season be aware that it does get very dusty. All in all, although quad biking is not something that locals do, I found that this was the activity that really gave me a closer view of life in Cambodia. Feeling the wind on my face and being able to see and smell the country made it a better experience than the one I had in an air-conditioned car. My two tips would be a) that you check your helmet for fit very carefully before you set off, (mine end up being a little on the large size) and also pull the visor down to check for scratches and or only use well fitting sunglasses, and b) that long pants really does me long pants; I wore pretty long leggings but the bare part of my ankle got pretty uncomfortably hot from the engine at times. Go for proper long baggy pants."

Well I can say they earn their first spot on the list!! I used to be a skidoo guide in Val thorens myself and when I saw this ad I thought it had some potential. First of all they pick you up at the hotel, our guide was visut (if you really like riding, take this dude) and at arrival you already know it's gonna be fun. The owner has lived in France for many years and understands the needs of his costumers. My girlfriend and I were separate from 4 lovely Korean women who clearly had never done anything like this before. We were delighted by our guide visut who took us cruising trew the fields at a very nice speed and believe me I used to be a guide myself, he really feels the capacities and abilities from his customers. After that you get the choice between a sunset from a sacred mountain top or a cruise trew the villages and the backcountry of siem reap. We did the last one and it was the most amazing trip I ever made in Asia. The villagers salute and wave at you while you are cruising down the road! The sunset is next level!! Incredible moment of genuine pleasure!!! The ride takes a little nonferrous than an hour and I can't say there was a minute without happiness!!Big big up to this amazing team. Thanks for making my valentine out of the box and unforgettable!!!"

We were picked up from our hotel by our guide Davy who gave us a briefing on quads and started a tour. Beside driving thru the villages we visited nice mountain with amazing panorama to floating village rice paddles and a 10th century temple. Despite the entrance to the mountain security fee (8$ per person) that was a bit suspicious - Davy gave us a great overlook on Cambodian culture, politics, issues and everydays living. Davy is working hard on his english skills developement so I really advise you to ask for him when booking. He is really honest and tries to answer every single question! :)"

What an experience, a must do in Siem Reap!Started off with a quick run down on how to use the bikes (which are automatic thankfully!), and then we took off. Just a side note: if you don't feel comfortable on your own after the test drive the instructor will do the ride on the back of your bike with you to help guide you through.Davy took us up one of the hills so we could see the beautiful view of Siem Reap and the back down to tour through some of the villages. He was so informative with the history he was able to teach us, as well as about life in cambodia today. I can't thank Davy and Quad Adventure Cambodia enough for the wonderful experience and if I am ever in Siem Reap again I'll be booking another tour with them!"

We had a free afternoon from all the tours of the temples etc but didn't feel like just staying in the hotel so I looked on TA to see what we might do and came across this.Looking at the itinerary we wanted to do the sunset but didn't think that 1 hour was enough so booked the 2 hour which was timed to do the sunset as well and met up with the 1 hour set. The hotel rang them and we paid cash (USD) after they had come to pick us up from our hotel at their office. A good briefing on how to use them and what to do and what not to do. These are rather larger quad bikes than I have been on previously. February is the dry season and therefore places are dusty. Don't wear anything that you might want to wear again before you get it laundered. We were both covered in brown dust when we got back, but don't let put you off.You get given a helmet with visor so you don't need sunglasses. We wore long sleeve shirts as a protection from the sun.We had 2 hours of great fun, driving through local villages, stopping at a monastery and outside another small temple where I bought a cold sprite.I can recommend this. 1 hour I am sure if fine but I know I would have wished for longer so 2 hours for us was just fine."

Safe and well guided tour with a tour guide that was more than happy to take his time and stop frequently while we gave out dollar bills (bring lots as the children saying hello with broad smiles and curiosities is touching). We check our horses on ATV'S and even though the equipment overview and mandatory need to wear a helmet was like pulling teeth, it was quick and comfortable. Great sunset tour and return to happy hour at Khmer Mansion which we highly recommend for accommodation! Looking forward to this tour and seeing the children again next year !!!"

The ATV is quite easy to use (although I have experience having ridden on one before), but it will not be difficult to grasp for the first time. The roads that we went on were all good and we did not go at speeds that were too excessive so it is suitable for beginner drivers. The tour goes throughout the countryside and we get to see a side of Cambodia that we hadn't seen before, through the paddy fields and surrounding villages and thus given an glimpse into all the lives of the people who occupy the village and work on the paddy fields. The Sunrise in the middle of the paddy field was very scenic as well, so all in all it is 100% worth it !!"

If you'd like to try a different type of tour and want to see the gorgeous Cambodian countryside this is the tour for you.You don't have to know how to operative an ATV to enjoy this. You can either learn quickly, since its not rocket science or have a tour guide ride with you. This is so much better than being stuck in a car. Seeing the terrain around Siem Reap was a surreal expereince. Our tour guide, So, was fun and informative. He took us on a beautiful visual tour and let us stop at the most opportune stops for photographs. He explained he was an orphan and took us to the orphanage he said he grew up in. We bought a $40usd bag of rice which we thought was reasonable. Found out later that there is a scam that some people use that involves this exact scenario. I honestly hope this was not the case since we were doing this out of the goodness of our hearts. Do your research and decide if you want to donate or not.Wish we would have stopped at a couple more spots, but that was our fault for not telling So we wanted to spend more time there. When you go feel free to flag your tour guide when you want to see something in more detail.Make sure you take cash for payment as they do not take credit cards. Just FYI, since they allowed us to pay once we got back to the hotel.We saw some amazing sights, learned some new things and drank some good coconut juice on the way. The tour was great and would definitely recommend it to someone traveling for the the first time to Siem Reap."

We sped along roads, bounced along off road dirt tracks and visited some amazing places; best of which was a poor village where we met families with young children living simple but dignified lives.

We booked the Discovery Tour with Quad Adventure and it was the best fun thing we did during our stay in Siem Reap, we were a group of 3 adults and 2 children (10 & 12) and would recommend all the instructors we had that day. I made the booking online and received an email to say we would be picked up at our hotel on the morning of our tour and the children would have instructors. Davy came to pick us up, he was really friendly and all smiles. I explained we would like to visit a school to donate some books and pencils and he said that would not be a problem. We got to their headquarters and had a mini test on the quadbikes, 2 adults had to have instructors which was good as it gave us more confidence and made the experience even more enjoyable as they could tell us about the countryside we were riding through. It was lovely to see the Cambodian countryside after visiting the temples for 2 days. At the suggestion of our instructors we stopped off to get some food supplies for the children (we were going to a village since schools were closed the day we went out on our tour) and made our way to the village where the children came and gathered in the village square. We also took a football for the kids to play with and I know one of our 'big kid' would have stayed behind to play football with the children if he could! After, we went to have some real fun on the bikes driving through huge puddles and zig-zagging through the water logged fields and getting thoroughly soaked! The videos and photos that were taken of that day will forever remind us of a really fantastic time we had. Such a great experience. Thank you Vilay. Thank you Niko. Thank you Davy. Thank you Visal.

My husband, myself and our 23 year old son took the tour. They promptly picked us up at the hotel and took us to their office. Here we signed the paperwork , were fitted for helmets and were taught about the quads. We then all had a brief driving test. I had never been on one before and was a bit apprehensive. Even though the practice drive was brief it was enough for me to feel comfortable and after the first 10 minutes of the start of the tour, that was it I loved it! Pee was our guide. He thoughtfully waited for us to take pictures along the way. He answered our many questions. We saw farm houses, rice fields, water buffalo, kids playing, small village life, temples ... The list goes on. I would say this is a must do to really see the country side and how 80% of Cambodians really live."

The route took us though suburbs, fields, farms and villages, seeing how local people lived, farmed and went about their daily lives. The terrain was a mixture of paved roads, rough roads to tracks of dirt, sand and gravel. Many of the tracks got bumpy in places but nothing the Quads could not handle. Our tour included a number of stops for water, rest and photos. We visited a temple and a floating village along the way and had a really nice lunch at a lakeside restaurant which had hammocks, helping to rest our bums. Got to interact with locals at our numerous stops along the way and amazed by some of the sights we saw. Definitely got a more immersive experience, as the quad allowed you get the sounds and smells of area, that I don't think you could appreciate from a car our coach.I would throughly recommend the quad tour, but it is probably not for the faint hearted as you are left in full responsibility to control the quad and navigate Cambodia traffic. Our tour guide, Pee was great, very friendly and spoke very good english had a great chat over lunch. My perhaps, one constructive critism would be managing our expectations and keeping us informed of the tour plan and durations. We left the floating village at 11:50 to head for lunch, but was not made aware the restaurant was over an hour away, which was quiet along trek as we were both really tired and hungry by this stage.I was throughly covered in dirt and dust by the end of the trip and we received a cold towel and drink, which was a nice touch. The staff were friendly and genuine and pleased that we had a good time."

My guide, Hong, showed up at 11:30 just like they said he would and transported me to their facility. After a quick demonstration of the controls and a short test run to make sure I could drive the atv we were off. I followed Hong and he made sure to let me know through hand signals when we'd be making a turn or stopping and he also let me stop for pictures and happily offered to photograph me. We mostly rode through unpaved back roads and in the open farmlands where there were lots of bison. When you go through some of the populated areas the little children come to the side of the road and wave at you as you ride by. If there was any downside to this tour I'd say that because of the large potholes in the dirt roads sometimes you'd have to slow down to a crawl just to make sure you didn't get bucked or thrown off the atv. Otherwise I very much enjoyed my time."

I followed him all over the countywide and saw a part of Siem Reap that you will not get a really good chance to see. You drive through passing kids playing, and adults working hard in the rice fields and herding cows. I think it is the perfect compliment to visiting temples because you see how the locals really live.The sunset over the rice field was spectacular! But the best part was the fun you have driving though the countryside and some fun off roaring. Niko, my guide asked a few questions on how daring I wanted to be and he hit it right on the spot.

A water crossing adds to the fun and you never know when your path might be blocked by a buffalo or two as you ride through small villages greeted by happy waving children. Getting this close inside the villages shows you how industrious and well organised the communities are. My ride was on a hot dry day so the face mask made sense. Glad I didn't wear white, at the end of the ride we were all orange with dust and big happy smiles all round. The quads are easy to ride and the trip is very safe, so if you're not sure, give it a go, it really is the best way to get up close to the less touched areas."

We each had our own ATV, 2 of us chose to have a guide riding with us, while my other friend chose to drive alone. At first I was wary to have someone riding with me but the guide is very professional, they don't sit near you (bodies do not touch as ATV is big enough for 2).Super fun!! There are times I thought I would flip the ATV over but these babies are very sturdy and steady! I love taking photos and would stop once in a while to get nice shots. We ended in the rice fields with the sun just about to set. The 2 guides with us are also great directors and photographers. They tell us how to position ourselves to get the best shots!

We got to go at our own pace and stopped a lot to take pictures. We also purchased noodles in a small town to hand out to the kids we met along the way. It had rained on and off a couple of days prior so we had lots of puddles to drive thru and it actually started raining towards the end of our tour which actually made the tour even more fun. Highly, highly recommend!"

They tested us on the machines quickly and made sure we were safe to drive them. Then we went out touring for nearly 5 hours. The guides did great finding all kinds of fun trails for us to get wet and muddy (they asked us first if we wanted to get wet/muddy). We toured a crocodile farm, stopped at a shooting range (which was really fun), and then we ended with some beers while watching the sun go down over a rice paddy. We made it back safely and they gave us cold water and towels to clean up.This is a well run organization, and I would recommend them for a fun way to explore Siem Reap."

It was great!Our guide came and picked us up from our hotel in a tuk-tuk. We had a safety briefing and then a practice ride with an instructor. Both of us are novice riders but had no problems operating the ATV. They are automatic and pretty easy to handle. We were also supplied with helmets and face masks (some of the roads are a bit dusty).After that we set out on our tour. Our guide took us through many areas at just the right speed. We passed a few temples, many houses & farms, and a school. If you have one, bring your temple pass as there is a place you can visit using it.Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely recommend doing it!"

At one point mid way along the journey, we were given a few options of an additional side trip, one of which involved buying a sack of dried noodles from a store and distributing them to kids from what, according to the guide, was 'the poorest village in Cambodia.' I do not enjoy poverty tourism. I don't think that it sets a good example to kids, to stand on the side of the road waiting for passing tourists to give them noodles. I felt uncomfortable doing this. The guide said that the kids enjoy this...Other than this, the morning ride was a great way to experience the back roads of Cambodia. The tour operator was efficient, arriving on time at our hotel and providing the necessary training to ride the bikes, and providing bottles of water on our return.Note that you can't take much on the bikes, so will have to leave your large camera and backpacks in lockers at the office before you set out."

The booking process all the way through to the pick up from our hotel to the ride itself was absolutely flawless and we enjoyed every minute. We were the first group to do the new route from the new premises, and after a safety brief and a quick lesson each we were deemed safe to hit the road and get exploring. We saw amazing country side, beautiful lotus fields and remote villages that hadn't seen quad bikes before. Children were coming running from rice fields to see the bikes. We stopped at a traditional soup place for breakfast which was really tasty and was opposite from a local school. The opportunity to discreetly watch the children in school was a real eye opener, the teachers had minimal resources but did a great job - from what we saw anyway. The school wasn't part of the tour, it just happened to be opposite a breakfast spot chosen randomly. There were a couple of kids out the front of the school who's parents couldn't afford to send them to school and our guides were kind enough to let them sit on the quad bikes -something I'm certain they would have been talking about for days, weeks even!!! My favourite part was riding through the fields knee deep in water with water buffalo wondering what on earth was happening hahaVisal and Vilay offered to take our phones or cameras so thankfully we had a tonne of photos and footage of our day too which was excellent. I'm not sure what the old route was like but I can confidently say the new route we did was AWESOME!"

It honestly is so much fun and you really get to let loose on the quads. You will be taken off into the countryside to see some truly amazing scenery. One hour costs $30 and the experience can vary depending on your guide. In summer of 2014, we had an amazing guide who ended up giving us more than an hour and even brought us off the dirt roads and into fields where we could race and really let loose on the quads. As you can imagine, this got really messy so bring old clothes haha. This time, our guide was not as engaging and seemed like he wanted the day to end but we still had an unbelievable experience. 100% reccomend it"

It was so easy and fun to drive or maybe I was confident because the crew was there watching me while driving and kept on reminding me to slow down since I got so excited and drove so fast.

The bikes are in great condition and we were a little sad that we did not opt for the longer packages at the end of the journey.Note: Do wear long pants if possible as the location of Engine vents on the Polaris ATV\"S are poorly taught out as they are placed next to where your left foot resides and can get quite toasty.

I would say a must do and the bikes were easy to ride we did a 2hr tour which was a good time length as you see heaps.

No experience needed as you go for a test drive first and then either ride on your own or with an instructor seated behind you. The bike is a little heavy on the steering, so all the women in our group had instructors behind. This actually just gave you confidence especially in traffic, and didn't impede on the experience at all. This was booked as an optional tour through a travel marvel trip."

We got plastic protection for our shoes so it was no problem even though it was muddy. I think it was actually better instead of the roads being dusty. It was worth it.

Having said that, the bikes are REALLY simple to ride anyway, but it's still important to be confident and comfortable if you're going to be out on the road.The ride was also great, a fantastic way to see the local countryside and to just see the daily life that you wouldn't normally come across. Our guide Piseth was great, he spoke English really well and was happy to take as long as we wanted to explain about the local area and things we saw while out riding. After doing the 4 hour ride I don't think the shorter rides would be any good. 4 hours was perfect, enough time to see a lot, and enough time to have a good ride (the bikes are super fun). Do the half-day tour if you can spare the time.Thanks for a great experience guys, you were great and we had a ball."

We saw rice paddies, water buffalo, temples, villages, stone carvings in the river bed, and we swam below the most beautiful waterfall ever. Sunblock is a must and make sure you put lots on top of hands, wear long loose pants. Roads are good and route we took was very easy and mainly smooth.

You are picked up from your hotel and given a quick run down on how to use the bike. Then you are taken on a short test drive - safety comes first and if your instructor does not think you are ready, then you will need to ride with someone else. No deposit is needed to book the tour, and we paid with cash after the test drive. It was just the two of us with our guide, and the drive around the local countryside was amazing. Lots of water crossings this time of year, so expect to get wet and a bit muddy. Great adventure and highly recommend it."

We went off-road through local villages and I had to manoeuvre around lots of cow traffic which was a first! You also get to see amazing paddocks and the lushness of the paddy fields is just indescribable. I had a very patient and friendly guide. We ended up in an amazing spot to watch a stunning sunset - the breeze was so refreshing! On the way back we got caught in a heavy downpour which only added to the charm of the tour.

There was no time wasted when we arrived. A quick but thorough briefing on how the quads worked and then off on a quick driver test to ensure that we could control the vehicles without issues. Some in our group weren't very confident and they were provided with escorts who sat behind (or drove) them during the adventure. The drive started with a few minutes of \"city\" driving before turning off the streets and heading for the more rural and remote parts of the Cambodian countryside... And boy what an amazing countryside it is. Everywhere we went the locals greeted us with huge smiles and were more than happy to pose for photos, high five us or simply wave before continuing with their daily rituals. Rather than detract from the experience, a sudden downpour added to the fun and excitement. Piseth - our quad bike tour leader was a star and always seemed to looking out for us - to the point of providing ponchos for us to use in an attempt to keep us at least moderately dry. The temple stop partway through was an unexpected bonus and the \"refuel\" stop a little while later came at a perfect time. Our aim with this tour was to see how the locals lived - and that mission was more than accomplished. I can't imagine a better way to see the real Cambodian countryside than on the back of one of these quad bikes... And with Quad Adventure Cambodia!"

Traders in some places appear to be so impoverished that they're happy when a deal is made. One thanked me profusely because she said she'd not been able to break even for the past few days. The saddest part of Siem Reap are children being used to sell wares. They pester until you buy something, and we did. One particular incident that broke my heart was a young girl carrying a baby sister, begging for milk. Her mother was ill and couldn't feed the baby. She refused money because she wasn't wearing slippers, hence not allowed into the supermarket. So I took her into the supermarket and bought her a pair of slippers, milk. When I asked her if she wanted anything else, she said instant noodles. I felt it was a genuine case because she took just one cup. Upon my insistence she accepted another cup and was delighted at the prospect of a large bottle of coke. The USD is welcome in Cambodia. The local currency is all paper and it's difficult to count if you're there for the first time. However, you may need some of the local currency to purchase street food like coconut water which is safest if you're afraid of contaminated water. It is advisable to dress conservatively, but they do not interfere with your dress code unless it's in the inner places of The Angkor Wat. The weather is humid and you may want to carry a hat to shield you from the scourging heat of the sun. Bars are aplenty. In the high end eateries, water costs more than lager! All sorts of food is available- Indian, Mexican,Chinese,Western and Khmer. If you're a traveller from a developing nation, the prices would be a bit too much but if you're from a developed nation, you will be happy to have a decent Mexican meal for just USD 12.Beware when you cross the streets because it's the left hand drive and it's two way traffic on narrow streets. They usually go slow, still I witnessed two near miss accidents involving pedestrians. Crime rates are relatively low in Siem Reap, however the onus is on you to be careful with your money. Tonle Sap (lake)is a must experience. The boatman usually allow you to sit in the front portion of the boat where you can actually feel the wind on your back. Forget about the crocodile farm where they breed crocodiles from babies, skin them and sell the meat. You may want to skip this if you're an animal activist. It's along the great Tonle Sap. Toilets are well maintained in most areas. It's truly a credit to the Cambodian government to safeguard cleanliness in order to promote tourism. Cambodia is a mysterious place with obscure historical accounts and it is a nation reeling from wars. Beautiful architecture is part of Cambodia through it all. Polite people and a generally clean environment makes one want to explore more of the enchanting Cambodia."

We did the Discovery tour and our girls (aged 9 & 7) rode on the back of our bikes - we went out into rural villages, through huge puddles in rice fields, & past water buffalos. We brought some books,pencils,erasers, & sharpeners to hand out to the children we met along the way. Our guide was great - we felt safe at all times and had the best fun. I had no previous experience - the bikes are easy to drive . Can't recommend it highly enough."

We saw temples, water buffalo, and lots of scenes of rural life.The quads were quite fast, although easy to manage, and you really don't need any previous experience. It does get dusty and, if its been raining, very muddy, so old clothes are a must.it is well worth taking things for the children - they are very grateful for anything, as they have nothing. Pencils and paper is great, little bangles, tooth brushes - anything really will be treasured, and the sight of the happy faces certainly makes taking stuff with you worthwhile.This was definitely one of the highlights of our visit to Cambodia"

He was genuinely happy and excited to share the true culture and lifestyle of his country with us and we were thrilled to have the opportunity to observe and learn. From start to finish, it was a meaningful and unforgettable experience. Thank you, Visuth!

We were taken to the base and were honest about our experience on quad bikes, once before! However we were both given very clear instructions and a trial run near to base. I was more wary than my husband but Nick rode behind me to ensure I didn't lose control and I passed!Off we went, we elected to go for the shorter ride but it still enabled us to see the surrounding villages and countryside. We were about for about an hour and 30 mins. Once Nick saw we were confident, we had fun on some interesting tracks as well as stopping for photo opportunities. Nick was informative, interesting and good company. An excellent guide! Great fun, really enjoyed it and we were taken back to our hotel at the end of the ride. A well organised experience, thank you!"

But its worth the trip guys.Prior to the trip, I read about riding through villages and thus I brought along goodies to give away to kids in the villages. We went thru muddy roads, puddles of water, rode along nice green villages and befriended some good people. The Quad Adventure guides were awesome, very patient and tolerant.

Initially we were skeptical that a full day would be too long and tiring, particularly in the scorching heat in the afternoon, but we're so glad we did it! We drove out into the countryside and stopped whenever we felt like taking pictures. Every hour or so, we would take a break, whether it was for pictures, toilet, lunch, water, etc.Our tour guide, Vilay, was truly exceptional, and no words can praise him enough! He picked us up on time from our hotel in a tuk-tuk at 7:30am and drove us to his company to teach us how to drive a quad. I've driven it in the past, but he still gave me a 15-minute practice run before we started the tour to ensure I was comfortable. Safety was his primary focus, but he still made sure we were having fun. My husband and I shared a quad, and he ended up driving the entire day, as I preferred to sit in the back to enjoy the ride. Heat wasn't an issue, since the wind was blowing against us as we rode, which was refreshing. It started to pour at 4pm and we seeked shelter at a local's residence, which made the tour even more memorable since we got to see up close and personal the living conditions of a local. Vilay's English was better than the private English-speaking guide that brought us to Angkor Wat the previous day (arranged by our hotel). His passion for his job and warm, friendly attitude was a pleasure to be around.If anyone is deciding on joining this tour, ask for Vilay, and you won't regret it! The riding was very fun, but it was our tour guide that made the difference. We've joined plenty of tours before and are world travellers, but this was definitely the best tour we've ever done. All thanks to Vilay!!!"

There will be a safety brief and sigining of some indemnity forms followed by equipment check (helmets, review of your current gear what and what not to take on the trip, there are lockers there) then followed by the operational brief of the bike. All these I must say instills only confidence in the company. Afterwhich, you will be taken out on a short orientation run, then you are off on the real trail.The guide will lead the way and pace for the journey that will cover asphalt, gravel, grass, mud, you name it, whatever cambodian terrain throws at you! Also the guide will provide brief introduction/description to interesting places you passed by. You'll really get to see rural siem reap via dirt roads and observe the villagers about their daily lives. As I've booked a sunset tour, we get to see sunset on the open padi fields. Very Nice!When you get back, water and towels are provided to freshen up before they take you back to your hotel.All in All, a memorable experience, losta of real fun with the quadbike and you'll learn quite a bit bout the locals from the guide.(we had an awesome young guide that shared alot on the local culture and stuff) Outstanding from Quad Adventure. Thumbs up!"

They took us on a short test drive to make sure we knew how to use the controls and that we were comfortable on the bikes on our own, they also gave us a helmet with a visor and a face mask (it can be really dusty). The only part I struggled with was remembering to drive on the right side of the road!! But it didn't matter as we followed our tour guide Piseth who was brilliant! We went through a few villages, went off road for a while and also made a stop at a really beautiful temple. Piseth took some amazing photos of us all on the bikes and also driving through a huge puddle! Overall a brilliant experience - would definitely go again :) one think I would say is wear long trousers if possible as the engine next to your ankles gets really hot."

Every care is taken to ensure the bike you ride is roadworthy and you can safely control it, staff were only too happy to go over the controls and supported us to safely secure our kids to sitting in front of us on the Quad.Our sons are (3yrs) and (5yrs) safety helmets and face masks were supplied by Quad Adventure Day Tours and they loaned us some sunglasses for one of our sons. The trip itself is as slow or as fast as you want it to be, with 2 kids we set the pace and the lead driver up front was only too happy to wait/slow down at certain points. You do have to navigate local traffic, but its not fast moving like the city - as you ca imagine its in the country, past cows and traditional homesteads. The sun set was wow ! The lead driver was only too happy to talk to us about the local villages, and our sons got to sit on the back of a water buffalo - this was a huge hit for the kids ! Its a magical, one off experience and upon returning to base we got offered a smile, a cold towel and a drink. Its professional, safe and an exhilarating experience - our sons are still talking about it - and for us its the start of educating our boys on road/bike/traffic safety too.Its worth every $ so go book !"

The restaurant at this location for lunch (included) is also delicious. Slap a gopro to your helmet to record your adventures, and don't forget the tether just in case. Mounts are cheap on amazon so bring a few for other adventures during your travels. In early July, I was roasting under the Cambodian sun - wish I kinda had loose fitting white long sleeve shirt."

If you dont have a lot of experience on a quad its not a problem. My girlfriend had one of the guides ride on the back and it worked out great because he took all kinds of video and photos. I would suggest leaving your belongings at the shop because everthing you wear will get dirty from the landscape. We took a few hours to get to the eco village that was self sustainable and spent the night in one of the houses. They gave us dinner and breakfast the next day which were both tasty. We also had a 30 min foot massage from the locals! Both of the guides were really nice and always patient. The ride back was really fun and we kind of got to play around on the quads a little more. Overall a great time."

I signed up for the 8 hour tour ($170), and thought it might be too long and too expensive. I looked at the shorter times (1hr, 2 1/2 hrs), and based on the fact I have ridden on 4 wheelers before, I just knew that was too short. I am so glad I spent a few extra bucks. My lunch (probably $15-$20) by USA standards (and that was all I could eat/drink (including if I wanted adult beverages). I had time to relax on the long journey which was about 50KM total. I think it was longer, but that was the estimate. I went off in the jungle/off the beaten path with my guide \"Hong\", and he was fantastic. I got to see things you can get to by car/bus/tuk tuk. That is why this is a MUST DO! Things to think about bringing: 1. Sun glasses, 2. maybe some gloves (it will be hot, but your hand could get sore without), camera, long pants/covered shoes (as you will go through some water/mud), water bottle (I put in my back pack for trip) Hong was great, but I am sure others here would do a fantastic job. I would do this again, and if I come back with a friend, I will make sure we take the whole day to go into the back country and talk to the locals. I got some great pics, and this is a must for any photographer!"

We were fortunate enough that it had rained the night before, so we had plenty of mud and water to negotiate, which made the trip ideal. My wife and I shared the one quad, as doing it this way she could sit back, relax and take in the scenery. We visited a mosque and a local school which we and the school children enjoyed, stopped at a local shop for a drink and chat and visited small places that you would not normally see. The locals along the way were very friendly, and after reading other reviews we took some lollies and handed them out to the children( and adults) who came out to wave to us. Some people may think this is wrong, but we enjoyed the look on their faces as we pulled up to say hello. We are rating this trip highly and thinking about doing it again before we leave. We would like to thank Quad Adventure fir their professional approach and a big thanks to Hong for his knowledge, photography and and friendliness, and also the offer to be our son :)"

We had a fantastic tour guide named Vicut. He showed us so many beautiful sights and gave us insight into people's daily lives in the country. Vicut took us to some more remote villages where my husband and I decided to buy some noodles and candy to give to the children. Seeing their smiling, beautiful faces and \"hellos\" was definitely the best part of our vacation.

We outran a huge storm! The vistas were stunning and the guide stopped for photos whenever we wanted. We visited a little modern working temple and stopped for drinks in one of the villages we passed through.This tour was a definite highlight for my son (and for his parents as well)!My only advice is to wear clothes that you can get dirty.

We were picked up and dropped off at the hotel by tuk tuk drivers from the centre.Safety was addressed with everyone who wanted to drive themselves given a test drive with one of the centre's drivers also on the bike.During the tour staff were also on motorbikes to direct traffic whenever entering a roadway with major traffic. Most traffic gave way, as they do, when they saw the group, apart from me nearly getting skittled by a reversing bus.Most of the ride was on backroads in the farming areas. As such the quality of the tracks was very poor so most of your attention was on the road and negotiating the washouts, rather than enjoying the scenery.A relaxing ride it is not.Stops were interesting to observe the farming and to see just how poor the people in this area are.I thought that the lead driver, from the centre, was a bit fast as some of the slower drivers seemed to have difficulty keeping up.Well worth it if you have a couple of hours spare."

The ride was fun because we got to talk with them as we traversed towards the paddy fields. They also served as our photographers telling us what kind of pose to do. Even utilizing the panorama mode in my phone. We were also able to ride a water buffalo for $1 which was a memorable experience for us. The ATV ride is worth it!

Free transport from hotel was great too. I can highly recommend Quad Adventure Cambodia."

The tour starts at around 4:30 and ends around 6:30-7:00. This kind of tour is especially interesting in some aspects:- It brings you to a spot with the perfect view of the sunset and spectacular scenery in all direction for photo taking and nature appreciation.- At this spot there are some buffaloes and cows where you can pet (for free), or ride for some \"service fee\" to the owner.- For once you can experience how a dirt bike racer feels like with all the dust, rapid winds and bumpy roads along the way (no worries, the organizer provides dust mask and helmet, but be sure to hang on tight!)- Usually if you have never rode a car before, an instructor would sit behind you on the quad bike for assistance if necessary. In such a case, you can experience riding the bike and also taking photos while letting the instructor drive.- The ride offers an up-close and personal look on the current state of nature of Cambodian landscape, the crops, the houses, the locals etc. The instructors are friendly, highly experienced and proficient in English so communication is easy and straightforward."

However, we were lucky that our tour leader Niko taught me how to ride the bike with a very good instruction.Me and my partner were told about other quad bike agency by our friends, but I chose this agency as their website provides more details of the route with a map where the tracks are. We lucky that only two of us and Niko to do the riding around the village. So we could stop wherever to take some beautiful Siem reap scenic view.The ride through muds, puddles and rough landscape was so much. We finished the tour with clothes, body and bike covered with mud which was great. We think we were lucky to have Niko who did a great job in guiding us and also the rain in the previous 3 days helped in making the tracks more muddy and challenging."

It was a hot and dry day with barely 40% humidity and as expected it was very dusty. The tour takes you on the outskirts of the city visiting a number of pagodas, rice fields and actually witnessing rural Cambodia and its people. My guide Davy was absolutely top quality. Apart from the sightseeing he gave me in depth information on the political and financial situation in Cambodia something that was an eye opener to me. Many thanks Davy on the memorable tour. If I ever come back I will do the full day tour."

Our guide kept us out for 30 minutes beyond what we paid for and was also extremely helpful posing us for the best possible sunset photos on the scenic rice fields. Quad Adventure has top class service, even down to the wet towels you receive at the end to clean the dust off your face. Only complaint was the scenery on the first half of the ride, mostly just dirt fields with little to see, but that may have just been the end of the dry season."

The owner is very kind and the staff both helpful and attentive: they make sure you can drive and take their time in teaching you, if needed.Going outside of Siem Reap was nice, although not particularly scenic; and driving a ATV is fun (although I don't think it will deserve another attempt).Since returning I keep wondering if our guide, nice as he was, kept underlining the bad of life in Cambodia (exaggerating quite a bit according to other locals we talked to later), and suggested a remote stop where we met an old person surrounded by children for whom he translated to us at length, in order to encourage tipping to himself or others. Had he told us sincerely, we might have - but since we felt a bit... cornered, we didn't."

Our guides were great, letting the kids who were too young to drive by themselves (under 18) to drive with the guides riding behind them. They were always safe and took good care of us. Convenient pickup and drop off from our hotel. Our only regret is not booking the half or full day tour! PS- expect to get dirty (either dusty or muddy) and dress accordingly."

He also took a picture of me every time I requested to go for a quick stop and take pictures with a cow, water buffalo, sunset. We even stopped for 5-10 minutes and let him record on video my quad-bike riding! And since I'm alone like literally, I can even speed up for quite a few times (not in major roads of course).Upon arriving at company headquarters, I was welcomed with a bottled water and cold towel to freshen me up.The owner was nice and courteous as well.Overall, the experience was worth the ride!

Guides alongside on motor bikes ensure added safety when dealing with crossing busier roads and then next your out in the countryside waving to the kids as you fly by. We then sat in a rice paddock to enjoy the sunset and watch a storm in the distance.Next morning our smaller group of 15 were collected for a countryside ride.... different route and the Guides again assisted with keeping the group together, yet also allowing the more adventurous a chance to head off at a faster pace. Again all catching up for a few shots of the countryside.Want a memorable tour? One that will bring a smile to your face once your home?

We went in March 2014 (just a little slow to write the review), The ATV tour lasted around 3 hours (if I remember correctly). My wife and I each had a kid on our ATV and that worked out fine. The tour is dusty (you are not on paved roads) so wear clothing that can get dirty. The ATV's we in good mechanical shape and our tour guide, Den, was great. When we arrived in a certain area, he took each of the kids and let them drive the ATV, while he sat behind them. The kids thought that was great. In addition to just having fun riding the ATV's, we were able to go out into more local areas of Siem Reap to see how the locals live in the area. One thing to check into on other reviews is whether to bring treats for the local kids you will come across on the tour. We did not realize this but a lot of people apparently bring candy or other treats to pass out to the local kids you see along the way. That said, you may want to consider non-sugary snacks as extra sugar may not be the best option where dental care is minimal. Overall, I would highly recommend Quad Adventure Cambodia for an ATV tour and if Den is still working there, I would recommend him as a tour guide."

Seeing the countryside from the quad bikes was a fantastic option. The tour guides are very attentive and will help out if you have timid riders and they let us set the pace of how fast or when to stop. Some other members of our group did the sunset ride but I think either are good options before or after the heat of the day.

I was on my own and had never driven a quad before, but after some clear instructions and a test drive, Vilay confirmed that I was a 'strong woman' and very good driver :) AWESOME!Vilay led the way on a 250cc dirt bike and I followed on the quad. We left the city via some back roads and spent the day flying round the beautiful countryside over every terrain possible - sand, dirt roads, water, scrub land, forest, villages, rice fields, you name it. As the day went on I became more confident and we flew faster and harder. Vilay is very safe and attentive though - I never once felt like we were going too fast. He also made sure he took loads of photos and videos of me (I have my own go pro).We had a mid-morning and mid-afternoon break, and stopped for lunch at a fantastic Khmer restaurant near a lake to chill out, clean the layers of dust off (and rest my accelerator hand!) - chatting, laughing and sharing stories.

We contacted the company the day before our tour and they responded immediately.We assumed we would be going on a group tour and expected one of those tours where a mini-van picks up all the guests from each of their hotels. Instead, we were picked up by a tuk-tuk and taken to the company. Once there, my husband was given instructions on how to drive the quad. (I was not interested in driving one myself.) To ensure he was competent to drive the quad, he was then asked to take the quad for a test drive around town, with our guide on the back. When the guide was satisfied it was safe for my husband to drive the quad, we went on our tour, following our guide who was on a motorbike. We were each provided with a helmet and a face-mask. There were other couples going on tours at the same time but we all had our own individual guide.The company had suggested that everyone wear long-sleeved pants. I only wore 3/4 pants and that was a mistake. As I was on the back of the quad, my legs were closer to the engine and my legs did get fairly warm at times.Our guide Davy took us into the country-side and it was extremely interesting seeing the rice-fields and the way people lived. Davy was a good guide and we felt safe following him.When we returned, we were each provided with a bottle of water and a wet cloth to wipe off the dust, and then were taken back to our hotel. Our tour was about an hour or an hour and a half long. We were happy with our experience with this company."

Was very hot and quite tiring riding over the bumpy tracks so any stops were welcome! We also stopped at a pagoda and out at the furthest point - the temple of Prasat Bakong.It was great fun going past little villages, waving at the kids, seeing 'proper' Cambodian life. We actually got caught up in a local funeral procession, and were stuck behind that for 10 mins or so before we stopped for a drink. Very interesting!We eventually wound our way back to the Quad Adventure offices where cold water and towels awaited. You get caked in dust and grit so don't wear your finest clothes. Davy, who was a great guide, then took me back to my hotel by Tuk Tuk.So happy I did this, as I only booked it last minute as a break from the usual temple visits. Would thoroughly recommend."

This was one of the best activities I did in Siem Reap - had lots of fun going through fields, villages, dusty old trails and even through little paths in the dense forest.I went with one guide (Den) on a motorbike and myself on a quad bike - Den was fantastic, he took me to a small rural village where we chatted for a while with the kids with him translating and very happy to help take photos when I wanted. I also wanted to go fast and Den was happy to lead at a good speed.I initially booked 4 hours but on the day, I wanted to change to 2 hours because I was a bit unwell from the heat the day before. They were happy to change and had no complaints about it which I appreciated. Although in hindsight, because you get the wind blowing against you on the quads, you don't really feel the sun as much so I would do the 4 hour trip next time!It's a different experience to the usual temple tours - we also came across a farmer who's son had just killed a long wild snake (for lunch!) with a slingshot right in front of us!A truly memorable experience!"

The morning that we were suppose to be picked up no one showed up. I called and they told me they would be there shortly. 2 hours and nobody showed so we did a temple tour. To make up for the problem they told me they would give me the trip for free if i could make it during me trip. Unfortunately we couldn't make it. So when we decided to come back to Siem Reap we scheduled again. To my surprise they gave us the trip for free. It was an awesome trip through the country side. Don't forget to slow and high five the little kids they love it. I would do this again no problem"

No, the time was not too long as we had many breaks, lunch, photo opps etc. The company initially takes you out to learn the mechanics of the quad than you are off on your adventure. The bikes are easy to manoeuvre however you may feel a bit sore in your shoulders/arms the next day. We were taken to great sites; a temple, thru rice paddies (not being used), over dusty paths etc. All great fun. Our two guides who were excellent, rode ahead and behind us on dirt bikes and were there every step of the way for us. They stopped and got us cold water when needed, found bathrooms and took us to lunch. We cannot say enough good about them.Suggest you wear sleeveless shirt (very hot) and long, light weight pants as the engine gets warm and they will protect your legs, plus closed in shoes or sneakers. We had read previous reviews of how dirty they got and decided to bring old stuff and just throw them out. Helmets are mandatory but they are not full faced and are pretty light weight. Face masks are provided and the guides will give you a change regularly. Children hear the engines and come running. We handed out pencils etc however note that they will come in bunches of 4-8 so be prepared. Lots of laughing and waving to the villagers and children. Everyone was friendly. Would highly recommend, if you cannot do the full day, try the half day."

Which allowed me to really enjoy the atmosphere of Cambodia in the afternoon. It's truly lovely - children wave at you, dogs chasing the bike (playfully) and - oh yeah - cows block you by standing in the middle of the road chewing cud and looking at you like you're in their way. One of the best experiences of my trip.And an extra tip of the hat to the manager and my driver - they were all super friendly and the driver played tour guide by pointing out various crops and attractions. Just lovely. Couldn't recommend it enough. He also ran half an hour over time and there was no expectation of paying more which was excellent :D."

This excursion with Quad Adventure Cambodia really is a fun way for you to enjoy Siem Reap in a whole new way.I did the excursion soon after I did my Fly With Gibbons zipline (booked a packaged one with them so it comes right after the zipline) back in early May 2015, right during the times when Siem Reap was so packed with tourist and backpackers like me. I got such a nice guide (forgot the name, sorry!) who guided me in exploring the villages of Siem Reap with a complete background stories and information on the Greater Siem Reap area. The guide also showed me a way to Prasat Bakong temple, a temple that is located pretty excluded from the other ones (also less crowded but not any less interesting!)For appr. 2.5 hours time, doing this excursion is really a fun way for you to enjoy Siem Reap. You'll get to see the real life and culture of Siem Reap, way beyond the overly touristic spots. And the best thing of all, you're doing it while riding on a cool ATV!Tips: you might want to combine this excursion with the Flying with Gibbon zipline, think it would provide you the best value for money!"

Three years ago we did this and it was in our top 3 best things to do (ranking our number 1)Spending a total of 3 weeks in Siem Reap over a couple of visits, we have seen a lot of temples, even remote ones as far as the northern border, so for something different, Quad Adventure takes you through the outskirts of town that you would not normally see.Being dry season, we visited Kampong Phluk stilt village for the second time, this time picking up local kids on the back of the quads for a ride. Even though we did the same full day - even with the same guide, Piseth, who is amazing (thanks again Piseth!), it was a different day and a different route. This time we discovered hidden temples at the end of awesome little jungle tracks and again went through pretty little villages where the kids hear you coming and run out to greet you.The lunch break this time was a great experience too, next to a lake in a fabulous bamboo floored local restaurant called The Flying Coconut. Great food and great company chatting to Piseth while swinging in a hammock in the heat.The only concern you may have in doing this is the noise and dust that you create, which is understandable. Take it easy in general, especially through the villages and you will find that they are quite happy to see you travel through if you are polite about it.If you don't mind getting (very) dirty for the sake of an awesome day and an unforgettable experience, go for a Quad Adventure. I highly recommend the full day, you won't regret it.I must note that this is a very expensive day compared to most other things, but it really is worth it for the thrill and the great memories. If I ever go back for a third time, I will most definitely do it again."

My wife and I each took one child as a passenger. Quad Adventure charged us USD40 per bike (with 2 passengers) for the sunset package.The ride took us through the rice fields.

The scenery through the villages was amazing especially all the local kids running out to say hi and wave and hi-five! and the little hidden temples we would never have seen otherwise. Well worth doing. We were picked up and dropped back, given cold water and very well looked after. Also some great photo's taken for us by the guides. Highly recommended."

They were very accommodating to an alternative time of departure and we left in the late afternoon, around 4 pm, for a 2 1/2 hour tour. We had a fabulous time and really enjoyed seeing Siem Reap's countryside and villages. The guides were patient and concerned with safety. For our kids and my parents, the duration of the trip was plenty. I think that any longer would have been a bit too much. Prepare to be hot and dusty, but definitely worth it and the highlight of our trip to Siem Reap."

It turned out to be one of my favorite experiences (other than the temples) in Cambodia.The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful, and after a quick spin around the block to get used to driving a quad, we were off! We were lucky enough to not be in a big group, so it was just the two of us and our guide as we rode out of town. He took us out through the rice paddies as the sun was starting to set. We stopped and admired the views, moved aside for some water buffalo, and splashed our way through some huge puddles. He was great about pointing out possible pictures and totally fine with us stopping for the perfect shot. The entire time, we had huge grins on our face. The wind, the sun, the air, the quiet...it was all perfect and such a great way to see the lovely country outside the city.The entire tour is less than two hours so it's perfect to sandwich in between a day at the temples and a night out on Pub Street. Just make sure to wear clothes that can take a little mud as you're likely to get a bit dirty as you fly through puddles. It's worth it.Definitely add this to your life of things to do in Siem Reap!"

I did the multi adventure activity which included Flight of the Gibbons zip lining (longest zip line in Asia), crossing the jungle bridges from tree to tree and the second part was ATV quad biking around the country side. The zip lining took up 3 hours before heading for lunch. It was a great experience zip lining, the level of difficulty is low- it's quite nice and relaxed and fun! We ended up seeing three gibbons right at the start of the group meeting. The second half of the tour was the Quad bikes which is 2:15 hours. Personally, this was a bit long for me I would have preferred it lasting an hour. It's beautiful to see the country side and riding through the little towns where you see the local people living- children are in the street waving and keen to meet and greet you. However it's a rough ride, very bumpy and dusty, also very hot (I did this in April). Overall great experience but very tiring so make sure you get a good nights rest."

Drive to pick us up at 6.30am, driver was on time and a quick tuk tuk ride to the quad bike place. Signed paperwork and then had a full run down on how to ride the quad bikes. (Husband and I have done other quad bike tours through Asia)Once he went through how to operate the quad, he sat on the back and we had to go for a small ride, to show him we are ok to ride it and also make sure we feel comfortable riding it. Husband and I had a large quad each. The tour guide Piseth was awesome.So off we went, Piseth up front on motorbike, me on the quad, then my husband on the quad. No group tours here! Our own personal tour which was awesome, no other people holding you up, or taking off when you want to stop and take photos. We went to amazing places. Saw the real Cambodia. The homes, the plots of land, and old old temples.We also went to The floating village, we had to pay an extra usd8 each for this.Piseth would tell us all about the farming, the Cambodian people and all sorts of info.This is the best quad bike tour we have ever been on. The others had so many people, you were only ever aloud one speed. But not this company. Just us and the tour guide and we could go fast or slow, we could basically set the pace.Thank you so much, we both had a wonderful morning and are truly greatful for the insights into Cambodia.When I booked I thought it was a bit expensive. No way after coming back, it was well worth it.Please note you get really really dusty. Make sure cameras are in really good cases so no dust gets into the camera."

They arrived at 3:25 pm, which we were fairly surprised by how on time they were. Upon our arrival they showed us the run down (how to work the quad, signed the papers etc.). We did a quick 2 minute trial run nearby where the trainers basically observed us sitting behind us on our quad. Those that were still weary had the option of having a trainer sit behind the full rid . If not, then you'd ride by yourself, following a trainer. Before taking off for the actual run, they give each person a bottle of water and surgical mask. The easy ride was a breeze. The trainers were very nice. Our tour leader, Hong, also give us the 411 on the harvest season, some of their local animals, and took us to a nearby temple. He helped us take photos and was very friendly. He constantly checked up on the riders, ensuring that they had no problems. The easy ride was a bit bumpy, but wasn't hard to tackle, even for new drivers. After the adventure, we went back to the office where we were given towels to wipe our feet/ hands etc. The total cost per individual for the easy ride was 35 us.

Knew every inch of the countryside and really let you take it to the limit. I've heard the other quad places in siem reap skrimp on the amount of kms and fuel you use but this place didn't at all. We got to see everything from the temples, rice paddys, farms, and floating village and had a fun time hi-fiving the children along the way. Get it booked!"

I took the morning discovery tour from Quad Adventure, which was a gentle tour of the surrounding countryside around Siem Reap as well as temples and small villages. The entire operation is very well run, in no time I was set up and ready to go and having done a quick practice loop around the office we were ready for the off! The first few minutes was along quiet lanes to get out of the town and we were soon surrounded by idyllic paddy fields passing waving kids and farmers going about their business. I was told I could stop whenever I liked to take photos which was good, there was no pressure to keep up and the pace was essentially dictated by my ability on the quad. The guide was very good, extremely polite and proficient in English and kept me informed on a lot of Cambodia's history and other tidbits. We stopped at a nice scenic area about half way for a refreshing drink and then we were back on our way. The wat was a nice stop off too.Upon my return there was another cold drink waiting and a refreshing wipe to cool off! All in all a fun morning exploring the Siem Reap countryside and highly recommended."

My experiences attest to the wonderful staff and staff training of this family business. They picked us up from our accommodation as well!

The bikes themselves are well-balanced and easy to ride.

The guide also picks you up from your hotel and when you return offers you amenities to wash and refresh.Piseth was our guide and was fantastic - when booking I'd recommend asking for him - not only does he have great English, but an extensive knowledge of the area, stopping to explain and show us points of interest - it was really interesting.

After a morning of ziplines and then an included lunch, we were picked up at the restaurant in a tuk-tuk by our ATV guide Pao. He drove us across town to the start point. He asked us if we had ever ridden before, and we are both experienced riders. About 6 others were there and they were not experienced. They sent the two of us with Pao and the other 6 with another guide. We rode a little in the city then out to the more rural areas and through the dried rice fields. We followed our guide and he was very attentive. If we stopped for pics, he stopped. If we wanted to go faster, he would go faster. He even took pictures for us in front of a bunch of water buffalo and again as we tore it up through giant mud puddles. We visited a crocodile farm ($1.50 USD each) and had the option to visit some temple ruins and a school (free). We also stopped at a small restaurant to purchase a drink and what tasted like rice doughnuts. We had a great time chatting with Pao about his life, his job, and the manny different kinds of tourists who come on this tour. We read mixed reviews about giving candy or presents to the children in the rural areas as you drive by. In the end, we decided against it and i feel good about that decision. If you do decide to bring something, I recommend small toys or pencils etc over candy. The children are often out waving to you, and they seemed pretty ecstatic to get a high five as you fly by. After the tour, we were given a wet towel to wipe our dusty faces and hands and some water, then taken back to our hotel by Pao. That day, we were switching hotels and Pao took us to grab our bags at the first hotel, then to the new hotel for free. Don't be a moron like me and wear a light colored tank top. The dust stains will never come out. Helmets and face masks providedOnline, it said travlers insurance is required. Though this is never a bad idea, no one at Quad Adventures asked us for proof, let alone verbal confirmation. In the end, it's really a personal call. Our guide was kind, safe, knowledgeable, and spoke English well. I highly recommend this tour. Aside from the temples, it was one of our favorite parts of Cambodia. Don't forget to tip your guide!! :)"

I was picked up from my hotel and taken to the Ceramics place. After I was finished there, my drive picked me up and took me to Quad Adventure Cambodia. It was further away and not near where I had previously seen, so the ride was nice and I got to see a different part of Siem Reap. After being greeted by at least three staff members, I was given a place to store my bag and belongings for the trip. Then my guide explained the parts of the bike to me, and we went out on a trial safety run. He sat behind me on the quad and gave instructions of what to do and where to go. It was a quick 3 minute safety check-really easy! Then I signed my waiver, put on LOTS of sunscreen, and got the quad all to myself. A large group of chinese tourists were there and clogging up the place just as I was ready to leave. But we had different guides, luckily. I followed my guide out and shortly broke away from the much slower moving group. Pee let me stop whenever I wanted to take pictures; he never got too far ahead but let me fall behind just enough to have to \"speed\" up. He guided me with hand signals when turning, and even stopped in shade when we needed a break. He even bought me a cold bottle of water in the middle! During our breaks, we talked about life in Cambodia and life in the US. I learned a lot about the schools, and where Pee came from. It was a highlight of my trip talking to him.My guide took me on all kinds of terrain-flat, red clay, bumpy dirt roads, grasslands, etc. I got a full range of places to drive on! It was a excellent drive, even in the heat and sun of Cambodia in February.I would recommend a 2 hour tour, as my hands got tired and my legs got hot after awhile. But definitely wear long pants and sneakers! And if you are riding in the middle of the day, it might be worth it to wear long sleeves. There is enough wind to keep you cool, but it will keep the hot, hot sun off of your arms. Don't be afraid to get muddy! And stop as much as you can to take pictures."

I was surprised when this was in a relatively built up area as I had expected it to be in the countryside. We were given an introduction to the fully automatic quads, no gears just hand accelerator and and were then sent on a short ride with an instructor on the back to see if we could handle the quads well enough. My husband was fine and was allowed to go on his own but with such a short practice I was struggling with the heavy steering, therefore our instructor, Phy, sat as my passenger which I was quite happy with. We set off onlong relatively busy roads before heading off into the countryside. We rode through paddy fields and villages, and it was very interesting to see the locals at work. We stopped for a drink part way round, where there were other quad bikers from the same company, so we could compare notes. When we started off again I asked Phy to drive and I became the passenger. I had enjoyed driving but found it quite tiring and my back was aching. By becoming the passenger I was able to take more note of the surroundings and take lots of photos/videos. Phy asked if we would like to visit a small temple, which we did, and he then asked if we would like to visit an alligator farm, which we did (extra cost of $3 each). We were out on the quads for about 2.5hrs, so extremely good value. But do beware if you have any back problems."

You pass by villages, locals, many paddy fields to get a countryside feel. The guy assisting me even took videos of the surroundings while I was riding which is a bonus, if you have a GoPro, nothing like it !

The owner replied immediately to confirm our booking which was lucky! It was very professional and we had a test run with a guide before setting out properly. They took a lot of care in providing proper helmets and face masks. I want to highly praise our guide, Saren. He was very considerate and informative on the stops we made through the countryside. You really saw the real poor areas and it was very overwhelming. Children would run out to give gifts of flowers and wave at us. Truly unforgettable and brilliant fun driving over the bumpy roads! Thank you, Saren and the company for a great Valentines!"

We rode around rural villages, rice patties and various other places and got an authentic cultural experience that can be sometimes hard to come by as many places can be overrun with tourists.Despite booking in at the same time as other couples, we still were taken off on our own for a private experience and they were generous, giving us two hours longer than we paid for. The quad bikes were clean and in good repair and the staff were wonderful.My advice: if you have someone to go tandem with, it's much better as you get to enjoy the experience when you ride pillion.I couldn't recommend this company more highly, I have nothing to complain about."

His English was spot on and he took the time to explain the sites we were seeing. The country side was beautiful, as was the sunset and golden glow as we drove through small villages and through fields of buffalo. The bikes were in good condition and we never felt unsafe. We enjoyed the trip and hanging out with Niko so much that we booked a 2 + hour trip a few days later. Again Niko was brilliant and took us 'off the beaten track'. He tailored the trip to suit us and it was the most enjoyable experience ever. The Manager is lovely too , and email responses were prompt and professional.

The guide speaks a good English, very friendly and it was very interesting to talk with him about real life in Cambodia during our breaks. The landscapes were amazing ! It was our first time riding quad (we took one quad for each of us) and the guides brought us for a little trial of the quad before starting the tour, which makes us feel comfortable. We took the 2:30 hours ride and we thought it was more than enough, not too long and not too short. Highly recommended !! Thank you to Quad Adventure for the ride :)"

It was heaps of fun, we went off the roads quite a bit and through a few villages along roads (and through a puddle- do not speed through this or you will get absolutely drenched like I did). We stopped 3 times to take pictures- first at a rice paddy field, second at some trees in the middle of fields near cows and thirdly near a temple, along some water. Our tour leader was Vilay, and he spoke english clearly and gave us information about the Cambodian countryside, temples and villages. I think the 2 hour was a decent length of time, enough to see the country without getting tired or bored, and we thoroughly enjoyed it."

It was a great deal including lunch, and also provided seamless transportation between the two events. It seemed like both companies were totally organized and behaved as one. Great opportunity to do both! The morning was Flight of the Gibbon and the afternoon after lunch was the Quad Adventure.We had a private guide for my wife and me (his name was Den). The experience was fantastic and totally unlike most other experiences in that we really saw the non-touristy side of Cambodia away from Siem Reap. We drove by the more rural areas where children would be playing and come running out whenever we came by (perhaps accustomed to tourists giving away goodies, which we did... though we felt a little bad about it afterward given it was candy, Den said they loved it and the parents were ok with it.) That was really something.We even drove by two local weddings that was in progress and got to sneak a peek at it. Really neat. Den was also kind enough to take our camera and film us riding at various points, both photo and video.If we had one complaint about it, it would be that water should be provided by the company. It's incredibly hot and obviously easy to get thirsty. We had to stop along the way to buy some water from a local shop. The cost was minimal but convenience wise the company probably should be providing it, since you never know when you're going to stop.If you go, make sure that multiple face masks are available to change midway because there is a TON of dirt and it does get all over your face and body. You'll want to change masks after a while so you don't breathe in the dirt.Overall, a great way to see some local culture and the residents of the beautiful country. Oh, and the quads themselves were great and a lot of fun too!"

The ride costs 35$ for 1.5hours if you want your own quadbike. If you go two up like we did its 45$ and you can both take turns driving. The guys at Quad Adventure were really awesome. When we arrived we had a safety check and took a short \"drive test\" to see that you felt comfortable with the quad. The quads themselves were perfect for the job. Fully automatic so no gears to worry about and more than enough power to have a properly good time sliding a bit in the softer sand. We were 5 quads in my group and we had 3 of the Quad Adventure guys cruising with us on off road bikes guiding us where to go. The beginning stretch is on the road for a kilometre or so until you get onto the dirt tracks,but the guys were fantastic in directing traffic and helping us at the one or two small intersections. Because we had a few \"guides\" on bikes it meant the pack could thin out a bit and catered for those who wanted to go a bit quicker and those who just wanted to cruise. All in all we rode for about 2hours, saw the sunset over the rice paddies and had an absolute blast. If you like the outdoors and anything motorised, put on some closed shoes and dark clothes (wear sun glasses to) for the dust and go have some fun with these guys. A must do in Cambodia for me."

Our tour guide was phy who was great he spoke really good English, knew a lot and offered to take pictures whenever he could! To start with you go on a test drive to see if you can drive the quad okay then you're off! We went through the Cambodian countryside which was lovely but a bit bumpy at times! (Hope it goes without saying if you're not physically fit this is not for you)! We stopped off at a lovely temple and phy told us a bit about it which was interesting.Overall we had a great time and great fun! Would 100% recommend!"

I did the half day tour with Visal in December and was really pleased with his level of knowledge about the area. The back roads are not available to tuk-tuk or car, and we were able to see several villages and old temples not easily accessible. The children along the route and families always came out to wave, even before we offered the lollipops to them. We stopped along the route for a quick break to mellow out before heading back to the city and Visal had many other suggestions about things to see/do in the area not affiliated with his company. From start to finish, it was a great day out and made for a good break between seeing all the temples. Thank you!"

I don't like heights but because my husband and I are travelling with our 16 year old son we decided to do a one day zip lining and quad bike adventure so we could balance out the 2 day temple tour. We booked both through Quad Aventures Cambodia. The zip lining was in the morning followed by lunch and the quad bikes in the afternoon. This was a great choice. I admit I did wonder what the safety processes would be like in Cambodia. I had nothing to worry about. Our zip lining guides made me feel very comfortable. Safety always came first. The guides were very professional and had a wonderful sense of humour that made everyone comfortable. I was particularly interested in how all the zip lines were constructed to ensure the trees were not damaged in any way. Felt very comfortable within the first 3 of 10 zip lines. So very happy we booked this. We have fantastic video and pictures of our zip lining adventure. The quad bikes were the same - safety first. My 16 year old son had a guide on the back because he is under age. But the guide was fabulous and let my son perform all the driving and pointed out areas of interest. My husband and I went tandem on 1 bike and this was great because I was able to take photos and video but more importantly was able to wave and slap hands to the many children that passed us in the farming areas. Don't hesitate to book this. They also had a helmet that had a Go Pro camera fitting. Seeing some of the rural areas of Cambodia without other tourists was a highlight of our trip to Cambodia."

If you can drive a car you can drive the quad. They are powerful but there is no need for speed. This company has obviously consulted with the villagers about the tours. We received waves and smiles from many locals including the adults, not just children hoping for lollies. The tour is very respectful of the villagers by slowing down when passing the populated areas and not running a dozen vehicles through at once. Our tour included lunch and drinks. We stopped at small stalls along the way to buy water and soft drinks. Our guide spoke very good English and was able to explain history and current customs. He spotted a family making palm sugar and soon I was tasting and then squatting stirring the sugar. I will appreciate the hard work it takes to make a kilo of this delicious sugar when I am shopping. You do get dirty but nothing the pool shower in your clothes won't fix. The cold face towel at the end was a nice touch."

It was so fun and exhilarating to drive through farmland and country roads. We saw locals and water buffalo and miles and miles of beautiful scenery. Quads are in good shape and they provide you with helmets and face masks (it gets quite dusty). Wear comfortable clothing that can get wet in case you dramatically drive through puddles. Go in the evening after a big day of touring and let loose on the back roads. Was a great time!"

Our guide Niko was extremely patient and helpful, especially when my girlfriend felt a bit uneasy - he got someone to pick up his bike and sat on the back of her quad, making her feel much safer. Although he was a little too enthusiastic with photos! My girlfriend and I did a 4 hour trip and I thought it was just the right length, while she felt it was a bit too long. I would prefer it if the quads had rear vision mirrors and horns, but under the close supervision of the guide this didn't really matter. If you want to do a morning tour but don't want to wake up at 6 am, you can ask the hotel to arrange a time specific to you. This is not advertised on the website."

The guide would then advise when we should cross the road and he always left time for me to follow as the unaccompanied rider.We soon got out of the city and on to village roads between the paddy fields and must have driven for 15 kms.Although we had just come off the Mekong River Cruise, we had never seen this amount of countryside, with locals just doing their natural thing.If you don't do anything else other than the temples, do this.There are apparently other quad bike outfits in Siem Reap with similar names. I can't speak for them, so make sure you chose this company"

The staff tested our ability to drive a quad bike before they would commit to taking us on the adventure. We went across the fields and rice paddy's on our quads with a guide leading the way on his motor bike, we had brought a couple pair of children jeans that my friends son had out grown and our guide gave them to a family who's father had died two years before, they are farmers so life is hard. (if you have any old childrens clothes then take them with you and donate them via your guide to a family that will really appreciate them). We went through a number of villages and our guide suggested that we could buy a carton of Ma Ma noodles and hand them out to the children as we go through some of the villages (the noodles cost us about \u00a320 for a carton of 50), it may seem expensive but when you see these little kids getting a small pack of noodles and leaping with joy with a big smile on their face it is worth every penny. We are talking about very poor farmers who may make about $2,000 a year! They eat rice, fish, chicken and insects so a pack of noodles is a real treat. Our half day tour was enough for us, a full day may be a bit long. Take water with you, excellent adventure for your children and a great way to see a different life to our's"

He simply laughed it off, which was nice.And then our guide, Phy, is just the best. He rode with my younger sister, who was pretty nervous about driving a quad in the streets of Siem Reap, but Phy made her very comfortable and at ease. We didn't need to ask him to take our photos; he readily volunteered to do so before we ever had the chance to ask him. It must also be said that he takes great photos. Above all, we loved hearing the many stories he shared with us. It was an adventure tour with a healthy does of Cambodian history and culture as well.Lastly, the sunset on the paddy fields was simply breathtaking, and we've seen a lot of sunsets before.We will definitely do this again when we get the chance.

Our guide Phy was great. Very friendly and attentive the whole time. Sunset tour was a great way to get some amazing pictures we wouldn't have been able to get otherwise. Not to mention getting to cruise around on a Quad was great fun too. Def recommend it!!!"

For people that aren't confident you can opt for a pillion guide to support you. The quads are easy to ride, great fun and an opportunity to get down right dirty! Loved the mud puddles Visal (thanks for finding them for me). We took the 2 hour adventure tour, this gave us an opportunity to view the countryside, take some great photos and build upon our Cambodian memories. My only regret is that we did the quad adventure on our last day in Siem Reap and were unable to go again! So many different riding opportunities. The ride finished with a cold towel to clean and cool down, laughs back at base with riders returning from other tours and then a comfortable trip back to our motel. Guides speak excellent English. Thanks Visal - we have passed your details onto our friends."

Our tour leader Vilay was fun and very helpful with the video tapping and photo taking of our ride. He helped checking intersections for us to ensure our safety and gave us some information on the villager's life in the countryside.

Our tour was absolutely fantastic, and while I was a little nervous driving the bike on the busier roads, it helped a lot to have the guide on my bike reassuring me and telling me when to stop and go. We got to drive out into the rice paddies where we saw a beautiful sunset, and then we drove around the countryside before heading back into town. We were then dropped back off at our hotel (included in the cost). Highly recommended and our guide was fantastic!!"

Sharing the quad with a friend is my recommendation. You will have sufficient driving time as well as the chance to take in the sights.

Both times I had Pee as a guide who was excellent.When arriving I had a short driving test, there was a large group and 2 individuals. The company decided to keep the group together, but gave the two indivduals their own guides since we were different abilities. This meant I got a private tour for the normal price. On the tour we go progressively faster and more exciting exploring open areas, back roads and villages and having a lot of fun.The next day we did the shared quad easy ride. This again turned out to be a private tour with just 2 of us and the guide. Although billed as the easy tour we were asked what sort of route we would like and this allowed us some smooth roads, but also some bumpy off-roading.Both times I got a private tour at no extra cost and had the experience tailored to my own wishes. They supported those that needed it (a guide shared a quad with another woman) but also allowed me to have a fast and exciting time. Highly recommended for people of all abilities since they go out of their way to make sure you get the experience you want."

We did a quick orientation and took off on a 1.5 hr ride where we were able to see the sunset and countryside. It was an eye opening experience to be able to see villages around Siem Reap and how these people live their lives. Overall it was worth the money to do something different. Were were not taken to any orphanages and asked to make any donations, however the guides did mention how poor they are soooooo they do expect tips. Please DO NOT bring candy for these kids who have no adequate healthcare. If you are going to bring anything, toiletries, soap, shampoo, toothbrush and other hygiene products would all be useful.Feedback and caution: Management should spend a bit more time going over safety tips and taking the person around the practice area. I recommend that you take it slowly around the local roads that have holes. Hitting a hole while having your thumb on the accelerator will lurch your bike towards a sudden change in direction and is dangerous when you are on a narrow road!"

It was perfect and leaves you wanting more. The company welcomes you with a short but thorough introduction to the quad you'll be driving, fits you with a helmet and dust mask, then takes you with a driver on the back on a test ride around the corner, to make sure you can handle the machine. It is very simple to operate and the instant-off excellerator thumb control ensures you can't get into much trouble to begin with. Then it is off to the countryside around Siem Reap The guide who accompanies/leads you on a motorbike (we had 'Lucky') was excellent, spoke decent English and didn't mind stopping often (we are photographers). You'll encounter water buffalo and cow herds on the roads, lots of kids waving you on, and really see the countryside up close and personal. We will certainly go again, next time we are in Siem Reap, but may do the day-long tour to the mountain that time. The quads are so comfortable to ride! Staff on your tour and back at the office are professional, friendly and safety conscious. One of the most fun things you can do in Siem Reap, and a nice getaway from the temples."

We have two boys (10 and 13yrs) and thought that it would be a great way for them to see Cambodia, experience the people & country and have fun in the process.This proved to be the highlight of our trip. Visal was our tour leader and did a fabulous job. We had a short lesson in the beginning and started off slow since neither my husband or I had driven four wheelers before. We booked for two and each had one of our sons on the back. We booked the 2 hour Discovery Tour; for us it was perfect. Never too rough or too fast. 2 hours was just the perfect amount of time to see the countryside.We had filled our pockets with Hot Wheel cars to hand out to the kids. This turned out to be perfect. Anytime you want to stop or slow down, the tour leader cannot lose you. Visal explained that some of his customers bring hand me down clothes to hand out to the families as well. This provided wonderful life lessons to teach our boys and helped others in the process. When the adventure is completed, you return to the Quad Adventure location for cold water and cold towels.Dress - wear clothes that you would expect to get dirty and possibly wet with water/mud splash from driving through dirt and puddles.Be careful as two other knock off Quad Adventure companies (Quad Bike Adventure and Cambodia Quad Bike). Quad Adventure is the original and have experience & great guides.I wish that we could find this type of experience in other countries as well. Fabulous way to experience Siem Reap. Recommend this for all and for families with kids old enough to hold on."

On arrival we received a quick introduction to the quad bikes which were very easy to operate and we went off on a practise loop to see if we could handle the quads. Our tour leader Phy was wonderful in showing us around the country side of Siem Reap. We rode through rice fields with amazing views and saw a lot of local people in their environment. We saw a few temples and drove through forests. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and agreed it was the best day we had spent in Siem Reap and possible throughout our trip! If you do visit, remember there are some competing companies out there with very similar names, so make sure you choose the right one.This is definitely a must-do after some days spent at the temples as it completely refreshed us and allowed us to see another side to Siem Reap. Our guide was so professional at the same time so friendly and informative, he really made the whole experience!"

It rained mid-way through the trip, which made it even more exciting for the kids as we tore up some mud and spun through some water holes! Highly recommend this company."

Once again an awesome experience I would recommend to all! I was lucky enough to get Visal again as a tour guide and he led me through the rice fields and villages around Siem Reap. Whilst visiting the large temples like Angkor Wat are awesome, just experiencing and getting some understanding of the locals and their way of life is amazing and in some ways has a bigger impact on your experience and the stories you take home. Riding the Quads is not difficult and they will give you a test run before unleashing you on the countryside! It is by far not the cheapest tour option however the quad bikes lets you reach places that you couldn't on a tuk-tuk."

My boyfriend and I took the sunset biking tour with Den recently.We had an incredible time and definitely class it as one of the best things we have done whilst travelling (We have been travelling ten months). The quad bikes are really easy to drive and you will receive a quick lesson and have a practice drive before the tour begins. Whilst on the tour, we drove through a few small rural villages, saw the paddy fields where the farmer grows rice and navigated our way through herds of cows. Den stopped regularly to take photos for us and explain things about the countryside. This was above and beyond our expectations - it was like a real guided tour instead of just bombing around the countryside. He also gave us some really good advice about the Angkor temples and what order to see them in. We decided to share a quad and this turned out to be a really good decision as it meant that the person on the back could relax and take videos/pictures of the surroundings. We swapped halfway through so both of us got a chance to drive. I would definitely recommend doing this tour if you are in Siem Reap. When you book the tour try and ask for Den to be your guide as he was just brilliant. He made our time in Siem Reap unforgettable and both me and my boyfriend will always remember our time here because of Den!"

We booked a tour via email without having to make any deposit. We were picked up by a tuktuk from our hotel at 4:30 in the afternoon and we were brought to the headquarters. There, we were taught the basics of driving an ATV and after a few minutes, they let us test drive the ATVs on the actual street with each of us having an individual instructor. The instructors then made an evaluation as whether or not they would allow us to drive on our own or have an instructor riding together with each individual. Everyone in our group ended up having an instructor with them (there's NO extra charge for this). Then we started the sunset tour! We were provided with helmets as well as face masks since the road could get really dusty. We drove through the actual streets, smaller side streets and bumpy dirt roads until we eventually reached the rice fields where we enjoyed the sunset, chatted with the instructors and took photos. I loved driving the ATV as it gave me an opportunity to really enjoy the city. I didn't feel totally relaxed though because I had to make sure to keep an alert lookout for cars, trucks, tractors, motor vehicles, even buses, as well as small children and giant cows (although my instructor was there to push the breaks whenever I failed to do so). After the sunset, we headed back to the headquarters and it was a little more difficult to drive as it was already dark. We were also provided with a cold bottle of water and wet towels. We went home covered with dust but totally hyped by this adventure!Giving a special thanks to my instructor, Vilay! :)"

Our guide also was amazing stopping at rest points and explaining the various stops with a a brief history of Cambodia and their local way of life (guides name is Piseth). A must try when you are here as it really gives you a better understanding of what Siem Reap is other than just Temples. What i recommend is a minimum of 2hour tour if you do a half day or a whole day tour its better to do 2pax to a Quad rather than ride solo as after a while it can get rather tiring (your right thumb triggers the throttle).Wear shoes and comfortable clothes which you do not mind getting dusty as the route is very dusty, you would be caked with sand at the end of the tour. I carried a backpack with with bottled water and wet wipes just in case. Also brought sweets for the many children you pass along the way. :)If i had three thumbs i would give it three thumbs up."

Riding through the surrounding countryside on four wheel all terrain vehicles is the antidote to temple overload. Take the morning tour to beat the heat, and come to appreciate daily life in Cambodia by meandering through the rice fields and villages on the 45 km route.Well maintained vehicles, great service, and attention to safety make this a low stress adventure that you do not want to miss. Pick up in the tuk-tuk is an authentic touch. Never driven a quad, don't be concerned as they will test your skills and drive accordingly. For most the two hour option will be sufficient - good fun, good value, good time."

Seeing Angkor Wat while in Siem Riep is definitely the must see attraction, but you have to take the time and do a quad tour with this company. They will give you an experience that will rival Angkor Wat. You get to see the real Cambodia from farmlands to luxurious homes. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A GOPRO FOR THIS TRIP! I wish I had one when I went; I would have paid $100's of dollars for a copy if the company had taken a video of the trip. Everything is so fantastic I wanted to be able to show friends and families everything I experienced.Starting the tour you are quickly out of the city and into farming areas where you are able to view farmers working their rice fields. Next, make sure you have clothes you do not mind getting dirty. The mud holes are great ripping through for a little extra fun! Then the true Cambodian experience begins as you drive through small villages that show the heart and soul of the country. Driving down small lanes you will pass countless houses where little children will run down the paths to their homes and wave as you pass. The smiles are precious and worth a lifetime of memories. A stop in a small village affords you plenty of opportunities to interact with the local residents. How bout a haircut by a barber using clippers that have to be operated by hand. The haircut is really good for just $2 US. In a span of three hours our guide Visal provided memories that will last forever. The people are super friendly and truly this is what Cambodia is all about. Take the time to experience the best part of Cambodia which is the people! This tour will bring you first hand with them if you are willing to take the time. Thank you Visal for showing us your country up close and personal!"

Had so much fun experiencing the different landscapes and on our own bikes. He even took us to remote temples and areas, saw the famous rice fields too. Even went through some rather muddy water logged areas and got covered...but the guide was fantastic and took us somewhere to clean up, get refreshments and generally enjoy our time there. Brilliant. Recommend it as a must do and see when visiting Siem Reap in Cambodia."

We selected a morning session departed at 0730hrs where there is a free pick up from our hostel. The staff was absolutely friendly and helpful. We had given them the wrong hostel address which delayed their pick up as they need to fetch us a the other hostel. They gave training on how to operate the quad bike and brief us on the safety guidelines. Along the journey, they led us the road to the rural area where the poor villagers stay, we saw the beautiful farm land and enjoyed the fresh breeze from the countryside. The crews are so helpful as they offered to help us take photograph and video for such a big group of us. They follow us closely to ensure that we are safe and no one is left behind the route. The whole journey supposed to take about 2.15 hours but we realized that when we were back to the office site it was about 3 hours in total. I wanted to compliment the group of guides that are super friendly, experienced and well verse in English namely Davy, Den, Piseth, Saren and Pov. All of them are fantastic! Everyone of us are so satisfied with this quad bike and I will definitely recommend this must do in Siem Reap to my friends.Please make early booking via online to enjoy 10% discount on the rate."

Whilst my wife and I have experience riding motorcycles and quads but our friend didn't but she was fine with the quad due to their quick assessment ride with an instructor and graded approach. The bikes are automatic, safe and almost fool proof and provide a great way to see the real Cambodia that normal travellers would not experience. The guides were safety orientated and friendly and I would highly recommend this experience, particularly coupled with the Flight of the Gibbons adventure to make it a perfect adventure day out!!!"

We drove around the back parts of Siem Reap and then a little further out to see some farmlands and quieter areas. What I did like is that they didn't sugar coat the experience but let us see it all. The tour was well paced, my 15yr old got to drive the quad with an experienced pillion instructor and I had not driven one either but picked it up very quickly. The guides were experienced and spoke english well. We all enjoyed ourselves immensely."

We went through some giant puddles which was fun - we got very muddy so wear clothes that can get dirty. They recommend you wear shoes long trousers. We didn't have either and survived but it was pretty hot next to the engine. We passed another tour company of quad bikes on our journey. There were about 20 in the group. We had a group of 3 which made us feel really grateful.We went at a good speed and could take as long as we wanted at one of the temples. I'm giving it 4 stars because, there were occasions where I felt a bit guilty hurling through small villages leaving a cloud of dust for the locals to breath in. We went through a little river where It looked like people were fishing. If there were fish there before, it's unlikely the fish were there after we had been through.It's not the company's fault, it's what you sign up for but it is something you should be prepared to experience. Having said that, it was a pretty awesome day."

So much fun was had from manoeuvring around water buffalo, seeing the locals going about their daily life, and waving to all the kids that came running out onto the sides of the road. We stopped at a number of places to take photos. When we got to the rice fields, Phy took our youngest (8 yrs) and let him have a drive of the ATV, Mr 8 had the biggest a smile from ear to ear and said that was so cool.

The staff was really nice, they give you all the information you need about quad operation and then you go with a \"guide\", that shows you the way with his own motorcycle. Our guy chose a very beatiful path, in the middle of small villages and rice fields, he even took us to a pagoda. The two-hour tour was very pleasant, people were really kind all the way, especially children. We ended watching the sunset in an incredibly silent place and it was magic, as there were thunders in the sky."

I searched on the internet and found this one... I was not disappointed. I was picked up promptly at 4:30pm in a tuk-tuk by my guide. I took my six year old son as my passenger (after a quick drive around the block as a 'test' that I was safe to drive on my own) and it was a great experience overall! My guide, Niko was fantastic throughout the tour. All Cambodians love kids, but Niko went the extra mile to make sure my son and I were happy at all times. We even went on a detour to make sure we had a photo next to a rice paddy, even though I had just mentioned the power lines in another shot, as a joke! It was great. Small groups meant that we were able to stop in an empty field and have fun doing a bit of off-road as well. We didn't spend much time in villages, but I thought that was more appropriate anyway. I would have felt wrong imposing on their evening activities on a noisy quad bike. We did see some villagers bringing their water buffalo and cattle in for the night and that was nice. It was a dry day, so I got only a few splatters of mud, nothing significant, but I can see on a wet day it could get a lot messier. A fantastic experience overall and I liked meeting the family who own the business (French husband, Khmer wife and their two cute girls) after the ride over a cold towel and water."

We did it in conjunction with a Flight of the Gibbon ziplining tour and the transition from one activity to the next was seamless. Our guide was incredibly patient and allowed us to all move at our admittedly slowish pace. Every single one of us had a blast. This was such a great way to see more of the beautiful Cambodian countryside and its super friendly people in a relatively short amount of time. None of us had ever been on an ATV before, but found them quite easy to handle. On our tour, we saw cows, chickens, ducks, water buffalos, village children chasing frogs, tons of rice paddies and we even stopped at a lovely temple for some photos and a break. I highly recommend this tour as a way to see more of the \"real\" Cambodia. It was also a nice break from the temples, which are gorgeous but can get exhausting for kids."

It is pretty easy to learn especially since all of us have driving (car) experience. Our guides Visal and Saren were excellent. Before we rode through deeper puddle of water, they even took the time to show us how to go through it and helped us to take photos. As fun as the ATV is, the most unique experience is the beautiful and peaceful countryside. City dwellers like us got a glimpse of the simplicity and slow paced lives of the villagers. On the verge of sounding philosophical, it really made me think of how materialistic and self centred our city lives can be. It was a real eye opener to see the homes of the villagers, their farm animals (water buffalos, cows, dogs, cats, ducks, chicken), the vast green rice fields against the clear blue skies. We took the discovery tour and rode the ATV for about 2 hours. Made a stop at some village and bought sweets to give out to the adorable kids along the way. Would advise everyone else to bring sweets along to see the joyous smiles of these children. Our ATV guide also mentioned that we can bring along children's clothes which your kids have outgrown to give out to the villagers.Would definitely recommend this ATV company and tour to anyone going to Siem Reap. In fact, it should be a must! Would probably go for a full day tour if I go back again."

It was such a wonderful way to see what goes on beyond the city and how the locals really live. You navigate around potholes, buffalos, kids from local villages and whatever crosses your path.

He did the same thing with the cows on the side of the road to scare them and make them run. My friend Michelle and I did NOT like this. Can't we just drive the ATV and enjoy the sunset and countryside with out scaring poor dogs and thin cows? "

They had a free tuk tuk pick up and drop off to and from your hotel, so that scored bonus points (Tuk tuks cost US$3-$5 per trip in Siem Reap). Plus, cold water & cold towels were provided at the end of your sweaty ride.We chose the sunset tour that started at 4.30pm. And we were blessed to have such a charming young man by the name of So as our tour leader. He brought us around the paddy fields and we saw grey buffaloes, white cows and adorable happy children waving as we zoomed past. The sunset was breathtaking, and to put icing on the cake, there was a pretty rainbow just before we left. Even though it started raining on our way back, I couldn't be any happier and blessed to have tried this & given the chance to chat with So. You honestly don't need any driving or riding skills prior to this. The quad is easy to maneuver with only 2 handles - right for accelerate, left for brake. You've got to try it. The bumpy muddy fields, the crazy anything-goes traffic, and of course, the kinda sights you'll remember for life. Ask for So! He speaks really good English, and is a really funny charming chap!"

Safety is quite important at the quad bike centre so we each had to take a lap around the place with a tour guide behind us to assess our level in driving a quad bike. If we seemed capable of handling a quad bike we can ride alone, otherwise we would have to pair up with a friend or have a guide behind us through out the adventure. Safety first..a great idea!The quad bikes were in very good condition. We drove along siem reap's rural area and countryside for the sunset. What a view! The adventure and view were unforgettable.We couldn't roam around on our own, which was understandable, but the track we drove through made up for that! Definitely a highlight of out trip.

They make sure you are capable of operating the quad bike safely before letting you out on the road and their guides are well trained and very helpful. My concern with this tour is the environmental and local impact that it is having. We opted for the sunset tour, assuming that we would ride to the outskirts of the city and then get to zoom around in a specially constructed track or paddock as the sun set over Siem Reap. Instead, the tour takes in the narrow paths of the surrounding villages. The landscape is simply beautiful and of course the quads are a lot of fun, but driving noisily through small villages past people's homes felt very invasive and inappropriate. I asked our guide if the locals mind the tours and he admitted that a lot of them don't like it - I can understand why! These villages are quiet and peaceful, with children playing on the roads and animals wandering by... it is very invasive for extremely loud, big quad bikes to be destroying this serenity. I also think it is quite dangerous for the local children - they should be able to play on their streets without fearing that foreigners on quad bikes are going to come racing through. My recommendation would be to instead make the tours away from people homes and in big paddocks for speeding around on the quad bikes instead."

We were assigned a guide who was also game in taking pictures and would goad us to maximize our ATVs by speeding, which we really liked. We passed by Cambodian kids who were very friendly and would wave everytime. We also stopped by some and they asked for money. Gave them a few and you could see the priceless smiles on their faces. It was a great experience! Before sunset, we went to this place which had the best location for dusk.. And it was awesome. After the ride, we were given cold towels to cool us down and wipe hands and faces which have been dirtied by dust along the way.

As I have a driving license and have played the ATV a few times, he saw that I was okay with the ride when we practised, hence I could handle the ATV on my own and had my friend as my passenger. My other friend didn't have a license but wanted to drive his own one, hence Sophy sat behind him as his passenger. Sophy brought us to the village part of the beautiful Siem Reap and that's where we see cute innocent kids who were so enthusiastic seeing us. It was also an experience to see for ourselves the living conditions of the Cambodian villagers. Saw many cows along the way as well. I would definitely recommend the sunset tour as the 1.5hour ride is more than enough to experience the village life (plus 1,5 hour has drained quite a bit of my energy).

We were picked up from our hotel at the appointed time (4:30pm) and they took us at their head office which was about 5-10 minutes away.Since there were 6 of us, we initially reserved for 3 Quads thinking that we could share. However, after a short test ride, the owner decided that we needed one guide for each person. 3 of us couldn't drive but still wanted to tour the countryside and be with our friends. We asked the owner if we could have a staff, instead, drive for those who couldn't. Even though he obviously thought it was funny (to pay to ride a quad but not drive it), the owner agreed and even gave us a good deal. The guides were very considerate. They even stopped at a temple when one of my friends expressed interest. The path going to the rice fields were a bit bumpy but very interesting. We thought we were too late to see the sunset but we just arrived as the sun was setting. The scenery was very peaceful and we had a blast taking pictures. The guides were very much willing to take our pictures and even suggested different poses. It was a bit dangerous going back to their office because the road going back was not that wide and did not have much light. One of the drivers was a bit fast and overtook some of the Quads but it was all in good fun. After the ride, we were given cold bottles of water and cold face towel before they took us back to the hotel at about 6:30pm.I like the fact that it was a private tour with only our group, enough staff was provided to guide us (6 for 6), we took a different route from the other group, we were not hurried and they allowed us enough time to take in the scenery. Some suggestions to make the experience better: have cold water bottles available during the tour (by the time we were at the rice fields, we were very thirsty but we couldn't find a store to buy drinks), provide a group souvenir photo and/or option for a helmet camera.Even though the experience was a bit pricey ($30/person) I believe it was worth it. Special mention to \"Dan\" (or was it \"Den\") who was one of the tour guide and the person who fetched us from the hotel - very friendly, always smiling, and nice guy. To the rest of the guides, a big thank you from the girls from the Philippines :)"

One was upfront to make sure we didn't go too fast. One was back and forth all the time on his motorbike to check on us. After a while we were pretty spread out - about 8 of us went. I stopped to take a picture of a water buffalo and within a couple of minutes, one of the guys was riding back to make sure I was ok. I wondered why they put our shoes in plastic bags - well I found out! There was mud and I loved it. I laughed so much my cheeks were sore. I thoroughly recommend this activity."

We requested an earlier start than normal to try and avoid the heat of the midday sun which they duly obliged - however it was still super hot so plenty of sun cream and water are essential as shade is limited.I was a little concerned taking the children (2YO & 4YO) however they had all the equipment required to make them safe, and they rode tandem with me, one in-front, one behind. Safety instruction was very thorough even investing more time with my wife to ensure she was comfortable before the tour started.The easy tour took a couple of hours (23km) and took us across the country and farmland of Cambodia. The only word of caution I would have is that the tour does take you on the public roads so for individual riders it is essential they are sober and also better that they have a driving licence and be comfortable with navigating the roads and traffic otherwise this may be a bit daunting / dangerous.On our return we were treated to some ice cold water and then transferred back to the hotel via Tuk Tuk (Collection and pick up were included in the price). We would definitely do again, but probably try and pick a less sunny or even a rainy day.... you can see the route we took below.http://connect.garmin.com/activity/572211868"

Mr Herve nicole replied promptly and confirmed our reservations. We took the sunset tour which is approximately one hour. Had such a lovely time. I was scared at first. And our tour leader is MR Niko. He guided me throughout the whole journey in the paddy fields. My fiance rode the ATV like an expert even without license and it was his first time. It was fast and i can feel the adrenaline rush. I highly recommend this company as they are friendly and polite. Provided us with facemasks and helmets. At the end we were given cold drinks and cold towels to wipe out face. Though it was very dusty and misty, fiance and me enjoyed every second of it. And for those who loves natures and taking pictures, you can capture the best sunset moments. There were also many cows and buffalos along the way. I love the Atv ride especially with our tour leader MR niko."

This tour is a must-do for all travellers who want to see the lives in Siem Reap!We booked our tour a week in advance to our trip, Souphea, the secretary is very helpful and extremely efficient. She sent us reminders on weather and what to wear a few days in advance so we could pack the right clothes.We had Pou as our tour guide, he is very funny, very nice and very patient (I was a little scared since this was my first time). He showed us the most beautiful parts of the village - rice paddy, local villages, Old town and a temple which had an even longer history than Angkor Wat.He also took many pictures for us, some funny ones and some very pretty ones.This tour is suitable for families, couples and big groups of friends.Since you can control your own speed and a tour guide can come with in the same bike, and there are not many people and animals walking around, this is a safe and fun experience for every travellers.My advice - wear the masks they provide to you!Some parts of the road are a little sandy ;)And wear your sunscreen!! It is so breezy all the way that you won't feel hot at all, but you do get burnt from the sun so don't forget!Happy bike ride! x"

By 0725 we had been \"trained\" and we were on our way. 2 quads each with one adult and one child (we have two boys aged 8 and 11). We opted for the \"Discovery\" package which was perfect. Within minutes we were experiencing rice fields and local rural Cambodia life. It was just us (Piseth was on a trial bike) in the trip. The quads are in great condition working well. Also not too noisy which is important when passing through the local villages. We stopped at various times to take pictures, see a small temple, crocodile farm (not for the faint hearted - the animals do not have much of a life and this part could have been happily missed)We met wonderful local happy children who were just happy to wave, slap hands and say hello (no begging whatsoever). I wish we had taken a big bag of sweets which I am sure they would have appreciated. Piseth was very knowledgable about the local area and very pleasant. I must say that, at our own risk and responsibility, we put our two boys in the front and they did most of the driving which they really loved. I should point out that the company did not promote this in any way and this was our choice/risk. To be honest, when sitting behind your child with hands available to take over at any second, it was no issue. All in all a great morning and a memorable part of our Asia adventure that will not be forgotten!Thank you Piseth!(Wear long trousers and trainers and expect to get some mud on you - no big deal. They offered plastic bags to wear over our shoes but we decided we looked too daft!)"

I went for the sunset tour with three other friends. 3 of us were first timers so we were recommended to have instructors with us, while 1 rode the ATV on his own. To be honest, I think having an instructor along was better (putting pride aside since you have this short \"training and test\" to see if you're capable to be alone) because they would explain to you certain \"attractions\", random Cambodian culture, tourist tips etc. Furthermore, having the instructor doesn't restrict you from going faster (just less recklessly of course) and the added bonus is that it doesn't cost a single cent!The experience was good too, because otherwise, I wouldn't have seen the countryside at all. They also brought us to a temple at the outskirts which was photo worthy, and the photos at the rice fields were breathtaking. The instructors were also very patient with us when we took our time to take photos/videos, and even helped us too :)It is definitely worth the money. Plus they include pick up and drop off at hotels/guesthouses, and at the end, they even gave us a refreshing cold bottle of mineral water and a cold towel :) Really good experience!!"

We figured a quad tour of the countryside might end up being just a joy ride (which would have been ok) but it turned out to be that and much more. We had two quads for the four of us (two adults and two college age children). The kids took one and we took the other and off we went - just us and our guide Den - who led us on his motorbike. What a blast! Den was great as he guided us through village after village and took us to an 8th century temple overgrown and ruined. Children everywhere, with big smiles just from the sheer fun of hanging with us and giving us five, or a fist bump. He modified the tour according to our likes (no tourists - no other quad groups - and time for pictures). When another group of riders came along, he immediately took a different path and we never saw another group for the rest of the morning. Four hours, which ended up being closer to five, was just the right time on the quads and it gave us a glimpse of local life far removed from the crowds. Quad Adventure Cambodia does it right, and I recommend this activity, especially if your kids (or the kid in you) needs a break from visiting temple after temple. One tip, we stopped at a local shop along the way and bought bags of candy to give out to the children we met. Cost a couple of dollars, made them so excited, and avoided the dilemma of wanting to give all of them something, but hating to make them run to see you for the possibility of some pocket change."

We went through little dirt roads amid the fields and rural settings just outside Siem Reap.

Taking in a Buddhist temple we went through small villages filled with waving children and negotiated herds of cows and water buffalo! On the day the sun was not cooperative but we still managed some great photos of the rice fields at dusk with the light on the water.

Your shoes and lower legs will get very VERY muddy. Also don't wear light clothes since the mud stains a bit. Our guide Vilay was excellent and attentive, and spoke great English! We especially appreciated it when he answered all of our questions about culture and Cambodian government!"

It was a private one too and we got to ride through the beautiful villages, through mud and water. Our tour leaders Niko and Vilay were fantastic they took photos for us throughout the day and were very friendly and helpful. Really recommend this."

The sunset scenery across the paddy fields with mirrored view from the river and water puddles was unforgettable. And of course, not forgetting how fun the ride was! The journey across Khmer villages and having had the chance to witness the simple and happy lives of the people, the beautiful flora and fauna, giving way to the big gentle, shy and cute buffalo's is not an experience to be missed when one visits Cambodia.Thank you for the providing such rides that allow visitors from around the world to embed one of the greatest and most valuable/euphoric experiences in their memories. We will never forget that amazing moment!Readers, if you think I am exaggerating you can check out the pictures of my Quad Ride journey on their facebook page (pictures uploaded by Sean):http://www.facebook.com/home.php?#!/pages/Siem-Reap-Cambodia/Quad-Adventure-Cambodia/34745610954**Disclaimer: With all that said, you should be aware that if the evening is rainy or cloudy you may not be able to see the beautiful sunset like I saw.

While the others in my family were experienced quad operators, I had never driven one before; but these are automatic and they practically drive themselves; you simply have to pay attention. I was shown how to operate it whilst still at the \"garage,\" then a guide rode with me as I took a test drive around the block. I was deemed a sufficiently good driver, so away we went. Den and Koay took us through some villages, to a pagoda where we fed the catfish, to the ruins of some of the Khmer empire's ancient capitals--and through miles of rice paddies for lots of bumping, bouncing and splashing (it was rainy season). Children would wave to us as we zoomed past; and we got close enough to cattle and water buffalo to get them excited too. We were picked up right on time at our hotel, and, save a short break for a drink and to feed the catfish, we were riding the whole time. This trip was truly the adventure promised. The quads are well-maintained and everyone gets a helmet to wear, so safety is provided for. I cannot say enough good things about this experience. I am absolutely certain we will book again when we are next in Siem Reap--perhaps a day-long adventure next time!"

Yep no problem and our friendly guide Psy picked us up just before 1pm. I found this company to be professional and safe. They provided us with plastic bags for our shoes (you'll want those) to protect them from the mud and water. They also give you a safety brief and get you to practice on the quad bike around the bike to make sure you can handle it. As long as you're sensible they are safe to use. We did the 2.5 trail for $60 US p.p and found that was perfect. Psy took us through the countryside, a lovely temple and we even got to go through large puddles (safely of course)! It is a very nice way to do something else besides temple hopping and a great way to see the real side of Siem Reap."

The instructors didn't hesitate to step in when we were tired, or if a dangerous stretch of road was coming up, which was great as we had just gotten off a plane and our reflexes were not at our best.

Taking the 'easy ride' option suited us as were were total novices. We were picked up from our hotel via tuk tuk and taken to the quad bike base, given a safety briefing and were then escorted by a guide on a motorbike who took our safety seriously, especially when on the town roads for the first 5 minutes or so of the trip. We felt safe at all times. Upon return you are greeted with cold towels and water before being returned to our hotel.Now to the ride:This 'easy ride' option allowed us to take in the country side around Siem Reap. We got to drive along dirt roads through farming villages and along tracks weaving amongst rice fields. We got to see rice being sowed, dried, harvested and bagged as we drove along as well as passing picture postcard scenes of water buffalo in rice paddies as well as any number of other farm animals and activities. A stop at a pagoda is included. However, nothing beats the simply stunning expanse of the Cambodian countryside. I can't imagine it possible to see it any other way than on a quad bike tour like this. The guide will stop whenever you do such as pausing to take photos. He will take some of you on your bikes as well. I indicated I wanted to see water buffalo and he took a route that had some. So don't be afraid to make a special request. The tour was 1 hr and 30 minutes on paper but we got closer to 2 hrs.To consider: check with your travel insurance provider to make sure you are covered for injury on a quad-bike. As soon as I told mine that it was a guided tour it did not seem to be an issue. Injury is covered but not damage to equipment.All up, this is the coolest thing I have ever done in all my travels through Asia. I cannot think of a better way to get out and see the local countryside in a few hours."

The first thing to say about this company is that you feel completely safe at all times. We had two excellent guides for the three of us, Phy and Den, and they guided us safely through the traffic, before taking us out across the fields into rural Siem Reap. The ride was amazing; we drove past paddy fields and grazing water buffalo, and then on through tiny rural villages, passing grinning children, simple huts, and lots of things balanced on bikes, including mewling infants and a large basket of piglets, which was crazy. It is really impossible to describe just how affecting it is to experience a small snapshot of rural Cambodia, but I would urge you to do it, and to use Quad Adventure Cambodia as your guides. They looked after us amazingly well, taking photos and video of us driving past, and stopping with us if we needed to take photos ourselves.My daughters both had a profoundly affecting journey, as did I, and it will undoubtedly be the highlight of our trip.

We booked this tour several weeks in advance and received an immediate email to confirm and a request to let them know when we had a hotel booked so that they could pick us up (I emailed this information at a later date). We were picked up on time and taken by tuk-tuk to the company location, where we each had a quick 'test' of our ability to safely drive the four-wheelers (I went with a friend, and we're both relatively fit and in our early 30s). Once we had passed, we set off for the half-day tour: rice paddies and local farms, countryside villages, newer Buddhist temples, and several of the temples (including a very remote one) in the Roluos Group (we were very glad that we had taken our three-day temple passes with us!). We did stop at one point to get drinks and fruit smoothies from a roadside stand in a small village. About an hour from the end of our tour, it started absolutely pouring, but the guide had a waterproof bag for our cameras and phones. So we took off through pouring rain, driving through enormous puddles! I can see how some people might not like this, but we thoroughly enjoyed the adventure and the opportunity to wave to other people on the dirt roads who were similarly drenched. I'm no expert on four-wheeling, but I felt very safe the entire time. Beautiful sights and an amazing opportunity to see things outside of the typical tourist circuit."

We originally booked a sunset ATV ride through the rice paddies but unfortantely it was downpouring so we called Quad Adventure Tours 15 minutes before they were suppose to pick us up to reschedule and they were very nice about it and booked us for the following morning. We were picked up at our hotel then driven to Quad Adventures, ended up just being a private tour for my friend and myself. They made sure that we felt comfortable driving the ATV's and then we were off. Our guide was fabulous and so friendly! It was amazing to see the country side and how people lived. It was absolutely beautiful! Glad we choose to start the tour at 8am because it was hot! This is a must do for anyone who visits beautiful Siem Reap! Everyone that I dealt with was so nice and professional! Can't wait to go back again."

I love quads and other mechanised vehicles like Skidoos etc., I've ridden bikes etc in many country's and surroundings.Our trip was on par with the best of these.Pickup from our hostel was on time, it was our instructor that picked us up.My girlfriend hadn't driven one before, so the instructor spent much more time with her getting her comfortable with the bike, perfect. Plus it was just us on the trip.We booked the 2 hour trip. This was fantastic. At the start the instructor asked us if we would like to stop at various places along the route. We said yes to all of them as we wanted to look at Cambodia outside of the Siem Reap. We travelled along many different types of terrain, and down various sizes of roads stopping at various places. The trip ended up being around 3 hours, rather than 2, as it was 2 hours on the bike itself. The instructor didn't seem fazed by this and was in no hurry at the stop points etc.They dropped us off at the hostel afterwards also.Fantastic trip out for both of us and my girlfriend is very enthusiastic about driving quads again."

As we wanted to take a lot of photos, we had one large quad bike between the two of us. It was such a great way to see the countryside and the tour took us through small villages, a temple site and typical Cambodian countryside. The highlight was watching the sunset on the Rice fields. The tour guide was informative and spoke good English. We were picked up by tuk tuk from our hotel on time, went to the headquarters to get an instruction on how to ride the bike, get fitted with helmets and masks (for the dusty roads) and were given water. Well worth it. It became one of our fondest memories of Siem rIEP"

The company is very efficient to deal with, answering emails promptly and nothing is too much trouble. I realised I emailed to book for the Tuesday, but wrote down the Monday on my calendar and booked something else for the Tuesday. I realised this the Sunday night prior to the Monday and emailed Nicole who promptly replied and it was not a problem. We were promptly picked up from our hotel at 1pm and taken to the Quad bike centre.We were given an explanation of the bikes and then taken for a test drive, ensuring we were comfortable and that we were confident to drive one on our own. We then paid for our tour, were fitted with a helmet and dust mask and off we went. What a wonderful experience we were gone for nearly 3 hours, but it went so very quickly. One of the highlights for me was to stop in a local village for a drink and to be swamped by the children there. I am a photographer and revelled in the moment of taking the children's photos and seeing them smile as I showed them the back of the camera. I'm sure this held us up a bit time wise, but Den our guide was not phased at all and happily waited. Other highlights were stopping at a temple, feeding the cat fish and then at the ruins of an old temple.It was very dry and dusty driving, but lots of fun. Den was so very careful on the paths he took and was always checking to make sure we were closely following.At the end of the tour there were cold wet towels waiting for us which were wonderful and a cold bottle of water. We were then farewelled and Den drove us back to our hotel. We asked to stop at a convenience store on the way back for a few supplies, well beer, he did this without a worry, waited for us and then dropped us to our hotel.When researching this tour we went off the recommendation of friends along with reviews on Trip Advisor and their customer service. We wouldn't hesitate to recommend this tour company it was an amazing experience one we all enjoyed very much."

We also arrived early, so he took us out earlier on a longer more scenic route. We could tell because the paths were not well-ridden and covered in grass. The day was also extremely beautiful and the sunset made up for our mediocre sunrise at the temples the prior day. It was a great experience seeing what's outside of town!

It was a little awkward. The other guy was real pissed off actually. But anyway, I went with this one cause that's the one I wanted in the first place. My guide was Niko and he was amazing :D. He was super helpful with everything. He also talks a lot haha. Just ask him anything and he'll tell you. I went to this alone so it was awesome to have someone to talk to. Ps it was private!! Each group got their own private guide!! He also bought me water when he realized the bottle that I had with me had turned hot from the heat of the engine. He also got some village children to take a picture with me. He was so great, I'm so glad I had him for my guide. As for the rest of the company, they were all super nice!

The first hour or so of the ride basically takes you through back streets of rural/suburban Siem Reap. Some of the places you ride through are pretty bleak looking. Then as sunset approaches, don't be afraid to stop your ATV frequently and snap a bunch of pictures of the sunset. By that point, you will be in a much more rural area where rice fields will stretch as far as you can see.I give this place 5 stars for several reasons: the last 20 minutes or so of the ATV ride (the first hour or so is pretty average, to be honest), the cost ($30 - pretty cheap), and the friendly nature of all the guys who work there."

They are reliable - we did not need to reconfirm booking even if we emailed them about 3 weeks before. After prompt pick up from hotel, you are briefed and taken for a test drive upon arrival. Even if I said yes when they asked me if I drive back home, one of the staff took me for a longer test drive than my husband. The area we tested were different terrains and I practiced going a bit uphill, downhill, side to side. This shows they are definitely after your safety and are making sure you are capable of driving on your own. And it was good for me because I was able to gauge the speed I was comfortable with in controlling the ATV. I rode alone while our 13 year old rode with my husband. Helmets and masks our provided. Water and cold towels are provided after the tour. We had the best time the next 2.5 hours! Our friendly guide Koay took pictures of us when we would stop for photo ops. Before crossing intersections or making turns, he made sure we were safely behind him. You have to press a lever with your right finger/thumb to control the speed so be warned that your thumb will hurt during and after! Although we had so much fun, good we only booked the Discovery tour because I don't think our thumbs would have lasted another 2 hours that day. If we had more time, we would have booked for another day. Follow their advice of wearing long pants and closed shoes to make sure to be protected from heat and dust, and wear lots of sun screen. We were covered with red dust, and my wrists were sun burned after the trip. Highly recommended!"

We rode all the way through the fishing village at Tonle Sap Lake and through so many other villages and country side. We have no idea how the guides new all these roads. At times, we were making our own trails through wide open fields. Our next trip will include a full day on these bikes. The owner, Nicole, is so helpful and friendly.

We each rode our own ATV, and it was a fun and safe experience. Such an amazing experience seeing how the true Cambodians live. The tour took us through the countryside, villages, and even a real outdoor market (in which we were the only foreigners). We loved the little kids who came up to greet us, but were saddened we didn't know (until the end of the tour) that the kids were likely hoping to get some candy from us! So we suggest to future couples doing this tour - fill your pockets with candies to hand out to the children! Also - we were told the market isn't usually open during the day, if we hadn't had the market, i think the half day tour would have been a bit much, so we suggest taking the shorter tour (2.5 hours i believe)."

My husband and I wanted to do something fun that wouldn't take all day. I e-mailed this company in the morning and got a response that we would be picked up this same morning for the Easy Ride tour. We were picked up by Phy in a tuk tuk and taken to the office. We were given instructions as to how to operate the quad bikes. Our tour will cover 21 kms and last around 1 1/2 hrs. Cost was $35 per person and we each had our own bike. I was nervous so for the first 5 minutes Phy drove the bike with me sitting behind. Then we switched and I drove! We passed small villages,seeing rice fields, animals, a local temple. My first time off roading and I had the time of my life! Next time I'll take one of the longer tours!"

It was really an amazing experience, especially seeing the children of Siem Reap come out of their homes and wave to us as we passed. This made us feel most welcomed. Our tour leader gave us more than sufficient time on the quads. We wore masks to protect us from the dust, and they were definitely needed. We went fast at times, and Hong allowed it once we kept within safety parameters. It was frekinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn awesome! At the end of the tour, we got a nicely chilled and much needed bottles of water and hand towel to cool down. Then Hong took us back directly to our hotel. The staff was most welcoming, knowledgeable and kind, focusing on safety most of all. This experience provided a rush for two adventurous West Indians. It was EPIC! I would undoubtedly recommend this experience to anyone. (note of advice- try not to wear white, by the end of the tour, it\u2019ll be brown.)Do it! Do it! Do it!"

Had the pleasure of doing the Discovery Tour for 2 hours with my brother-in-law and my nine year-old niece.Picked up from the hotel on time via tuk tuk with a smile by our guide \"Not\" and enjoyed a short ride to the quad bike facility. This being my first time actually riding a quad bike as an adult I was a little apprehensive, but after the quick test drive around the block, it's as simple as driving anything. They provide a thorough explanation beforehand and the vehicle is manual so it's very easy to drive.We went into the countryside and stopped to take some pictures. I was told that if I wanted to take pictures to just stop whenever and do so, which I did a lot of and Not was very delightful and patient about it. After our pictures in the field, our guide gave us the option of staying in the countryside or going through the villages. I had read other posts about buying candy and giving it to the kids, so we opted for doing that. We stopped at a market on the way and we each bought 3 bags of suckers at $2 each (pricey) for the kids. It's completely up to you if you want to buy and give candy away. At first, I was giving handfuls away, but that quickly stopped as I realized how fast my stash was depleting. Once the kids realize that you are giving candy away, they come running from every direction. I was giving candy to everyone, not just the kids. Not offered to take some pictures of us handing out the candy and i was also able to get a group photo with some children along the way. I received quite a few smiles from the adults as they were surprised by the gesture. I ended up stopping and buying more from a village store. They were quite surprised as I jumped off my quad and entered their store searching for candy and snacks. Not came back looking for me as I was ransacking the village store. I bought as much as I could for $3 and we continued, but of course, I ran out again. That made it difficult as kids were waving to us passing by but I didn't have anymore to handout. My recommendation if you're planning on buying candy and giving it out, buy more than you think is enough(6-8 bags) and try to have a few left by the end of your trip. You'll see kids the entire trip, so you will have more than enough chances to get rid of the leftovers.As the trip progressed and Not saw that I was becoming more comfortable with the quad, he increased the speed, which gave me a whole other element of excitement. My brother-in-law was driving my niece so we occasionally had to stop and wait for them, but they both were enjoying it as much as I was. We stopped at a local place to get a cold drink and just relax for a moment and this is where we had the chance to actually learn more about Cambodia and our guide named Not. It was great being able to ask questions that you may never get to ask in any other situation. I really enjoyed learning about his life in Cambodia. By the time we returned, I couldn't believe how the time flew by. All three of us didn't want the experience to end. Fantastic experience. Next time I will do the all day adventure!Thanks, Not and the owners for the great experience!"

If you've never ridden Quads before, they're very stable and easy to drive. Whether you want to take it easy or fly down trails, both can be provided for. I grew up riding Quads and was worried that the guide would want to go slow, be safe, etc. I was very wrong. He gauged my aptitude for riding and adjusted accordingly. We passed rice paddies, water buffalo, small villages, and elevated houses that stand 40 feet in the air to compensate for the Tonle Sap, which greatly expands during the rainy season. This was a great, safe experience, and I only recommend bringing sunscreen. My forearms were about 3 shades darker after we finished. Thanks again to Vilay; such a personable, nice guy. He has a remarkable life story, so ask him about it if you have a chance! Only minor linguistic barriers when speaking English, nothing at all to be worried about."

After the instructions the guide took off on a motorbike and we followed him (one quad for two people). We got a private guide, they are not bunching people in groups.The route took us around Siem through small villages, rice fields and a beautiful budhist temple. We saw beautiful countryside and really enjoyed our ride that lasted almost two hours. Guide spoke pretty good English and explained everything we asked about the area. After finishing the ride he took us back to the hotel. We really enjoyed the ride and suggest it as a great way to experience the area around Siem Reap."

Staff were really informative and friendly and made us feel at ease as we both had never been quad biking. We went through villages and rice fields and our guide Phy made sure he gave us plenty of options for places to visit. We stopped for drinks a few times and given plenty of information about life in Cambodia through Phy. Bikes were easy to use and in very good condition. When driving back we took a different route and as we both felt more confident on the quad bikes Phy made sure our journey back was even more fun, plenty of puddle splashing and bumps. Cold towels and water on return which was much appreciated. As you can see in the photo you get very very dusty. This is half the fun and I would recommend wearing clothes you don't mind getting dirty. We did this tour in the afternoon so it was very hot and we had to keep applying suncream but I wore loose trousers and a short sleeve shirt and was fine. My husband wore shorts and a t shirt and he seemed fine as well. Good, covered shoes are useful aswell. Overall an amazing time and a great break from all the temples! I wish we had take small wrapped sweets for all the children who came out to see us. Something to think about for future visits."

He offered to take us to a floating village for an additional $6 each. This cost covered our entrance fees to the village.

We bought some notebooks and pencils from a woman and gave them to the kids. They were very appreciative and we left feeling really good. It was my first time on a quad and it was extremely easy to drive. These bikes also can go really fast! If you want to do the four hour tour, I suggest you go ahead and book it now! Don't let the price scare you. It was worth every penny. The things you see are priceless and will stay with your for a lifetime.

First time I visited Siem Reap (a few years ago) I did a half day ATV tour with Quad Adventure, and this time myself and two friends had time to do the adventure. Herve and his guides did a fantastic job the first time and did not fail this time either - it all was perfect.Since my first visit, I think the ATV (quad) bikes have been upgrade??? anyway, they have a small well maintained fleet of automatic Polaris'. (Tip...good idea to wear long pants as the heat from the engine emits right next to where your legs rest. I found it mildly discomforting, at times, but the two girls had issues and at times had to ride with their legs up!?!?!)The bikes are very stable and really easy to ride, and the guides only take you as fast as the slowest rider and they determine where the group goes basing it on rider capabilities. We had a private afternoon tour (other options available) and enjoyed the relaxed pace, visiting many villages, temples and an obscure ruin (not usually on the Angkor tour trail). We commenced our journey just after 1:00pm (after a free tuk-tuk collection from our hotel - Pavilion D'Orient Hotel) and spent the rest of the afternoon out amongst the rural areas of Siem Reap returning to the home base around 6:00pm. Very, dirty and dusty, but we all thoroughly enjoyed the afternoon ride. We were gven a free gift (small bottle of Khmer rum in a nice box) and a tuk-tuk ride back to the hotel.As per my first review, this is an excellent experience and adventure to undertake whilst in Siem Reap. A good break from the temples of Angkor Wat, and a lovely way to see rural Siem Reap - and always the eager \"hello's\" from all the children along the way. Highly recommended to most age groups and even novices (maybe a small lesson to start with)."

Our tour leaders Piseth and Davy were excellent throughout, arriving early at the hotel and taking the time to call up to our room to check we were ready to go. Davy drove us to the starting point on his tuk-tuk while Piseth sat with us and explained the schedule of the tour and talked to us about our stay in Cambodia. On arrival I was shown how to drive the quad (very easy - Piseth was very careful not to over-complicate anything) and then taken on a test drive, with Piseth sat behind me on the quad to direct me. Only once this test drive was complete we were asked to make payment and sign liability forms, which I think is very fair and reassuring! The quad was of a good size and quality, with plenty of room for two people, the passenger can either hold on to the driver, or several over hand holds, making for a comfy ride. The route was well-chosen, taking us away from the town and out through fields and farmland. Piseth and Davy rode ahead on a dirt bike, one riding and the other spotting for us, so that we kept a good distance. Even on a relatively short ride there were plenty of changes of scenery, Piseth was knowledgable about the countryside and it's people, introducing us to so of the Cambodian way of life. We also stopped off at a beautiful temple at the centre of a village. We were impressed by the speed and grip of the quad, which was very fast on the smoother tracks, and equally strong on the bumpy sections of the route.All in all, we would certainly use Quad Adventure Cambodia again on our return to Siem Reap."

We felt safe and the quads were easy to ride, no gears to shift, reminded me of the quads and snowmobiles we have ridden in the US. We saw herds of water buffalo crossing the paths and roads in front of us, local farmers, villages, children and we stopped at a small school. We brought school supplies and clothing for the kids, all of which were eagerly and happily accepted. The schools can use more supplies: pencils, paper, colored pencils, crayons, maps of both the world and Cambodia, glue sticks.....pretty much anything you can think of for elementary students. It is dusty, but they provide masks, helmets eye shields. We also wore sunglasses, pants and close toed sandals. It was really fun and we will do it again. It might be a long ride for passengers.

Me and my boyfriend joined the \"easy ride\" trip and had amazing fun (we found out later that they actually took us to the adventure trip, since they saw we could manage). Everything went smooth, we were picked up at the hotel, we showed how to use the quad with a little test drive and started off - we went outside of the city, went through rice fields, met cheering children on the way saw the astonishing fields. I can only recommend it. We took the 4pm tour, the weather was still very hot, but OK."

As I was alone i got picked up with a dirtbike, what was quite fun.We got a little instruction to the quads, did a little testdrive with one of the instructors and than started the tour.There were two other guys so it was a small group. I was the last in line so had a little space to speed sometimes. The tour led out of town, than to some small ways across the ricefields. Stopped for the sunset, took some pictures and drove back on dirtroads and some paved streets. The locals on the countryside are extremely friendly and are so happy to see people on the quads. Everybody is waving and smiling. All in all a very good experience! - Basically a must do in Siem Reap!"

Pros- It was great to be going top speed as it was just me and the tour guide on his dirt bike - Got to visit Bakong Temple - Beer in the jungle village -Friendly kids along the wayCons (none of which fault of the tour company)  - My choice of 1pm was too hot-would recommend morning or sunset ride -I went in dry season-would have been nice to spash through a few more riversI was lucky enough to have the chance to go quad biking in Siem Reap on a recent stay. It was a great experience and very well planned and organised by Quad Adventure Cambodia. I would highly recommend others using this company. Their guide arrived punctually at my hotel and took me off to start my adventure. I selected the 'Discovery Tour' for $60 but was reduced to $54 given their promotion. This package granted me almost 2.5 hours of trail blazing. I did the 1pm start (i wouldn't recommend this as with the heat of the day I got pretty sunburned (im a pasty guy from Ireland) We blazed through rice paddies, stopped for a beer at a local village then continued on through jungle villages. It was great to see all the local kids saying hello (i would recommend bringing a bag of candy to throw to the kids of you feel inclined) A highlight of the trip was making it to Bakong Temple. I had yet to be to Angkor Wat at the time so a glimpse at the temples were great. My tour guide was friendly, it might have been better if he gave me some more information about the places we stopped but it was ll part of the adventure. After nearly 2.5 hours I was glad to be off the quad but it was a great trip."

But you get some basic tuition before you start and its actually very simple. Pushbike style brake operated by your left hand, thumb operated accelerator with right hand. Steer, and go. Our dry season tour was on dirt roads through rice paddy and all the way down to the village on stilts as the lake was so low. The only things you could possibly collide with are a lazy sleeping dog or a cow wandering up the track. A great way to see the countryside, far from the madding crowds of the temples. Our guide (who rides ahead on a dirt bike) was great, always warning us of potential hazards on the roads/traffic, and a good source of knowledge about the land and the people. Very glad I took the plunge."

The guide was at my hotel right on time and took me by tuk tuk to the business office of Quad Adventure, where we went through safety procedures and helmet fitting and such. Then we were off for the 4-hour ride. It was just the guide and me - I thought I'd be with a group but had a private tour. He took me down dirt roads, down cattle paths, across fields, through villages where excited children came running to wave to us or slap our hands as we rode by. I saw a modern Buddhist temple and cemetery, and a very small ancient temple off the beaten path. It was a great way to see the Cambodian countryside and the homes and shops of the villages, which I would have missed if I had just toured the temples. $100USD for 4 hours still seems a little expensive to me, but I did it anyway because how often am I going to visit Siem Reap? I would recommend this tour. Prepare to get really dirty just from the dust! And bring a bandana for your face, and sunglasses."

Our guide Phy is friendly and funny, asked for our preferences, and kept a watchful eye as we trailed his motorcycle.

Pee was our guide and he was fantastic. He spoke great English and was very patient to allow us to stop whenever we would like to take pictures. He took us to a few specific great photo opportunities.It was great because 3 couples showed up for the 7:30 am adventure tour, but they divided us up so each couple had their own guide so no one held anyone else up and we had our own private tour. Each guide took a slightly different route, too, so you weren't all stopping to get the same photos at the same time.My husband and I loved all the amazing landscape and the people, especially the children running to the road to wave were a highlight. We wouldn't have seen much of true life if we hadn't taken this tour. We will be doing this again if we're fortunate enough to return to Siem Reap.Oh, I had never driven a quad and it was incredibly easy to handle and I never felt uncomfortable.

I recommend booking in person or on the phone after you arrive in order to get the best price.Lastly, it says you can only ride together with a combined weight of 200lbs or something, that's not true. They have one large ATV for a little bit of a higher price that my boyfriend and I were able to ride (my boyfriend weighs 200 and I 140). You do have to special request this though."

From there we were taken to the centre to shown how to use our bikes and get given our itinerary. I had ridden before but my girlfriend hasn't so they took the time to explain how the bike works - we both took a practise ride around the complex with an instructor on board to ensure they were happy with how we could ride/control the bike. The bike itself was an auto 250cc with some good power (unlike a lot of other places were the bike is either wrecked from overuse or engine is capped). Sean explained that they always keep the tours down to 3-4 people max as the dry season can kick up some dust. So our touring party consisted of my girlfriend, me and our guide Sean. Before we departed Sean noticed I had a GoPro and offered me a helmet with attachment ready to go - another small touch but once again great to know as I had bought the gopro chest mount for this ride! The ride itself was spectacular, after a short ride through town it's off the beaten track to a small Buddhist temple were we met some school kids then off to the paddy fields, all along the way we had kids walking home from school running along and highfiving us as we passed! The spot were we stopped for the sunset was truly amazing - a field with two water buffalo lazing about 10 feet in front of us no tourists, no westerners - no one except our little party, the two water buffalo and three kids who were playing in the water before they took the buffalo into an enclosure for the night - this was definitely a highlight of our entire tour through Cambodia. Sean was happy to take photos of us as the sun set and told us plenty of history about the local area. Once the sunset we took a twilight ride back into the quad bike centre - all up a fantastic trip which was worth every single cent - if you're going to siem reap keep an evening free for this you won't regret it!!"

Found the perfect solution! A quad bike ride around the local villages gave us a unique view of local life. Bikes were in great condition. Guide was superb and made sure that we all were safe. He even gave the kids a quick hands-on tutorial on the bike! They were even each handed a certificate at the end of the tour :-) Two wks after our holiday, we are still talking about our SR trip. Surely, this is one holiday that they will remember for a long time."

They pick you up at your hotel and drop you back. We took a 1.5 hour followed by the sunset in the rice fields tour back to back, so this gave us almost 3 hours, which was just about right. The Quads where in great condition, and the whole experience was fantastic. We visited villages and rural areas. Watch out for small children and cows that jump out across the road! You get to see a lot. The sunset in the fields was great. I recommend you stop when you see a great photo opportunity - there are lots)You will get very dirty, keep this in mind, don't ware your best clothes!.The whole family thought this was one of the top highlights of our trip.Recommend you book direct (phoe or website) as they gave they kids a nice Tshirt for booking direct and not via the hotel."

Our guides Piseth and Den went out of their way to give us a unique experience. Instead of the normal trip they offered to take us on anextravangaza that took us 70 km across rice paddies and dirt tracks, through villages to Phnom Kulen national park and back. We took the Quads to the limit of what they could do and saw amazing sights. These guys were fun, informative and really focused on giving us a good time, I can't speak highly enough of them.

Decided to visit the actual 'shop' (house) and booked in person- managed to get a 10% discount after asking nicely. They required a deposit towards the tour to make sure we showed up later in the evening but no passport needed to be handed over. Quad Adventure Cambodia also sends a tutuk to pick you up from your hotel and drop you back afterwards.The actual quad biking was very enjoyable. They have several tour guides so you end up in a small personal group. We found this good because my friend and I could stop and take pictures as much as we wanted to, but the downside is that you don't get to meet many new people and share your stories. The sunset tour was great for a small taster, wish we ended up going for one of the half day ones! Though the Cambodia skyline can be a little unpredictable and the clouds (pollution?) meant that we couldn't see much of the sunset. Nevertheless we enjoyed riding through the sand, puddles and hi-fiving the kids that would run out to wave to us :) Try and at least give them a wave back, when we hi-fived them you could tell by their smiles that it made their day! Our tour guide was really friendly and was able to take many good photographs for us.Being two young boys we found ourselves wanting to go faster but I can't blame them for taking a safety first approach. Still, we had more fun than doing this than the Fun Biggies in Sihanoukville- which were okay but were nothing like the pictures and description in their brochure. If you happen to be there in the rainy season this is a no brainer, it would be a lot of fun in the wet!"

They picked us up sharp at 6:30 AM and the first thing we did at arrival was a safety briefing. They taught us how to handle the bike's accelerators and brakes. Out trip took 4.5 hrs and we rode around the rice fields near Seam Reap. We had the chance to see another Cambodia full of kids with smiles and friendly locals. I am glad I took my 6 and 9 years old kids so they could experience and see first hand Cambodia life style. We rode across small villages and farms. We stopped on a Buddhist temple and small shop for a drink. In addition to that, we drove by one of the world heritage ancient temple.We recommend this trip for families and get ready to see another Cambodia. My kids appreciated it and had a great time. At the end of the trip, we were received with a cold towel and a bottle of water. I noticed that after our bikes were in the shop, they were already cleaning it up and making maintenance. We would come back, no doubt."

They will also take photos and videos for you (it can be difficult when you are trying to steer) and stop to give you info about the area. We LOVED it!*** We went during the dry season and it was very dusty/dirty. They give you a helmet with face mask, as well as a mouth mask to cover your mouth and nose. But you will get messy!

Also, we were each given fresh, cold, clean face-towels and a bottle of water when we returned.Great to go off-road, drive through backwater villages, rice paddy fields, past traditional housing, temples, water buffalo and the whole countryside. We stopped many times to give gifts of rubber bouncy balls and sweets to the children, who all come out to wave at us! Stop as often as you like to take photos, Your guide will wait for you.

I went for the full day tour which may sound a bit pricey at 170 USD but I definitely got my moneys worth and highly recommend doing 1 of the options available. Firstly you get to see amazing scenery of fields and mountains that you woudn't normally see but for me the best part was going through the villages and seeing how people live and meeting lots of friendly faces along the way. The kids come running out to the road when they hear the bikes to wave and I had great fun exchanging high fives with them as I passed. The trip can be adapted to fit in other activities too, so I also went on a boat trip to see a floating village and there was also the option to stop off to have a go with different types of guns. Going on the quad bike means you can cover a lot more distance than on a bicycle and its a real buzz going full tilt through the Cambodian countryside on a quad!Book it now!

Our group was made up of 2 families - 4 adults, 4 8 year olds, and a 10 year old. So, each adult drove and had a child behind them. You make a few stops, so can switch the pairings. Everyone loved it. We did the 2 hour tour. You drive thru Rice Paddies, several small villages, pass fields with chickens, water buffalo and cows. Children from the villages run to the road to greet you with a smile and a wave. Right towards the end, all 4 of the kids began complaining that their Bums hurt, so I would not advise longer than 2 hours for children.It is quite bumpy and dusty - they give you helmets with eye coverings and paper masks. You come back covered in dry, brown/orange dust. Probably best to wear long pants (dark colors if you don't want them stained). I don't think our white socks will ever be white again! Also, if you are a well endowed woman, you should really wear a good sports bra!There was a guide in front and in back. They were great with the kids and I always felt that everyone was very safe. When it was time to cross an intersection, the driver in back drove ahead and blocked the intersection for us to cross.I believe it was $150 USD for the 2 hour tour for each family (2 adults, 2 kids)Oh, they also provided a Tuk Tuk ride to and from our hotel.My kids say it was the highlight of our week in Cambodia.

Even though my wife was worried at first and nervous, after about 10 minutes she was loving it. We kept switching the kids back and forth, an both were able to sit in front of us for a full view which of course only added to tier enjoyment. If you have time do this trip. Don't do anything less than 2 hours because you will be sorry for cutting it short. We got to see all the various settings, villages, high five and wave to all the kids along the way. Beautiful as the sun was setting. I know others say to wear pants but we all did shorts and tshirt and that was fine. Bring along waters as I don't think the guide will have any. But he can stop along the way and they are super cheap on the road. We also had a break and then the guide took our kids on their own and they got to drive!

We went as a large group of 7 with a quad bike each for the sunset ride. I loved every minute of the trip and Piseth was an amazing guide. He was always happy to take a more challenging road because he was confident with our abilities and every time we got stuck behind a slower group he would find a way to get past them so we could continue at our pace. We got to the sunset location with 15 minutes to spare, more than enough time to get photos and Piseth was very happy to take photos for us and suggest funny photos. We also had him in hysterics at one stage I tripped over with someone on my back. It seems some things are just universally funny! He also spoke great English which helped as he could explain things if we had any questions.Back at the base we received complimentary water and a refreshing soaked towel to wipe our faces clean of the dust that had accumulated on the ride. The owner and his wife were both lovely and we enjoyed talking with them while we waited for the complimentary tuk tuk to return from it's rounds. All in all a fantastic experience and I will definitely be back!"

An excellent guide for my journet which lasted just over 1 hour and cost $30.The quads are very good quality, have automatic transmission and handle well. I was picked up and returned to my hotel.Give this trip a try if you want to see more than temples and the town whilst you are in this beautiful part of Cambodia."

No need to say much, just that this is the perfect way to run away from all the massive amounts of tourists that are visiting siem reap on a daily basis. this way you can really see the country side and feel the local environment. Me and my wife took the 4 hours ride which was way than enough. Ask to see the local market. It's very cool. Don't start too late as its getting hot after 11am.Take some food and drinks and stop on the way. Overall, great! P. S, Our tour guide was Pee. He was super cool and added a lot to our ride. "

Our hotel recommended us to avoid the temples on the day of the protests and do something around Siem Reap. After a couple of searches on the net and trip advisor, we found quad Adventure Cambodia which is run by Herve, a nice french guy always there to help. Note that this review is for Quad Adventure Cambodia and not Quad Adventure Cambodia ATV Tours which has a very similar name.We chose the full day option and did not regret at all our choice. We were expecting to be part of a larger group but in fact it was only the two of us and our guide. A very private and unique tour, almost made for us !Yes it might be pricey but it's worth every pennies. We were picked up at 7:30am from our hotel by Visal who happened to be our guide in the end. Once over there, we had a quick induction session about the bikes and how to handle them, followed by a 10-15 minutes practise run through the streets and outskirts of Siem Reap. Then off we go until almost 6pm. We went through rice fields, local villages, stopped at a nice local restaurant just across one of the temples which was part of the Angkor wat complex. A fond memory is about the little kids when crossing the villages. Because we chose a full day option, we went through places where there aren't many tourists and we could really appreciate the local life. Our guide Visal was funny, friendly, very knowledgeable and his english was perfect. He customised the day for us and even became our photographer :)I should also highly praise Herve and his wife for their friendliness and professionalism. We are going back to Siem Reap in april and will definately do another full day with Visal and Herve's company."

Having previously done a half day tour with Quad Adventure Cambodia some two years ago and it being the highlight of our holiday, I made sure when returning to Siem Reap with my two adult sons that the full day quad tour was top of our agenda. Cost wise quad biking may seem a bit expensive when compared to other activities in Cambodia, but this is really worth every cent. These guys are the originals in Siem Reap and are a truly professional outfit. They have well maintained bikes and friendly, knowledgable, English speaking guides. Our guides for this tour were Piseth and Phy. They really could not do enough to make this day sensational for us. They took us to see things we wanted to see and bypassed the rest. In that respect they will tailor the tour to suit your wishes. If you want to get off the tourist merry go round and see some REAL Cambodia, this is the way to do it. The rural children really turn on the rock star treatment - waving, shouting \"hello\", and lining the roadside for high fives. Tip: take some sweets to give to the poorest children as they next to never see them (you will know these kids by what their house is made of). The squeals of delight will send shivers down your spine and you won't wipe the grin off your face for days! The quads are all automatic and the crew ensure the tours meet your level of riding proficiency. If you go in the dry season you are probably going to get pretty dusty so don't wear your best white shirt. However they do supply you with dust masks so you don't have to breath it all in. The guides will stop for refreshments and photos whenever you want. The scenery is really picture postcard stuff. Note: don't get confused with the other operators in town with similar names. As happens so often in SE Asia, they are simply trying to cash in on the good reputation of the best operator. This really is must do while in Siem Reap."

We are SO glad we decided to do it, it was one of the highlights of our time in Cambodia! We did the \"discovery\" tour starting at 7.30am which we LOVED. It was great doing it in the morning when it was a bit cooler and we found that just over two hours was about the right amount of time. The scenery is beautiful and most of it you never would have been able to find on your own. Heaps of children run out of their homes and wave at you with massive smiles and give you high-fives which is very cute. The quads are easy to drive, you have a 'test' around the block with a guide on your quad with you before you are allowed to drive on your own. It can be pretty dusty so don't wear white! You are provided with a face mask to keep the dust out of your mouth and nose and the helmet has clear plastic part to pull down over your eyes. We were the only two on our tour and the guide was good with letting us stop for photos and also taking photos of us together which was nice. Overall a MUST do experience, you will not regret it!"

The guides are also eager to talk to you and learn more about you - I really liked the personal touch there, instead of just being guide and follower.For those who have never rode a quad bike before, don't worry, they will give you a quick course beforehand and ensure you can confidently operate one instead of just going straight for the tour. I'm glad they did because I thought these quads were like scooters (my, my, was I wrong)."

They talked to us about village life, etc, and ensured we weren't doing anything that would endanger ourselves or others. This is not a risky adrenalin ride.

The tour gives a real view of life in Cambodia. Very professional staff and extremely safe. Well worth the trip especially if you need a change from the temples. My teenagers loved it as well as my 78 and 76 year old parents."

Happy that we took the morning tour as it started to get very hot near the end of out 4 hour adventure. I would have liked to go to a temple or two in the forest though. I felt that 4 hours just riding around the roads, through villages got a bit tedious....but we did have a lot of fun and stopped for photos and cold drinks.. i suggest that other travellers try to get a temple or two thrown into the trip. there os more than enough time."

My wife and I shared a quad, and our guide was on a two wheel dirt bike. We rode through some of the most engaging countryside as well as some outlying villages. Be prepared to get dirty however as the tour is all on dusty back roads and trails. All along the route, small children ran out of their homes waving their hands with big smiles on their faces. That was priceless. Sadly, we didn't take many photos as we're having too much fun riding. Dint miss this opportunity if you get burned out on Wat visiting."

I was pressed for time and appreciated how efficient everything was. I was able to book a quad bike tour for a friend and I less than a day in advance, and we were picked up and dropped off by tuk-tuk precisely on schedule. Our guide/lead driver, Hong, was fantastic. I'd never driven a quad bike before, but Hong gave me a quick training session and I was good to go. As others have suggested, you *will* get caked in dust, so dress accordingly. As memorable everything was, I felt very guilty biking through the serene neighborhoods around the city, especially since I didn't have any treats to give the children who would run up and wave at us."

I booked this 4 hour morning tour prior to leaving Australia after reading all the great reviews on TripAdvisor.I booked it to impress my 16 year old son so he would think I was a \"cool Mum\". I had never been on a Quad Bike before so at 45 years of age I was a little nervous to say the least. My son is an expert on all things motorised so I was concerned that I might not be able to keep up!Well, I needn't have worried, this Mum was riding with the best of them, at top speed might I add!Not only did all my fears dissolve, but within the first hour or so I was seriously considering how we could fit in another Quad Biking tour with this company, I had an absolute blast. Unfortunately, as with most holidays, we had limited time so one quad adventure would have to suffice on this occasion.The fun of racing through villages, past rice fields, water buffalo and even hitting \"Water Buffalo Land Mines\" at 100kms an hour was exhilarating and I was amazed at how quickly I became confident with the vehicle, my son was rather impressed with his novice Mum!!Please do not be put off by the $100 per person price for the 4 hour tour it is well worth the asking price and I considered it very, very good value for money and would not hesitate to pay the same again. I am quite frugal when it comes to outlaying money for tours and I must say that this was well and truly excellent value for money!We felt very well looked after and our wonderful guide Khoi made sure that we were very safe along our journey.The only situation which I found quite uncomfortable and confronting (which is absolutely no fault of the owner of the business nor had any real impact on our enjoyment overall) was when the our guide asked me on several occasions during the tour whether I would consider sponsoring him to come to Australia and he would \"pay me back later\". He was a lovely man and I felt very sorry for his predicament but I also felt very uncomfortable when I had to respectfully decline his request.This situation should just be overlooked if it occurs on your tour because the company and the guides really are wonderful people and I can appreciate that these people are quite desperate to escape the poverty of their country, which made it all the more difficult to refuse such a request.If I ever have the pleasure to return to Siem Reap I would not hesitate to take this fantastic tour."

Herve gave us extra time at no additional charge since we had to wait a few minutes for the larger ATV to return from a pickup.

It was pricey (100 USD each for 4 hours) but well worth the experience. We traveled through a tremendous amount of beautiful countryside to the South and Southeast of Siem Reap. It was definitely the road less traveled, but the road that passed by the typical Cambodian village and home in this part of the country that we otherwise would not have seen."

It's quite an investment for Siem Reap pricing, but if you ask enough questions... you'll get exactly what you want from the experience, as there's a significant difference between a leisurely ride in the country side and an off road rampage.I made plenty on enquiries before committing and got a good combination of both, but was fortunate enough to share the ride with only one other driver and a great guide SOPHY!He catered to both our needs and was a pleasure to share it with... even when I got bogged in the deep mud. So be prepared to get dirty, or ask not too be taken on the muddy trails, but instead opt for a scenic tour... possibly consider a bike or horse instead... these Quads have got some serious power and should be used accordingly. Interaction with the rural communities may be limited to fleeting hello's and wavering goodbye's, while you race through the country side and experience the thrill of unregulated Quad driving"

The guides are great and the owner Vong speaks excellent English and is a good guy. We hung out with him after our tour and it was one of the most fun and interesting experiences we had in Siem Reap. Hearing about how he and his family managed through the various changes in Cambodia was very interesting and his story about starting his business inspiring.Wear clothes you dont mind getting filthy, do not use the ponchos if it rains, much more fun without them, wear long pants, wear sneakers or closed toe shoes, bring a camera but in a small back pack or a zippered pocket so you dont lose it - if it threatens to rain wrap it in a plastic bag so you dont ruin it.

As soon as we left the main road, it felt very different from being on the touristy paths.When we got there, we learned that the two of us will be the only people on the tour with our guide, which was a pleasant surprise. They try to separate guests whenever possible, so you can have a personal experience. After doing some test drives on the bikes (not hard at all if you drive), we were ready to go. We brought our driver's license but didn't need to show it.The trip itself was great. We saw rice paddies, people working on fields, people going by their day to day life.

The tour itself is set down for about 1.5 hours however in total you will be there longer. Our guide was on his motorbike in front of us and spent lots of time at different places talking to us about the sometimes devastatingly sad history of this country. At the same time he was able to offer lots of information about the rice paddies themselves and all of the music we could hear playing - it's wedding season so after everyone finishes work for the day they get together and have big (loud) wedding parties! We would never have known or understood, especially out here in the sticks. The tour we did is 16km and you are on the move pretty much constantly. The photos I took (attached) only tell part of the story. You will go through lots of tiny villages and the local people smile and wave, some kids even run alongside wanting to say \"hello\" and give high-fives! We were completely satisfied with this adventure company. We checked our travel insurance and we were covered - might just pay to check yours before you go as you will have to sign a waiver before you can ride."

We would do it again and bring treats to all the little children who came out to wave to us.Our guide was great; he speaks English well and very personable. Recommend bringing light weight point and shoot camera with retractable lens. As it is dusty, wet, dirty and bumpy/bouncy. I had my large camera sling to my side covered in plastic bags. It kept bouncing and hitting my hip as we go through some serious bumpy roads in between rice fields.Wear long pants, and closed toes shoes. When going over water areas, the splashing of water on the engine also splashed onto my ankles. It did burn my legs slightly. They do provide a dust mask-- though flimsy. Recommend you bring better quality one for yourself as the elastic strap broke off easilyBecause we are in a 2 Quads, led by the guide on his dirt bike. I felt I had to keep up with them. I wanted to stop more often and take pictures and interact with the people. I wish I had.Also, I wish my children would have more opportunity to drive the Quad more. Certainly there is a concern for the kids safety and the vehicles because you are riding in narrow paths and uneven terrains, and at time driving on paved road with other cars and motorcycles-- AND of course the people and animals along the way.It's not cheap by Khmer standard, but certainly worth it."

            "review": "Fantastic thrilling activity for all. The ATV ride through the quaint villages and peaceful paddy fields was simply awesome and tops the list of what my teens enjoy most on our Cambodian vacation. Each potential rider was assessed for his/her suitability to ride a quad bike. Under the instructor's guidance, we felt comfortable riding on the roads and countryside trails. Those who were assessed as not being suitable to handle a quad bike were only allowed to be on the front seat along safe stretches of path, bordered by paddy fields. Hence, all of us felt safe and had sufficient adrenaline rush for the one and a half hours.The instructors were professional and were mindful of everyone's safety. We had Pee, John and Pon Lok as our instructors, and they were friendly and skilful. There were breaks along the trail for us to take in the beauty of the countryside. This is a must-try activity at Siem Reap. Arrive with an adventurous spirit and a camera and you will have an experience to remember."

The sunset view at paddy field is more lovely and enjoyable as you can see the sun descending in a few minutes without a big crowd of people around you and no body will try to squeeze in the space for taking pics.It was a relaxing and enjoyable tour. The staff going with me took good care of our group and since one of them is siting at my bike with me, he answered my questions about Cambodia and showed me anything interesting on the way to the paddy field. They offer you mask & helmet, give you instructions and practice before the tour, so no problem if you don't have any experience with quad bikes at all."

They did a quick 101 and practice run. We rode through the town and village areas where there was a small number of other vehicles and pedestrians so no need to be concerned about traffic. As you ride through the village, little kids come out and wave at you. We rode pass the rice paddies, people fishing, and buffaloes hanging out in the water. We stopped at a beautiful location where we had an amazing view of the sunset. They give you a helmet which you will use esp when it starts to get dark b/c bugs will hit your face. One thing to note is that you should wear long pants since you will go through some puddles that are hot from the engine of the bike. Other than that, staff was amazing and super friendly. Would highly recommend!"

We took one quad as the tour was quite expensive and I wasn't too bothered about driving. Our tour guide Phy spoke very good English and was very friendly. We were out for at least 2 hours overall, with a 10 min break for a drink and also a quick look around a temple (not the most impressive we've seen but still nice).Well organised and a very enjoyable thing to do, very different from looking around temples and other attractions! You get to see the real Cambodia. I recommend wearing old clothes or ones you don't mind getting dirty as it was a dry day but there were still big puddles! I think just about everything got some mud on it! They give you a cold towel and water when you get back which was a nice touch.The quad bikes were in great condition and we felt very safe. I still think it is a bit overpriced, but really enjoyed it! They also don't mention on the website about having an Angkor pass as I think we could have gone a different route if we'd had a valid pass. They also suggested we go to the shooting range but that would have meant less time on the quads and we wanted to spend as much time on them for our $75! We were quite happy just driving around seeing the countryside."

Choose the 4pm easy ride tour. My guide picked me up, again like many other tours I'd pre organised I was the only one in the group. All the staff were so friendly, had a lesson on how to ride I was pretty nervous so my guide suggested he ride on the back with me, I have to say the quads are quite massive and heavy to steer but perfect for guys who probably love the big toys. Having the guide sit with me was actually a bonus as I got to hear all the history and local knowledge while we drove. He spoke excellent English and we were able to chat the whole way even over the noise of the quad. The local kids are adorable and they run out and say hello, I brought lollipops which they loved but didn't expect . Quad adventure take safety very seriously and they won't compromise anyone's safety especially the locals and of course the local kids. Fantastic 2 hours, added so much more to my trip and got to see a lot more of country Cambodia and interact with locals. Even if you're not into ripping around on bikes do it for the scenery, experience and interaction with locals and the adorable kids... Or do it for the adrenaline if that's your thing but either way it's an amazing experience and can be enjoyed by all. Oh and you get absolutely filthy so make sure you wear old clothes, long pants and runners are ideal. "

His english is good and we had a good time chatting. He helped me drive when i couldnt do big steers or my hands got numb. We went through paddy fields and spent some time with the local children. We also caught the sunset at the paddy fields.Tips: wear long pants or clothes that you dont mind getting dirty.

            "review": "Impressed with their business ethics. In March 2013 my family, including my 17 year old daughter, along with another family with 2 teenage boys did a 4 hour trip. I am petite and had never ridden an ATV before, but because my daughter was riding in a double with my husband, I had to ride a single. It was the dry season and what might be mud in the rainy season had hardened into ruts and I had the sensation the vehicle might tip over. For someone who's not into high speed or vehicles, it was what I might term tense fun. There was red dust everywhere, that got into everything, but the scenery was wonderful. So I wouldn't say this trip is for everyone, but if you're into this kind of adventure, the company does a very good job and their foreign imported equipment is very well maintained.What I want to talk about, however, is what happened when my daughter had an accident and damaged the vehicle she was riding. She had never driven before, and the company had told her she should not ride her own ATV. But my husband let her drive the double while he kept an eye from behind. She seemed to be doing well and part way through the trip, she wanted to ride a single on her own, so I got on the double with my husband. Of course, my daughter was not going to be left behind by the two teenage boys, so she went ripping after them. I didn't see the accident, but at some point, she says a child came on to the path, and she swerved and hit a pole. Her lack of experience led to her swerving when she could probably have stopped in time. In any case, she was fine, but the plastic housing of the vehicle was cracked and there may have been other damage underneath. We got back with trepidation that the business would try to hose us by asking us to pay an exorbitant amount for the damage. In fact, they only charged us $50 and were apologetic about having to do that. They explained that if it was only the plastic, they would have let it go, but there was some metal damage underneath. They would keep cost down by doing the repair themselves. Bottom line: they showed they are an honest business."

What an adrenaline rush :) It was our first time to drive an ATV but it wasn't too difficult to do the tour since they taught us the vehicle's basic controls before starting the tour. They also provided guides to assist us through the muddy and slippery tracks and in case we lost control of the vehicle because of the heavy rain. Souphea was my tour guide and he gave insights on how the countryside people live. During the ride, we also encountered several kids who enthusiastically waved at us and said \"hello!\" It was very uplifting and heartwarming.I strongly recommend this to anyone who wants to include something different in their Siem Reap itinerary :)"

They wanted to get active and out there, and this tour didn't disappoint!I pre-registered online for the Quad Adventures tour, and it turned out to be perfect. They picked my group up from our hotel and dropped us off afterwards. When we arrived at their site, there was a lesson to make sure we all knew how to operate the ATV's and then a test drive with one of the employees around the block to triple-check that we were all competent which made me feel rather safe about the whole tour. There was another group arriving to do the sunset tour when we were there, but we were able to go just the four of us alone with two tour guides. I know my group was really worried about the guides moving too slowly and the tour not being fun. However, I didn't think that was the case at all! You have one guide in front of you, leading the way and he was moving at a fast enough rate for our group, making sure that the boys were enjoying the speed. Another guide was following up in the rear, just in case anyone had any problems. Riding through the rice paddies and local rural areas of Siem Reap was really amazing, one of my favorite parts of our Cambodia trip. I really felt like I escaped the tourist area of Siem Reap which was a little overwhelming at times. The whole tour is on dirt paths (don't worry you have a helmet and face masks to protect yourself), and you pass by local houses and farms - people in the river looking for fish and working in the rice paddies. The path was nice because you could choose to avoid or go over the bumpy parts, making the ride more fun - and different for those who want more of the adventure. There are cows EVERYWHERE, I had to stop and shoo them out of the way at times, never dangerous though. And all the local children come out to the side of the road to wave at you, which was fun. There weren't any lockers or storage in the ATV, so whatever you bring, make sure to have a backpack or a purse that wraps around your body because it needs to be on yourself. We stopped along the dirt path to watch the sunset, really stunning - see the pictures attached. This is the only time in the tour that we saw other tourists doing a similar package with other companies. We did stop here for quite some time. We were talking to our tour guide the whole time, but I did feel like they were stretching out the time here in order to make the tour longer. When you head back towards the home site, you are driving in the dark, so make sure you feel comfortable doing that - or have glasses with you etc."

So perhaps Quad adventure should look into the website reservation option as customers may be lost as they don't receive any replies. None of the mails were in junk folder, it was rather bizzare.Nevertheless, we really enjoyed our quad bike rides. My companions were saying how much they enjoyed it after the ride. We chose the sunset ride and rode through the beautiful paddy fields which i feel is even prettier than those paddy fields we saw during our horse riding. As i rode my quad bike without an instructor, i had a full hands on experience in moving in those bumpy terrains. Some of those terrains are not easy to move around especially in water or muddy areas with lots of pot holes.I would actually recommend taking the trip during daylight as towards the end of my sunset ride, it was pure darkness. Not much scenery to look for during night fall. All in all, enjoyed this experience! We even had a certificate to certify that we had ridden a quad bike! :)"

Our poor shoes--so glad our hotel offered free laundry! I never thought quad bikes could go so fast. Was it 300km/hr the guide said the maximum speed was? It was everyone's first time to ride this, and we found it quite easy to learn.The countryside is typical of that of Southeast Asian countries--rice paddies, water buffalos, houses on stilts, children playing outside by the road... so if you've seen such scenes before, it's nothing new. Don't forget to wave to all the happy children waving back at you! Our guides spoke very good English and were very nice. When you get back to base, you'll be offered bottled water and cold towels. The only downside we had was we couldn't go in Bakong Temple which was along the bike route. I was a bit disappointed that our travel agent (who arranged our itinerary) didn't inform us so we didn't bring along our temple passes. Tip: I suggest you ask the company / your agent where exactly you will be going in case you need to bring along your temple passes. If you're bringing bottled water, note there is no basket on the quad bike, you'll have to strap it to your body (i.e. belt bag)."

Despite some self-admitted jitters about operating as a novice these Trail Boss machines- our guide and the Quad team helped us test drive thoroughly, establish operating standards along with proper safety gear and then we were quickly underway. Thankfully the pink bags tied around our shoes avoided more potential splash damage as we navigated some fun off-road potholes filled with water from the recent rain. As we moved through the countryside (very short distance from the shop)- we felt in control, at our own pace and amazed by the smiling faces and daily life we encountered. This was life outside the tourist zone for sure. Our eventual stop among the rice paddies as the sunset was, indeed as advertised, a memorable experience. Great photos- our 12-yr old got to test drive a quad with a guide and loved it. While this event is a bit noisy and takes a slightly adventurous spirit, it is well worth the trip for sure. In hindsight- we definitely should have worn long pants (they said to do that) and bring some bug spray for the ride back as the night falls- the mosquitos come out to play. All in all, warm hosts, excellent and very safe gear, and a clear sense that you were in good hands the entire time. We would love to try another one of their trips the next time we go back. Merci Beaucoup Mille Fois Herv\u00e9 Nicole et all!"

Recommend taking water and your worst clothes as you will get dirty, if not mud the dust will get you. They can supply you with shoe covers if needed and you are given a face mask. Don't be macho and not wear it, as there is a fair bit of dust. I did the 2hr Discovery Experience, it was the perfect amount of time. Along the way Soheang stopped and we got some photos and at any stage I wanted a particular photo along the way I just pulled up and he'd stop ahead of me. See some great scenery, the friendly local kids waving as you go past and the different country-side. A great experience - definitely worth the money! The bikes are all clean, good working order and the guide will only go as fast as he thinks your capable of maintaining control - road conditions vary quite a bit, but not at all challenging for infrequent riders.

The quad bikes available were 300cc beasties, which were a bit more powerful than the ones we used in Koh Samui, but with our prior experience we were ready to get out of the compound and start our tour. We were given a quick test drive just so the guide was sure we'd be able to handle the bikes, and then we were off. It was just the two of us, plus the guide of course, which was perfect. The journey was pretty easy; very few streams and the ground was mostly level, so it's excellent for anyone who isn't confident riding a quad. We were given a small bottle of water, but it's not enough if you're on a long tour and exposed to the sun the whole time. Expect lots of dust, so you may want to bring a face mask, and appropriate sunglasses if you're not going to wear a helmet with a visor.The only annoyance I had was having to wear a helmet that didn't fit properly (and the chin strap came loose), but this seems to be a recurring problem in Southeast Asia in general."

Then off on a test drive so that we would be familiar with our bikes. We all passed that test and our little convoy headed out... \"breaker, breaker, you got your ears on\"... okay, there was no walkie-talkie or head-set action, so please don't expect that when you rock up.We headed through streets, back-streets, villages, farms, dirt tracks, stopped for attractions, other vehicles, groups of people, waved at villagers and more.We had a photo opportunity in a rather large field where we did a combination of a page-3 pin-up, as well as the Jetstar and Toyota jumps... we rocked it in \"the Bodes\".Depending on the time of year you go, be ready for some dust... it was everywhere, but, we wouldn't have wanted it any other way... hahaha, be prepared for some interesting face masks once you take your helmets off.It was lucky that our group were the only people on our time-slot, which made it a little more intimate.A fantastic trip, but, over before we knew it.Get revved up, you'll be glad you did."

I have experience of quads so after doing the paperwork we were straight off into the countryside. As far as I could see each party has their own guide, meaning you could drive at a speed to suit your experience, rather than being restricted to the speed of the slowest in a group. The roads were flooded in places because it was still the wet season making the riding extremely good fun. Be warned however that the red mud can stain clothes so be careful to only wear things that don't matter. As we were riding quite fast we covered a considerable distance, stopping at a village market and an outlying temple, as well as travelling on a great variety of roads and tracks. Everywhere we went we were greeted by smiles and on hearing us approach children would rush out of their houses to wave as we passed. Altogether a thoroughly enjoyable experience that I intend to repeat as soon as I can, and that I would thoroughly recommend. You will get dirty, and your thumb will ache from using the throttle lever as with any quad bike, but the experience makes it all worth while. The bike was in good condition and Quad Adventure Cambodia's administration was excellent."

We had the good fortune to meet some fantastic people on our cruise that recommended this company as being safe and a great way to get out to the local orphanage to visit the kids with some gifts and food. As I was travelling with our two girls aged 8 and 10 I was terribly hesitant given Quad bikes are quite dangerous. I was impressed after arriving at the thorough safety briefing and all participants were tested before being allowed on this 40km ride throughout some wet and wild countryside. We were there during massive flooding so it was muddy!My fears were allayed when I saw how fastidiously maintained the Quad bikes were and how professional the set up was. The instructors and guides were clearly good English speakers. This is important when you are learning how to ride these for the first time.The guides were always on the look out for hazards- traffic, huge holes and mother cows protecting their calves. We all had an absolute ball and it was the highlight of a fantastic trip so that's saying something!We were impressed to learn it is run by a Westerner (a lovely Frenchman, Herve) so this explained the regard for safety. We understand there are other Quad bike tours for whom safety is not a concern. As you are whizzing through villagers with small children by the roadside this is worrying. Especially when I learnt from one of the orphans that many children were orphaned due to road accidents in Cambodia. This is not a place where you want to gamble with your health and safety.So, make sure you get taken to Quad Adventure Cambodia- Siem Reap and not Sem REap- Quad Bike Adventure ATV tours OR Cambodia Quad Bike as Hotel concierges are bribed to send guests to these very similar sounding places INSTEAD of Herve's business which has a BIG focus on safety, unlike the competition apparently. Even if you've specifically requested Quad Bike Adventure Cambodia - Siem Reap you could still end up at the other places so ask for Herve and check where you are when you arrive before paying any $$!You can request to visit the orphanage (as they are no longer allowed to take you or suggest going there due to changes in the government's rules unless you specifically request it). We stopped at the local shop and bought three huge bags of rice and large boxes of noodles. All the kids will go through one bag or rice in two days so its a meaningful contribution and more direct than $. We also took bags of pencils, pads, paints etc that they were very happy with."

SUMMARYThis was my second time taking the 4-hour tour with Quad Adventure Cambodia. 4 hours for me is a minimum because it allows you enough time to get comfortable with the machines so that you can spend the rest of the time observing the land and the people. And every time you do this, you find new interesting things to see in the country side.THE GOOD- A family business run competently by the French owner who employs very qualified tour guides who know the land and the people well. Each one has an interesting personal story as well. Our guide was Piseth who did an exceptional job.- Kids: Safety is first and the company goes through an extensive helmet-fitting exercise as well as a detailed instruction on how to operate the 4-wheeler. The kids are allowed to take a short drive in a closed area inside a temple compound which they absolutely loved.- Make It Your Own: Even though there is a planned route, you can stop and slow down whenever you want to talk to kids on the side of the road or to take pictures. The tour guide will follow your lead.THE BAD- Nothing. It was all-around great fun.OPPORTUNITIES- I think the owners should consider a day-long temple tour because I would love to sign up for that. They should also look at longer overnight trips. Maybe they already have and I just didn't notice."

I went on a 1.5 hour (USD35) easy ride trail and the experience was fantastic, an absolute bang for the buck. My instructor/tour leader Soheang took me to places largely inaccessible by foot, away from the touristy Siem Reap to the various rice paddies, villages and rural temples located in the outskirts, home to the many locals residing around the city center; showing me first hand another side of Siem Reap that goes by largely unnoticed - slow, quiet, yet filled with an everlasting impression of serenity and beauty that is different, unique, and unmatched by the city. Ride the quad bike on dirt tracks, through mud and puddles of water, making a big splash at every instance (and of course enjoy the ever-so-bumpy journey filled with potholes). Stop by the green paddies and admire the setting sun from afar while water buffaloes and their owners pack up after a long day's work. To that, add in a dash of human warmth as kids by the roads wave and say hello as you ride by, ever so willing to communicate or converse in anyway they could (and nope, its not to peddle their wares like in the cities) to foreign visitors from abroad.Highly recommended for the adventurous and fun-loving!"

The office and bikes are kept in great order, safety briefing and ride done with care and the tour itself flexible in that you could stop at any time to take in the sights. As I was the only one on this particular tour, it was a great opportunity to chat with my guide along the way about the country, village life etc. The bikes themselves are really noisy and one wonders what impact a group of 15 or 20 bikes speeding along in a group has on the villagers. Certainly the peaceful atmosphere was shattered as we rode through villages however lots of people still came out of their houses with big smiles and waved to us as we rode by - especially the children. To get the most out of this adventure don't ride as fast as you can along the small tracks in the rice paddies and dirt roads in the villages but go at a leisurely speed so you can take time to stop and look at the beautiful scenery and meet the locals. This was what made my quad bike adventure all the more enjoyable and memorable."

We did the sunset ride starting around 5pm. They sent a Tuk-Tuk to pick us up from the hotel to get us to the Quad place. After some instructions from the friendly staff, we were good to go. We followed the guide on our Quad bikes through the rural areas of Siem Reap, passing by rice fields, duck farms, village houses while being waved at by children and while dodging cows. We then stopped to watch the sunset and drove back.It was a fun experience"

These guys mean business.- They have brand new perfectly maintained quad bikes which are very easy to drive (but they teach you anyway!).- They take care of you the whole time, making sure you are OK.- They even provide you with plastic bags for your shoes (I recommend some sort of water shoes anyway).- The roads are not dangerous in any way, not even if this is your first time in a quad bike and you are a rookie, but it still is FUN! We came across a few ponds but these big quad bikes seem not to even care... :-)- The landscape is beautiful, and upon passing, the small children will approach and hi-five you if you slow down. If you say hi and smile, almost every single kid will wave back.- PLEASE MAKE YOU SLOW DOWN NEAR CHILDREN AND WORKING LOCALS, NOT ONLY FOR SAFETY REASONS, BUT OUR OF RESPECT OF THE CAMBODIAN PEOPLE WORKING IN THE RURAL AREA. Some of them are handling their food, and the passing quad bikes may result in a lot of dust covering it if you pass by fast enough. If you slow down, they will appreciate your gesture and smile back in gratitude.- There are different tours with different lengths. We did the 4-hour one, and it was just right. Actually, we ended up wanting for a little more, but it was OK. If we had booked a shorter one, we would have regretted not picking the one we chose.The owner is french, and after the excursion he approached and asked us how everything was, making sure we had a good time and if not, getting the feedback for improvement.Totally recommended!! And we indeed recommend it to our friends..."

            "review": "A One-Of-A-Kind Ride along Siem Reap's Rural side. The tour started when we were picked up via tuktuk at our hotel (Tara Angkor Hotel). We chose the Sunset tour which starts at 5:15 PM and we were picked up at around 4:45 PM. They were quite strict with the time since we really needed to make in time for sunset view along the paddy fields which is around 6PM.Upon reaching the location, we were first asked if we had any driving experience prior our ride. After that, we went for a short test to see if we're capable to drive by our own. In our case though, all 6 of us failed and we were all forced to have somebody ride at our backs to guide us. After paying and signing the waivers, we wore our helmets and face masks (against dust) and proceeded to start. If you're a first-timer, you don't have to be nervous about riding. The guide is more than capable to help you when he/she sees that you're having a little difficulty in controlling the ATV. At the same time, he/she would let you control when the guide sees that you're already stable in driving. It can be pretty intimidating at first since you'll be driving along the main road where actual cars and motorcycles pass through as well. Sometimes, the guide will ask you to drive a little slower or faster depending on your speed. After driving for 15 to 20 more minutes, you'll reach the rough road part of the ride. It was raining before our tour so there was mud in some portions of the road which is why it will be a lot more comfortable if you'll wear pants and rubber shoes. And since it was a bit cloudy, we never really got to see the sunset view although we waited for around 10 minutes for the sun to appear. After that, we proceeded to go back to the shop. Overall, it was an awesome experience even without the sunset view. I rode the ATV before but this is surely different because you are actually driving along the rural town where you'll see the paddy fields, farm animals and friendly locals. My favorite part is whenever the local children would wave at you as if they actually know you. This is cultural immersion at its best paired with a bit splash of adventure."

The temples are the number one most fascinating experience I have had in my month long Southeast Asia trip and the quad ride has been my number one most adventurous experience. Please note, I took the sunset tour and cannot speak on behalf of the other tour options. Company: note, this is 'Quad Adventure Cambodia - Siem Reap\", not \"Siem Reap - Quad Bike Adventure ATV tours\". It is run by Herve, a now local French man and his family. So we had some miscommunication and I put the wrong hotel name on my form (thanks to a local tuk tuk driver) and Herve's rider. Herve was quick to respond via email and incredibly sensitive to the situation. I ended up being an hour late and it did not deter my tour. Herve understood the situation and did not charge me, so I got a private tour for free! Regardless, I thought the $30 was expensive at first, but would have easily paid much more after doing the tour! If only I had one more day! Another note, it was incredibly refreshing that the company in no way was solitons about anything which is incredibly rare in siem reap, and a major reason why I am very compelled to write this review.The quad experience: my tour began an hour late due to the mishap (above) but still lasted well over an hour. It had rained all day and was still raining in the height of wet season. I think this made the trip even better! Note, you will get wet, very, very wet! The entire tour is on bumpy muddy paths just wide enough for maybe 2 quads. The rice fields surround the road so if you are not an experienced rider, it can be easy to slide into the waters! Personally, I have driven quads before and had no problem with control and loved every moment of careening through the puddles and bumps. I think there is an easy ride option for less experienced riders and also may want to consider just riding on the back of a guides quad if you like adventur but do not feel comfortable with a quad (the instructions are very limited, but then again, there is not much to tell). The sunset tour: although there was no sunset due to rain, the scenery was breathtaking. This is the true way to see how the khemar people live. My tour was not guided and we only stopped once for a picture. Half of my tour was in the dark which I think heightened the adventure of the experience. It was a rush the entire way!My tour guide: hong was fantastic. He allowed me to dictate the pace which was a bit slower at first then picked up as I got comfortable with everything. His English was pretty good and when we stopped we talked a bit about the local cuisine. He offered to stop off and grab a bite and/or drink. He told me he would take me somewhere offer the tourist trail and get REAL Khemar food. If I didn't have plans to eat at the night market I would have been all over this! Again, this tour was not guided, but I actually enjoyed it as it was an amazing experience just being on a quad and being in the middle of the rice fields and villages of Cambodia watching people around me work, shuffle water buffalo, play, eat, laugh, etc. Overall, I am not the most easy to please traveler and I have nothing but amazing things to say about my experience and the company. I almost passed this up for a second day at the temples, but take my advice and don't miss out on this one!!!!"

Fun, exhilarating and a fantastic way to get off the beaten track. The local children running out to wave and just seeing them playing, swimming and fishing was a joy. I fluctuated between concentrating on where I was going to enjoying the beautiful landscape, luckily with a quad bike it is fairly forgiving so the occasional lapse in concentration goes unnoticed! Quad adventure made this whole experience easy and enjoyable - would recommend to those who like a bit of adventure mixed in with their sightseeing."

We had a quad each and went through small villages, past small ruined temples, visited a lotus flower field ( ate some lotus seeds.....yumm!) stopped for a great bite to eat on a road stop and drank ice cold coconut milk from fresh coconuts on the way home...soooo refreshing after a hot day! We went out to the floating village which we knew would be dry when we went but very much worth the visit for the sites and sounds you'll see.You'll finish you're day covered in dust and tired but such a great way to see the area around siem reap....wear sensible shoes and long trousers.Would highyl recommend this team as an essential part of your siem reap trip!"

We did the Sunset Tour - a short check-out for me - each of the kids had a guide (sitting behind them) - off we went. Three new quad bikes and I see on their website they have even more now.After a few minutes we were riding along the paddy fields - though puddles some pretty big and muddy as it had been raining earlier - the sunset unfortunately was not great - so they gave us a longer ride. The guides were great - making sure that the kids drove within their capabilities - a bit of racing and overtaking where it was possible and safe.A totally enjoyable experience - looking forward to my next visit to Cambodia and then I'm thinking of doing a half-day or full day session.Unfortunately my GoPro seemed to have fogged up so no good pictures - next time ;)"

The guide was enthusiastic, patient, and friendly and I couldn't recommend this experience more. We spent a week exploring the archaeology of the Ankor complex, and this was a rewarding break to experience something a little different. We stopped and watched the sun go down over the rice paddies, sped along dusty bumpy roads, and enjoyed the friendly smiley locals. We read that it is a good idea to take lollies (sweets) with you for the children so we took a small bucket of lollipops - the only thing is when you stop to give a child a treat 5 more seemingly materialise out of nowhere! At first I thought the idea of giving lollies to local children would be a terrible touristy thing to do while kicking up dust on a quad, but the parents greeted us with big smiles and called their kids over to us.

Great for ATV riding.Remember sun lotion, though! My arms were covered, but I had forgotten to put lotion on my hands. After 4 hours in the sun I was toasted.Some of the most excellent fun I've had for a long time!If I have to mention a downside, it must be that compared to lots of other activities in Cambodia, ATV riding here is not for the budget minded. I paid 100 US dollars for 4 hours.. But still, compared to american prices, this is very cheap."

Two of my friends and I decided to do the half day trip and it turned out to be the highlight of our three week trip to SE Asia (and we even rode/swam with elephants, which was pretty awesome as well). About halfway through a beautiful and scenic ride through rice fields, small villages (high-fiving little kids), a fish market, a temple, etc. we stopped and the guides praised us on our moderate pace. At that point we felt very comfortable riding the quads and asked to go a bit faster, get a little dirtier, and have a little more space to play around. Our guides (totally awesome young guys with great english) accommodated perfectly. Given that it had just rained, there were some dirt roads that had huge puddles/ditches and we were able to go splashing and romping through at top speeds. Needless to say, we were completely soaked by the end of the trip and thoroughly satisfied. $95 definitely a reasonable price point for the awesomeness of the experience and the quality of the quads and guides. Would definitely do again."

He fell off at one point and lost his phone (a villager chased us down to return it). The owner Herve been doing this for 6 years so he does take certain precautions to make sure everybody has a good and safe time. ATVs are not toys. They are a motor vehicle which has certain risks when operating. When you realize that the area you are driving through is rural country side where there are lots of small children and livestock, you should not be blasting through at high speed. There are speed limits for a reason. For those that complain it is slow; go to a race track.tips:- wear comfortable clothing that covers your body, it's hot- take the 7am start time. trust me, it's more enjoyable light and temperature at that time. you also get to see people starting their day (going to work, school, market)- stop and see the sights.- say hi to people- ATVs are easy to ride but do resist the urge to go rally style through people's front yards (children literally play in the streets)- you will get dirty (exponentially if you decide to go through giant puddles which is a bad idea btw because you dont know how deep or what's under the water)- bring your temple pass because we forgot ours and couldnt go in some of the temples which are part of the Angkor park.-dont give treats or gifts to little kids along the road. this encourages them to stand in the streets with hands out. dangerous if you hit them. i know some of them just want to say hi, but others really want to touch the ATVs/get treats."

Being the rainy season there were lots of puddles which made the tour extra fun. I had taken along a some old trousers specifically for this tour and threw them out afterwards although I think they would have washed up fine. We stopped for lunch outside the temples where my husband had an amazing soup served in a tent style restaurant with dirt floor. The family here were all very friendly and we had a lovely time.

They picked me up from my hotel half an hour prior to the start time and provided a training session to ensure I was well prepared to use the vehicle.My tour was led by Phy. He was professional and knowledgable. He provided an insight into the lives of ordinary Cambodians, talking to some of the villagers on the way and translating their stories, as well as his own upbringing and how he also started out as a farmer's child to working in the tourism trade after learning English. He seemed like a genuine character and the info he provided me with a deeper understanding of the Cambodian way of life and the struggles of its people.The ATV provided was in good working order and there were no faults with it. The only warning is that; whilst the ATV looks spotless when you first step on it, do not expect it, nor you to be spotless after you return as they really mean off road. One other benefit of the tour was that, unlike the ATV rides I've taken in Thailand where they are on set routes which do not allow you to approach any reasonable speed, this tour allows you to ride the ATV at reasonable speeds as you will be taken on dirt roads [slower experience] as well as paved roads where you will have to go the same speed as cars [much faster].All in all, it was $95 well spent and I recommend this tour to anyone coming to Siem Reap."

There were lots of other people with other guides but Barang happily allowed us to linger longer to watch an epic lightning storm and a truly awesome sunset. It was breathtaking and driving back at dusk was amazing as well.It is worth tracking down a leaflet in Siem Reap to find the magic code and free gift! What a blast this trip was! We all loved it even though not all of our group expected to enjoy it."

            "review": "The best day of the best holiday i've ever taken. My wife and I did the full 8 hour tour and I would recommend it to anyone travelling to Siem Reap, infact I'd think you foolish to travel there and miss out on this. It's the most money that we spent on a single ticket item (165USD each) during our honeymoon, but In hindsight I would have been happy to pay double and think the day was incredible value for money. It was just the two of us and our guide, who was both friendly and professional, spoke great english and was born and raised in the area - so was very knowledable of the lay and law of the land. We saw so much of the real Cambodia: village life, rice farming, totally abandoned temples - right off the beaten track - far more intimate than the hordes at Angkor Wat.As we settled into the experience, and being a pair of adrenaline junkies, our guide upped the pace and took us on some challenging and exhillerating terrain. He really worked to what we wanted, and we did not need to ask. In the moring we were full throttle, skidding round corners in the dust, stopping at temples for some great snaps, and high fiving the village kids as we cruised past - all under blistering sunshine. Then in the afternoon, not long after a delicious local lunch; the heavens opened for a real tropical downpour. But unlike most activities I've been on, this only improved the experience. The driving style totally changed. We were no longer stopping to take snaps, but were crusing through bursting rivers up to our ankles, navigating slippery terrain and having nothing short of a real adventure.I cannot express enough how great this day was. The guide was lovely, and really let us test and push our driving abilities. We saw so much of local life in an intimate way that I don't feel we would have if we had not visited quad adventure. The service was tip top from pick up at our hotel, to drop off back at our hotel in the evening. If i'm ever back in Cambodia, I'll be sure to travel back to Siem Reap specifically for Quad Adventure.Truly Awesome."

            "review": "Heaps of fun! Prepared to get wet!. My wife and I took the 4 hour package (shared one bike) in early August 2013. Our tour guide was an awesome guy named Hong. He picked us up at our resort by TukTuk to the HQ, did a quick training and run around the block (I already know how to drive so it was short) then we were off. Being the wet season in Cambodia it was hot and sunny for the first hour, poured they next two hours and cloudy afterwards. Emotions towards the weather varied during the ride. Initially the burning sun and quad bike exhaust was bearable but starting the get uncomfortable. When the rain came it was initially a welcome relief and became quite fun after the initial shock of getting soaked. Don't be scared though as the tour guides give you raincoats and have waterproof backpacks for your electronics - I advise you to leave non-essiential items in hotel safe or at HQ. Eg. purses, passports etc. The most memorable experiences are the friendly farm kids coming out to wave at you. If you are lucky enough there'll be a line of them on the side of the road for you do drive past and do a high fives all around =) (just be careful driving as well). This will be a memory I'll cherish for quite a while. Definitely recommended to adventurers who want to see the less travelled parts of rural Siem Reap and don't mind getting muddy."

Tour is professional and safe, suitable for all ages, abilities and interests.My boyfriend was genuinely concerned about me riding the quad but it was very easy. We did the half day tour and although my initial reaction was that it was over priced, it was worth it. It was an amazing way to see the 'real' Cambodia. Driving through the villages is very memorable, seeing how the locals live, work and play is definitely the highlight of our trip. Also as you drive through all the local children run out to meet you and try to high five you as you go past.  Tip - be prepared to get a little muddy as there are a few puddles along the way."

            "review": "fun fun fun!!!!. We initially booked the sunset ride. When we arrived it started drizzling. We went ahead for the short trial nearby. Apparently those who passed the trial can ride solo, otherwise an instructor will sit behind u on your bike, so it makes the whole trip a lot safer. They gave us ponchos before we started the ride. We were told that we can stop anytime we want to take photos. When we started our journey, the rain got heavier. Nonetheless we completed the whole sunset ride, through the villages with rice fields, cows and buffaloes. It was an awesome experience!! The cows and buffaloes will give way to you. Because of the weather, we had no sunset to see. It was rain and more rain, puddles of muddy water, sandy ground became thick mud. Riding the quad bike thru the mud with dirty water splashing up your jeans and soaking up the shoes actually made it a lot more adventurous and memorable. But the rain was so bad that we only got our instructors to take a couple of photos for us quickly when it only got a tiny bit lighter and off we went again. I enjoyed talking to my instructor during the ride, learning more about the country and village life. As the ride is in the village, beware that there is no light as the sky gets dark. Use the headlights of the quad bike. The rain made it a lot more difficult to see. Even with the visor up, hoping for a better view, the rainwater keeps splashing onto the face and eyes so we travelled slowly.At the end of the ride, we were given a bottle of water and wet towel and a certificate. Tip: maybe wearing slippers or crocs is more convenient. We wore shoes and after it being soaked and dirtied we had a hard time washing them clean. Plus the drying part takes at least one day if there's sun. Overall it was an awesome experience not to be missed! I would gladly do it again!!"

We were given instruction on how the quads worked and then a short trial to make sure we (and they) were happy we could handle the bikes. The kids doubled up with an adult but that just made it even more fun. Three of the team came with us and made sure we were safe crossing the roads. If it's the rainy season don't wear anything you don't want to get muddy. We were given bags to wear over our shoes but they just proved useful for collecting water!! Seeing the local people and scenery was just so much fun. Whilst we stopped to see the sunset the kids were allowed to go off for their own drive with two of the team riding passenger!! We were told to wear long trousers and I'm glad I did as the engine did get quite warm (even with the amount of water I got on it!!).

Quad Adventures recently procured new bikes, and they were all lined up ready for their maiden rides on the day we visited. I was certainly impressed by the experience provided by Quad Adventures, and kudos to them for injecting some vibrancy into the tourism sector in Siem Reap, as well as creating a livelihood for its people. Definitely a must visit! My partner even got a certificate of achievement for completing the circuit, which I thought was a nice touch."

As other reviewers have said u can get quite muddy but when i went it had not rained for a while so the tracks were dry. The company advise you to wear long trousers i did not follow that as i thought i would be too hot but if your wearing shorts your legs do burn a bit when your out directly in the sun.Even though i was on the shortest tour Barang said as i was such a fast rider we could have a bigger tour as we made up lots of time. it was a nice touch when you return to get water and a cold towel. anyone coming to siem reap should do one of the tours they offer."

They took us for a test drive as neither of us had driven quads before - easy, all automatic. Then the kids hopped on behind us and off we went. The guide in front on a motorbike showing the way. Some roads for a short distance / crossing, but nothing too daunting. Saw lots of interesting things, I was just sorry that I had to spend time looking at the road while I drove instead of gazing around.The guides gave both the kids a chance to drive the quad bikes themselves in a safe area, which they LOVED, after that, though, the kids were a bit reluctant to let the adults drive again. When we got back after the ride the kids were presented with a certificate to show that they had driven the quads.Definitely wear long trousers, it does get hot on your legs from the engine.A little expensive, but a great experience."

The supplied guide scoots ahead on his motorbike we follow on quads. All quads automatic easy to operate. Great stops along the way and suggest lots of small gifts and healthy treats for the village kids who run out to greet you along the way when they hear the quads coming. Means sweets are arriving.You see heaps of villages along the way and rate this trip highly."

My son and his family, five us in total booked a tour, four hours in all and I can honestly say it was one of the most exhilarating times of my 72 years on this planet, even after driving rally cars for nearly thirty of them. Quad Adventure Cambodia supplied us with a tour guide on a motor bike with two other assistants also on a motorbike all of whom acted a guide and a protective guard for us when the need to cross main roads. We started off into the Cambobian country side on narrow dirt roads through the rice paddies and small villages, this was great but when we came to any of the water crossings any and all sence was thrown to the four winds. One big sploosh after the other and five very wet and muddy people emerged all smiles and very happy. And on it went for four wonderful hours, sadly it had to come to an end. What can one say? A big thank you to Quad Adventure Cambodia, Pov, our tour guide, and all associated in making a most memorable morning. Ted."

I had ever ridden a quad bike before but found it easy so didn't bother with a guide on my bike which would have been even more expensive. We chose the morning discovery tour so that we wouldnt have to deal with the monsoon rains, and we found this to be the perfect length. Don't bother with the crocodile farm which is unimpressive and unpleasant - they really shouldn't include this on the tour. The visit to the shooting range is also unnecessary if you aren't going to shoot. I would have preferred to spend that time cruising around. Do ask to stop at any time to take photos - the opportunities to do so are amazing! Make sure you wear long trousers as your legs get very hot next to the engine. Also - make sure you take enough cash as they don't accept cards. Overall I would definitely recommend this, especially if you are templed out!"

The many kids who came out to see us and wave as we passed were charming and a delight. The highlight was a visit to a local orphanage, beautiful children being given a chance in life that we all take for granted. Full marks to Herve and his people for supporting institutions such as this!Herve and his people we very patient and helpful and made the tour extremely enjoyable. we were lucky the weather was fine for our tour but we could see that it could get very muddy but agreed that was part of the experience and Herve's advice and help minimises and issues.We were offered and chose to go to a Crocodile farm but found it very ordinary and unpleasant and would not recommend it.

Obviously, you should see the temples and the trees that make all amateur photographers feel really excited, but if you're not that interested in rocks and the fact that Angelina Jolie was here a long time ago, you should hire a quad bike. The farms, rice plantations and people you see racing though narrow roads of rural areas of Siem Riep are so much better than Angkor Wat. In my opinion.Special thanks to Mony and other guys that made my day."

I had my own quad bike and the kids each had their own with a Tour Guide on the back. The kids were amazed that they were allowed to ride the bike and steer etc at the front. It was great having our own private group. Everything felt really safe, from the standard of the bikes to riding along on my own when the rest of the party had gone on a little way ahead of me. I'm really glad we each had our own bikes. I was also pleased with the length of the tour. Any shorter and I would have felt rushed as our teenagers kept stopping to hand out lollies. Any longer and we agreed we would have become too tired.I had a little practice with the Tour Guide to check I would be ok riding on my own I guess. Once we started on the tour, I thought I would have to turn around when we came to a small stream but the Tour Guide said it was fine, it wasn't very deep so I felt a lot better. Once I got through that, I thought I could get through anything. After a while I became more confident and felt like an expert by the time we returned. I'm not particularly adventurous, fit or well and I was so happy I did this, I really felt like I achieved something.After reading other reviews, I decided I wanted to see a school and a temple as well as stop for lunch. I mentioned this before we left and this was no problem at all. The best thing we did was hand out lollies to the kids. Our teenagers loved it. We ran out of lollies so just stopped at a stall along the way and bought more. The next best thing was being able to get some really cool photos of local Cambodian families, houses and the countryside etc. I just stopped my bike whenever I felt like it and snapped away.It rained for about 10 minutes twice along the way, but a bit on rain and mud never hurt anyone so we didn't worry. I washed our clothes as soon as we got back to the hotel and everything came clean.I had mentioned it was my daughters 16th birthday and they presented her with a little present when we returned which was really cute! Also, they received a certificate each which was cool.If you have an open mind, and want to experience the real Cambodia you definitely have to do this!!!"

Kids were not so enthused about the trip until our agent suggested adding Quad Biking. So I booked an afternoon with Quad Adventure.We had our own private group with 2 leaders. First my husband and I had a quick lesson to make sure we could manage on our own - easy! One leader sat behind my 14 year old daughter and led the way, the other leader sat behind my 11 year old son at the back and my 9 year old daughter sat with my husband. I have to say this was the best fun Ive had in ages.We drove around the country side of Siem Reip, past farms, villages etc but the highlight was stopping in a little village for a quick drink and handing out small packets of crisps and wrapped lollies to the village children- they were so grateful it was heartwarming. We bought extra crisps and lollies to hand out other village children along the route.We all agree this was the the most memorable part of our trip, and would recommend to young and old, even boring mums like myself laughed enjoyed the thrill of zooming down the roads!We felt safe at all times and our guides were fantastic, our tour leader was Pee.HIGHLY RECOMMEND"

Pow picked us up and ran me through the theory and practical of driving the quad. thanfully i passed and was able to drive with my wife as passenger. Pow led the way on his bike. He paid close attention to our wellbeing and modified the speed to suit our sightseeing needs. One regret is we wished we had taken sweets to give to all the beautiful smiling kids en-route. Book this and enjoy :-)"

I booked a month before on the internet, no problems at all. We were picked up from our hotel in Siem Reap, and taken to the office. Indemnity papers signed, we were ready to go. There was a small amount of on road riding to get to the country side, no big deal, you just followed the guide who rode in front. There was also a guide who rode second last, both were in radio communications. If you wanted to stop, you stopped, and the guides called a halt to the procession. Once in the countryside, you could really let your hair down. We covered all sorts of terrain, from narrow village roads, to paddy field tracks, and bitumen. The ride was 80% done in fine weather (we actually got sun burnt), but with 30km to go the afternoon monsoonal down pour hit us. Wow!! thunder and lightning, and tracks that turned to muddy slush in just minutes. It really tested our skills just to stay on the tracks, but we made it back with some expert guidance from our guides. Others have said take some sweets etc, I totally agree. The kids in the villages run from everywhere, I haven't waved so much in my life. The 2 guides we had were excellent, and meals were supplied along the way, nothing was lacking. Well done Quad Adventure."

Apart from the magnificent tours of the temples (which is, of course, the main reason why you are going to Siem Reap in the first place!), this is definitely the #2 activity to do!! I cannot recommend this enough, as there is no better way to see the outside areas of Siem Reap .... you will travel down roads and go to places that you would have otherwise never seen. We opted for the 4 hour morning tour. It starts with a safety instruction and complete review of how to operate the Quads. VERY EASY to do and never once did we feel unsafe (you are mostly on dirt roads in the country side...only a few \"main\" roads). Our tour guide, Visal, was fantastic and was extremely accommodating. He took time to explain everything we saw. During our mid-way break, we had a chance to talk with Visal about Cambodia, the people, the culture, etc...when do you ever have an opportunity like that to get such insight?Here are some tips: 1) BRING SUNSCREEN!! 2) Wear trousers, older tennis shoes, etc...you WILL get mud/dirt on you (after all, that's part of the fun!) 3) Bring a light-weight backpack 4) bring money in case you buy a trinket / water / snacks along the way...this ensures your tourist dollars are going to the people..not corporations 5) If you can, bring small t-shirts, pens, school-supply type items....you will see people/children who have absolutely nothing but are so content with life...help them out if you can. Just pick up these items in the markets before you go. We did not think of doing it, and regretted it after the trip.Thanks, Herve Family, for an eye-opening, unforgettable experience!"

The bikes were well maintained and the pick up and drop off was as scheduled and without issue. What did happen though was that the guides we were assigned brought us to places they were not supposed to. I posted these comments on my blog Ray On Time just as the owner of the company - Herve Nicole sent us an email asking us about our experience. He was very professional in responding to our feedback and we understand that the staff concerned had (prior to this) been let go when he found out about their extra curricular activities.Overall, if you are a semi-serious or more expert rider, better alternatives exist elsewhere in Asia. Over the years Cambodia has had more tourists visiting and many organisations and individuals have been capitalising on the tourist dollar. Things will hopefully improve in the years to come."

Nice personal touch. The guides are helpful and fun. The ATVs are very easy to drive. The terrain is nothing to be concerned about from the perspective of a novice ATV driver. The route is great, giving you an up close a personal perspective on the more rural parts of Siem Reap. My family took the sunset ride. Initially I was concerned that it would be too short but it was the perfect amount of time and the cool evening breeze made it really nice. Well worth the money spent. I will do it again next time I visit Siem Reap."

Herve was there to welcome us and we would be the only ones on the tour. We never rode on a quad before and was quite apprenhensive at first. We were given a safety briefing followed by a test ride. We signed an undertaking and off we go. We were told to start slow and as we build up our confidence we could go faster later on. Along the way we were given a running commentary of the the sights around the Cambodian countryside. Visal was most informative and accomodating. We were allow to stop anytime to take pictures. During our break i mentioned about visiting an orphanage. Visal told us there is one along the way but not recommended by the boss (maybe due to the fact that it involves 'hidden costs' and you know how we tourists hated this on a tour). I told him i am doing this on my own free will and insisted he bring me there. So we bought rice, instant noodles, biscuits and sweets along the way. The experience i had at the orphanage was beyond words. Never have i felt by doing so little could benefit so much. The children were happy despite having the bare minimum. I talked to them and experienced the different emotions that transcend upon me during the short time i was there. Off we go again i we made one more stop along the way-the crocodile farm. No comment here though. Towards the latter part we drove the quads like a pro and needed no more assistance from the guide. We came back and was served cool towels and drinks. We were also given our quad certificates haha. We had a short talk with Herve's wife and Visal sent us backed to the hotel. All in all a much different and meaningful tour from the temples. Highly recommended."

We were picked up on time from our hotel as advertised and were taken to the starting location where the quads were located. There was a brief checkout, 3 out of 4 of us had driven a motor bike, snow machine, or other conveyance before so this was no problem. My son's girlfriend had never driven anything other than a car, but had no problem picking up the operation of the quad.The tour lasted little over 2 hours with a good cross section of the country side visited. We had 2 excellent tour leaders (Piseth & Hong) on our trip, one leading and the other keeping the pack \"rounded up\". I was at the back of the pack and that gave me the opportunity to basically stop whenever I wanted to take photos. The others would continue on and the 2nd leader would wait at a visible point till I took my pictures and caught up and we would then reconnect with the rest of the pack (excellent).We were there in mid-May and the early morning start was a good thing since the temp by the end of the ride was already mid 30's and climbing. As long as you were moving, you didn't really notice the heat. It was very dry when we were there and you can accumulate a lot of fine red dust on your clothes. This will wash out of most fabrics but not all, depending on how much sun lotion, bug juice, etc you have applied. So don't wear anything that you wouldn't want to potentially relegate to gardening duty when you get back home.We certainly plan to do this again the next time we are in Siem Reap."

Me and my boyfriend were told we weren't allowed to share a quad as we were too heavy so I had to pay an extra $95! I was given my own quad and made to do a small test to see if I could do it, I also told them I had never driven anything motorised but they said that was fine! It started out well as the roads were flat and we weren't going too fast. After half an hour we had come to our first stop, it was just a field with no great view of the country side, just a few trees! We carried on but then our guide started to drive much faster and the roads got harder to drive on, as a consequence I ended up crashing into a pile of palm leaves, it was scary but no damage done! The guide said he would slow down a little as I was finding it quite difficult! As we carried on a noticed we were driving past a temple and other interesting things but we weren't allowed to stop as we didn't have enough time! The guide kept driving to fast and as not to lose him I had to speed up, trying to be as carful as I could! The path became much more difficult and I ended up losing control and being thrown from my quad into a 2m drop bank! I had never felt pain like it before, I thought I had broken my back! There was no concern for me from the guide he told me to get up and get back on the quad!!! I was in so much pain and was so scared to get back on the quad but I was told I had no other choice! My boyfriend insisted that I wasn't getting back on a quad of my own and that we were going to have to go straight back! We waited a small cafe for someone to come and get my quad so a could share my boyfriends! While we were waiting the guide was telling me about other people who had fallen off there quads! So it must happen quite a bit!! It's been over two weeks since I fell and my back still isn't right! It was a very expensive trip and not worth it at all!"

I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone and everyone going to Siem Reap!I went to Cambodia with my sister in November and we took turns in picking activites to do. This was her choice. I will admitt, at first I was a bit unsure. I don't drive back home in Australia and get very anixous behind the wheel of anything. They collected us late from the hotel. Apparently there had been a translation confusion and the driver went to the wrong hotel. Once we were collected (maybe 15 minutes later) we were on our way to the site. They took us out on a test drive around the block - I was close to calling it quits - I was so tense but seeing I was there already I pushed myself to do it and BEST decision ever!!!We were taken through this rural Cambodian village, where the children run along beside you waving and laughing (I don't recommend waving back - Driving a quad one handed wasn't very stable!) There were animals roaming freely and people going about their normal day life. It was incredible. You don't see this in the city and get the opportunity to see how real Cambodian people live.We stopped at the rice fields just as the sun was setting and it was AMAZING! The sky was incredible and it was such a beautiful and peaceful experience. We waited till the sun was down completely before we started on heading back - This is when the adventure part starts! The road is rocky, bumpy and narrow. You are driving along basically a walkway behind people's houses and while driving in the dark does put you on alert it was a great and fun experience! And to make up for the mix up in our pick up we got a 2 for 1 deal which was much appreicated! ** NOTE ** You are dodging animals and people while on the bikes, it does take some time to get used too and I wouldn't really recommend for younger kids - more at teenagers and adults looking for a close up experience of Cambodian life and a adventure!"

Pick up and drop off service, private tour, same tour leader: I remember Phy 3 years ago, and he's still glad to make people discover his country!, new quads!Those ones are still perfectly maintained, comfortable, and very safe for people who ride safe (we could practice for a few minutes with an instructor before the tour).Highly recommended, we will come again!"

Our day with Quad Adventure was one of the best day of mine and my boyfriends 4 months travels so far.The owner (french I think) was so friendly and efficient on the phone organising our day out so last minute for us the evening before, their lovely tuktuk driver picked us uop at 7.30 in the morning for our morning slot (there is a morning and afternoon slot), arriving at Quad Adventures we were given helmets, spoken through how to drive Quad's etc (we had driven before) and we were promptly on our way within 30 minutes. It was just me and my boyfriend in the group, I think they all take groups out separately which is fantastic. We had our guide in front of us on a dirtbike, stopping patiently whenever we wanted to take pictures. We got to see SO much driving through many villages, Cambodians on their everyday activities, little kids running out into the road to greet you, shopkeepers smiling and waving. Just amazing.... 2 hours and 15 minutes pure driving time was just enough I think we even got an hour and and half I think any more would have been too tiring and any less not enough. When we got back, we were given cold towels and promptly taken back to our hotel no messing around waiting for minibuses with 20 other people!. Brilliant day out, price may seem daunting but please DO IT......"

We were given the option to go to several places, tailoring our trip to our interests. We opted to stop at the shooting range for about a half hour and then spent the rest of our time riding through the countryside. We loved handing out lollypops to children along the way, and then when they ran out, we slowed and gave \"high fives\" as we passed by children waving to us. The ATV's were in good shape and we were able to stop and take pictures whenever we liked. This was a great way to be active and see beautiful countryside and village life."

It always felt very safe, thanks to guides Hong and Pov who were really helpful and made a lot of effort to please us during the 8 hours trip.We had a short training before starting as we had no idea how to drive the machines but it is actually very simple: accelerator and brakes! That\u2019s basically all you have to know. The French owner of the business helped us to get started and was there when we came back.We did stopped in a few villages, didn\u2019t see any white face all day and the villagers were quite friendly, especially the kids who were running behind trying to catch us in the dusty village trails.This was very well worth our money and actually the highlight of my friends stay in Siem Reap.Highly recommended after a few days in the temples overcrowded with tourists."

We were there in the wet season & yes we got very wet, but all the water just added to our experience. What we saw that day, we would never had seen if we weren't on our great new quad bikes.I have no hesitation in recommending this great activity to the world. If you are in Siem Reap this is a must.

This is a first-rate operation with perfectly maintained machines, a great local guide, and a truly hospitable owner. Though Siem Reap has some of the most jaw-dropping archeological sites on the planet, with so many ruins, it's easy to get \"templed out.\" Quad Adventure is an amazing change of pace that lets you get a bit farther afield and see the countryside beyond the city (and have loads of fun along the way). We found there was a great variety of options from remote excursions to laid back circuits in the rice paddies and outlying villages. We opted for an early morning ride and found ourselves zipping through picturesque fields and quaint little villages that we otherwise would never have seen.Thanks for a great experience. We'll be back!"

We opted for the sunset tour and was lucky enough to be picked up at the hotel by the guides on quad bikes. They started by giving us instructions on the controls on the bike as well as dos and donts when riding the bike. After donning the helmets and masks, each of us had to go for a test drive with our guide. At the end of the test, you will be handed a piece of paper telling you if you have passed or failed. For those who failed, you will have a chance for retest or opt to have a guide sit with you during the ride. Off we went on the sunset tour and the country side offers such a refreshing change from all the temple visits. It was awesome getting a glimpse of the villagers' life and they are so friendly! We stopped several times along the way for pictures and made it for the sunset in a huge field. On the way back, our guide, Hong, took us on less travelled routes and we had an exhilarating experience! I will be sure to book a longer ride with them the next time I return to SR and will definitely request for Hong! The engine heat is a little hot and can be a little bothersome if your lower calf and feet are not covered. Also, be prepared for the dust on your clothes and bags."

I have been on ATV's before so I had a experience riding on them before. The reason I wanted to do this is because I thought it would be neat to go out into the country of Siem Reap and experience something new. I was on this tour alone with just my tour guide which was great because didn't have to worry about anybody else wanting to stop or being slow. My tour guide was quite fast which was cool because I got to gun my Quad and then that becomes lots of fun when you go over small humps in the dirt. Its so cool that little kids are jumping up and down and waving at you just waiting for you to wave back at them. I had a great time doing this adventure and I would do it again if I come back to Siem Reap and bring friends with me. After you adventure is over they give you a cold bottle of water and a cold wet towel to wipe off all the dust from your face, neck and hands which was a extra plus after the trip. A Must do for a new experience and to see how it really is in the country areas of Siem Reap."

We also got to see Bakong temple which was definitely worth seeing. It was really cool seeing the villagers go about their daily tasks and one of the highlights was seeing the fish market which was incredibly busy due to it being Khmer New Year. We were both beginner riders but Chet made sure we were okay at all times and by the end of the tour, we felt that we'd been riding for days!

Firstly, it is important to get across that this is a \"Must Do\" tour which is fun and allows interaction with the locals as you pass them going about their daily business as farmers, market sellers, families and kids playing in their home environment. We also visited an orphanage and got to see the kids learning English and got to hand out sweets and gifts that we bought them. This was the highlight of the trip.I have reviewed my experience with Quad Adventure as average as although undoubtedly a wonderful excursion I do feel their is room for improvement for customer service in terms of value for money. I base my comments on the fact we had also done a similar Quad Bike tour in Phnom Penh a few days earlier. This tour was $30 each for a 2 hour sunset tour and an audio visit to the Killing Fields. The cost also included return tuk tuk pick up/drop off which was 40 minutes each way.....so we were with them for nearly 4 hours as well. Our hosts on the Phnom Penh excursion provided us with a welcomed coconut juice drink part way through the tour and water on demand. Considering the costs of the Discovery Trip offered by Quad Adventure in Siem Reap is 3 times more expensive I think that it would not be too much to ask for provision of a drink of some sort to be included whilst out in 40 degree temperature for 4 hours rather than the expectation of us having to buy our own drinks. There was also an opportunity to visit a crocodile farm but again it attracted further costs. If a drink and entry to the farm were included in the $95 each price I think it would reflect far better value for money. I hope the owners might consider this as constructive criticism for future customers as the product itself of Quad Biking across parts of Cambodia is a great concept which with a little more improvement in customer service would warrant the excellent rating I would rather be giving instead of average.But as first stated, its still a \"Must Do\""

You stop off at a local temple, orphanage and he took us to an abandoned temple which was really cool and a crocodile farm. You drive quite far apart from each other so you dont feel like your on a tour but riding along on your own. You can stop when ever you want to take pictures, when you stop they stop. Almost every house the kids came running out to wave which was cool, you cant help but smile the whole time. Ladies dont wear short shorts as the bike gets really hot and can get really uncomforable. wear long pants and any shirt you dont mind getting dirty.

For the service that you get, the mileage you cover and the level of fun you get. This activity comes highly recommended!"

He gave a quick quad overview and after a practice run we were on our way. The tour was listed as about an hour but we actually had about two so great value. The tour went out into thecountryside and through villages so got a bit of insight into rural Cambodia. Lots of kids out waving and wanting high fives but be careful as all these sweets they're getting I think they now expect you to be giving them something. One little girl got in front of my quad when i was going slow, not to stop me on purpose but to see if I had sweets and I had to carefully move round her. Overall a great trip and well worth the money. Good luck to the people that run this."

Our guide was friendly and said that we can stop and take pictures as many as we want. It was only me, my boyfriend and of course our guide. We started out driving from paved roads to dusty roads, rice paddies and muddy obstacles. It was fun to go around the temples and experience the quite side of Siem Reap. It was so nice that the kids would wave and smile at us as we pass by, Some even say hello :) We had so much fun, i was driving mad through the bumpy roads!! we did stop a few times to take pictures of the surroundings and videos of each other, our guide even took a video of me and my boyfriend driving pass by him. After the tour though we were covered with dust and some mud at our feet, we didnt mind. It's all worth it! :)"

We picked the Easy Ride since I was a nervous ninny and wasn't too keen on getting on an ATV for four hours the first time I was on it. We loved the experience-- it was really exciting to see another side of Siem Reap. Not much of a view really, but it was charming to see farm life. Our trip leader Pei was nice enough to let our girl have a go at the ATV during our pitstop. He picks you up and takes you back to the hotel. After a short orientation they give you safety gear and a face mask then you wander off their garage. On the trip itself-- It is warm... and dusty-- dress accordingly. The ATV will scorch your legs. Again, dress accordingly. Most important of all-- have fun!"

I cannot count how may times I stopped to interact with the kids and their parents, take photos and in return pass on a few lollies.Definitely take a quad by yourself, sharing just wouldn't be fun.

It was really cool to meet the owner. Their kids are so cute! The misses is from the same town as my parents, Battambang! so we started the relationship off really well. Very attentive staff and very hospitable. The tour went really well and the ATV's are really simple to handle. They go fast so be careful! They let you test drive to see what you are capable of and if you ever drove go-karts or bumper cars, you'd probably be able to do this. The tour through the countryside is amazing. The kids that run out to wave at you when you pass has to be one of the best experiences because you can tell that is one of the highlights of their day. Don't forget the candy so that you have something to give to these, sometimes naked, kids. Bring clothes you don't mind getting dirty. We found out that medical facemasks works really well. We stopped by the Roulous group right after our first break. We saw a beautiful new WAT that was just finished being built. Overall the tour was so much fun. Better then a stroll at the market or a bike ride through the temples. Nothing beats this experience."

While this is a huge part of the Siem Reap experience, it is definitely not all the city has to offer. The experience begins with your guide picking you up at your hotel and taking you (by tuk-tuk) to the Quad Adventure Tour location. After you arrive, you are given safety instructions on how to drive your ATV and get to drive it around an empty lot to get a bit of practice. You are given a helmet and mask to keep the dirt out of your face and mouth. USE IT! - the roads you will traverse are made of clay and dirt and a tremendous amount of material gets kicked up during the ride. This is particularly true is you are behind another ATV.We lucky enough to have Mr Pov as our guide. He was very friendly and extremely knowledgeable about the area. He led us down a great path combining lengths of straight road (where you can get a good velocity) and twisting roads (that will test your handling). He stopped at the perfect spot to let us see the sunset over the horizon and was happy to take pictures for us as requested. He was a superb tour-guide. The rest of the staff is exceedingly helpful as well. This was a great experience. I highly recommend it to anyone visiting Siem Reap."

I wanted to do the Discovery Tour (2 hours) but also wanted to go for sunset so they tailor made a trip just for us. Free hotel pick up and drop off. Lovely English speaking guide. 10 mins training but very easy to ride- especially if you have ridden motorbikes/ jet skis etc. Had our own bikes (much more fun). Went through villages and farms and got to see how the real people live. Can stop when ever you want for photos. If you stop to photograph children they will think you are going to give them lollies (which most people do) and I was horrified to see their disappointed little faces when I only pulled out my camera! But there are lots of little shops so when we stopped I bought a pack of lollies and handed them out as we rode. I felt like Santa Claus! Be warned though, at some points the kids were crowding around and grabbing at the bag of lollies- not all of them honest or polite! But they are so poor it is understandable :( Watched the sunset from a rice paddy field. Wear long pants and be prepared to have to throw them in the wash- you will be covered with red dust. They provide helmet and face mask- both a necessity! Great first day in Siem Reap!"

The owner is afraid that you crash their new ATVs and I saw he re-tested a lady who was actually given an OK by an instructor, only to fail her. Apart from this, the dirt road drive was a very pleasant one albeit the dust, you get to see kids playing and waving at you...making one feel very humble. The downside is our fingers and arms ache after the ride..."

They showed us how to ride (anyone can do it, it's so simple) and took us for a short test ride before letting us drive on our own. Then we went off following our tour guide who was on a motorbike. It was a lot of fun, and so fun waving back to all the Cambodian children you will see waving at you from the side of the road! I would not have done longer than the 1.5 hour tour, though, but that's just me. :). If you are \"templed out\", as we were, this is a great option."

Being experienced riders we quickly got into the swing of things. The hardest thing all day was to try and get past our guide. We were told at the strt not to ask our guide to go fast, but he had no option because he had to lead and when we were travelling over some of the dirtiest and roughest roads in the outback he was passed twice only all day. We all had a blast going around the unspoilt villages in the country then crossed over the main road and went bush. Riding through the jungle tracks at top speed was fantastic, we even managed quite a few photo stops then when the guide wasn't looking tried our best to leave him behind, but to no avail, he was quicker on two wheels than us on four. After eight hours of exceptional fun we finally called it quits and returned to base completely covered from head to foot with fine brown dust . Was it fun, you bet, would we do it again, you bet! At one third the cost of a similar tour in our own country it was a cheap and thrilling day out."

Having never ridden a quad bike before I was pretty scared, but the instructor was lovely & showed us how to operate the bikes in great detail & even went on a little practice run before setting off. We went out of town into the villages, through paddocks with crops growing & cows grazing. Riding past village huts the children all run out to wave at the tourists passing by which is very cute. It is amazing to see how the Cambodian people out of the city live & would definitely recommend the quad biking to anyone."

The quads where powerful enough to get through sandy and washed out roads easily. We saw many villages and it was really great to see the villagers go about their day (we took the morning tour). Wear cloth that can get dirty, the roads are dusty. We all had long sleeves and pants over the knee on just to avoid to get sunburnt. our guide Ray was very helpful, explained things along the way and stopped enough to make photos. He maintained a nice speed and we always felt save with him. Midway we made a break at a local bar to drink something and use the bathroom."

The trip was almost entirely off road which made it incredibly fun, dirty, and allowed us to see some \"real\" areas of Cambodia. We've lived in South Asia for 4 years and have done a few of these tours. This business has the best maintained vehicles and safety equipment we have seen in the region. In addition our English speaking guide was friendly and flexible with the itinerary. He was proactive about making the trip an enjoyable and safe experience for us all.During the trip we were able to stop at the Crocodile farm and the shooting range. If I had to do it over again I would skip the Crocodile farm. Entrance was $3/person to see the animals piled on one another in relatively small enclosures. Beyond that the viewing conditions were entirely unsafe for the humans. The narrow walkways extend over the pits and the railing would in no way stop a person (child) from falling over the edge to a certain gruesome death. With that said, my animal maniac 8 year old loved it! It shook my wife and I up a little. The shooting range was great and more safe than the Crocodile farm. All of us were able to shoot an M16 at the indoor range (30 rounds for $50). The guns are bolted to a rail that only allows then to point down range and limits the kick back. In the lobby they have prop guns to pose with.As others have said be sure to wear cloths that you don't mind getting dirty. We were covered in dust. I wished I had brought a helmet cam to capture the views and sites along the tour. Finally, we realized half way through why the children run out to wave at the quads... They want candy. We purchased some lollies and liberally distributed throught the second half of the trip. The boys loved handing out the candy as it made them feel like Santa Claus."

We took some lollies with us for the kids, though you may get swarmed with kids if you stop at a school. You get a personal guide, our guide was great and asks if you wanna see things nearby (crocodile farm, shooting range, Angkor wat temples tho you need your pass or small other small temples). Crocodile farm isn't that good, just lots of crocs in dirty water. We did morning discovery tour and overall lasted close to 3hours. I think half day may be a bit too long as you will get tired and the shorter tours are too short,. If you're budget conscious, ride double on one quad. Overall awesome fun and though more expensive, a unique experience "

Yes please!My now new friend phy come picked us up at our hostel and took us too the place, as we arrived we got greeted by all the staff including the owner. We sat down and chilled out for 5 minutes until phy showed us our quads and how to ride them, even tho me and my other half are experienced it was still nice to get to know the Quad I'd be ridingBefore we set off we had a mini driving test with phy just round the corner he already had me laughing. Coming back we laughed how my girlfriend was alot better than me then we were off! On our personally little tour of the countryside a side to Cambodia we've never seen. Riding through cool places and seeing some awesome stuff phy was always there checking of we were okay but at the sametime giving us our freedom! We arrived with enough time for phy to take pictures of us and have a smoke, see the true Beauty of the sunset and chat about tattoos and our pubs in England. Driving back at night with the cool breeze and still the epic sunset in mind you could do no more than smile. When we arrived back we was greeted with wet towels to wipe down all the dust(which we was hoping was a new tan) and ice cold bottle of water. We chatted with phy a bit before him droppings home making sure we got in safe. Overall an amazing experience!! I'm still smiling hours later. Got to say it was brilliant but phy made it special.

The scenery is amazing if you can catch a glimpse of it, but there's plenty of time to stop and get some photos.The tour guides are friendly & good for a laugh, and don't make you feel bad for driving like a blouse (generally).One thing I will say is that we kind of sped through people's villages a little fast, especially as all the kiddies come rushing out of their homes to wave at you (or rather the convoy of quad bikes roaring through their neighbourhood at a million miles per hour). The tour guides seem happy to fang it through the villages, but maybe do as we did (eventually) and take it easy through those bits?"

Make sure to wear long pants and runners. This time of year is particularly dusty so be prepared to wear glasses of some sort just to protect your eyes a bit. The french owner runs a good show, he's not particularly engaging as when I returned to their main office he didn't ask me what I thought of the trip or anything, which I thought was a bit odd. And quite frankly out of character with most good tour operators in SR, but you spend all your time with the locals guides so really it didn't matter in the end.

Very professionally run tour from the initial contact, to the pickup, to the safety demonstration, the tour and being dropped back at my hotel. I signed up for the discovery tour (2hours 15 min) and was really ecstatic to find out that I was given a private tour with my own tour guide. I was later told that all of the tours were 'private' as either you go with your group of people, or if you are just one person you go on your own! This was particularly wonderful for me, as I wanted to ride more than take pictures and therefore did not have to stop much throughout the tour. Despite this, we did stop at a pagoda, a shooting range (I fired an AK47 amazing!!) and a temple. Each visit was nice, but my favourite part was simply riding through the countryside checking out the surroundings and waving at the smiling and friendly Cambodians as we zipped by. The Quad I was on was in great condition, went quite fast and was a pleasure to ride! I highly recommend this tour."

My husband and I were in Siem Reap for his birthday and I wanted something fun to surprise him with and after reading the great TripAdvisor reviews I decided to book a half-day tour with Quad Adventure. It was fantastic. We really enjoyed going around through the countryside, through rice paddies, through small villages and we even went through a very busy fish market! There were also cows and buffaloes around the place and it was quite amusing to find yourself stuck behind a herd of buffalo on the road. It was a great way of seeing the area. It was excellent! Our guide, Hong was great. He was very friendly and professional and he even stopped and picked us some berries that we could eat! He was happy to take photos of us and wait for me when I stopped randomly to take photos of the different places. The kids in the houses were also very excited to see us and would sprint down from their house to the side of the road to wave at us as we drove by. We really enjoyed our trip and would highly recommend it to others!"

As the website states, a sunset tour \"that ends with a beautiful view of the setting sun as it dips below the rice fields\" - I thought that would make a very nice photo but I wasn't prepared for the impatient escort rider at the paddy field.You don't ride in a group - you are assigned an escort rider - even if you booked for one person. After a short briefing, the escort will ride behind you on a short test run - just so that you are comfortable stopping and turning in the quad. So each group would arrive at the paddy field at different times. The first leg of the tour is quite flat - just have to watch out for kids and animals. I stopped to take some photos of the village scenes (we were informed we could) but at the paddy field where you alight and watch the sunset, and after taking the customary photo on the quad, the escort rider was in quite a hurry to continue. There was a family herding buffaloes past us which I found interesting, but the rider just wanted to get moving. I was a bit annoyed with him and I asked him what the hurry was. No reason, but I suspect there was a certain time you had to complete the tour by and maybe I was the last person? But on the way back, there were other quad riders behind me, so I wasn't really the slow coach. The ride back to the Quad base was much more exciting - as the terrain wasn't so flat anymore, and it was getting dark, and there were plenty of muddy puddles to ride into. Fortunately, my annoyance was short-lived replaced by the excitement of the second leg of the ride. In short, just enjoy the ride and if you want pictures, bring along a point and shoot camera, at least for the sunset tour. I'm sure for the other longer tours, there will be more photo-taking opportunities."

The quads were nice, high quality, well maintained so we felt safe while riding. The guides were fabulous. We had two guides for our group of three and they were friendly, attentive and engaged us in fun conversation about the area (pretty much just responding to our various questions about where we were going and what we were seeing). Not only did we get to see beautiful views of the rice fields but also small tree lined streets going through little villages. The kids that run to the road to wave were so adorable. I'd recommend the morning tour as it's not too hot yet and you have the rest of the day to make other plans. This is definitely worth the money if you are in Siem Reap!"

They are super safety conscious - give you a good breakdown of how to ride a quad (ATV) and there are about 4 of them who follow you as you weave throught the dusty and bumpy backside. One leading, one trailing and two in between. And whenever we crossed a major intersection two of e guides stopped traffic on either end so our convoy could follow in unison without coming to a complete stop.Our guides brought us to a rice field where we could watch the sunset and then they took a ton of group photos. While doing so they were all super giddy - in party like mode, which made the experience very fun. In other words, they were not boring at all. The actual ride was sweet. Power! Just rip it through the streets, hitting bumps when you can. Guaranteed, by the end of the ride you will be covered in dirt and dust. Word of advice: go in smaller groups so you can just floor the quad and go at unreal speeds! More people slow the pace down. At the end of the tour they give you a nice wet hot cloth to wash you face. Take a picture of how dirty that was cloth is afterwards. Lol."

Our teens had guides sitting behind them who didnt interfere, just told them the way to go when necessary - so they could go at their own pace and didnt feel they needed to keep up.

Having the kids waving at you is good fun too but remember to slow down as you go past them as the quads kick up a bit of dirt and there were a couple of occasions where perhaps the parents shouldn't have let such young children get involved as they were desperate to touch the quads as we went past - but as long as you are considerate, nobody should get hurt!

Our guide was lovely, kept stopping for us as taking photos, went the perfect speed for us (haha he slowed down when we slowed down) and helped us across the major roads (driving through the back streets of Siem Reap is definitely something to experience!).The flier advertised that of you booked online you would receive a free gift. In the excitement and bustle of the afternoon the company (and I) forgot about this gift. I emailed as soon as I got back to the hostel and was informed it would be dropped off. I don't know if it was just bad luck but by the Time we flew out the next day (midday) we still didn't have it, although had been informed by email that the manager had tried twice to deliver it.. I wonder what it was? :-)At any rate, this company is excellent and you should give them a go!"

My husband and I booked our discovery trip the day before and Herve was very quick to confirm via email our hotel pick up at 12:30 the next day.We got picked up by a tuk-tuk from put hotel on time an were driven to the quad-bike centre. After a short introduction on how to drive the bikes (which were extremely easy) we went for a short test drive to prove our competence before the trip was confirmed, we got kitted out with dust masks and helmets and we paid. Then we were off to explore rural Cambodia!! It is true that at the beginning of the trip we crossed one mainish road, but I would like to stress that our guide (sadly we can't remember his name) ensured that we crossed safely and the safely aspect was maintained throughout the entire trip! We drove through villages and rice fields which gave us the real insight to life in Cambodia and after about 20 minutes I knew I wanted to extend our trip to half a day if we can. We stopped wherever we wanted to take photos and out guide also took photos of us several times. When he asked if we had our temple passes on us, he took us to another temple called Banteay Samre plus another one in the middle of the forest. We then asked him if we could extend our trip to half a day and after a quick call to his boss, it was all sorted. The rest of the afternoon continued to be a fun, exhilarating and fascinating experience. It was a shame when we had to head back to the centre at around 5 pm. In summary, after having read some of the reviews, we want to share our experience. We were not taken to any school or orphanage or asked for any donations, the bikes were really new and safe, the guide was friendly, knowledgable, safety conscious and was always checking if were ok and were having fun. The prices are published and we felt it was good value for money and with hindsight we wished we booked a full day trip. The trip is on quad-bikes, on dirt trails so don't be surprised to get dirty and dusty! It is part of the experience and fun!!Finally we would like to thank the centre and our guide our unforgettable trip!!"

Initially, I was a bit nervous because this always seemed to me as Westerners running around the country like colonialists. However, the trip ended up being some of the most fun I've had in SR. The guide took us through some very remote areas in the countryside allowing us to see villages, markets, and temples that were not frequented by the tour buses. The guides allowed us to stop whenever we wanted to take pictures, rest, talk to the locals, and give high fives to the kids lining the roads to wave to us. We only did the two-hour ride but next time I'll definitely do the four-hour ride to see even more of the surrounding country-side.This company is run by a friendly French man. When talking to the tour guides it was clear that they respected and liked him and felt they were part of the larger family. This family atmosphere definitely came across in how the tour guides treated us, they were friendly, engaging, and very open to talk about anything. I highly recommend this activity for adults and families as well. Kids can ride with the parents and they are well prepared for that as well."

You can observe the farmers working in the fields or have a chat with school children that run towards you as they see you arrive. Their smiling faces will remain a great memory. Our friendly guide, Ray, took us also to the tempel of Bakong which was interesting to see and by far less crowded then the ones around Angkor Wat. The company is run by a french guy and absolutely serious, the quads and the equipment are in good shape. Maybe just check your insurance as you will need to sign a discharge."

However, pretty much the first thing you do is go through some training where they make sure you're able to safely ride on your own. Safetly is obviously a priority as my friend didn't seem to get it right the first time. As a result they got someone else to go through with him again to ensure he had it right. They were still a little concerned so they got a guide to sit on the back of his quad. He got it afterwards but it's great to see that they take things seriously (having said that, it's not all that 'dangerous' anyway..unless you do something crazy).It was great to ride through the fields and small dirt roads. There were many smiling faces and good scenery along the way. Also, obviously dependent on your luck, having a herd of ox on the road walking towards you and then passing your quad bike was simply amazing. We also stopped at the Bakong temple of the Rolous Group.The only annoyance (which isn't exactly the fault of Quad Adventure Cambodia) is that it got extremely dusty. As a result I stayed quite a distance behind my friend, who had the guide sitting on the back of his quad, to ensure that the dust in my face was lessened. However, I still ended up with thick, red dust caked up in my eyes which was rather uncomfortable (and dangerous if you don't slow down/stop at times as it felt like some bigger pieces got in my eye). The helmet they provided did have a visor but the space between the eyes and the visor was too large that dust can easily get in. My friend was lucky as they provided him a pair of sunglasses. A face mask was also provided so you wouldn't breathe it in which was great.I did the 'Discovery' option which I thought was just the right amount of time for a first time quad-biker."

That was probably a good thing because although I drive regularly, there were instances where the ATV has to really manuveur through the paddy fields/ people, and it was nice to have someone helping me. Halfway through, they take you to a sunset point amidst the fields, which is beautiful. They also give you a certificate at the end of the tour and provide a free drop off :)"

Only thing that would've made the experience better would've been goggles. Sunglasses, helmet visor, and bandanna were not enough to keep fine dust from flying into my eyes and completely irritating them by the end of the ride.We were all experienced riders so we opted for the 4 hour tour. The bikes were of good quality and in excellent condition. We were lucky to be the only 4 people booked for the afternoon ride so we enjoyed a \"private\" tour. At the beginning of the ride we agreed on the route, including villages, ruins, a stop to eat, and a stop at a shooting range. The ride truly gives you an insight into the way of life of the locals.

With his company, SAFETY COMES FIRST, NO EXCUSES! Read thoroughly on his faq and be prepared. A quad each for the discovery tour was USD 58 each. But this is the price for imported high quality and excellently maintained quads!First off, I would advise people to book directly with the company - Quad Adventure Cambodia was the first Quad business in Siem Reap and after that, another opened right next to them which are owned and run by a rich Khmer family from Phnom Penh (Siem Reap Quad Adventure).BOOK DIRECTLY WITH THE COMPANY AND NOT THE HOTEL!Secondly, you'll be picked up at your hotel. They will be on time. Look for a guy in a red collared shirt! Some hotels will not even let the guys inside because they already have a higher commission deal with the other Quad company.Once you get to the Quad Adventure Cambodia headquarters, there'll be a short lesson on riding a quad bike. If you are confident and have experience riding one, excellent! If not, they will immediately tell if you are inexperienced and a bit scared no matter what you say! But don't worry, there will be a guide sitting behind you, which I didn't mind.Finally, you'll be off on your adventure, on the road, then through some rice paddies, along some streams, through some villages. Many children will run out and wave. Wave back!Also AVOID THE POOP ON THE ROAD! It will seriously go EVERYWHERE if you do! You will be asked whether you want to visit the orphanage or school. Some people think this part is a bit dodgy. There may be a suggestion to buy a bag of rice or a box of noodles to give to the kids there. Obviously, the guide takes a commission from the shop for this so seriously guys, DON'T BE SURPRISED. These are poor people just trying to make a living in every way they can. And plus, the schoolkids get rice.Highly recommended to stop at the pagoda if you are doing this tour. It's great to look at, and if you are Buddhist, go inside and light some incense.A stop at the crocodile farm is good too. If you are daring, go inside and hold a baby crocodile, and beware the monkeys!This should be the next on your list aside from visiting the temples and the museum! If you can handle it, go to visit Kulen Mountain, the waterfall, Banteay Srei and Kbal Spean. That is definitely the first on our list on our next visit to Siem Reap!Once finished and back at the quarters, you'll get a cold towelette and a bottle of water."

He picked us up in a tuk-tuk and took us back to Quad Adventures, giving us a tutorial and then I drove and he rode with me to make sure I could drive it. I passed! Pov went with my 12-year old and I took my 8-year old with me. It was amazing. Pov was super-friendly, helpful, and fantastic. He was a great guide and he took us to a rice paddy to watch the sunset and volunteered to take pictures of us on the bike. My kids thought this was the best part of the trip - we had a great time! If we had more time, we would definitely go out again. I would recommend doing this early in your trip so if you love it, you can go again. It's not just the thrill of riding the ATV, it's going through the real countryside and seeing scenery of real-life Cambodians, not just what you see on the temple trail. Excellent."

The ride started off with an introduction on how to ride the bikes and we went for a practice ride with our guide to make sure we were capable. We then started our ride, which went for just over an hour. It included riding on sealed road, dirt roads and smaller tracks. The scenery was interesting and there were opportunities to stop for photo shots or at a small shop for drinks. The only thing I would say is for non-confident riders, you do drive on public roads, so do have to be aware of the traffic around you. The bikes are also big 4 wheeler bikes, so I would definitely suggest riders be at least 16 to be strong enough to handle them."

When we got there we were greated with fresh cold towels, helmets and masks. I would suggest wearing dark coloured clothes and old clothes. It's a very dusty ride. Firstly were given a lesson on how to drive the quad bikes then taken for a test drive to see if we passed the test. Unfortunately I did not, perhaps cause I was short, but a blessing in disguise. I had a guide come with me just to ensure I was ok on the roads. I drove the whole way. The sunset tour is the by far the best. We got to see the villages of the country, extremely cute kids hi fiving us as we drove. As the sun was setting we stopped to take pics of the rice paddies and the sun setting, it was simply beautiful.Definitely recommend using this place. The owner is a bit strange, but his staff are great, very sweet and friendly."

After a quick yet efficient overview of the quadbike, we were off.We did the hour long easy circuit, and although there wasn't much in the way of historical landmarks to see, driving through the countryside and passing the local farmers herding their cattle and other villagers about their daily life was a totally different side to Cambodia. It did unfortunately start to rain while we were out - the poncho provided turned out not to be too helpful! - but bombing through the mud and puddles was equally fun!Thanks - Rob and Laura"

The guys there give you a tutorial and go on your first driving attempt before deciding that you know how to drive well enough to go out with the group. The guys at the shop dont take too many people out at a time; there were only three of us along with guide, when I went out there. We drove through rice fields, local villages where the kids run out waving, to a temple and pagoda, and a place midway through our trip to get water if we didnt have it or use the bathroom. After we returned, we were given a cool wet towel, which revealed how dusty we actually got from the ride (something you dont notice while you are out there driving around). I chose the 2 hour trip, however once it was complete, wished I had opted for the longer trip. Two hours fly by! In all, I would definitely recommend the quad adventure to anyone when was in Siem Reap (or nearby). I would also do it again if/when I am back there."

Both of us tried Quad biking at US$28 each bike. She was 12 yr old and she had a coach that seat behind her and guide her for the adventure ride. The things that we had seen was an eye opener for her as the cows, goats and dogs were walking along the farm freely. Kids were playing and swimming along the river. Most of the people will wave when you drove past their homes. The Lifestyle of the Cambodian People was very carefree and simple.

Quad adventures sent someone to pick us up from our hotel, and dropped us off at no additional cost. The facilities provided were also excellent. As none of us had experience riding a quad bike, a thorough briefing and demonstration was given prior to setting off. Helmets, face masks were also provided. None of us had experience on a quad bike, and only one of us had a driving license. However, they were very encouraging and allowed us to try driving the quad bikes. With an instructor riding behind us, we felt safer as there was little way we could have met with an accident. They would guide us initially when it comes to steering, but after a while, left most of the driving to us. My instructor would take the time to point out interesting sights and photo opportunities along the way. He was very helpful and kept volunteering to help us take photos along the way, and helped us carry our small backpacks so we could drive without carrying our bags. As we were asked to keep two hands on the handle bars while driving, my instructor was very friendly and waved to all the villagers that we passed by.Throughout the hour-long trip, we got to take 3 breaks during the trip. After a while, pressing the accelerator with the right thumb could get a bit tiring, and the breaks were well arranged. While there is no dress code, I would recommend wearing long pants for the ride as the engine could get quite hot. One of us had her inner right calf scalded by the hot engine as she was wearing shorts.One hour was almost not enough for us. Quad Adventures take good care of their equipment, and everything from the bikes to the helmets were in great condition. They would wash these equipment immediately after we had used them so that they would be clean for the next user. Upon return, they also offered us complimentary cold water and a cold towel for us to wipe off the dust. We each had a certificate after the ride as well.A great experience! A bit pricey, but definitely highly recommended. We would go for a longer duration if we were to ride again!"

I booked a 4 hour morning tour for myself, the pickup was arranged for 6.30am from my accommodation and the guide was waiting patiently at the allotted time. He introduced himself and explained he would be my guide for the day. Upon arrival at the office, I was asked to sign a waiver form and given a complete rundown of how to ride the quad bike. I was given a helmet and face mask and off we went. I could have had a short practice session to get used to riding, but I explained we have a quad bike on the farm so I have experience in riding one.Through rice paddies, back roads, markets and farms we passed many water buffalo, cows, dogs, pigs, chickens, ducks and people including smiling, waving children at every home. It was explained that I could stop at any time I wanted to take photographs or to visit or see something more in depth. The guide rode ahead on a dirt bike and his hand signals were clear and in advance so there was no guessing as to where we were turning or heading. Upon arrival back at the office i was given a cold wet towel to wipe off the red dust (yes you get a bit dusty) and a cold bottle of water before being taken back to the hotel door for a much needed shower. 4 hours was a fair amount of time, but was just right for me and I would highly recommend this tour to anyone of any age group, it was the next best thing to seeing the temples of Angkor Wat in Siem Reap in my opinion.

When I booked the trip, I didn't realize that we would get our own tour guide which was great. I thought we had to follow in a large group. One thing I regretted was not bringing along things for the children we met along the way. You will see how poor the people are and how hard they have to work in the fields. When we stopped for a drink, we bought candy and it was wonderful to see the wonderful smiles on the children's faces. I think books or color pencils or even clothes would have made better gifts to these children. Our guide said that some visitors come prepared with little bags of rice to give to the people there. This is a must do if you want to see life in Siem Reap beyond the superficial tourist spots like Pub Street. On a separate note, if you hire a tuk tuk driver for the whole day, be mindful that these are people. Invite them to join you for lunch instead of letting them wait in the hot sun. We convinced our tuk tuk driver to eat with us and we end up talking with him and the waitress for over an hour. You will learn how corrupted things can be in Cambodia and how difficult life can be."

You do get very dusty!! So wear things you don't mind getting a bit dirty.Whilst driving around there are lots of kids who run and wave it's very cute. We bought a bag of sweets to give to them and they really appreciated it. One thing they don't tell you is that everyone has there own guide which is great. However had we known this we would have requested to go in the afternoon for sunset. On the flyer it seems like the only way to get sunset is by doing the sunset your which is too short. That's not true just ask.As I mentioned above we did two hours I was loving it and wanted more however my wife (who also loved it) had enough after 2 hours so its up to you.All in all a great day. Very safe, great bikes and great value. remember ask for Visal you won't regret it he is the best. Also if you boom online or ask nicely before you book they will give you a free polo shirt, which is nice."

We only booked the half day due to the price as at first we thought it was quite expensive but now wish we had booked the full day. There were four of us, we were picked up and given a safety demonstration before setting off on our half day excursion. The quads were modern and well maintained. We had 3 \"outriders\" on motorbikes who positioned themselves at the front, middle and back of our convoy, once we approached a main road the middle and rear guys would shoot up in front and stop the traffic for us to continue. We were taken into some wonderful places with amazing scenery. The locals were always smiling & waving as we drove past and we had plenty photograph stops. Our guides were more than helpful and extremely friendly, we visited an orphanage which even had it's own pig farm ! After returning back to base we were tired and filthy due to the dust but with the biggest smiles on our faces. If you go to Siem Reap this is a must, will definitely go back and do the full day next time."

It was so giving to see them so happy. I just wished I would have brought something that was useful to them and not a short time enjoyment. If you have some good idea to give them, I would do it if I were you. You will never regret seeing their happy faces. Our guide was nice and so was the scenery.

The terrain was dirt road with mud and puddles, the color was very interesting - bright red dusty road. The scenery is cambodian villages you see houses animals and kids that always run to wave to you and say hello or hi. My suggestion to you is to wear clothes and shoes that are very easy to wash. Shoes can be anything as long as its not flipflops. My jeans and tshirt were so red from the dust and i am not sure if they will ever be like before again :-) My face was red too and in the hotel the guy asked me if i was wearing makeup :-) they put some covers on the shoes but still some dirt got thru. Be careful who you go there with, if they are calm and slow they will speed down the whole group and will significantly reduce the fun. Lower people in the group = more fun :-) i think the price is fine as it is comparable with the prices at home and it is very hard and expensive to maintain these quads in cambodia. This was a good breakaway from the temples :-)"

The sunset view, the rides through the paddy fields, the tracks through the village, gorgeous beautiful children waving at you every time you pass by. Nothing can beat that!

I had an amazing day riding around the beautiful countryside of Cambodia. I would really recommend the full day tour, it allows you to see more of the amazing countryside and also we squeezed in a visit to the floating village which I would also recommend. I would quite happily have spent my whole holiday riding around the country side, it was so much fun. I also felt like the celebrity as all the kids come to wave as you ride by.The quad bikes are fun and very easy to ride, as other reviewers mentioned they are new and well maintained and make the difficult terrain easy to navigate. The staff are also excellent and it is all very well organised. I really appreciated being picked up and dropped off at the hotel as it's just one less thing to worry about. Also they were very responsive to me making the booking and any questions I had. They also had nice thoughtful touches like a wet towel at the end to wipe the dust off and face masks to protect your from the dust.Vichet was our guide and he was really nice and friendly and very knowledgeable and chatty also he didn't seem to mind me stopping all the time to take pictures of the amazing views. We stopped off for lunch at a little local restaurant which was nice (apparently they used to give you a packed lunch, but I think this was much better this way as you got to try the local food). All in all I cannot recommend this enough, if you are in Siem Reap spend a day here and do the full day tour, you won't regret it. I got a free shirt at the end with the company logo on it and I will be wearing it with pride as I remember the amazing day.A few tips: - definitely remember your sun glasses to protect your eyes from dust and dirt and also the sun is very strong - don't wear a white shirt or trousers as you will get covered in the red Cambodian dust (it took the wet towel they give you at the end and two showers back at the hotel to finally get rid of all the dirt)- get a second face mask at the start as they break quite easily but are really good at keeping the dust out of your lungs- don't worry about being hot because when you are riding the breeze keeps you cool- take lots of pictures you'll want to remember the day."

As part of the fee a tuk tuk picked us up from our hotel at 4.30pm to take us to their location on the edge of town. Upon arrival we were given full instructions on how to drive the quad bikes and taken out with an instructor for a test drive. Instructors are really good & the quad bikes easy to use (their automatic). The 2 of us then went out on our own quad bikes with an instructor, soon realised why they advised to wear long trousers (get warm round your ankles). You quickly arrive in the countryside and can stop to take photos whenever you like. The Guide stop at sunset in a paddy field & took some great pictures of us. Then drove back through villages into town. Back by 7.30pm"

I travelled through Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam but this tour was the best part of the whole trip. I took the discovery tour and it was just amazing. Firstly my guide was incredibly helpful, the bikes were in good order and very easy to operate and I was collected At my hotel. We set off into the countryside through the paddy fields with locals going about their daily routine. The views were breathtaking and the people were so friendly. As we got further into the country the roads/passages got narrower and lined with trees. Then the best part. As our quad bikes were a novelty the children just loved them. They would hear the bikes coming down the paths and they would literally run full blast from their house to greet us with huge beaming smiles, waves and high fives. I literally drove for 40 Kms and I just waved non-stop at kids coming to greet me. It was humbling and just an amazing experience. It was so good that I convinced my sister who was on the trip with me to do the Discovery tour the very next day. She did not want to do it the first day because she was sceptical of driving a quad bike for 4 hours. She thought the trip was awesome also and I enjoyed my second time around every bit as much as I enjoyed the first. All I can say is that if you are in Siem Riep you have to do this trip. I only heard about the tour on this trip advisor site so I just wanted to add my experience and recommendation. You will not regret it. 6 months later and I am still recalling it and have loads of pictures of the smiling children and the glorious countryside to remind me as well.Amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I didn't really know what to expect from them but the final result was above all the expectations. In my case that I like a bit of adventure and speed they let you play the game, always within security limits but I saw other people going at a much slower pace (this older lady with her very young kid) and they coach you and help you as much as you need. The sights they take you too are a good mixture of nice views and bumpy dirt tracks where you can have loads of fun driving on the ponds...I had a lot of fun with them, and above all I found them really really profesional, much higher of what you would expect in a place like Siem Reap. I really recommend them to anybody looking for a different way of seing the hidden Siem Reap."

The country side around Siem Reap is beautiful.Hong, our guide, was an extremely cool guy, We stopped at a few places, including a very nice new Buddhist temple, and few places where we could enjoy the spectacular scenery and the company of the local kids. You will get dirty so don't bring your best clothes, and because of the sun I would recommend a long sleeves, and take the plastic bags they offer to put on over your shoes. Be careful though, that you will be riding the quad not without a reason. You are going on a dirt track, with paddles, bumps. If it is your piece of cake you will have a lot of fun just to ride the quad by itself, the guide will adapt to your style, so if he sees you are doing all right he will increase the pace on the front so you can enjoy the quading more.I would do it again and again."

The staff were fantastic and very thorough in going over the instructions and getting us all to take a trial drive out before approving us for solo driving.The sunset drive is the perfect trip after a long day looking at temples and before hitting Pub Street. Altogether it's probably 90 minutes of splashing through puddles and mud along the tracks and roads in the rice paddies while frogs, buffalo, cows and many,many hundreds of smiling children share your path with you. You get to stop halfway to watch the sunset and then continue on as it gets dark.Some puddles are surprisingly deep too! The bikes are all new and despite lots and lots of mud they didn't seem troubled by any of it. They do get quite hot by the end though.I think the best way to book is to email from their website. Herve must check it frequently as we heard back within minutes. Our two kids (11 and 7) rode with us on two person bikes and they loved it too despite not getting to have their own bikes. Everyone gets a helmet too although the visor on mine was a bit hard to see through- I kept my sunglasses on until it was too dark to see properly.The 2 riders that came out with us said that sometimes tourists bring pens, pencils or other school supplies to give to some of the children along the way- we hadn't thought to bring any but would if we did it again.Altogether it was a very enjoyable break from temple exploring and Quad Adventures run a very professional company.

We chose the full 8 hour day trip to ensure that we got the most out of the day. We set off just after 8am and stopped for early refreshments an hour or so later, we went off the beaten track through puddles, dusty roads, villages and temples. The kids are amazing, running up to the road to smile and wave, take some small sweets and hand them out they are so grateful. Lunch was at a local restaurant and was really tasty and then we went back to the same place we had stopped in the morning for refreshments on the way home. If you have Angkor Temple tickets you can include this in your trip, but ours had expired and I was happy enough touring round local roads and villages and getting filthy (it's only dirt).Chet was a really good guide, happy to stop whenever we wanted, to explain the local ways and religion. We stumbled across 3 lads climbing a palm tree and was treated to completely fresh coconut milk. The scenary was really impressive.Not the cheapest of trips, but a lot of the tracks we went down you would struggle unless you was on foot and the quads were in top condition."

Vichet was an outstanding guide, leading us in fast paced segments as well as slower portions to interact with the children (bring candy) along the route and taking us thru wet and muddy terrain as well.

Me, being a fairly inexperienced driver, was very nervous, but it turned out there was no need. They gave us a little training run first. Then we were on our way, with the guide on a dirt bike in front. We visited an orphanage along the trip, which was a beautiful experience. The children were so bright and lovely and taught us about their classes and lifestyle. Whilst we were doing this our guide went out of his way to charge our camera, which had died within our first few minutes of driving. The only thing you have to watch out for are the cows and dogs (that don't move for no one).We loved it so much, we did it a second time two days later. I would recommend this to anyone who was visiting Siem Reap and will certainly be doing it again next time we visit."

I booked a quad bike tour whilst in Siem Reap recently, at first I wasn't sure as it was raining all morning and I was very hungover......however they sent a free pickup and off I went, the sun came out and I ended up having one of the single best experiences of my entire trip! The quad itself was both in excellent condition, spotlessly clean and 'man' sized, even had decent amount of power - all the opposite to my last quad biking experience in England. It was quiet seasons and nobody else was on the tour, but the price was still the same and it meant I could just stop anytime I wanted to (the guide rides ahead and stops when you do) to take photos and meet the local kids - I'd recommend doing that as they really are amazing, so happy - take a few pencils if you can, they don't ask for anything they just want to say hello.I did the 2hour (was 2.5 in the end) tour, was just right, an amazing way to see the stunning countryside, away from the tourist spots, right out there with the locals - couldn't stop smiling the whole time. Also as it was wet and as the quad had some power it was really good fun splashing around, if its wet prepare to get very muddy - but totally worth it! They provided shoe covers, they might look silly but trust me - use them! Overall I'd recommend this to everyone, would be awesome fun with a group of friends. The company was very welcoming and professional, thanks for the great memories!"

Each time I have booked a trip we have gone on different roads and through different villages.

Herve was prompt in e-mailing us the pick up time from our Angkor Pearl hotel. The pick up was prompt at 10am by the company tuk tuk. We were driven to the south of Siem Reap giving us another opportunity to see life in other parts of Siem Reap.Herve met us and made sure that we were aware of all liabilities and knew how to operate the quad bike. It was easy once you knew how. One does not ride it like a motor bike ie bending into each turn. The ride would be very comfortable but the rutted country roads can be very bumpy. So we were glad to have done the shortest tour. That said it was a very enjoyable experience and one that we would not have missed.The advice provided by the company to wear long pants and long sleeves is important to heed. You will burn your legs from the very hot motor and you will certainly get burnt on your arms by the hot sun. We did this trip in October and despite slapping on the sun screen, we were quite burnt. A longer day in the sun would have made it quite unbearable.The trip gives an opportunity to see how the majority of Cambodians live. As we were a party of two, we were able to interact with our guide Visal who told us of his life and his goal to become a mechanic or take on further studies. He also told us about the lives of the Cambodian people living in the countryside.The Easy Rider tour is the same as the Sunset tour, so perhaps that is an opportunity if you do not like the hot sun. Visal also has a tuk tuk service so you can use him/his family if you need a reliable and pleasant tuk tuk driver.On returning to Quad Adventure HQ we met Herve's wife who made sure that we got some cold water and a cooling towel to wipe off the red dust that one gets covered in. She also explained that as they do not give finders fees to hotels, and therefore they do not promote her business, removing brochures from public view. It is therefore best to book directly with the company on-line or by direct phone call. If you ask the hotel to check availability for you the response is likely to be that Quad Adventures is fully booked and you should take some other company or tour that the hotel suggests.Quad Adventure update their bikes each year. You can tell which are new bikes by the colour. Each year is a different colour."

Having seen the temples many times before, I decided I wanted to do something a little different - however I was a little worried about whether or not I could get my grandma to join in. I contacted Herve and Souphea, and they were more that accommodating. They arranged for a quad-driver to take my grandma on the back of one of their bikes (a slightly bigger quad, which had a back to seat, which made it easier for her to feel comfortable and secure in the chair). They took her for a test drive to make sure she was comfortable with it, and together (with me on my own quad) we went out into the rice fields for a beautiful sunset ride. The driver took it slowly for my grandma, and gave me the space to hoon around a little bit on my own, which was lots of fun!I couldn't recommend Quad Adventure Cambodia enough - they're very professional in what they do, and the trips that they hold look amazing. Whilst I was there I saw children, teenagers, adults and grandmothers all having a go - and everyone absolutely loved it! I will definitely be going back again!"

The two boys where very friendly and easy to communicate with, they gave us a great insight as to how the locals live.

Our children are 3, 5 & 7 and Quad Adventures had a strong focus on safety which was important to us, this included well fitting helmets for all of us. We all had a ball, and special thanks to our excellent guide Visal who rode with our eldest daughter, but who also took the effort to stop and explain some interesting facts and he clearly loves his job as he was always smiling!"

For many people that may sound like mumbo jumbo but what it means is you get to ride a quality american built quad bike, I have done quad biking in Thailand and Indonesia before (3 times) and every time before I got put onto a chinese built quad that didn't work particularly well, ie no brakes, faulty gears etc etc. But the bikes at quad adventure cambodia were like I said real quads, not cheap imports and very well maintained too.. So that was the first thing, after that we blasted our way through some beautiful country side on a two hour trip costing us$57.. It was definately one of the highlights of the trip.. I think when I come back I will do a full day trip. Very good value for money, very enjoyable especially on quality bikes.. :-)I am an experienced rider back home, I have ridden alot of bikes in my years, but my sister who was a complete NOVICE was able to do the 2 hour trip with no real hiccups apart from getting the quad bogged once.. But thats all part of the fun.. Even though I have ridden a lot faster back home watching every Cambodian child come out of their house and wave at you and seeing the local scenery you don't see from your hotel swimming pool definately made this trip worthwhile.Loved it!!"

We loved seeing so much more f the countryside, mud, flooded roads and all. We went alongside rice paddies, through villages, past temples and more. We took balloons to hand out to the kids and my daughters( on the one bike) had to stop at every single kid so we went well over the 2.5hours- no drama at all. On our return to base my 7 year old was offered a small circuit of the block driving a quad ( with a guide riding tandem) which was the most exciting thing she has ever done! Dont consider rthe Easy Rider - take the Discovery tour - more challenging and a lot more fun - but be preapred to get very wet and dirty"

We made a quick list of potential activities and Quad Adventure Cambodia was one of them. I have always wanted to ride on a quad so naturally this was topped my list.We made a booking for the Sunset package for the same day and it was the best US$28 I have ever spent. QAC sent a complimentary tuk tuk to pick us up and we were greeted by Mr and Mrs Nicole who run QAC. It is not necessary to possess a driver\u2019s licence to operate the quad. I, on the other hand, have a driver\u2019s licence but don\u2019t drive. I was still able to operate it with no trouble because the quad is that simple, not to mention FUN, to operate. My only gripe is that the engine on the right tends to get real hot after a while. We rode through the village, in a little bit of mud and rain together with our two guides. Both of them were caring and protective, on the lookout for traffic and the occasional confused cattle. And when it rained, they rushed to cover us in plastic ponchos and were patient enough to stop midway to be our photographers. I really enjoyed waving at the children while riding. They must encounter throngs of tourists riding through but they always seem so excited to see a new face. Don\u2019t forget to wave back and say hello!When we returned, Mrs Nicole gave us cold clean towers and cold bottled water to freshen up. We were also presented with a certificate each upon completion, with our names handwritten by Herv\u00e9 Nicole. A fantastic experience and highly recommended to all! Thank you Quad Adventure Cambodia. Best wishes from Antoinette from Singapore."

After a 5 minute tour we were hit up for donations. We are happy to help out, but it just felt wierd having such a place be a stop on a tour. Doesn't feel right.

Get out into the villages with at least the Discovery Tour. You do not need to be any sort of off road expert, the rides are pretty benign as far as mud and water go. 99% of the tour is on very small dirt tracks with no traffic, certainly no cars or trucks, just a few people here and there on bikes and motor bikes, walking and of course the obligatory livestock. You will get to see the real Cambodia, out where plowing the fields is done by oxen or water buffalo. Just real Cambodian people and their homes. This company run by a gentleman named Herve, he of the French persuasion, is 100% on the money with their service. From reservation confirmation to pick up and drop off at the hotel.

The thorough instructions, adequate safety precautions and a test ride ensure that you are protected, taking the edge of riding a new vehicle in a new place. The staff has good communication skills and are always ready to take pictures while you are on the quad.

The tour started vey well; our guide \"Tshat\" was super friendly; we stopped for soft drinks at little local cafes; interacted a bit with children on the way as my friend braught with her quite a few clothes to donate to the children. Everyone was super happy to see us and the morning went very well. As we stopped near a local shop for our picnic lunch our tour guide offered to stop in an orphanage to visit children, bring them food and take a tour. We where ok with the idea but then he kept insisting on how the 71 children eat at least 50kg of rice perday (I had my doubt on the amonut); that we should buy a bag for 50kg of rice; or if not at least some instant noodle (30bags or so)! I was a bit surprise that we suddently where feeling that if we where not going to guy a meal for 71 children we should feel guilty.. So I asked how much the case of noodles where.. and the owner of the shop.. whom seems to know our guide very well agreed on 15USD. Well; after living in China 7 years I was surprised the rate was more then in Shanghai! So I said in this case I'd rather buy milk.. then I asked the price; and again seemed outrageous! So we decided not to buy anything and see once we get there how we felt.. Anyways, cut the story short; there was almost no kids there; with some excuses, not one teacher etc! We bumpper into 2 foreigners that had 2 big boxes of noodles on the back of their quad... In the evening when we headed back to the city I wanted to know the truth so I stopped at the lucky supermarket and that box of noodles was under 5USD! So it confirmed what I thought.. unfortunatelly :(Connie and I felt it was such a pitty to take adventage of people'sidness to just rip them off! This is very very unfortunate as the children and parents on the way are extremelly nice! Happy to say hello and smile! We fell in love with them and regretted we didnt have more posibilities to stop more.. As you can imagine after lunch when the guide realize he was going to get out of us the attitude changed a lot! To resume; 1 or 2 hours would be more then enought! If you would like to spend more time with village people just rent a tuk tuk. Hope this help for future traveller."

The owners are sweet and will definitely help you find the right tour."

You had a guide but you could go at your own pace, stop for photos whenever you wanted and generally enjoy the ride. The locals you see along the way make the experience really special, in particular the children who wave and smile at you, even though they must see people like us everyday.Watching sunset over the fields was truly spectacular. I was also joined by a group of 5 kids, who climbed all over me and were so much fun.Make sure you book with these guys - they are a professional outfit and the original company. There is a competing quad bike place down the road, who offer cheaper adventures - but not as good and certainly from a safety aspect I'd go with these guys."

You must get a quad bike each (don't share, you will regret it). Even if you are a first timer on a quad bike, the staff will train you and go through everything with you so you are in good hands. The helmet/bikes are all in good condition. They provide you with water and a face mask too as it gets very dusty (if you are behind a quad bike especially). Don't forget to wear long pants as the ankles get rather hot from the engine!We did the 43k countryside quad bike. Stunned for words. We weaved in and out of the countryside visiting local villages and the fish market. Our guide was awesome and made sure we were ok at all times. It's a MUST in Siem Reap. The experience passing through the rice paddies, the lush green scenery, greeting village kids was superb!When we return next time, we will certainly go for a whole day quad bike. You will not be disappointed!!!Thank you Quad Adventure Team!"

Eventually though, after their tutorial and letting us ride the quad on our own, we got used to it\u2014and had fun driving it for almost three hours.The best parts of the trip were the places we got to see. We got to see some of the temples of Angkor from a distance, and some other ruins. We also had fun giving candies to the kids around the site. We had no idea we had rode such a distance until we went for a break and felt tired. Riding the quad makes you forget about how tired you are and just relax while you feel the wind against your face. It was an amazing experience and will sure try it again with friends when we return."

Wonderful way to really get the feeling of rural Cambodia, with lots of photo opportunities, quite apart from appearing to provide great entertainment and amusement especially to the local children. Appreciated the dust masks after examining the red brown colour of my shirt front at the end of the trip. Took a while to get the feel of a Quad bike after being a trail bike veteran.

We decided to go for the Discovery Tour that starts at 1pm, I've slapped on extra sunblock but my forearms are burnt but it's worth it.Our guide, Pee, was excellent. He told us that we can stop anytime to take photos and when we did, he's never more than 20m away, waiting for us patiently.We brought candies for the kids in the village, they would run out to the road sides upon hearing the bikes nearing. They were very polite. I think an alternative to sweets for them would be some kids clothes from friends and relatives for them, if you are planning to visit the village with Quad Adventure. Plenty of room on the bikes and kids clothes don't take up too much space in suitcases.The ATVs we rode on were very new - 2010 & 2011, they were both in excellent condition. They provided helmets and plastice bags to tie around your ankle to keep your shoes dry (it's the raining season). We encountered some passing showers and were handed raincoats but we didnot put them on. We just kept going! We'll do this again when we return!"

It was wonderful to see and experience the countryside, beautiful scenery and passing through many little villags with so many smiling faces and little happy children running out to see us when they hear us coming, a very humble experience. My husabnd and I had never been on quads before and I was a little nervous thinking how I would manage them but I had absolutely nothing to be nervous about. When we arrived we were given a full professional safety talk and then fitted with helmets (and plastic bags over our feet to keep our shoes clean and dry, it was the wet season and a few puddles about) and went for a trial run to make sure we could handle the bikes and confident to ride them on our own. Our guide Vichet was fantastic, our safety was his first priority at all times and his instructions were alwasy clear and precise. He is a lovely guy with a great personality and we felt very relaxed and comfortable with him and he had a wealth of knoweldge of the area. We had booked our 4 hour trip on line a few months before arriving in Siem Reap. Our e-mails were answered promptly with all the information we needed. Vichet arrived in his tuk tuk at our hotel on time on our arranged day and greeted us with a great smile. Our trip went over the 4 hours at no extra cost, it was not tiring despite the heat, wet did the 7.30am start. Vichet also took us to a temple along our route which was an added bonus to our adventure (bring your temple pass, though Vichet did remind us before we left the hotel). We loved the whole experience so much we bookd again for the next morning and had Vichet again. We travelled along a different route, again as beautiful as the day befores, we also stopped off to see a different temple which was brilliant as we had missed that one when we were on our temple trips due to heav rain. We would highly recommend Quad Adventures, a 'must do' when visiting Siem Reap. We met Herve Nicole on both our vists and he is a lovely man, he runs his business very well and his bikes are maintained and checked thooughly before going out and he ensure his guests are happy and enjoy themselves. We wish him and his team good luck and a huge thank for a fantastic experience!"

We took the tour on August 13th and we are not going to forget that day ever. It was fun, we got a good feel of the land and the way people live, and got to see many incredible places. We have never driven dirt bikes, or any kind of bike to be honest, but had no trouble at all after the few minutes orientation with them.The tour takes you to small villages, dirt roads, pagodas and rice fields, in the wide periphery of Siem Reap. With some stops, our eight hour tour was more than six hours driving. You can stop wherever and whenever you want. We have to specially thank our tour leader, Piseth, who was knowledgeable, kind, patient, with good conversational English - we can't recommend him enough. We didn't really cared for the provided food - but Piseth took care of us and stopped in a nice, clean local place for coffee and noodle soup (if you are too picky about food and not adventurous enough, keep to the provided meal though). As a lot of people wrote, the kids from the villages get on the road as soon as they hear the bikes to greet them and get the occasional treat. We had some candies and mini lollipops with us (70 of them were exhausted in the first 2-3 hours) but even three times that wouldn't be enough. As most of us start giving immediately, the kids near the end don't seem to get any (they still wave from their heart thou - and they loved to high five us while we rode by). We also thought that maybe ballons or whistles or tiny toys may be better that sweets- we saw kids playing for hours with a balloon (using it as a ball) and others having fun with a pair of wooden wheels."

First thing to point out: It really depends on who is riding the Quad. If you are not competent during the practice round, then a guide will have to sit behind you and drive the Quad for you. ( Which in my opinion, looks really uncomfortable, esp if you're a girl.) Our guide (po) was really wonderful. It was a \"one guide to one Quad\" experience which was very good. He stopped at a temple and then a paddy field where the sunset was. Along the way, you get to see the villagers and friendly kids waving to you. ( most kids hope for candies) If you wish to view the real village life of Cambodians, immerse in their culture, mingle with their people (you can stop anytime during the trip to take photos), i would seriously recommend this tour.Note: Please wear long pants as the Quad might get hot and have a firm grip of the steering."

We had guides who stayed close by the entire trip. We went the day after supremely heavy rains and were a little concerned about the potential state of the trails but it was great, a few puddles to splash through but the bikes handled everything with ease. Would recommend as something a little different to the temples, a bit of fresh air and supporting an entrepreneurial idea....."

She picked it up really quickly and enjoyed it a lot.We were initially told that we would be able to take her on the tour and that there were helmets for her.We took a back back (baby carrier) just to be sure (enabling us to strap her in). Lucky for us as I'm not sure how she would have been able to go had we not had this option. The office did offer to look after her - but we weren't comfortable with this.There was also no helmut small enough to fit her head. I have driven quad bikes quite a bit so had the confidence to take her without a helmut. If we had known this in advance we would have bought her push bike helmut with us.The ride is quite bumpy so I found myself squatting above the seat to ensure she wasn't rattled around too much.Also hear that there had been mechanical problems with the rear brakes so they had disconnected these - this means that only the front brakes work. Not such a big issue but worth all parties understanding.Good scenery though - with lots of kids running out to say hello."

Daughter and son are in their late teens. The bikes were in excellent condition and we had a test run and safety briefing first. We had two guides to accompany us. The guides were patient, as initially our daughter found the going tough with water-filled ruts. However, she quickly got the hang of it and we thoroughly enjoyed our ride. The scenery was beautiful and varied. We rode through paddocks, villages, little lanes and some sealed roads. We were able to stop to rest or photograph whenever we chose.We were each given a T-shirt to celebrate our repeat visit.At the conclusion of the ride we were grateful to receive damp face cloths and chilled water.We highly recommend this as an addition to the temples."

I and my younger brother purchased the 4 hour morning ATV excursion to temples and local villages around Siem Riep, and let me tell you, it was pure adrenaline pumping awesomeness. We got 1 ATV for two people and switched off whenever one of us would get tired or to shoot film. We took amazing photos on our ride through rice paddies, local villages, temples and etc. Plus, we shot some excellent video too. Our guide Vichet was very informative, spoke good English, and was just a friendly fellow who knew how to have fun. Vichet knew all the crazy, winding, and dipping roads around Siem Riep suburbs and we had a crazy fun time managing our way around. In the 4 hour span, I believe, we did not ride the same road twice. The country side of Siem Riep is gorgeous, and the roads are tailor made for ATV adventures. Bring lots of candy to hand out to the local kids, there are hundreds of them in the villages, and they all run up to the curb of their huts to wave 'hello'. I loved every minute of this experience and so did my brother. I suggest bringing a really good pair of sunglasses as the helmet face mask is too dark, you don't want to miss out on all the beautiful scenery out there. Enjoy!"

I was very comfortable within 10 minutes or so after getting used to the roads and ... potholes! :-) It was a fantastic experience. All the kids come running out the houses when they hear the bikes. Our guide said people sometimes bring sweets to give out - a simple wave was all I had to offer! But they seemed happy enough ... Our guide stopped for pictures whenever we liked, took us to a couple of temples - one in Angkor and another new one. We then very culturally stopped for a drink and played angry birds!! All in all, our Guide, Hong (hope I spelt that right) was great and it was one of the best things I've done. Do it! - It's a must in Siem Reap!"

We start our ride towards Rolous Group temple area through Siem Reap magnificent landscape taking the unpaved road most of the times (it would be a shame to waste atv on tarmac right?), passing by small villages, wagging our way through the morning market, making our way in paddy field, small forested area, avoiding traffic of small bikes, tuk-tuk, trucks, cows and their fresh dung while constantly waving and hi-fiving small kids along the way. Since we are there during June, the trail is hot and dusty, so they provide us with a face mask. We stop for a drink near Bakong temple before making our way back though more rough terrain fun."

The tour takes you through surrounding villages and rice fields and it is the best way to see some of rural Cambodian life. Passing through the villages the children all come running out to wave at you from the side of the road which was fun. One of the best things about the whole experience was our guide, a super cool guy called Chad. Friendly, funny and helpful, he really made the day perfect - from picking us up from our guest house to dropping us off at the end, it was unbeatable. When we told him we were planning on going to see the floating villages he offered to take us on the bikes as it was the dry season so we got to go down to those too. This actually added an extra hour and a half to our tour and I'm so glad we did it.

When we stopped at a little place for a drink they sold candy but at $8 for four not so big bags we wilt taken advantage of and declined the offer and skipped the orphanage. Only warning for this ride is the ridiculous disclaimer that you need to sign. The company is not in any way responsible for damage or accidents caused by yourself or them and you are not insured. Travel insurance won't cover this either so the ride it at your own risk! I have to admit that it was safe and we did not encountered any traffic except scooters. And lots of smiling and waiving little children along the trek."

The guides were fabulous and the safety drills certainly adequate. This was a perfect way to see rural Siem Reap, village life and the beautiful countryside. I highly recommend getting off the beaten track and taking one of these tours. Well worth the time and cost! Thanks guys! A most memorable experience."

On the way to their site, there will be another quad bike store but dont be fooled because its a new company trying to imitate the original company. Just look for the signs to point you to Quad Adventure Cambodia. I met Herve and his wife upon my arrival there and they were very hospitable and friendly. I chose the discovery package (about 2 and a half to 3 hours) and I chose it for 7 in the morning. They provided a tuktuk service to pick me up and drop me back at the hotel the next day. The quad bikes were automatic and easy to use. I had the tour by myself so it was just me and my guide Vichet. He was amazing... Very knowledgeable about the history of his country and extremely friendly. We first stopped to have breakfast in the outskirts of town which I enjoyed because the food was very authentic, fresh, and cheap. We then ventured out to the countryside stopping once to take pictures and we stopped again at a temple. You should bring your temple pass with you as you need it if you want to enter this particular temple. It rained the night before so the road was muddy but it made the experience more fun. This is a must do when you are in siem reap. A very good break from the temples and a very unique experience. Im glad I did it!"

The bikes are in great condition and are automatic so are very easy to ride. We stopped for about 20 minutes during the trip at a little side of the road caf\u00e9 for a cold drink, the ladies at the caf\u00e9 were so friendly and chatty and did not pressure us to buy anything. The ladies in our trip went slower than the men, but there was no pressure for us to speed up, you can cruise along at your own pace. I would definitely do this tour again and recommend it to anyone. TIP: Wear long trousers as your right leg will get so hot from where the exhaust is. Because of this I think the 2 hour trip was the perfect amount of time."

Sure, the staff are friendly and it's nice to see the countryside but I would recommend hiring a bicycle instead. For one, its only $1 for a day as opposed to the exorbitant price we were charged for the quad bikes. Siem Reap is a small town so just a short bike ride and your in the countryside. Much more enjoyable viewing the scenery with out all the motors and the locals are even more friendly when you're not polluting their homes!"

Little did we know the profound effect the experience would have on us both.We were picked up promptly from our hotel as promised and had a fun tuk tuk ride with our fabulous guide Hong to get the quad bikes. There we met the lovely French owner and we set off on our half day tour.The bikes were fun to use and easy also, but by far the best part of the trip was driving through local villages where the children would run out to wave as you went past. Hong suggested we buy some bags of candy to hand out to the children and this really was an unforgettable experience. Hearing their squeals of delight at getting a simple piece of candy is humbling and beautiful. They were also very polite, in fact all the people we met were and all had lovely smiles to offer. We were caught in the middle of a torrential downpour and storm and not even that could ruin the trip, in fact it added to it. We took refuge under the home of a local family who welcomed in strangers and were very gracious. If you go to Siem Reap do not miss out on this experience. Very professional and friendly and truly is a day we will never forget."

We were off and away, our guide was on a scooter and we followed behind, it was a great way to see real Cambodia and some really beautiful scenery, our guide said we could stop whenever to take any photos and he also stopped if he felt there were any pictures we should take. We had both quad biked before so its seems we managed to cover a lot of land as we were quite confident and speedy according to the guide! We hit a major heavy rain storm half way, the guide was prepared with a waterproof bag which we could put our camera in and he had brightly coloured waterproof ponchos at the ready which we were thankful for! He gave us the option to stop or carry on, we chose to carry on made it quite exciting and the terrain varied throughout the route! Be prepared to get muddy if it rains and wear clothing that you don't mind getting mucked up. Also if you've been to the temples and have a spare day left on your ticket maybe take it with you as we stopped for lunch by one of the temples, unfortunately we didn't bring ours with us so we couldn't go but we wish we had it with us!"

Because it was deemed unsafe for me to ride alone, what more with a pillion, I had a guide with me and another guide rode with the 2 kids. To be honest, the scenery of village after village interspersed with paddy fields quickly became boring and I was concentrating on going as fast as I could without running into a ditch! I did the 2 hour ride which was just about right with young children. My boy found this tour to be his favourite activity because he got to have a go for a bit (with guide of course). Probably a boy thing as the girl was unimpressed.The guides were friendly and professional and told me repeatedly we could stop anytime we wanted for pictures but having travelled extensively in south-east asia, one village pretty much looks like another. I only saw one village child demand a dollar from me but it could be because i whizzed past all of them!The guide asks if you want to drop by an orphanage which they support. They're not pushy about it and leave it entirely up to you. If you don't want to feel blackmailed into making a donation, maybe give this a miss. Also, bring water along as it gets very hot and dusty and I was surprised they did not provide any. I enjoyed it for the thrills and spills and this being the first time I rode a quad bike. Probably a better activity for kids big enough to handle the bikes on their own."

We payed for a 1 hour 15 min tour, yet we recieved a 2 hour tour. They are very responsible and learn you the necessary before you head of into the Cambodian landscapes. It went perfectly well, but if you're sceptical, there is always an opportunity to sit two on one quadbike. Which will be even cheaper as well. Though i reccomend to go on your own bike, as there is ALOT to see and you can slow down/or stop whenever you find something interesting. You see water buffalos, small chickens, lots of cows, swans and animals that i wouldn't even know the name of. Ruins, munks, lots of children that are charmingly happy to see you- everybody waving to you, smiling and fascinated! I was waiting for the typical stop where they want tourists to buy something, but it never appeared. They took care of my purse and everything, with everything still there when i got it back. Trustworthy and proffesional people. This is definitely a must do- We're going once more before we leave! A little tip: Have shoes that can be dirty, though they borrowed me a pair of crocks. Clothes that can be dirty. Have a camera with you and just make sure to have it in a solid camera bag- this is paradise for photographers.

I agree that it is expensive $28 by Cambodia standards, but then bearing in mind insurance and the upkeep of the vehicle - it probably is not that expensive. Siem Reap is quiet a tourist town, and the quad bike tour provides you with an opportunity to get away from the town and actual see some countryside, and real Cambodia. You stop at a rice paddy for sunset. Visal spoke good English and was a very pleasant guide.Would recommend giving this a go if you are in Siem Reap, and looking for a break from the temples!"

Unfortunately however we didn't have much input from our guide receiving no real information on the area we were riding through. It is a pretty easy flat ride that could pretty easily get boring for anyone who rides motorbike regularly. Good fun if it rains though like it did the day we went. Most of the time was spent in standard wet season weather and the terrain soon changes. Not a bad experiance but could be improved by stopping to visit more of the local people and some information from the guide would be nice (I could have gotten the same hiring a motorbike and a map)"

At 7.00am we were driven to the Quad Adventure Cambodia office where after a briefing and short training run, we headed into the countryside behind our guide. We bounced along red clay tracks through paddy fields, past villages and small farms littered with sheets of rice drying in the baking sun. Children ran out of their houses to wave as the raspy engines whizzed past their huts while chickens and tethered cows recoiled in horror.We stopped at a village market where ladies deftly deboned fish, small birds and lumps of unrecognisable meat with huge cleavers. Smoke from small charcoal fires mixed with the steam from bubbling pots of noodles which boiled over adding to the puddles from last night\u2019s rain. Our guide provided an extra hour in the fields before we returned to the office for water, wet towels and the removal of three hours of dust.SuperbFor more things to do in Siem Reap, see http://www.103degreeseast.com/search/label/Cambodia"

The guide was respectful of villages by slowing down but also allowed us a bit of speed on the open roads! We even drove through a market! Many children come running out to say hello but PLEASE do not give them lollies (their teeth do not need anymore sugar) or dollars (it is not fair as you cannot give to all and you do not want to encourage children to stay home from school to earn money).

They love it when you stop and give them candy. Riding the bikes was a lot of fun and they are easy to ride with good instruction given before you start the tour.Be warned - you will get very dirty and definitely recommend long trousers and plenty of sunscreen. They will cover your shoes in plastic which is a great way to kep them clean, I really appreciated that. Have done quad tours in lots of places in the World but this was by far our favorite.

They are very professional, the bikes look great (most are changed every year and the \"old\" ones are from 2010), they're clean and well cared for and the manager is really nice. My friend and I decided to do a half day tour in the morning. I can't tell you just how much fun it was! I loved riding around the countryside on the quad. Our guide, Pee (means two in Khmer), was very friendly and adjusted the pace of the ride according to our abilities. He was very respectful when we rode through villages by always slowing down (but allowed us to ride fast when we were in open country). We were greeting by lots of waving kiddies in the villages and also visited a school. I had an absolute blast - I could not think of a better way to spend my Sunday morning."

But, before we set out we were given masks to wear. When we stopped for a break, the staff that accompanied us gave us new and clean masks. This was great. They also provided great conversation. We did the morning tour which was a good option. It was during March, so the days got really hot by noon. We saw rice paddies, buffaloes, and local kids. The kids love to come out and wave to you when they hear the 4 wheelers. It seemed that the staff practiced safety. We had 2 guides with us, one in the front and one following in the back. When we would have to cross streets, the staff would hold traffic so we could pass. The staff told us we could stop at any time and take pictures which we didn't do often.

The owner also came out to meet us, and as one of our group had never been on a quad before, he was given a private tuition by the owner himself. Talk about service! anyway, the experience was lovely and we were asked before we started if we would like to go to an orphanage during the experience as our hotel had kindly donated some school uniforms for the children - this was an eye opener and is definitely worth doing if you are ever in Cambodia. We did the 3 hour trip (or maybe it was 4 - i cant remember now) but either way, this was about the perfect time for the trip we did.

Guides informative and relaxed but safety conscious. Just watch out for the 17 year olds enjoying the speed around the corners and random chickens and dogs running across the road. Even if your kid is too young to ride by themselves they can ride behind you on a bike as my daughter did and its totally safe and stable.

We took the 2hour discovery ride and it was one of the best decisions we have made for the trip. The guides were really helpful and friendly, and what made it so awesome was the sights we've managed to see. The guides took us into the villages, where we got to meet little children who got excited and ran out when they heard us coming. My advice would be to prepare some healthy but tasty snacks - enough for 200 children perhaps and give it out along the way. You can opt to stop by a village school if you want to bring donations - we went on a Sunday and there was no school but I can imagine how fun it would be. :) Well deserved number 1 spot on Trip Advisor."

Might have been a bit ambitious to go for such a long ride. Make sure to wear long pants as you will end up dusty from head to toe. The guide will want to bring you to an orphanage and buy things for the orphans and will also bring you to see pagodas."

The tour includes helmets, masks for the dust (at least in the dry season), and a friendly and knowledgeable guide. We did the half day adventure and rode among the rural outskirts of the city and saw behind the tourist curtain. Beautiful rice paddies and children literally come out of the woods to wave and smile at you. What they really want is candy, which you can buy along the way, but you run out quickly because there are so many kids. You also stop at an orphanage and get a tour of their facility. You can buy and deliver supplies for them too on the tour. The owners are very nice and have great tips to help you on the rest of your stay. They speak English and French that we know of, maybe more. Wonderfull all around experience."

As metioned in other reviews be prepared to be covered in dust, one thing I did not prepare for was the heat (102 degrees), my pants stopped mid calf, about 30 minutes into the ride my legs were getting burned so Ray stopped at a local store and we bought high socks which really helped...moral to story is cover yourself, arms and legs, they provide masks and helmets. Did not do the orphange stop however wished had candy or something for ALL the kids that came out to greet us along he way. We did the 4 hour sunset tour, unbelievable sunset, fabulously fun tour. Bottom line, dress from head to toe, cover yourself due to dust and sun and bring candy for the kids...enjoy!"

I went with my wife and 2.5 year old daughter on the bike. I was initially worried about riding the bike with my daughter and wife behind. However the trainers made sure that I practiced well before heading off for my 19 km subset trip. I was assigned an individual guide instead of letting me go with a group. This helped a lot as I drove slowly and also distributed candies to the kids on the way. The sunset view was great and the guide clicked few pics for me and my family. The bikes are well maintained and you get into the riding rhythm pretty quickly. Overall this was a great and memorable experience and I recommend everyone to try this activity."

Glad I went to TripAdvisor for my Cambodian travel research. As has been said by many many reviews before me, this is a must do while you're in Cambodia! After days of exploring the Angkor archaeological complex, I highly recommend Quad Adventure Cambodia, among many other unique experiences in Cambodia. My guide, Soheang, was so friendly and patient as he allowed me to make many stops to take beautiful photos of Cambodian countryside. The genuine friendliness of the locals and the smiles of the local children as we were driving past, are simply unforgettable! The highlight of this Quad Adventure trip for me was when we went to 2 of the Roluos group temples: Bakong and Lolei and the green rice fields.I recommend taking at least the Discovery or Half Day tour package if you have the time. Thank you Soheang, and thank you Quad Adventure Cambodia, for the unforgettable experience!"

The quads are very easy to drive and a lot of fun, they make sure you are comfortable on the quads before leaving their compound.

The plan was for my husband and son to ride a quad each and my daughter and I to share, daughter being the driver so I could take photos. Unfortunately our daughter wasn't confidant enough to ride on her own so she had one of the guides on the back with her and I teamed up with my husband. We began our tour and after about 10 minutes I turned around and could not see our daughter anywhere, I was a little concerned and eventually we stopped due to the tour leaders bike having problems. Whilst waiting it was noticed that our son's quad was leaking something so another quad and trail bike were sent out to us. Our daughter eventually turned up, slow and steady.The villages we drove through we were always met by children waving and smiling. We had some lollies to hand out but not enough to give to all and I must say if we had stopped for every child it would have been a much longer trip. We stopped at the orphanage and donated some noodles and lollies. In regards to the donation I will say we stopped at a roadside store to make our purchases and felt like we were paying above the average. One of the students gave us a tour of the complex and though interesting did feel a little like a sales pitch (ouch that sounds horrible but every family member had the same feeling).Overall the tour was great, my son found it a bit boring after a while as he was on his own and as another reviewer noted maybe headsets so everyone could communicate would be a good idea (not sure if these are expensive). Our daughter thoroughly enjoyed her tour as the guide could point things out to her and as she was driving so slowly she really got to take in the scenery.The guides were great and overall we would recommend this tour."

The picnic lunch from The Blue Pumpkin was a nice touch. Since April was the DRY month, our guides took us to the DRY floating village which was very interesting. Take LOTS of Wet Ones or Baby wipes to wipe the dirt off of your face and body periodically. Also, if you are riding on the back of a quad, your right ankle will get hot from the engine. Something to shield the heat, since your pants ride up when you sit, would be nice."

We chose the four hour half-day tour and ended up riding from 12 - 4. Probably not one of the best times since it's extremely hot and sunny. Only one of us had riden the quad bike before, but it is a breeze if you have basic knowledge of car/bike riding. The owner trains you on how to use the bike in 10 mins and then you're taken on a test ride by the instructor who guides you. Most people should get a hang of it within a few minutes. The bikes are in excellent condition and are well maintained. If you're someone who suffers from backaches or stomach cramps etc, then this might not be a good idea since the roads are quite bumpy (countryside mud roads) and there's a lot of jumping around on the bike. The four hour tour passed through many villages, an orphanage school, and some local pit-stops. While the riding experience was amazing and definitely worth every bit, the tour wasn't really a tour. It was just a ride through the places. We did spot some structures where you could stop to see something but I would've preferred if the instructors who ride along with you on dirt bikes would've stopped to show us something or talk about the structures that we were passing by... I typically experience something by sharing and the fact that I was riding alone without being able to talk to anyone else in the group made me feel quite bored and I missed not having carried my ipod after a while, so if you're someone who loves talking, then you might want to double up with someone on the same bike instead of riding one on your own for 4 hours. It would've been ideal had they quipped the bikes with those intercommunication devices which enable you to have conversations with others within a certain radius. That would've made it an excellent experience!Make sure you wear clothing that can be easily washed or is not new. There is immense amount of dust that flies and your clothes and body will practically become brown after the ride. The sunscreen and glasses are a definite must-have. You can carry your camera on you so you can stop to click pictures if you like. They have a facility to keep all your other belongings in the office before you start. Ensure you have your Angkor temple pass on you in case you want to see the temples en route too. The orphanage school was disappointing. There were too few kids and the classrooms looked like they hadn't been used in a while. The person who showed us around seemed more interested in making us feel pity for him rather than respect or admiration for his ambitions."

Whilst there were other people going at the same time for the same tour, instead of lumping us together, it was just the two of us with Pee (our guide) who took us on a route that meant that we only saw the other groups once! Pee noticed that we rode confidently and after about 5minutes offered for us to see the orphanage which is normally reserved for a longer tour. We declined because we had seen many posters in Phnom Penh saying \u201cdon\u2019t go to orphanages \u2013it\u2019s not a zoo\u201dLater when talking to Pee, we told him the reason for declining the offer to see the orphanage . He explained to us that this is not how he / they see it. He said that many of the children are orphans because their parents died from HIV or landmines and the children really enjoy the visit. We certainly regret turning down the offer because it would have been nice to give some of the fruit we carried with us to the children. April is the end of dry season so it's quite dusty and the rice paddies weren\u2019t at their best. We didn\u2019t get a sunset either because it was overcast - we joked to Pee that we wanted a refund ;o) None the less, this a great way to see the countryside and catch a glimpse into the Khmer country lifestyle. The fading light, grandparents minding children, herds of cows being rounded up to go home, children running out to hi-five you as you pass, tractors pulling loads of straw, water buffalo munching their way through the paddies \u2013 all just a wonderful experience. The people of Siem Reap are beautiful. Thank you Pee for a wonderful evening!"

Teenage daughter, who has never driven any vehicle in her life, safely drove off road on her quad, complete with instructor seated behind her. The Quad Adventure Cambodia company are committed to ensuring safety first at all times, coupled with a fun time. Free pick up and drop off is a nice touch, so too is the certificate. Our instructors were so good, we gave each a small tip, worth every dollar. Very reasonably priced activity. Give it a go!"

We booked the sunset tour because the price suited our budget but for the price you get a personal escort to follow, this isn't some big group tour. Having done this tour we'd happily pay more to do a longer tour. The bikes are easy to ride & handle, lots of bumps but nothing the bikes can't handle. Our guide, Heng, was great, he gave us lots of information about locals, temples etc. as you pass houses, the kids run to the gate to wave & smile at you, so cute! this tour is a good option to see the countryside & something different from the temples."

After a safety orientation on the operation of the quad and getting fit with helmet and dust mask we were ready to go. Hong (my guide) was the perfect guide and was able to tell me so much about the local area and peoples.We stopped at a local road side store and I purchased 100kg of rice and two large boxes of noodles to drop off at a local orphanage; they were very happy for this food & told me all about the place.Driving around the outlaying areas of Siem Reap with Quad Adventures is a must and I will be going back next time to Cambodia and will do more trips with them.As an avid motor bike and quad rider and owner I would recommend Quad Adventures for everyone; young and old alike.Thank you again Harve and Hong,Yves LeGuerrier"

Of course driving the quad is fun in itself; but the real experience is in seeing parts of rural Cambodia that a visitor would not normally get to see. All along the route we had little children waving to us; our only regret being that we had not thought to carry small gifts (say a pencil or some sweets) to hand out.Eminently recommended as an evening trip for 2-3 hours. Bear in mind the roads will be dusty, so cover yourself and carry drinking water."

If you are interested in doing this, take some money with you so you can buy some rice as a gift (at today's date it was US$14). Also, think about taking a supply of lollies or small gifts with you. As you ride around the country side kids run from their house to the road to smile and wave which is such an enjoyable part of the tour. I wish I had something to give them."

Simply wonderful! However, there is only so much time that one can spend visiting Temples and ancient ruins before one realizes that there is a fascinating, vibrant, rich cultural people - the local Cambodians living off the beaten path of Siem Reap - who are also a must visit! And the absolute best (and most exciting and fun) way to see the rural, dusty, incredibly welcoming and inviting local community is with Quad Adventure! We had a blast on these 4-wheel cycles. We got into the local countryside and visited with dozens upon dozens of local Cambodians; the young children relished our arrival! The schools we visited were welcoming! The orphanage pulled at our heart-strings. This was among our best days in Cambodia and SE Asia!!! Don't miss this experience! Dr. Steven Pfeiffer (USA)"

I had never been quad biking before but the tour guide gave me a great demonstration at the start and made sure I was very comfortable before heading out. My partner and I did the half day tour early morning and didn't feel like it went for too long. The tour guide took us to some great dirt tracks to have great fun with the quads. Definitely stop by the orphanage as they make you feel very welcome and its a unique experience you just often don't get to see. Our tour guide let us stop as many times as we liked along the way to take photos. This was a bonus as we saw one other quad tour go pass with a huge number of people and this would have hindered them from doing this. Tip: go early morning as it gets very hot later in the day and seeing the sunrise over the villages is simply gorgeous!"

There are a couple of quad bike companies operating in Siem reap, 2 main ones situated just 100m from each other, so make sure the one you pick is the one you go to see. The first one on the road may catch you before you get to the other! That being said, we went with the first one on the street and had a great time. Other we spoke to went with the second and said the exact same as us, so I don't think either one is any better or worse. We only had time to squeeze in the 2.25hr tour, but that was enough to see a lot of the countryside, small villages, an orphanage, rice paddies, water buffaloes, hundreds of cute little kids running out to wave at you as you cruise on by etcGuide was good, happy to keep at whatever pace you desired or were capable of, stopped at good points for you to take photos and made sure you were safe and comfortable at all times.

I only drove for 1 hour and felt a bit tired when we arrived back.Oh, and if you take a photo bag as we did, put on protective bag or you'll have to clean all the dirt from the bag afterwards (dust was everywhere).All in all, this was one of the highlights of our trip in Cambodia."

There bright happy faces (even before we started giving out lollies) as they ran out of houses to say hello and wave was just incredible. My wife came away wanted to adopt!The service was amazing as well. Our guide was informative and really helpful. My wife ended up on the back of my quad bike after a test run showed she was not strong enough to steer it well which really made the experience better for us both (its harder to give out lollies and steer at the same time!). This meant less money for them but they were more than happy for her to do that. As an added bonus our guide also helped us set up a tuk tuk and guide for the following day of touring the temples.Overall it was an amazing experience and the company is very friendly, helpful and professional. And we cant stress this enough- dont get on the bikes until you have plenty of lollies to the beautiful Khmer kids!"

We also got provided with face masks so we wouldn't have to worry about the dust as we drove through - but we were lucky as it was raining before so the ground wasn't that dry and dusty.We went out through the roads and rice fields in a line and it was great! The ones who had done it before were a little disappointed they couldn't go any faster (it was difficult with children, dogs, traffic all around and because we were going through villages and dirt road which was pretty much one lane one way) but they overcame that by simply falling slightly behind the group then speeding up for a few metres. It was also good to know there were a couple of guides on a motorbike that went ahead to stop traffic or help make sure everyone was going the right way. There were also guides at the front and guides at the back on quads to make sure no one was left behind.When we got to the rice fields for the sunset, we followed a guide through the actual rice field and got lots of great photos taken. It was fun and seeing how much the guides love their job makes it all the more fun! One of the girls was having her birthday that day so we all sang happy birthday to her at the rice fields and through the walkie talkie, some of the guides sang her happy birthday too!

We were picked up from our hotel in a tuk tuk and taken to the base where we were given a demonstration on the bikes. We were also taken for a test drive with a member of the team which was great if like me you are a little nervous! Each couple or group then set out with their own guide who took things at your pace, which for me was fairly slow and steady ( much to my husbands frustration!). Driving through the little villages and countryside was just amazing and the sunset was definitely something that will stay with me. I would recommend this trip to anyone visiting Siem Reap. The company are so friendly and make you feel really safe. An unforgettable experience."

It was the first time I rid a quad bike. There was an escort who lead the way and looked after the well being for a small group of people. Our group drove through local villages and then stopped among paddy fields to watch sun set. While I was driving through the villages, I was greeted by local kids. I can share their joys when I handed out candies to them. Apart from the fun riding a quad bike and the beautiful sun set, it provided good first-hand experience of the local villages and kids."

The guide was safe and knowledgeable and led us at a pace that was fast enough to get some thrills but still able to take in the scenery. Its an opportunity to see a side of Cambodia you would not normally see that should not be missed. We stopped to rest and get refreshments a few times, it can be very hot driving through the rice paddies. Would definitely do it again and recommend to anyone visiting Siem Reap who wants a break from the temples."

This was my second time on the quadbikes and I enjoyed it so much last time that I convinced my travel companion this time that we should go twice. We booked about 5 months in advance and the email exchange to do so was simple and efficient.We first did the 2.5hr trip, which was great (actually we were away just over 3 hours) and then 2 days later we did a full day trip (8.5hrs) where we designed our own itinerary (they were happy to oblige) and went to the Ladies Temple (Bantey Srei) - about 120 km return trip. Our guide Chet was brilliant, he took us by an incredibly varied series of tracks and back-roads and fields and villages and rice paddies and sealed roads, via 2 other temples (one where we were the only people there, which after the crazy tourist crush of Angkor Wat was simply amazing) and via the very interesting Land Mine museum. We stopped for a great lunch (included in the price) and a few cold drinks along the way. It was just a fantastic day and an experience of the Cambodian countryside which most tourists will never have.I don't know of any holiday activity which so perfectly combines utility and fun as visiting the Angkor temples by quadbike. Just do it!!"

I felt confident after practicing his instructions & after a short time was relishing the thrill of it all. We booked the full day tour however on reflection would do the half day simply because the day was VERY hot. I simply stopped whenever I wanted to take a photo, enjoy the view a little longer or have a drink. Great lunch & drinks whenever needed. Top experience ."

Kids would run from their wooden homes and wave to us as we rode by. It was exhilarating and educational to see how local country folk live, even though we were just outside the city.

The light was so beautiful over the rice fields and the acres. We saw the village people working their fields with oxes, watering their gardens and preparing food. Small children were running around laughing and waving. We had balloons and pens with us, and my daughter had selected some small toys she wanted to hand out.

Its all part of the experience and I found myself looking for mud puddles where my guide was avoiding them!!!I was a single female and had the guide to myself, so the pace was easily adapted to my needs and he was happy to stop for pics etc. We stopped in a few places to get a drink and have a well earned rest. Be prepared for sore hands from gripping the handles, the roads are dirt and very rough with potholes you can get lost in, as well as buffalo springing out of the bushes with minimal notice, oh and piles of dung that could be disastrous if not avoided!!!. The kids run out and wave to you, and a couple of times it was just impossible to wave back due to the terrain and your advised to keep both hands on the bike anyway.Highly recommended tour with a great staff and good well maintained bikes."

Sitting comfortably, you have long dirt straights to open up that throttle, dune tracks, sand slopes and lowly bridges to see what the TrailBoss330 could do. And if your lucky, you may even get a cow in the middle of the road to complete your hazard driving test.Even if you\u2019re not templed out, THIS MUST BE on your Siem Reap to-do list!!!A big thank-you to PEE- our escort who made this a fantastic experience.

The riding was easy (but fun, especially since it had been raining for a couple of days before hand), and the quadbikes were in good condition. You will get dirty, but that's half the fun. We stopped over at an orphanage half way through the trip, and were given a tour by one of the older children.

Sadly I not able to wave back as need to control the vehicle. We get to see corn fields, bafflos etc etc. A different sight for a city kid like me.We made a stop at the rice paddy fields for sun set. You have to be there to see the vast fields. Although stated only 1 hour, the sunset ride seems longer than that. But its never enough! If you like go-Kart drive, you will LOVE this ATV drive!!!

I had never driven a quad before and had to take two practice runs before they let me go out on my own, but it was easy enough to master, even for a car-less city dweller like me. I brought two bags of candy for the village children and wished I had brought a little more. Bring your temple pass with you if you do the 2-hour tour because you have the opportunity to visit one of the more off-the-beaten-path temples during your ride through the countryside.

A fantastic way for everyone to see the real Siem Reap although, at times, we felt a bit weird about intruding on the lovely people. We did 2 1/2 hours which was more than enough for the kids. Great to see the orphanage. Totally recommend doing a quad bike adventure."

It was a great way to see see the country side, sugar plums, open area, rice paddle.. beautiful view. I was so excited to see different kinda animals as well, pigs, duck, chickens, water buffaloes, cows etc. there were so many kids waved at us when we passed by. Our tour guide told us some tourists gave them sweets before, that why they were waving for sweets. So I recommend u to buy some sweets before the trip starts ( u can also buy at some street booth on the way)one more thing: it is pretty dusty on certain section of the trip, I recommend u to wear dark clothing as my boyfriend white top turned into yellowish reddish brown at the end."

He was very nice and always made sure we are safe and riding on the right path. He took us to an orphanage where a well English-speaking boy showed us around & explained how they live and study. We went past different villages where little kids would run to the road naked and wave to you with huge smiles on their faces.One warning: you will encounter very bumpy dirt roads where you may feel more of the urge to release your bowels.Overall, a fantastic experience and one that I will not forget. And do remember to bring some lollies or chocolates for the kids you see along the roads, it'll make their day!"

The route the guides chose was excellent and easily managed by all without being too boring for my son and I who are used to quad biking.This is an extremely well run business and is connected to a local orphanage that can be visited on the longer ride - which we would have done had we another day there. If you are in Siem Reap, this is a must do. It is cheap compared to other such ventures elsewhere in the world, the bikes are easy to ride and very well maintained and the guides are professional. My son and I went quad biking in Indonesia and that experience nearly prevented me from wanting to do this in Cambodia. My faith has been restored!"

To get there, you can arrange for a tuk tuk to pick you up from your hotel and it's free of charge. Likewise, a tuk tuk will send you back to your hotel after you are done, also for free. When you get to the place, there's no wasting of time, no long briefings whatsoever. You get there, you get a helmet and face mask, and a guide will give you a quick lesson on how to ride the quad bike. Once that's done, you're ready to go.Before you get on the actual trail, you will be given a quick crash test of the quad bike. An instructor will be with you on your quad bike teaching you the proper techniques. Once you're done, you'll head back and 2 guides on motorbikes will take you on the actual trail. I went with 2 of my friends so there were 3 quad bikes and a motorbike ahead and behind us each, but they can accomodate much larger groups.The trails they take you along are very rural and very inconsistent also. Part of it is very rocky and uneven, part of it is real muddy and only a short part of the trail is tarmac.Along the way you can stop anywhere to take photos or interact with the locals. The guides will wait for you. Althought the ride is meant to last about an hour or so, it usually lasts much longer. My friends and I did almost 2 hours.This is something you definitely must do if you visit Siem Reap. Definitely worth the time and money"

Initially we didn't think a quad adventure would be possible since we have two young daughters (6 & 9 years old), but once I found out it was, we booked. And we are so glad we did!! My husband and I had never driven quad bikes before, so we were each given a short lesson with a trainer on board behind us to ensure we knew what to do. Meanwhile, they prepped two quads with back support and pillows so the girls were safe and comfortable sitting behind us. Once we were cleared, we got the girls on board and we were off. We were lucky enough to be on what amounted to a private tour with our guide on a motorbike ahead of us. We were able to stop whenever we wanted to in order to take photos, have a drink or just admire the countryside (the guide was always checking his mirrors and would just stop as well and wait for us). The route was great with a mix of semi-urban and really rural countryside and the guide stopped us a few times to take photos of us and explain things we were seeing. We got the hang of the quads quite quickly and really enjoyed the adventurous nature of exploring on them. What a blast!The owner, his wife and our guide could not have been more accommodating or helpful. We felt like we were in good hands and we wished we could have done more trips with them. We would definitely do this again if we go to Siem Reap again (which we hope to) and we HIGHLY recommend seeing Cambodia with Quad Adventure Cambodia."

We were encouraged to make as many stops as we wanted and take photo's or say hello to all the children that came running out as we rode along. The tour took us out of Siem Reap town and along small dirt roads (virtually no traffic) of the farming area, where we got a good close look at the rice fields and Cambodian family living. I highly recommend taking a Quad Bike tour around Siem Reap with Quad Adventure Cambodia, you will experience riding a Quad bike while seeing the quiet rural areas the country side has to offer.

The lush fields we passed were refreshing. Having lumbering water buffaloes swat at you when you pass by and ducks race across your path is an experience to the local side of Cambodia life. Had so much fun, I went back again three days later for the shorter one hour plus tour. Was given a much longer tour than that but not charged extra!

These children that have nothing, not even cloths on there backs, would walk to the road for a chance to wave at you. The innocence and joy coming from these children that expected nothing in return (except a wave back) was moving. A wave back to these children always resulted in a BIG SMILE and excitement for the children! During this tour I became sick from something I had eaten earlier that day. We were stopped in a village and sitting at table drinking water when I became very light headed and felt like I was about to pass out. The shop keeper and my tour guide (Viyan?) sprung into action. The shop keeper grabbed some Cambodian medicine that went under my nose and on my temples. In minutes, I was feeling much better. I was astounded how people living next to the shop that were cooking something in a wok on an open fire in a hut next door had also come over to see if there was anything they could do to help. The people of the small village were all very concerned and wanted to do anything they could to make sure I was O.K. This is Cambodia's treasure! I came for the temples and discovered that the greatest treasure in this country is the people! But you will never discover this unless you get close enough to discover it for your self. The \"Discovery Tour\" that we took was truly a different sense of the word than i had expected. It was so much more. These people that had nothing were willing to help me with anything that they had and expected nothing in return. Thank you Cambodia for an unbelievable experience."

They were so easy to drive. got to stop and take lots of photos. Our 2 guides were local which was great as we got to ask lots of questions. would so recommend this to anyone, any age. It was such great fun, which it could have gone on for days longer....I really enjoyed it."

We had so much fun. Our guide Piseth did an excellent job to explain the functionality of the bikes (very well maintained and easy to handle) and took us on an exciting route through the country-side around Siem Reap. We got access to areas we would never have see without this tour. Highly recommendable! We will definitely do it again once back in Siem Reap."

Took the sunset tour, which was really great. Got to see a lot of the countryside, and drove through some small villages, where you got to see how the Cambodians live in the country. Watched an amazing sunset in a really great scenery surrounded by rice fields. Totally quiet except from the sound of the frogs. Had Visal as our personal guide, which was nice, because we didn't had to follow a whole group. He also told us some interesting things, when we stopped for the sunset. And he adjusted the speed of the tour\u00a0to our level, so we at some times could pick up some speed. Pickup included from and to your hotel. Would definitely go again another time!!\u00a0"

They say that Cambodia is the country of smiling faces but nothing compares to seeing dozens of children run out waving and smiling as you come by on your quad. They just love it! We split up into groups based upon abilities, and fortunately for me, my girlfriend kicks butt on a quad so we had our own guide who took us miles further then others. We saw the real Cambodia and I'll never forget it.Thank you Herve and team for an amazing experience."

I had never driven a quad bike before and was a little nervous but the short induction they give you before the tour was enough to put me at ease and soon my husband and I were driving with confidence. The tour was perfect in terms of length and what you saw, we passed through rice fields, countryside, saw local villages, a Buddhist temple and last but not least visited an orphanage. The orphanage was very impressive as they have achieved so much and made such a difference and I wore my t-shirt with pride when we left Cambodia.I can't say enough great things about this tour, Herve, the owner, was very helpful when recommending which tour we took and the guide that came with us (the tour was a private one, I think they all are) was very friendly and always there without being intrusive. Definitely do this if you have a couple of hours spare in Siem Reap!"

We did a half day tour which was more than enough time. I would not have enjoyed any longer on the quad since it is very bumpy and dusty. But... we did absolutely love the experience, the guide, the brand new ATV's, and the tour. We brought pencils to all the little kids who run out of their houses to wave as you drive by. They seemed to love them! Also, we liked the pace of the trip since it seemed our guide let us decide how long to stay at places or where to stop. He was fantastic! The only reason Im giving it 4/5 is because all our other excursions included water or a snack. Our rest stop was at a friends little snack/souvenier place. Also, our other stop was at the shooting range where they gave us a hard sell to pay $50 to shoot war weapons. I didnt like being \"sold\" to while already on a tour that we paid good money for. I would definitely recommend this excursion to everyone who visits siem reap, I just think they should provide water and not take you to places where you are expected to spend more money."

The highlight was the children who all came running out of their homes to the roadside with bid smiles to yell \"bye-bye\" and wave their hands (worth setting your camera to video--but resist throwing out candy as it's not healthy and doing this promotes begging, when really, for now, they're quite happy just to get a wave and a smile from you!). Our teenage daughter rode on the back of one of our quads and we were happy she did, as she was able to record on camera, all the highlights, while we concentrated on driving (which was quite easy). We all started at the office as a big group but then they divided us into our own family groups and sent us out with our own guide, which was great as we were able to stop whenever we wanted and look at something, without worrying about holding up the rest of the group. There is a stop at a very well run orphanage/school and there was no pressure to give a donation, but we didn't feel at all bad about spending $10 on a t-shirt to support their good work. There are chances for a rest and bathroom break at an orphanage and the little roadside shop part-way through, where you can take a leisurly look throught the friendly village. A half day was enough for our bums (and bring a dust mask in the dry season). We highly recommend the experience!"

My husband and I both agree it was our best day in Siem Reap. From the moment we booked I knew that Mr Herve and his crew were totally professional. The booking took 2 emails and 3 months later they picked myself and my husband up at our hotel right on time. The briefing for the bikes was brief and thorough. Although I did not ride, my husband did and he loved it. VICHET , our guide was amazing. When we mentioned we were hungry he took us to a local hang-out for breakfast, when we mentioned our special dietary requirements( vegetarian/halaal) he made sure the cook understood. We stopped at many points along the way and bought loads of sweets for the kids who lined the streets when they heard the bikes. If you are visiting the orphanage make sure you budget to buy a bag of rice. The work they are doing is amazing and the resources few so do the right thing. And if you like it tip generously , the guides are seriously hardworking and deserve every penny they earn. Just book it. If you spend on nothing else, spend it on this trip. You won't regret it. Thanks again Mr Herve and Vichet!"

We wanted to do the sunset tour but it was booked out for that day and we didnt have another day on our itinerary to spare. So we did a morning session at 9am. By the time we finished, it was probably close to 11am. Luckily that day was not a scorching day. We took 4 bikes for our family. I had planned to have my 11 year old son sit behind his father but my husband insisted that his son rode on his own ! I was initially worried but after a quick training, the bike was easy enough for my son to manage on his own (although a guide sat behind him). Going into the countryside, we got to see how the local people lives. The houses, the vegetable plots, their livestock around their houses. It was touching to see the little children who were outside waving and smiling to us. Vong and his team did a fantastic job of looking out for us and waiting at certain points while my husband stopped intermittently to take photos."

The temples of Siem Reap are unbelievable, but the other reviewers are right - you don't get any sense of how people really live in Cambodia. This excursion was about 4 hours of riding through the countryside - past rice paddies, farms, rural houses where kids run outside and wave at you (just about the cutest thing ever!!!), through authentic rural markets and beautiful fields. We saw so many cool things and really got a better sense of Cambodian life and culture. It made a deep impression on us. We are so glad we did this tour and highly recommend it!"

The Discovery tour we had with Quad Bike Adventure for nearly 2 1/2 hours was definitely a big highlight of our stay in Siem Reap. There is no other way really to get off the beaten track with young children (ours are 3, 7 and 10 years old). We had an awesome trip through villages and rice paddies, along narrow dirt tracks. We had a guide in front on a motorbike but we could choose our own speed and stop for photos whenever we wanted. Definitely a great way to get a glimpse of the daily rural life around SR and the children had a blast. A MUST in Siem Reap.Practical details: The ride was safe. We all had proper helmets that fitted us (even the children), were given dust masks and the Quad bikes had been especially equipped to accomodate our children. Some of our friends had recommended the trip to us -they had left their 2 yrs old with the manager's children. Another option for the ones who want to go for a romantic sunset trip I suppose."

The route is interesting, taking you well away from the usual tourist areas - the only other foreigners we saw were another quad bike group about halfway through the trip. The guides are good, and you've got enough freedom to play with the throttle a bit - but they won't let you get too out of hand. It's just good to get out intot he countryside, although I suspect this will be more fun in the green season than after the rice has been harvested - might be a bit dry and dusty (although faster?!) too far into the new year. The one downside was the visit to the school - while I appreciate that the business is involved with the community, I personally find this kind of tourism a bit unsettling."

The folks at Quad Adventures were all very friendly, and the equipment was all in great condition. We did a half-day tour and actually ended up being out even more than the promised four hours. That said, it was a couple of hours more than I needed. In hindsight I'd do one of the two-hour Discovery Tours. The countryside is pretty repetitive, and even with a couple of leg stretches at temples and a school I was perfectly ready to call it a day halfway through our trip. Also I'll note what may or may not be obvious: You stand a good chance of getting filthy while you're out. My wife ended up stuck in the mud and got a good bit of it on herself spinning her wheels (our very kind guide eventually helped get her free). I was at the back of our group and after four hours as the tail four wheeler I was absolutely coated in dust from head to toe. Any exposed skin was brown with dust (Quad Adventures helpfully provides riders with a mask) and my clothing was similarly coated. Just an FYI if you're also coordinating laundry day."

All the local kids would run out to the roadside and wave or high five you.Water buffalo and herds of local cows wandering along the dusty paths and passing through small villages.Our guide was amazing, kept telling us to stop when we needed to take photos and he would wait, we passed the Baking Temple (Roulos group) and he stopped so we could get a nice picture of us with the quads and the temple as a backdrop.We visited the orphanage and were shown around the classrooms and gave out candy to the kids. No pressure was given to give any donations and was a very relaxed visit.Our guide Pisethseemed to realize that we both were having fun riding the quads and seemed to find the best routes possible, bumpy track, water to ride through, lots of ups and downs, as I said I've never ridden a quad but I found the experience amazing and was relieved that we weren't stuck to flat boring roads. Fantastic :-) We loved it so much we contacted Herve the owner the very same evening to book a 2nd trip for the sunset tour.again it was us two and the guide and we visited different areas of the countryside, and our guide again managed to find bridges to cross, great fun,'terrain to ride over and water where at one point I revved a bit too much to get out and was covered in mud, I was laughing but not nearly as much as the guide and my hubby!!!!it just made the experience even more enjoyable.The sunset across the rice fields was fantastic, but the best bit was the ride back in the dark....the best fun I've had in ages and worth every penny.The quads are all new and excellent, I found easy to ride and if we had more time here in Cambodia I would book a full day tour.Don't miss this ... they take great care of you and will ride to your ability..its Brilliant worth every penny.You can stop as many times as you want for drinks and photos, and get free tuk tuk to and from the hotel.Anyone wondering if its worth it....the answer in our eyes is a HUGE yes."

I was traveling by myself and they gave me my own guide (Visal), so that I could go at my own pace on the 4-wheeler and could decide for myself how often to stop to take pictures. The guide was fantastic, the views were amazing, and the 4-wheeler is a great way to travel. It's so easy to drive that you can still pay attention to the sites around you and you get to see a very different part of Siem Reap that feels quite a bit more authentic than the touristy areas.Definitely do this for an evening when you are in town."

We booked a sunset tour which laster for about 1.5 hours and we managed to bike through the dirt roads to the rice fields in time for the sunset. I had a guide riding pillion behind me because I didn't have a driving license, but that was really for safety reasons and it didn't interfere with the fun or anything and I had full control of the bike except for once or twice where the guide helped me with really narrow paths when it got dark. It was thoroughly enjoyable, especially for us city-dwelling kids who've never seen villages or rice fields, much less biked through them. We regretted not signing up for a longer session, so do consider picking a longer tour."

We were picked up at the hotel, driven to the starting point where we received a brief introduction to riding and driving the quads. We found the training to be sufficient and friendly and we quickly learned how to ride. We spent the next several hours driving through the countryside and got to see parts of the country that would not be accessible any other way. Our guide was very friendly and courteous and he spoke English very well. We were allowed to make requests about what to see and the guide also suggested sights worth seeing. The guide adapted the tour to our requests ver well. Good job!Overall, I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to explore the Cambodian countryside, but with the following thoughts worth considering.The full day tour was exhausting to me due to the heat. You drive during both the morning and the warmest hours, and although the wind from driving is somewhat cooling, it is still extremely hot (we rode in December during what was considered the cold season). The ride itself isn't exhausting, but if you don't handle heat well, you should ask to take a longer break during the warmest hours (noon-2 pm) rather than set out earlier. The second thought is for Herve, who I found friendly and courteous too: During the last hour, I had to stop because of the heat and my lungs filling with dust from the dry road. I had no way of signaling the guide nor by wife, so I got left behind for a couple of minutes and had to catch up by driving very fast. You should have a way of signaling ahead for the back riders (the quads do not have horns). For guests, make sure you have a cell phone for emergencies if you're riding in the back. The cell phone reception is good throughout the countryside, and although you're quite safe, it never hurts to be on the safe side.Regarding the school project, I fully support and believe in the idea of helping the children. However, I am skeptical about the tourism impact when lots of quads with tourists stop by while the children are in classes. Guests, ask yourself what you would think if someone started running a tourists' tour through your childrens' school. Herve, you may want to consider a less intrusive way of showing the project, for example by having a separate area where volunteer students may talk about the project rather than having the tourists walk around in the school. All in all, however, I strongly support and condine such projects and I also highly recommend the tour. Great work to all and a special thank you to our guide!"

He knew exactly what to say and how much information each type of driver or passenger would need. My fiance just planned on riding on the back of my quad, but they took her for a quick ride around the block for training just in case she wanted to drive a little mid way through. Our guide Soheang was awesome. He went at just the ride speed. You could tell he was waiting to see how experienced a driver I was before really picking up the speed. By the end we were going down wide roads with less bumps as he could tell I was ready to let it loose! The villages were amazing and the rice paddies were spectacular. We even went by a temple which we hadn't planned to visit which was a nice bonus. We had read reviews so knew to buy lollipops for the village children. I bought a bag of 60 which I thought would be too much, turns out it was not enough so we stopped mid way through to buy more! The kids and their parents were all very gracious. You get a good feeling going through town as the kids are waving and hoping for some candy...but you don't feel as if they are begging. The orphanage was really cool also. The children didn't get distracted by us and kept on with their classes. One of the older kids gave us the tour and his english was better than any of the tour guides we have met so far, I was very impressed. They sell t shirts but are not pushy about it at all...they even explained that the shirts normally sell for $5 but they sell for $10, meaning you are really giving a donation but leaving with a nice gift! Didn't want the trip to end, and will definitely recommend to everyone."

I was just in awe...it was beautiful.It was definantly one of the memorable experiences of my holiday & a great way to get out of the city & see some rural activity & scenery.My tip would be to wear long, thick trousers ie. jeans as the engine gets quite hot.If I had more time I would definantly love to do one of the longer day trips.Thankyou Quad adventures :)"

However, any suspicion was quashed when I was received by Lang, a 12 year-old who has maturity older than her age but stood not taller than my 9 year-old daughter. It was a Saturday and there were no classes so she volunteered to show us around the compound, living quarters, pig and fish farms. We were never approached by anyone for any donation whatsoever, and there were no song and dance to entertain any visitor. It also helped when I saw that 2 secondary schools in my country (Singapore) had helped to build a playground and a classroom for the orphanage a couple of years ago.Overall, a good break from visiting the ruins, something different."

I was grateful for this as it indicated that safety was one of their prioritiesThe ride itself was absolutely fantastic. We did the 2 hour discovery which was a perfect amount of time and it allows you to see a bit of the \"non-touristy\" side of Siem Reap, in a relatively unintrusive manner.We suspected our route was the route regularly taken as we repeatedly saw kids running up their driveways to wave at us and high five as when they heard our engines coming. This was such a delight to see and we loved that our simple quad bike ride put a smile on their faces. Our guide was also fantastic, letting us stop to take photos wherever we wanted and he was friendly and patient with us. The tour also includes a visit to a school for orphans. I thought this was worth noting because we weren't aware beforehand, and whilst I do believe that visits to facilities set up for orphans are well-intentioned, I personally prefer not to visit them based on some personal views I have about this process. I am certain though, that if we had of requested to not visit this facility, Quad Bike adventure would have happily catered to this - we just weren't aware that this visit was occuring. Just thought it was worth mentioning in case anybody else intending to go may want to skip this part of the tour as well. Overall - a safe and highly recommended experience"

Thus I was not really prepared except for the fact that I will be riding the quad bike. I book the 41km Discovery Tour.Upon arriving, you will be given a short driving test. My female friend had no driving license so she was given a guide as pillon while for me I have one but the owner Herve insisted that I have a guide as pillon as well. I was at first disasppointed that i was seen as not good enough to ride on my own but on retrospect, I was glad he did because I had a great time chatting ( while enjoying the view) for the hours I was on the road which otherwise would have been a quiet affair.Visal, my pillon guide was funny and I was entertained all the way. I do however felt a bit guilty because I had no idea I was going to ride pass many small children who wave at us. If I had read the other reviews prior to booking a tour, I would have known that and would have I bought lots of sweets and lollipops. So if are booking any of the tours make sure to bring sweets so you can pass to the waving children. You will see around 20 of them plus plus along the way.The quad biking also allows me to see siem reap rural site which include a glimpse at how hard their life can be ( from a developing world resident perspective ) yet how some of them can still be happy.Visiting the orphanage school was an eye opener because that was my first time observing pupils receiving education , which from my point of view as a singaporean educator who is so used to the Interactive Whiteboard, was sad and depressing yet knowing this was the best that can be offered to them. The school even has a guide for us ( a small girl fluent in English) to tell us more about the orphanage.After the hours of walking the previous days up and down the different temples to get to know the history..... To quad bike the next day in Siem Reap is a good way to know the people albeit short.This is an experience not to be missed. Highly recommended."

We saw the countryside, water buffalos, rice fields and got an appreciation for how most Cambodians (80% farmers) live. We also saw kids (to/from school and others who were younger) who would wave and say \"hello\" to us. Halfway through the ride, we stopped at a convenience store and bought a bunch of candies and handed those out to the kids on the second half of the ride. That was really nice...The temples are awe-inspiring for sure, but we really enjoyed the quad ride away from the crowds and in the midst of the Cambodian country side. Definitely highly recommend.

Buy some lollies from the little shop & hand them out to the local kiddies as you ride. Best thing I've ever done!"

This was not problem for the company and made no difference to the experience, we had an exceptional time. Fantastic photo opportunities of the rural people and countryside. I would recommend this tour to anyone. Well worth the money. The visit to the school/orphanage that is sponsored by Quad Adventure tours was well worthwhile. Pick up from and return to motel included - in our case on the back of trail bikes."

There was free hotel pick-up and there is a training session where you can Pass or Fail. I failed so I rode with my significant other. The tour is said to take a little over 2 hours. We were on tour for over 3 with many chances to take breaks and pictures. The roads/countryside is awfully bumpy and dusty but that is what you would expect. If you get sick easily, not the adventure for you. We got a beating from the sun and had to take it easy for the rest of the day. Highly recommended for those that have yet to discover the countryside of Cambodia."

Owned by an English speaking French guy called Herve, all his staff were very welcoming, friendly and professional. My wife and I booked a 'Discovery' tour which I think was meant to be two hours but we had an unrushed three hours. They sent a tuk tuk to our hotel to pick us up, then gave us some training to make sure we could use the machines, which were very modern and of a high quality. Then two guides on an off-ride bike lead the way for us to follow. It was amazing. We saw miles and miles of green rice fields, went through numerous villages where you could see the everyday life of water buffalos pulling carts, and kids running out to wave at you as you go past. We could stop whenever we wanted to take photos, the guides just stopped ahead and patiently waited. Plus, it was great fun! Quad bikes can pretty much go over any terrain so even if you did go over a pot hole it was no problem, even for my weedy wife!! Thoroughly recommend. One thing to mention is there is another quad bike company almost on the same road as QAC. I don't know how good they are, but we almost went there as the names are quite similar."

There were times when we just opened it up and zipped right along and others where it was a bit bumpier and slowed down. I stopped whenever I wanted and my guide would wait for me to take photos. We also took a few breaks, for photos and just to stretch the legs a bit.I found going down some of the dirt paths interesting as you can see the different types of houses and could see what locals were doing with their day. On the day I was there, a very old-looking rice thresher (probably considered an antique if it were in the US) was visiting the different homes and it was fascinating to see how it worked so the families could separate their rice from the chaff.The trip was a mixture of interesting things to see and the fun of bumpy paths, shallow water and zipping along on the flat areas.I would recommend this as a fun activity on its own as well as a break from the temples."

I was not impressed by the first half we were driving slow and the country side is not that impressive, but it does give you an overview of the way people live on the outskirts of town. After the school stop the lead driver picked up the pace and the ride became more fun. All in all it was a fun thing to do, if you have a few hours to kill after visiting the temples this is a good activity but it is a bit on the expensive side especially for a place like Cambodia."

After which, we received a short training covering all the important things we need to know and take note of. The people were so warm and welcoming, we immediately felt safe. Each of us had our own quad and a guide that will sit behind us. We were given helmets and off we went into the villages in search of the best location for sunset. Our guides, Vichet and Visal were so wonderful and knowledgeable, sharing all they know about the life of normal Cambodians, the history and also the more interesting stories of wedding ceremonies etc. We had the most wonderful 1 hour in Cambodia with Quad Adventures.

We were in Cambodia for over a week and loved every second of it and that was largely due to the warmth of the people. For people with such a turbulent and recent past, they are incredibly upbeat. Anyway, Some friends and I went to Siem Reap at the beginning of August this year. We decided we definitely wanted to do some quad biking while we were travelling and a friend of ours had booked a trip with quad adventure. On the day that we went the weather had been awful, it poured rain all day so we were all a little apprehensive before going. Also, we had been sightseeing all day, so we wanted to take a shorter route than our planned two hours. The owner, Herve, was incredibly accommodating and after some consultation with the other guys, found us a shorter and safe route. As two of us had never been on quads before, it was agreed that we would have helpers on the bike with us. For me, this worked out really well. The guy who came along with me, Don, was fantastic. Not only did help me to relax but he also acted as a tour guide as we drove around the Cambodian countryside, pointing out numerous things that I definitely would have missed had I been by myself. He was a really friendly guy and happily gave me an insight into the life of the Cambodian people. As I said we took a shorter tour so I think in total we were probably out for an hour and 15 or maybe a little more. In hindsight, I would have preferred to stay out longer as I really did love every second of it. The Cambodian countryside is beautiful and this is definitely a great way to see it. It's exciting, interesting and somewhat educational all in one. I would highly recommend this to anyone wanting to get out and see the Cambodian countryside. The owner and they guys who work with him are all very helpful, friendly people and it was a pleasure to meet them. If(hopefully when) I get back to Siem Reap I will almost certainly be returning to Quad Adventure Cambodia. Money well spent!"

Mr. Herve Nicole, (the owner) gave us a introductory course on how to ride a quad bike, provided us with all available routes and packages helping us to select the one that suits better to our wants and on top of all, he recommended the best suitable tour and NOT the most expensive one :)We have selected the ride through the jungle leading to an orphanage which was about 30Km away. We drove through the rice fields, jungle, and villages experiencing the real Cambodian life and friendliness of the Cambodian people. They were all constantly waving and smiling at us. We visited the orphanage offering rice, oil, books and pencils and we stayed with the children for 1 hour. If you would like to do the same, it is better to bring them rice, oil or anything eatable as these are the most needed items.The weather on the way to the orphanage was incredible however, on the way back we got hit by a heavy rain which to tell you the truth, it made this ride even more exciting. We came back soaking wet but it was an experience that we will never forget.A definitely must do, if you intend to visit this incredible land!!! Cambodia ROCKS!!! :)"

My friend and I were deliberating between going for the Skyventure Microlight or doing Quad Adventure. We decided on the latter, because of budget concerns, and we went for the Easy Ride. (Perhaps the Microlight can be done on my next trip!) The staff from Quad Adventure picked us up from our hotel and skilfully negotiated treacherous mud puddles (aftermath of the flood) on their motorbikes. Upon reaching the office, we were given a thorough briefing on how to operate the quad bikes. As the both of us had no quad biking experience (and I don't hold any driving license as well), we were each assigned a guide to be our pillion riders in the event that we require assistance. Vichet and Piseth were really amazing and good-natured, sharing with us personal stories along the way, while ensuring that we were able to ride with ease. We had fun zipping through the countryside, through muddy puddles and on concrete roads. Along the way you get to take in views of beautiful scenery and loads of smiley children waving enthusiastically at you. It was awesome fun and definitely a highlight of my trip! Do not worry that it's beyond you. Anyone can do it really. ;) And I'll certainly take a longer tour on my next visit. Tips: 1) Wear long pants as the steam might scald you. 2) Might be good to bring a waist pouch or a small bag that can be hung around your neck to keep your valuables."

The thrill of navigating an ATV through rural paths dodging potholes and crossing narrow bridges is an adventure not to be missed while visiting Siem Reap. We have been to Angkor Wat many times as tourists and currently as residents of Cambodia and we feel this was one of our highlights of our overall Cambodian experience.Quad Adventures is efficiently run by a French owner and his Cambodian wife. They are very safety-aware and sensitive to the impact on the local communities. They have adopted their own \"cause\" of a school run for orphans and children of migrant workers.One of the guides leads you on his motorcycle over back dirt roads and trails interrrupted by a few moments of going onto the main national tarmac highway.The back roads give a glimpse into the rural Cambodian lifestyle of families and farmers. The smiles on the shining faces of the Cambodian children will light up your day. The only trick is when you try to wave back (naturally with your right hand), that is the hand that controls the ATV throttle for acceleration, so you wave and slow down or ytou learn to wave with your left hand.The bright lime-green rice paddy fields glistened in the intense sunlight. The long horned water buffalo make their own path so you might have to adjust your route accordingly. In general, the farm animals and dogs consider the land to be their territory and motorized vehicles have to accomodate their whims.Subsistence living is viewed at every turn. Under the houses on stilts families store livestock or machinery. People fish with wooden poles and strings. People do the back- breaking work of harvesting rice. Small vegetables are growing under make-shift covers. There are a few elaborate houses interspersed in between the humble wooden abodes of the masses.The bottom line is that vrrroooooooming along on an ATV is just pure fun in addition to being a window into a traditional lifestyle."

Travelled through some villages outside siem reap with kids running alongside and waving, stunning scenery and one of the most spectacular sunsets I have ever seen. Our guides were friendly, considerate and patient and really good English....overall a huge thumbs up, definitely a must try when you are in town and next time I will be going for longer!"

A great addition to our Siem Reap tour, other than going to Angkor Wat and the temples visiting.The road was bumpy and we had fun looking at the paddy fields and the countryside, we even gave out some sweets to the local children. Do bring some sweets to the children as they are more than happy to get some gifts. All the staff of Quad Adventure was very friendly and helpful. The only thing I regretted was not taking a longer tour."

Full disclosure: my first quad-biking experience, so I don't have a clue on what this activity normally costs, but I felt a pinch in my wallet. That said, loved rambling around Siem Reap's countryside, seeing little kids wave with enthusiasm (remember to bring candies, that's what they're pining for!), and enjoying the top class service from the guides. All being said, great fun!"

What's the fun in following a 'perfect' schedule on your holiday anyway. In the corner of our mind, we had this quad biking as an option. I tried for a booking twice but in vain. Though Aug'11 was off-season we found it difficult to book a slot. Please pre-book it. Our pick was sunset ride. They had arranged for a pick up from the hotel. The guy was prompt to take us there. I found them professional & care for safety very seriously.I do ride motorcycles back at home. But, this was our first time to try something like this. I was asked to take a trial before the real ride - Somehow they felt that I would need assistance.When we set out for the ride I was given a brand new bike, which was much better to handle than the one given for trial. It was fun & easy. The country side was beautiful. We went through the paddy fields. Amused kids gather to wave at us through out. We got to see the peasants returning home after hard day's work.The bike was mean enough to take us through the tough tarmac - slush, mud, ditch, rocks & what not. The trip gets really interesting when we had to go through some non-motor-able routes. Rain added to the fun. We stopped at every other place to take pictures & enjoyed the sight. The team was very accommodating. That was a ride to remember. And I got certified for Quad-Biking in the end.. Yippeee !"

I think we were very lucky because no one else booked that time so it was just us and our guides and we were able to go at an adventure pace. The countryside is beautiful and you get a real understanding of local life on the tour. We stopped at an orphanage and school that Quad Adventure Tours sponsor and it will tug at your heart strings and make you want to get involved. I think it is very noble that a portion of every tour goes back to the community. This tour exceeded our expectations and we all had the best experience. Book it, you won't be disappointed!!"

You pass through some rural villages, taking in the rice paddies, and day to day life! The tour takes you to a local orphanage/school where you get a private tour by one of the students/residents. I believe the actual route of the tour varies based on the weather conditions, but we were taken near the Rolous group of temples, which was ace. We were both extremely happy with the tour, and would do it again!"

I took my family (boys aged 15 and 12) on an afternoon tour (scheduled 2.5 hours). We were picked up from our hotel by tuk-tuk (staff from Quad Bike Adventure) and taken to their compound/starting point a 10 minute trip from central Siem Reap. We were given our instructions on operating the bikes and completed a test run to fimiliarise us with the machines. The quad bikes were recent model (2011) in great operating condition and relativeley easy to operate. The staff were very fair in allowing the youngest to drive with guide being doubled and able to take control if required. The drive went through the country side with little traffic to contend with and guided by Khmer staff. The staff were helpful, great fun and very protective of us as we negotiated our way. Scenery was great - travelled around a road that went through several villages and past more temple ruins. You go at your own pace and take the time to absorb the experience.Great staff, great operation - highly recommend."

Taking a quad tour is a great alternative to visiting the temples and probably the best way to seeing the Cambodian back country in half or a full day and getting out of Siem Reap. In retrospective, it was one of the best adventures in Cambodia.Granted, it is a bit pricy, but worth every dollar. The guides are very friendly and good fun, the quads are state-of-the-art. Just check the weather forecast and head to Quad Adventure (we didn't have a reservation and they accomodated within 15min). I suggest taking the discovery tour (like we did) or the half a day tour."

As it was low season we were the only ones on the trip, which was great as it meant us and our motorbike guide could go at a pace and difficulty level that suited us, i.e. a bit faster and trickier than if you were in a big group. That said, if you want to go slow and easy, the guide adapts to suit you.He took us well off the beaten track through villages, cattle herds, ditches, mud banks and dirt tracks! It was really good to see a bit of Cambodia that wasn't touristy and you felt that you really were seeing a bit of real Cambodian life.If you get the chance to do this, don't hesitate! After the temples this was our highlight in Cambodia and I would do it again in an instant. In fact, at the end of the tour I wanted to jump back on and go around again.If you're thinking about it, don't hesitate; DO IT!"

They are too young to drive quads in the UK but they could here, under proper supervision (safety is respected). Good chance you will get splashed with a bit of mud, but you must take your camera (in a plastic bag, and stowed somehow when you drive). As you go down muddy tracks, you get to see the real Cambodia (water buffalos, ox ploughing and all that), even though you're very near Siem Reap. Westernish prices but we felt it was well worth it compared to what we would pay to do this activity somewhere else.The 2 hour trip (well, it was quite a bit longer) includes a rest stop at an orphanage. They don't solicit donations - you can do this after on the net if you want, but I talked to one of the British volunteers and she said any materials (pens, lear to read books I guess she meant) would be welcome."

We had an excellent guide named HONG. He took good care of us, leading the way on his scrambler and was accommodating when we wanted to make stops to take pictures.The ride through the villages near sunset was fantastic. See the locals go about in their daily lives and the cows going home at the end of the day (the cows caused a bit of a road block for us but it was really interesting). And the kids playing outside their houses would wave exuberantly at us, making one feel 'almost famous' :DBe prepared to get all dirty, so don't wear your best clothes. A large part of the trip would be on dirt paths. Even if you get tarmac, expects lots of potholes (mud-filled)! Because it rained earlier in the day for us, we got a fair share of mud (perhaps even mixed with some cow dung!!) splattered on our legs and bermudas, which got washed out as we rode through a flood (this part was sooooo... fun) in the village, and then splattered on again...At the end of the trip, we hosed down at the shop (which is actually the house where the French owner lives with his family) and received a certificate as keepsake.We highly recommend this to anyone who loves rugged fun, doesn't mind getting dirty and wet, and wants to see the real Cambodia.You don't required a driving/biking license to do this but you gotta pass an orientation ride before the actual trip. If you fail the orientation, you'll ride with a guide as a pillion behind you.PS: No Speeding :)"

My husband & I did the 4hr tour with Quad Adventure in Siem Reap & it was one of the best experiences (not to mention birthdays for me) while traveling SE Asia. The quads are comfortable, powerful, & very easy to maneuver. Our tour guide was great & went at the speed we were comfortable with. During the tour, we visited an orphanage (which was the highlight of the tour for me) that the company sponsors & were given a tour of the property by one of the children...in perfect English no less. It was absolutely remarkable! We were told that most of the buildings that have been built on the premises have been donated by tourists who have visited in the past. Then, we continued on riding the quads through the countryside, surrounded by rice paddy fields & the beautiful Cambodian children who would run out of their houses just to wave, yell hello, & smile as we rode by them. It was utterly heartwarming to see such beautiful happy children. I would do this tour again in a heartbeat! They have many different tour options, so if 4 hrs is too long (or too short), they have an appropriate amount of time just for you. The owner of the company is an awesomely funny french dude so be sure to pay careful attention to his introductory speech on quad do's & don'ts :)"

The quad bikes are pretty easy to manage, and if you're not confident to ride it on your own, you have someone ride on the back with you. Hong, the instructor who rode with me was great! It felt like a personalized tour. Really friendly and patient. We stopped and took photos, and it was truly an eye opener, riding the quad bikes into the more rural part of Siem Reap. We also stopped by the orphanage and it was given a tour around the school. Do bring candies for the village kids and the kids who are at the orphanage. Something simple like that brings the kids so much joy. Be prepared for getting muddy and dirty so wear long pants and track shoes. We didn't mind the dirt though, it's all part of the great rural adventure on the quad bikes. Apart from the Angkor temples, the quad bike tour was the highlight of our trip to Siem Reap!"

Our 3 boys ages 12,11, and 8 loved this and rate it as one of their favorites memories of our trip to Cambodia/Vietnam. Our 20 year old niece loved it too.

The orphanage visit is clearly a standard part of the route, but the visit was really interesting and I thought it worthwhile. I would definitely highly recommend this adventure, particularly for families with kids."

They'll come pick you up, so that might be best.My son had guide with him on his ATV, but he just told him which way to go and where to stop, and let him drive the way he wanted.The equipment is in good shape and faster than you'll want to go. They provide helmet and bags for your feet, but if its wet you'll still get some mud on you.Bring a camera and drinks."

It was quite a thrill ride over bumpy and wet tracks - with obstacles like cows, bikes, dogs and ducks to avoid - but really very good fun! And we felt we really got to see Cambodia off the beaten track - paddy fields, small kampong villages, lots of friendly smiling children waved at us and we saw a fantastic sunset too. Our kids aged 7 & 10 thought it was fab! - and us big kids thought it was fab too!

My daughter, who\u2019s 18 and drives at home, and I shared one bike while my son, who\u2019s just learning to drive at home, shared another bike with our guide. Although the website says no drivers under 16, they did allow my son to drive mainly because he\u2019s six foot tall and big/strong enough to handle the bike. The guide explained that he would normally ride on his bike with us but I asked that he ride with my son \u2013 it just made me more comfortable.The route took us through the rural countryside surrounding Siem Reap and it was great way to see how rural life for real, not some staged village visit. The little kids waved and smiled at us as we went past. We stopped at an orphanage which Quad Adventures helps to support and we were shown around by one of the orphans. I was worried that we would be pressured into donating but we weren\u2019t. We also stopped to walk around a monastery.The stops are needed because if you\u2019re not used to quad-biking, it can be tiring, even for a passenger. The route was mostly on dirt side roads but there were a couple of sections when we traveled on paved roads used by cars but they were not main roads and the traffic was light \u2013 not difficult or scary. For us the half-day was plenty long enough.After about three hours, we could see the rain moving in. Our tour guide gave us rain ponchos and even before we started out, they had put plastic bags around our feet to keep some of the mud off us. The rain really helped to cool us off but it did get heavy enough for us to take shelter at a roadside caf\u00e9 which was opposite a 9th century temple ruin \u2013 we hadn\u2019t bought our temple pass otherwise we could have visited.We got back to base about an hour late which was not a problem. We were drenched through, very muddy and very happy. My kids want to add that you shouldn\u2019t be put off by the possibility of rain \u2013 it didn\u2019t spoil the experience at all. Great fun for an afternoon."

We are in our mid 50s and overweight but we had an absolute ball and after about 4 hrs was only just starting to tire. Herve made sure I was road confident before we started and from then on, it was exhilerating. The kids in the orphanage were fantastic but what we enjoyed most was the changing scenery - from lanes, fields, villages etc. A real mixture of shade and full sun.It took me a while to realise you can only wave with your left hand as your right hand is for the throttle and I would remind riders to be careful riding through the villages in case a small child runs out, but the children seem wise to the quad bikes and all smile. There is plenty of open roads for a little more speed.I worse three quarter length pants and was very glad I had bought a pair of leg warmers (daggy I know) but my right leg started to burn from the exhaust pipe so when I put the two on the right leg, I was completely comfortble. Also I didn't apply enough sunscreen - well I did but the husband forgot to bring the small tube for the return journey. I just bought a cheap cotton scarf and tied it around my shoulders and problem solved. I suggest you also take one bottle of water too as it can get hot, even if you should be able to stop and buy some on the way. Highly recommended."

I had ridden Quads before and was familiar with them so riding was easy (not that it is hard anyway). After a brief and thorough block of instruction we set off in the countryside for our ride. I was travelling alone but ended up part of a group of 8, so they split us into two groups, each with a front guide on a motorbike. The tour took us through the countryside and we got to see a lot of village homes and cute children waving along the way as well as cows, ducks, rice fields, fishermen, etc. The views were very beautiful and it was lovely seeing all the children wave and smile. Seeing a gaggle of geese was a real treat - they were so funny!. The sunset was oustanding and majestic. My only negatives were that the guide was really a lead vehicle and didn't really say anything at all - no real \"tour\" and there was no opportunity for fun on the Quads - just a lot of slow road riding - seemed more like a mode of transport than an actual Quad adventure ride. Other than that a good value for your money and a different way to see Sieam Reap."

After a brief introductory lesson (the quads are really easy to manouver) we were off on the 2+ hour discovery tour. You will go through the Cambodian countryside, stop at an orphanage and at a local village for refreshments. The roads and countryside will give you a taste of the most authentic Cambodia. Make sure you request Hong as your tour guide. He will take you through some amaziing roads and will stop anytime you want to take pictures or stretch your legs. He will help you with the quad, the helmet, take pictures of you on the bike, etc...Truly a great person to tour the surroundings of Siem Reap!"

No problem whatsoever for the quads - they were brand new and powerful - very easy and comfortable to drive. What can one say but it was just great fun! Travelling the backroads where your typical tourist never goes, the local kids who invariably run from their houses to the road when they hear you coming and wave as if its the first time they see this sight, broad smiles on their faces.....The stop at the orphanage along the way is interesting, but we have chosen \"our own\" orphanage to sponsor in Cambodia, so were eager to move on.Even my 70+ yrs old dad had no problem riding the ATVs and thought this was one of the most fun things he had done in a long time."

My husband and i have both been quad biking before but really wanted to see the real Cambodia, having travelled for many weeks around SEA we had left Phnom Penh a little deflated and were looking for some fun.We booked the discovery tour initially and afternoon through villages and out to an orphanage. When we arrived we signed our disclaimer and as we had experience we were offered the big quad bikes which we were all too happy to accept :) Helmets on, our guide wrapped my trainers in plastic bags as there was plenty of muddle puddles about due to the recent rains.We were off, there's plenty of varied terrain on the routes you are taken on, the countryside is stunning and you can always stop to take pictures your guide will stop up ahead and wait for you no problem. It was very muddy this day and it is advisable to wear long trousers due to the steam which can be generated when water hits the engine as you plough through a puddle.We planned ahead for the orphanage and went to a local shop prior to our tour where we purchased reading books, colouring books, pencils a football and a volleyball as well as some coconut candy we brought from Vietnam. The children were all in classes so we were keen not to disturb their lessons too much. We enjoyed the tour of the orphanage very much you could see the children are keen to learn, we chatted with volunteer teachers and hope to visit again one day.On the way back we stopped at a village for a rest and a drink, this gave us the opportunity to chat with the other person on our tour and our guide. We could have sat there all afternoon if the truth be told.On our way back we went through some rice paddies which was such fun going down a steep hill and through water just before we hit a flat run of road and picked up speed!The next morning i realised i'd left my sunglasses in the giudes waterproof bag we e-mailed to ask when we could collect them, when we got back to iour hotel after lunch Quad Adventures had dropped them off for us.We were still talking about how much fun we'd had so we e-mailed to see if they could fit us in for a sunset tour. Luckily they could and off we went for yet more quad fun. This time we went on a different route but it was just as fun with varied terrain and amazing scenery. We had quite a few encounters with cows, which were funny and i almost got stuck which just added to the fun. The sunset was beautiful and we have some stunning pictures as a reminder of the fun we had. The adventures offered are varied and for people of all abbilities, the staff are very friendly and will happily take pictures of you. Wish i could do it every day!!"

I have to admit I was a little apprehensive about going, because I barely drive. We signed up for the Discovery tour which is around two hours of driving on your own quad-bike with a guide through the countryside passing rice paddies and villages. The tour also includes visiting an orphanage (where you see people do inspiring things, including very young children dedicating their time to teach others), and a stopover at one of Siem Reap's oldest temples- older than Angkor Wat. It was amazing, they give you very clear instructions on how to use the quad-bike (which is an automatic) and they even let you have a test-run and only when you are comfortable they begin the tour. The tour guide, Dom was SO patient with us as we stopped so often to take in the view, take photos and speak with the locals. Our tour in the end overran by more than an hour, but Dom never rushed us. He was AMAZING and we highly recommend him! It was an incredible experience, not only meeting the locals in their villages, the breathtaking scenery, but also the fun aspect of driving on all sorts of terrain! It was brilliant! The company was set up by Herve Nicole who was very welcoming and is doing a great job providing this opportunity to tourists! Honestly, despite all the wonderful things to see in Siem Reap with the temples and Ta Prohm, this was the highlight of the whole trip!"

Interestingly, the tuk tuk driver, Hont who fetch us from our hotel turns out to be our personal tour guide for the tour. After a short briefing by the owner, Hont and his colleague gave us practical lesson. Within a mere 15 minutes, we felt comfortable with the bike and began our adventure. It is worthy to note that despite the fact that I have no driving license, I did not encounter any major difficulties in operating the bike. Hence, you can be assured that it is safe and easy to operate.The journey to paddy field was easily to navigate as Hont gave clear instruction. We passed many picture perfect sceneries along the way. The pleasant journey was further enhanced by lovely village children who waved at us as we pass by.I would also like to commend Hont for his thoughtfulness - he offered us raincoats once it begins to drizzle. Overall, the ride lasted for approximately 2 hours including a few photo taking stops instead of the advertised 1 hour (extended due to rain on return journey and henceforth, slower driving speed). We were also given a certificate of completion after the ride. The only negative thing I have to say that we were not lucky enough to catch the sunset due to the rain (start of rainy season). Nonetheless, I certainly look forward to coming back for a longer trip next time round.Tips:  Do wear long pants & covered - the engine at ankle area feels hot and it is good to protect your legsMoreover, if you are caught in rain like me, its going to be freezing cold driving in the rain with shorts"

They decked us out in our helmets and gave us some instructions on the automatic Polaris Quad bikes. Our guide was sensitive to our lack of quad bike experience and desire to stop and take photos along the way. We weren't in a hurry, savouring the sights of rice paddys with elaborately decorated ancestoral shrines and streams as well as villages with traditional housing and subsistance farms. Almost every child from every village came out to wave at us as we rode along. We stopped at the Chres Village school and Orphanage, which is sponsored by the guys at QAC. We thought it was terrific to see how tourism can impact a community in a positive way. We stopped for a welcome cool drink at a village near the Roulos Ruins. We rode around the ruins, and would have loved the opportunity to look inside but time did not permit. All up it was a fun morning. It was very dusty and couldn't wait to jump in the pool when we got back to the hotel. 2.5 hours was just about the right length of time for us. The roads our guide took us on were not busy and we didn't feel anxious about riding on them. Hope this review is useful."

I highly recommend taking a morning tour to take advantage of the cooler temperatures, you will be covered head to foot when riding between long pants and the helmet they provide. The quads we were provided with worked perfectly, and our guide, Vichet, did a great job. Vichet had a firm grasp of English and led the two of us on our tour. A highlight of the tour was a stop by a local orphanage, where one of the young students took us on a tour while practicing his English. If you take the tour it is a good idea to bring some toys for the orphanage, and of course any thing you could donate is appreciated. The orphanage was a clean facility that had some construction going on, and of course the children were in class. The majority of our time was spent riding around back roads that you couldn't take a car on. As our tour progressed and our guide became more comfortable with our ability we were able to cover more and more ground. I would estimate that we spent 3.5 of the four hours touring around on the quads, with a couple of stops to get a refreshment, as well as stops at the orphanage and a couple of temples. Our guide was very open to our request to spend as much time riding as possible and at the end of our tour we were pretty tired (in a good way). If you have some spare time in Siem Reap I highly recommend Quad Adventures for a fun and safe way to spend a day seeing parts of Siem Reap that most visitors never look at."

The total time took almost 2 hours for us with stopping to take pictures and the actual ride. We were given the proper helmets and masks for the ride. We had two guides with us that lead and trailed to make sure that we were ok. The ATVs were loads of fun. The ride was amazing, you'll get to see the country side up close and it is truly beautiful. The locals kids were always waving hi. The dirt road was in very good condition for the ride.After we were finished, we were given a free ride back to our hotel.I say that this is a \"must\" do in Siem Reap.Finding the place could take a bit of a walk, but it is well worth it."

We hired a double quad for a very good price, and were shown basic training on the quad before hand - safety was excellent. It was just the two of us with our guide, and we did the Discovery Tour - definitely recommend!The guide we went with was very friendly and we stopped a couple of times for a drink where we chatted. We went all round the country side, visiting villages, and seeing all of the children. We got lots of photos and you could stop when you wanted. We also visited an orphanage which was a great insight to see what happens there. We bought a tshirt with the money going straight to the orphanage in further help with the children.We also visited a temple and overall the tour was amazing. If you want to discover the real Siem Reap - then defiantly do a tour with Quad Adventure.Highly Recommended :)"

We shared two quads.There was no rushing or fast biking but a relaxed pace that gave us chance to wave at the locals , share some lollies/sweets with the kids and take pictures as we needed toThe bikes are in great condition and the guide was never in a hurry so we always felt relaxed. The guide took us to a local school / orphanage where we had chance to talk with the children and gain an insight into their way of life. My ten year old daughter enjoyed the experience at the school so much she went back the next dayHighly recommended. It's what travel is all about--getting off the beaten track and exploring"

A prompt pick up from the Hotel from a friendly member of staff, then 2 1/2 hours of fun and amazing sights. What an incredible place Cambodia is..up there in my top 2 destinations! The people are truly amazing, knowing what they have gone through, and the poverty they still live in. It is truly humbling. It rained cats and dogs..out came our guide with waterproofs,(and plenty of water supplied), this made it even more fun for the kids..as we got soaked and mud covered. I would recomend this to EVERONE. Do take along crayons, toys etc for the Orphanage, I did not realise we would be visiting it on this shorter trip and felt guilty coming empty handed..although you can buy t-shirts there and the money goes back into the Orphanage.You truly got the 'feel'of Cambodia. Thank you to Quad Adventures, a job well done."

Being my third time visiting Cambodia, I wanted to experience more of Siem Reap than the usual places i had visited before. As the town is building up more, i figured 'off the beaten track' was the way to go to get a bit further out than i had been and get in amongst the country living areas. Having developed an anxiety over two wheeled bikes, I was jealous of those hiring scooters, vespas and motos in South East Asia. When i came across quad adventures i knew i could get my adrenalin rush! The company runs a great course that is not strict on their allocated time and i loved having the freedom to ride the bike myself. I could stop to take photos whenever i wanted, even when up close and personal with a buffalo herd and i liked that there were enough breaks so i didn't get too tired! The orphanage visit is a nice inclusion and very conveniently they picked me up from and dropped me back at my hotel. I immediately recommended the company to some friends and a family who were also staying in Siem Reap at the time."

They taught those of us who had no clue as to how to ride a Quad bike, with clear instructions and patience.We went on the sunset tour, lasting about two hours, which was a perfect amount of time. The temperature was cooling, making it the ideal time to go out. The scenery on the tour was fantastic; we drove through small villages and around the rural areas. As the sounds of the Quad bikes drew near, children came running, waving at the convoy.The convoy moves at the pace of the group, meaning those who are a bit more cautious can grow in confidence.Although returning slightly muddy, it was absolutely brilliant. We went twice, and if we go back we will be definately repeating the tour or taking part in one of their many others."

The students of course were adorable and the staff was helpful when guiding us through the grounds. Please don't hesitate to donate money or buy a t-shirt. The kids will LOVE it if you bring them some candy.I also loved that all the quads were automatic. The quick lesson before getting on the quad for your test drive is helpful. In all this was a great experience not to be missed. Be sure to wear sun screen or even a long linen shirt if your skin burns easily because I was quite burned even though it was the morning trip.

Since it was only our little family on the tour, we stopped whenever we wanted to snap a picture, visit the local market, or just have a stretch break.One little downside was that our 2 boys had to sit behind us on each of our Quad bikes, so their frontal view was obstructed.

We went through the countryside and got to see how daily life really is for the locals. What really warmed our hearts is how happy the children are, when in reality, they have next to nothing except dirty raggedy clothes and yet they seem so happy, laughing and smiling, running out into the road to wave to us passing by. It was puzzling why they all do the same thing? Reality really hits and you realize how life is so unfair for some people, while here in the U.S, kids are so materialistic and superficial with their ipods, ipads, toys and video games, while these children have each other to play with in the dirt and lacking nutrition and proper medical care - you could see that survival is number 1 on the families' list rather than what restaurants to eat at, and what car to drive.. Anyway, we visited the orphanage, and as you approach, the kids in the class, stand up and in unison says, \"Good morning, visitor, how are you? Where are you from?\", it was cute and touching. Older kids teach the younger ones English, Japanese and Khmer, there are no real teachers. We brought school supplies, crayons, pens, calculator, drawing books, dictionary for the school. We wished we had brought vitamins, or cold medicines because they really need it. We each got t-shirts and was on our way... Going on this tour, makes you wonder about alot of things in life, and really appreciate what you have ... it was a great way to see Cambodia outside of Pub Street and into the reality of the local people. In the early morning, I got a glimpse of monks walking alongside the road to houses for food offerings for the day.... I regret that I didn't get a picture, but it's really magnificient to see.. however, you can only witness very early in the morning.. If you come to Siemreap and do not do this tour, you are missing out a great deal!! Make sure to wear long pants, sunglasses, and maybe even double up on the face mask, it gets reallllly dusty.. A++++++++++ Thanks Quad Adventure!!"

When I was done, all I wished was that I had booked at least the 1/2 day (4-hour) tour. You get so much for your money. It was at least an hour and a half, the most amazing sunset and scenery, every five feet there were the most beautiful children at the end of the road waving hello...so excited to see us. I wanted to take all of them home!!! All of the staff at Quad Adventure were so nice and accomodating. The \"tour guides\" were GREAT guys as well. They made the wonderful experience even better. We saw beautiful countryside, beautiful people and a gorgeous sunset...what more could you ask for. I recommend the half day tour...I left wanting SO MUCH more. USA loves Cambodia!"

I really booked the ride for my partner (thinking he might want to do something other than visiting temples) and I am so glad I did - I absolutely loved it! Herve was so lovely - even after I got my days mixed up, he sent someone out for us and managed to fit us in. I had never ridden a ATV before, but Herve was great with instructions and safety, and I was grateful for the test run before we went - very easy to pick up. We ended up being the only 2 people on the tour (we did 41kms) and our guide was lovely. It is an absolutely amazing experience, seeing the countryside and having all the kids run out when they heard us coming! I felt so bad that we didn't have anything for them, they were so so happy to see us! We went over our 2 hour time but there was never any rush or comments. Such an amazing experience - a must do in Siem Reap!!!"

This is FUN! and a great way to see the country side, including villages, markets, a temple, an orphanage (which the company sponsors and which is charming and worthwhile) while traversing a good balance of mostly off-road terrain: dirt roads, dusty narrow paths, tracks through rice paddies, fields, villages, back-blocks of suburbs and the back roads of Siem Reap. Great balance for riding, between fast flat sections and some more challenging winding, twisting, rugged parts.In terms of the actual riding, the quadbikes are very easy to ride and you get very good, efficient instruction and a short practice ride at the start. You wear a helmet and a face mask (for the dust!). You get led all the way by a guide on a motorcycle, who adjusts the speed to suit you. I am a bit of a rev-head and have raced cars, although never ridden a motorcycle or a quad-bike, so I was very happy to go as fast as possible and really attack the rugged, winding parts. I was teamed up with a young German guy who was experienced on quadbikes and our guide let us go full-on most of the time (although he always slowed us down for intersections, villages, wandering cows etc), which was just brilliant - heaps of fun. The older couple who were on the same tour with us had a separate guide and I assume they went far more sedately, as we got back long before them. So the company really tailor the experience to your ability and attitude.This is about the best thing on 4 wheels in South East Asia. Do it...TWICE!"

My husband and I signed up for Quad Adventures when we visited Siem Reap in Dec 2010, and I must say it was one of our favorite adventures/activities in Cambodia. We had a wonderful time with our guide Savuth. He was a perfect guide. Took us through the villages and showed us the \"hidden\" part of Cambodia... things you don't get to see in the touristy parts of Siem Reap. What an adventure... we visited temples, a wedding ceremony, a monastery, an orphanage, rice paddies, and so much more. We met so many friendly villagers along the way. Savuth spoke wonderful English and helped us to understand what we were seeing and to appreciate the way of life of the villagers. He also made sure we were safe and comfortable on our quads which was key since this was my first time driving a quad. I'd give my highest recommendation to Quad Adventures, and make sure you ask for Savuth."

You have a lot of control on the ATV and can wave easily at all the friendly kids on the way. We also rode with the company that has dune buggies & that is a lot more intense for the driver (a different experience - more peaceful with ATV, more adventure with the dune buggy).

I have some experience riding a motorcycle and Mei and I ride bicycles regularly but, as Herv\u00e9 warned, quads are completely different. And so I found out. We worked out our combined weight was below the 130kg limit so elected to share a quad which worked out very nicely for us. We also decided to go for the long ride and that too was a great decision.The entire group was broken into smaller groups and we went in slightly different directions and at intervals so we wouldn't be choking on each other's dust. As it turned out, we were eventually alone with Herv\u00e9's brother, Fabian who proved to be an amiable and patient guide. We were told to stop the quad when we want to take pictures as the steering can kick back over ruts and driving one-handed is not recommended. We were also told to stop as often as we wanted and so it proved - being a bit of an avid photographer, I stopped quite often and each time Fabian slowed or stopped with us, otherwise he kept a good distance ahead so as not to kick up too much dust.Talking of dust, we were well equipped with face masks and the safety briefing beforehand had a short test ride as well. All in all, Herv\u00e9's outfit makes sure the quads are in good condition, and the riders are all comfortable and confident before setting off. Our route took us through the countryside and we stopped once for a short drink and rest before stopping at the highlight of the ride - the Orphanage which Herv\u00e9 supports. This is quite a remarkable place with many boarders and almost 300 students. It well deserves donations and support.Our ride took a little longer than the two and a half hours we'd booked but there were no complaints all round. Mei and I were extremely happy to have bumped our way around the Siem reap countryside, seeing places and things we otherwise would not have seen, and we still marvel at how friendly everyone was. Everywhere we went, kids rushed out to wave and smile at us and we shall always remember how remarkably warm a people the Cambodians are.If you're in Siem Reap and are looking for something a little off the beaten path, do give Herv\u00e9's Quad Adventure a try. It's extremely great fun and you'll take away great memories."

Having seen Angkor Wat at sunrise, I wasn't sure that anything would top that experience...until we set out on our Quad Adventure!At no extra cost, a driver came to pick us up from our hotel in a tuktuk, which made it very convenient. We had booked on an Easy Ride, however we were lucky enough that we departed later than normal, and were told that we'd be out for sunset as well. On arrival, we had a safety briefing, and my husband (who'd never driven a quad bike before) had a drive around the block with one of the staff on the back. Then, we set off with our guide.We headed off, cruising through rice fields and back roads and little villages. To say it was amazing is an absolutely an understatement. I lost count of how many happy, smiling children I waved at, and their parents seemed genuinely happy to see us (they waved, too, sometimes!). I could stop as often as I liked to take photos, and we got off for 5 minutes to watch the sun set over the rice fields. I honestly can't express in words how much of an absolutely AWESOME experience this was. Speeding through the rice paddies, waving and smiling at the gorgeous children and watching the end of a rural Cambodian work day is something I'll remember for a very long time! When (not if) we go back to Siem Reap, I'll definitely be doing another Quad Adventure!"

I've just arrived back in the UK after a trip around South-east Asia covering Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia, and have spent much of the past week catching up with friends and recounting some of the highlights of my trip. I took the 'Discovery Ride' with Quad Adventure Cambodia and this has been one of the things I have spent much of the last week talking about. The experience really smashed my expectations. It was sold as a '41Km ride through the rice paddies and villages of Siem Reap' but it was so much more than that. You really get into the villages and you interact with the people living feel like you are really seeing the real Siem Reap and meeting the real people of the town. From the touching waves and handshakes, to the sights of beutiful landscapes and humble homes, to the smells of outdoor living as food is prepared and even the smell of garbage littled villages. It's really getting under the skin and experiencing the real lives of the locals. It was heart warming driving through the villages where the children would run to the road side to give you a wave, with their beaming smiles and sqeals of joy, the only risk is that the tears in your eyes will make it hard to see where you are driving. It may be a cliche but it really does make you wonder about what happiness is all about. These were some of the happiest kids I've ever seen yet they were living on the bare bones - I doubt playstations, ponies, or Princess Barbie will be on their birthday list, but they just make do with each others company and drawing pictures in the sand. We visited an orphanage which is supported by QAC which made me feel like I was contributing in some way. We were guided around by a couple of super smart kids that put my language skills to shame. Fluent in 4 languages and only 12 years old - all a result of simply loving to learn. Education here is a privilege and they realise it. Our guide was courteous and allowed us to stop for photos and didn't rush us when we stopped to talk to the locals. We ended up getting back to base around 30 minutes late but our guides were more concerned about ensuring we had a good time. You really do get off road here too and find yourself surrounded by masses of beautiful landscape with nothing but you and the odd rice paddie farmer with mule. For the price of a day ticket to a theme park at home, this trip is unrivalled in the experiences, emotions and memories it will provide me for the rest of my life. Thank you QAC."

I think one of the most rewarding parts of the tour was the dozens of village kids running out of their front yards to wave at us (and some cheeky ones even grabbing onto the back rail of my quad!).

If you have spare time after visiting the temples, want to get an idea of how locals live (and have smiling children wave to you) and get away from the tourists for a bit, Quad Adventure is the way to do it. We've done the 4 hour trip. Covered great distance (would be difficult to do the same on a horse). Visit to the orphanage school was great - bring some food, clothing, or school supplies (we were told to avoid giving money as it's uncertain where they would end up).If you have 2 people, we strongly recommend taking one quad for 2 because 1) You get to discuss what you see while you're riding, 2) the second person can take pics/videos while you're riding - invaluable in my opinion 3) you save a bunch of money 4) the quad is comfortable and maneuverable enough for two ppl. The only 2 negatives I think are worth mentioning are: 1) you can't buy insurance for the bike - so you pay for any and all damage even if the accident is not your fault, 2) the trip is very expensive considering Cambodian prices for everything else. Keeping these two things in mind, I would still do the trip again."

That's what!!! I booked the $25 sunset tour and it was fantastic! In fact I was actually a bit sad I hadn't booked the full day tour, as I enjoyed it so much. I was taken out into the countryside, along local villages and through paddy fields and it was absolutely fascinating to see how and where the local people live. Because of the time of day, a lot of kids and families were milling about everywhere, locals were herding and bringing in their oxon and cattle (along the same tracks we were on - which made for some amusing scenarios) and many people were washing or cooking along the paths. The kids in all the villages were so cute and friendly - waving as I went by. I wish I had booked the longer day trip in fact, so that I could have stopped off and had the time to chat to the kids too and learn even more about the locals way of life. I am so pleased I booked the tour with Herve, got out of the 'touristy' end of Siem Reap and into the local countryside, which is absolutely beautiful. I was very impressed with the professionalism of the staff and the management of the operation and in particular with the quality of the quad bikes. Safety was paramount and this was described very clearly. I was also taken on a little test drive to learn handling and skills, even though I had said I had been on a quad bike before. This was actually useful as It helped me to get used to the conditions of the cambodian roads and dirt tracks, the way my bike operated and also the slightly crazy/hectic traffic of cambodia!"

I did the Discovery 2 hours + tour with no prior ATV experience and it was one of the most memorable things I have done in Cambodia. Wonderful way to see the countryside without going on a bicycle or dirt bike (ATV is DEFINITELY easier to learn and most stable than a dirt bike). I had a great instructor Phy who sat with me on the vehicle (I preferred him there, just in case, and it helped me psychologically throughout the right, knowing I had a safety net) and he was very encouraging and VERY nice. I think 2hours + is more than enough though to get the hang of the ATV and see the scenery. I think any more than that may make the experience a little of an 'overkill'.I will recommend to my friends as a way to see the Cambodian countryside, for sure."

I had e-mailed Herve prior to us arriving in Siem Reap explaining that my son was only 9yrs old but was desperate to ride a quad bike on his own if possible...he explained this was possible as long as I agreed to one of his employees sitting behind my son to assist if necessary. This was fine with me as I felt comfortable that he had somebody qualified with him due to his young age. They were very friendly, explained everything to us, gave us masks to wear and helmets and I then had to do a quick ride outside to make sure I and they were comfortable with me handling the bike...they are pretty big but there was no problem. The ride was fantastic and there was only us in the group which I liked. One of the employees rode in front on a motorbike with my son following and then me. They took us to a local orphange where we gave the children some gifts and this was a real eye opener for my son...57 orphans living here and having to sleep in their classrooms. All of the children (in the orphanage and outside in the villages we passed) look very happy and content with their lives. They were all extremely friendly waving and shouting out to us as we passed them...beautiful to see. We stopped at a stall to get some cold drinks then carried on. Was a great experience especially for my son who was delighted to get to the controls but he was sensible too!! Was quite expensive ($110 for the 2 of us) but worthwhile and very fun! At the end of the session, Herve gave my son a certificate. They also picked us up and dropped us back at the hotel with their own tuk-tuk. Thanks Herve and the team."

Definately one of the highlights of our week in Siem Reap, it was great to get out into the country side and see happy people and all the kids running out just to wave and smile as we passed...Was unreal to see all the volunteers from around the world that were teaching at the orphanage and speak with the kids in english, amazing! The bikes were very good quality and well maintained, feels like a massive amount of money to pay, but was well worth it.Once again the highlight of our week was seeing not just the touristy pub street and overcrowded temples but the serene country lanes and happy people."

The cost seems offputting initially, as it is quite high, but don't let it stop you for enjoying a fantastic adventure through the lesser seen parts of Siem Reap. We requested that we could postpone our start time so that we could watch the sun set and Herve was more than obliging.All aspects of the quad biking were very professional. All our group went on practice rides to determine competence and it was obvious that safety was a big priority. The quads are easy to ride and very well maintained.The sunset over the fields was picture perfect and probably the best sunset we saw throughout our SE Asia travels."

Two quads including myself went out with our guide on a motor bike and he took us to out of the way back villages and paddy fields that I think few westerners go to. Because they take different routes each time the tracks were not worn out and rutted like I thought they might be. The quads were all in excellent condition with good tyres and well maintained. I was disappointed that I didn't go for a longer trip as I was dubious that the quads would be OK for a full days ride but I was wrong. The French owner runs the Quad Rides very professionally and safely. I recommend the ride to anyone and it appears they cater to all riders ability. I have only ridden quads a couple of times and thoroughly enjoyed the trip. Experienced riders would probably love the all day trip and I was sorry I missed the opportunity due to time.Garry Australia."

From the moment we arrived, given our Quad brief and instruction, that were clear and easy to understand, we knew we were in the hands of real professionals. The brother of the owner joined us that day, on our three hour adventure along with two guides on off road motorcycles. We started on the easier roads, which gave us all time to get used to the controls, before heading out into the countryside. The sights we passed, and stopped to photo, along with the hundreds of smiling waving children really put smiles on our faces. The short stop we made at an orphanage was an eye opener to how friendly and welcoming the Cambodian people are. Do not be fooled into thinking the visit is just a plan to get money off you, its NOT, the children and staff are more than happy to just interact and make contact with you, if you want to buy a t-shirt ($10), the proceeds go to help.The guys in charge advise you to wear long trousers which help keep the steam from the engines off your legs if you go through a puddle, for me this was the best bit, getting muddy and at one time up to my knees in the water (unintentionally \u2013 but no harm done) We would really really recommend this experience as welcome break from visiting the marvellous temples.

You ride out through rice fields and remote villagers, hundreds upon hundreds of kids pass you as you drive through their homelands, they are all smiling and waving and it's a real treat to see how the real Cambodian's living off the land, live their everyday lives.I HIGHLY recommend this for anyone going to Siem Reap. If I make it back to Siem Reap next year I'll do this again, it was simply that good. The bikes are INCREDIBLY easy to use, you're only really going along at a slow speed anyway most of the time so it's always safe.

The tour guide came and picked us up from our hotel and it ended up being just the 2 of us on our own private tour. That was becasue we went in the low season and they mentioned it had been quiet, but it was great for us. The tour we chose went for 4 hours which i found was more than enough, you get a sore bum after a while. We stopped in at an orphanage which was great, the children are beautiful and the young men who run the orphanage do a wonderful job. I would definitely recommend people try the quad bike tour if you're up for some adventure and a small challenge - once you get a handle of the bike it's really easy."

The flood and rain did not turn the villagers away but instead we witnessed how the locals enjoyed the rain by jumping into the river, fishing, washing their vehicles with the flood water etc. It's a great experience to see the local lifetsyle. Quad Adventure's guides were friendly and allowed us to stop whenever we want. We stopped at a village and tried their local snacks such as fried prawns, fish and SNAKES!! Yes yucks....but my friends actually enjoyed it. Then, we visited Chres Orphanage and the experience is just indescribable. I highly recommend this tour as it makes our trip more meaningful and exciting. And don't forget to bring along candies as there will be many children who will run up to you asking for it."

Came across Quad Adventures before I left for the opportunity to get to more remote spots. Herve and his staff were great in their communication and their professionalism. I was picked up at my hotel as agreed at 730 am and had the most amazing full day taking photos and seeing the rural villages. My guide allowed me to stop as often as I wanted and gave me a lot of information on each areas we went. We also visited Chres Village School and Orphanage, which was a moving experience. I have since gotten involved with this orphanage and sponsored one of their kids. I can't say enough good things about this company. They were very thorough with being sure I knew how to operate the quad and safety was reviewed a number of times.Some of my better photos in Cambodia were taken in the remote areas I was taken to. Do yourself a favor. Set one day aside and use Quad adventures for an experience of a lifetime. I was in Siem Reap for 8 days and it was by far the best day of my trip.Steve Abruzzo"

On our first trip we were so amazed by out ride thrugh the villages that we did not realise we could stop and take photos (we thought we had to just follow the guide as he led). We enjoyed it the first time so much, we went back again. However, on the second trip we also took plastic balls, coloured pencils and books, lollies(sweets/candy) that we had purchased in Siem Reap earlier and handed these out to the kids as we rode though villages and around rice paddies just outside of Siem Reap. Riding through villages and fields where you would see what people were doing, would have to drive through a herd of cows, or sit at the side of the track as bullocks were driven past us, waving at the people and especially the children were all part of a great experience. The Quad Adventure team picked us up from our hotel and on arrival they explained the operation of the bike and gave a safety briefing, and gave my wife a short practice run through the nearby streets (they are easy to ride) and then with one child on the back each, we set off on two bikes with one of the staff as a guide and escort. A cold towel on our return to their premises was a nice touch. They then dropped us back by tuk tuk to a restaurant of our choice for dinner.We have told many people about this since our return."

That\u2019s important to have nice equipment when you ride during many hours. We spent the night in Khoker and the Khmer family prepared for us a very good barbecue for diner. Everywhere, locals were planting the rice and the countryside was so green, so beautiful that we will keep fantastic pictures in our head. The staff was very professional and the service perfect, even improved compare to the first time. We love Cambodia and will be back again next year, so, for sure back again for a quad ride!!!!!!!"

But as we had done some much already, and the kids were a little bit tired, I emailed Mr. Helv\u00e9 from my hotel, to start a bit later.He replied at once, it was no problem for him!We did the discovery tour and started at 08.30 uur. After a short test we left and it was the most memorable morning of the whole week in Siem Reap!The sightseeing in the villages is really amazing, all those lovely kids, beautiful lanes with many trees, cows, we really loved it!Also visited the orphanage centre and we were really impressed. The day before we gave a lot of clothes and toys in another school in a floating village, and we really felt sad we had no more things to give away.A lot of volunteers were teaching the kids English songs, and our kids joined them!Around 11.30 we were back in the hotel, an unforgettable experience richer!Highly recommended!Like others said: wear old clothes, start as early as you can, because it is really hot!And if you like to give things away: save all kinds of bathroom stuff or toys to make the kids along the way happy!"

The business owner, Herve, arranged a prompt pickup at our hotel, and after he provided a brief run-through of the quads, the three of us headed into the rural areas surrounding Siem Reap, with the experienced lead and tail riders. The trikes are very easy to handle, and the roads, laneways and field tracks were easy maneouvered. We rode through several small villages and visited the Chres Village free school and orphanage. Everywhere we went, the locals were smiling and friendly. A tour of the school with several students was very enlightening, as well as being rewarding in giving the students the chance to practice their english langage skills. We bought several US$10 T shirts, with the money helping to fund the school and orphanage. From the school we rode along rural roads and narrow tracks to a hidden ruined temple. Onwards via an exciting ride along the highway and we turned off for a brief cold drink stop, and then to Bakong temple in the Roluos Group. You will need your Siem Reap Temples pass to visit this site, and bring some cash as there are many young hawkers selling bags, scarves etc at the temple entrance. Helmets on again for another hour riding back the the quad office in Siem Reap. This is truely a great way to see a real part of Cambodia, with the knowledge that at least some of the cost would be directed to the orphanage. We strongly recommend taking this quad tour to do something a bit different during your Cambodian visit. Thanks Herve and the team for a well organised and safe adventure."

There was complimentary pick-up at our hotel. Like everybody else in Cambodia, they didn't accept Visa, so it took a hefty chunk out of our spending cash. We booked online and expressed that we wanted to share a bike, as my travel companion was not comfortable driving.As soon as we arrived there after our free pick-up, the owner, Herve, came up and introduced himself. After the introduction, the first thing out of his mouth was \"You are much too large to both ride.\" Having been on quad bikes much like this before, I know this was a ridiculous statement, aimed at trying to get us to pay more to each get our own ATV. He kept saying over and over that the bike couldn't handle that much weight, etc. We were firm in telling him that no, we would only do it if we could ride together, and the rest of the time, he kept throwing out little comments, like \"Be careful of this\", \"Don't do that\", regarding our weight on the bike. I found him to be quite unpleasant.We were the only ones on the tour. So, they get you a helmet, bags for your feet if you want (if it's muddy), and briefly show you how to drive it. Being familiar with ATVs, it was no problem for me, but it's also very intuitive for those who have no experience at all. We followed behind our guide who rode on a motorbike. Our first stop was the orphanage, where the older children took us and showed us around. It was interesting to see what it was like, but there was always the background feeling of them obviously looking for a hand-out. Our next stop was Bakong Temple. You can only go in if you have an Angkor pass (which we thankfully did), so make sure to bring that with you if you go! And then, we were done and went back to the pick-up spot, where we received a tuk-tuk ride back to our guesthouse.Driving through the Cambodian countryside was awesome - as everyone mentioned, kids would run out when they hear you coming, and smile, and wave, and yell. We had big smiles on our faces during the whole trip. The actual quad biking through the back roads was the fun part. We did feel very safe at all times, and the quad bikes were in good condition. Response from our internet booking was quick and the tuk-tuk was on time.My complaints lie in regard to: - The owner left a very sour taste in my mouth, obviously quite a money grabber. - We would only do this again if it was much, much cheaper. It was far too expensive, even for the unique experience that it is.- Why are there only two stops on this tour, one of them being a place which you feel obliged to support and another that you can only see if you have already bought a pass? There really ought to be more stops, and there would definitely be time for at least one more attraction on the Discovery tour.All in all, we DID enjoy it, but due to the price and the other aforementioned negative points, I wouldn't recommend it to a friend."

You get given great instructions allowing you to really get off the beaten track. However the price charged was damn expensive ($55 US for 2 hours) given that the owner hires Cambodians and likely pays Cambodian rent etc for his facilities.

It's a nice change from all the kids begging you to buy some cheap crap from them at the temple areas. Gives you a different perspective. We did the full day tour last week. After a short intro we took off. No details on where we were going or how long we'd be riding before the next stop. We just went. About 40 minutes or so later we got to the orphanage. There we asked our guide some basic questions about stopping etc. and he then proceeded to tell us to raise our hand when we wanted to stop and he would whenever. It was just my girl and I on the full day tour. Nice info but could be more useful from the beginning don't you think. Then we asked what the plan was for the day and he kind of laughed and wasn't sure what to say. Some basic info like \"We're gonna go deep into the countryside and eventually make it to _______, stopping whenver you like for pictures\" would have been helpful. But nope, we just rode and kept riding. lol Which of course is cool and fun, but we were kind of like \"So......we're just riding on this bike to no place in particular until time runs out?\" That being said, our guide was really cool and he took pics of us and videos whenver we liked. We had him go ahead and start filming and then we'd come zooming by all while on the video. Really cool video. Couldn't have done that with the shorter tours cuz they usually have 8 bikes or so. It was just us on the full day tour. So, to sum it up, very fun but $100 for each person on 1 bike and even more if you want your own bike is just too much to spend in my opinion.BTW, the orpanage was cool but we saw a guy there beat the hell out of a dog for eating a duck. He used a steel pole and hammered the dog. I was like WTF is that!!! Our orphan guide was just like \"Yeah, the dog ate the duck and so he is beating the dog so he won't do it again.\" Gave me a very bad taste of the place. Good to see the kids learning English and Japanese of course but what seems common sense in some countries obviously isn't in Cambodia. A mixed bag tour for sure."

What can I say, you have not experienced Cambodia until your on a quad bike, driving past country side with 12 screaming kids running out of a house so happy to see you. I waved for the whole hour at kids and locals who are so happy to have you in this wonderful country. To make it better it was Khmer new year so the people were a buzz.This tour deserves the number 1 title, and is that memorable I highly recommend people just to come to Siem Reap for it, Cambodia is amazing and this tour is just another way to compliement this. Do it, just go for it :-)"

We booked a four hour tour and although we had to get up early we were so glad we did the morning tour as the afternoon would have been unbearably hot. The bikes were easy to control and the guide set an easy pace. The stop at the orphanage was the highlight. The boys who showed us around were fantastic, their english was amazing and their pride in their school and respect for their teachers and eachother was so touching. We had taken sweets and pens and their gratitude for such small gifts made us all feel very humble. Our trip to Cambodia and in particular this tour made us re-evaluate our lives and reminded us of how lucky we are. The only very small criticism was that there was no easy way of carrying water. I had taken a couple of small bottles in a back pack but we made only one stop to buy a drink in the entire four hours. We were very hot and thirsty by then. This aside we were travelling in a family group of five and we all agreed this was the best day of our three week holiday."

Our guide was just so gentle and keen to please but certainly made the day for us. We were given good choices about what we wanted to see and we saw it all. The villages all seemed so delighted to see us. Quad biking gave us the opportunity to see the real conditions in the backblocks. We soon noticed that although the conditions were harsh the people in most of the villages had a huge pride in their homes and they seemed amazingly happy with their lot in life. The orphanage was most significant for our thinking. How could we best help them? We bought 2 huge bags of rice at a local village (that sure seemed to amke their day) and took it back to Chres Village Orphanage. Such beautiful spirits. I would thoroughly recommend this day for anyone who is interested in the real Cambodia, Herve and all staff were so, so helpful and in tune with our requests. I would especially recommend our guide Phy Khum. A day not to be missed for any fun lovers. Julia and Kristy"

We did the day tour - a long day, but looking back, one of the highlights of our holiday. The quad is really easy to ride and control and as comfortable as you could be driving through dusty uneven countryside in scorching heat!! My leg did burn a bit from the engine so wear long trousers. Don't wear anything you want to wear again on holiday - we couldn't get the sand washed out!Our guide Savuth was really friendly, spoke great english and we learnt alot about the area and people during the day from him. We went to the orphanage, standard stop I guess. I was more impressed than I expected to be - their language skills are amazing.Really knocked out by the hordes of kids who run up to their gates and out onto the road to wave and laugh as you quad bike past! We stopped for lunch in a small village temple, spreading out our mats for a picnic. Within minutes every kid in the village was sat around us watching and laughing. Then 2 old guys arrived with flowers for the altar, they wanted to meet us and tell us about the things they'd seen and experienced, they were really interested in talking to us, through Savuth of course! We shook their hands when we left and they left a real impression on me.We had a few laughs, mostly at the temple sellers flocking round my husband trying to flog him 10 cans of warm coke!Stopped for a break near a house making palm sugar and ended up in the yard talking to the family who again were so interested in finding out more about us. The old Dad made us roll laughing with his tobacco rolled in a leaf, he was dead proud when I showed him his photo that I took.Beautiful people, the day really made me think about how I should do more to help because they really do deserve a break.A bit expensive but I understand the bikes are alot of money for the owner to buy and get over there so I guess he's trying to recoup that. The guide Savuth made the day special by translating and asking us questions and sharing his knowledge with us. Definately recommend it, even if you're not sure it's for you - do the half day maybe but make sure you do stop in the small villages and get talking to people, better than the staged orphanage although of course I understand why they do that visit and it was interesting too."

            "review": "Excellent way to see the Cambodian country side. Myself and travelling partner booked a half day tour for April prior to leaving Australia. Herve's (owner) response was quick and effective. Although, we made this booking well in advance, all was adherred to and when the day arrived our taxi (tuk-tuk) was there promptly at our hotel (Pavilion D'Orient) to collect us.Upon arrival at Quad Bike Adventure Tour's premises, we were greeted by the friendly and jovial Herve who instructed us on how to use the quad bike and gave us pointers on the terrain we'll experience, the Cambodian traffic and road \"rules\" (which are very loosely followed). The bikes are well maintained, automatic (no clutch) and comfortable. This means that they are very user frienldy, even to the completely unexperienced - I have experience only in motorbikes, and it was no problem for me! All equiopment is supplied, like helmet and face mask for those dusty roads.The early morning start isn't fun, but is a relief as Cambodia can get quite hot during their 'dry season' and travelling throughout the morning is the best time. Our guide (in front on a motorbike) and us make our way out of Siem Reap, without navigating any major traffic enroute to our first pitstop, Chreas Village School & Orphanage. (If anything, please buy one of their shirts to aid their funding program, or ask Herve what should you bring to help them, eg English written children's books, pencils etc.) After this stop we travel further into the country side, all the while waving and saying \"hello\" to the many children standing out the front of their houses/huts in eager anticipation.The journey carries on for awhile (allowing for a few drink stops) before arriving at an Angkor ruin (Bakor?). This is the time for stretching the legs and excercising the camera, which is welcomed. However, as you are not riding there is very little breeze which can make this stop a bit hot and possibly uncomfortable - also the vendors selling their souvenirs can be very pushy here. After leaving this ruin site, we head back into the country side, but this time we go a little more cross country. This allows you to see and experience things that most tourists wouldn't. The journey finally ends back at the Quad Bike's headquarters, some 4.5 - 5 hours later (all dependent how long you stop at the various places mentioned above).Throughout the journey, you can stop to take photo's as the guide will notice and will wait for you (Don't take photo's while riding as this can be very dangerous!). The majority of roads are unsealed and at times quite bumpy and riddled with pot holes. This adds to the experience, and as you are in control of your own vehicle you can go as slow as you like if so desired. The throttle control is a lever design which is controlled by your thumb, unlike a motorbike, and may cause discomfort after awhile (especially if you don't heed the advice offered by Herve or your instructor), but nothing severe. The bikes are equipped with 4 wheel brakes, which helps the inexperienced or novices. (Just like a car, and that is the way you should operate these vehicles.)This tour was absolutely brilliant and we thoroughly enjoyed every minute - even near the end when our bums got a bit sore. Big thumbs up to Quad Bike Adventure Tours, and if we ever return to Siem Reap we would definately do another one of their tours. Highly recommended."

We went when it was like 100F at 1:00 in the afternoon and the guide discouraged us from bringing water (and then he waited too long to stop for some water -the kids got whiny). We did the tour that included a stop at the orphanage. It was a nice stop (but try to bring some gifts along or money to donate or you may feel real guilty - I brought soaps and shampoos from the hotels plus $). There are about 50 kids living at the ophanage and about 650 going to school there. It really is incredible to see and hear the kids learning so many languages. The Quad was real fun (but it lasted about about 45 minutes too long - a total of about 2 hrs 45 minutes). The kids got a bit bored but I think the heat played a huge part in this. It was nice to see all the children come running out and waving at us. I wonder if I was supposed to throw a lollypop or something toward them - but there were probably 70 or so kids waving in total during our trip. I don't know how I could have physically thrown anything toward them and not run off the road. One of our kids had to share a Quad with a second guide. Riding the Quads was easier than I thought it would be and I was only given about 2 minutes of instruction. The guides were laid back - unlike what I read in some old reviews."

My girlfriend and I booked a half day tour prior to leaving the UK to ensure we had our place. Once we had been picked up from our guesthouse by tuk tuk we were taken to the Quad Adventure base which in the south of Siem Reap. Expecting a group of around 6-8 people on the tour we were pleasently suprised to find that it was just the two of us plus our guide for the afternoon. Our guide talked us through the basics of riding the quad bike and as my girfriend was nervous about riding solo we had a quick trip round the block with the guide on the back to get a feeling for the bikes. On returning to the base my girlfriend was still nervous about riding solo so we asked if the guide could sit on the back of her bike rather than riding alongside on a motorbike. He kindly agreed and off we set into the countryside.We rode through many small villages and past remote houses, children would hear us coming and run out of their homes towards the road/track waving with big smiles on their faces. The roads were bumpy and dusty however the grins on our faces reached from ear to ear under our facemasks.With the guide on the back of my girlfriends bike this gave her the confidence to enjoy the sights without worrying and also gave her a running commentary. We stopped at an orphanage during our ride and 3 boys showed us round their home/school. It was evident that Herne and his team from Quad Adventure are helping to support this place and by taking us there made us very aware of how a little money can go a long way.It was truely a humbling experience and one we will not forget. We can both honestly say that the afternoon ride was one of the highlights of our 3 week trip to Cambodia and Vietnam. This is a 'must-do' experience!!!"

It was amazing and we loved it so much that we went back for a second tour before we left.I did have a concern as another traveller stated that sometimes you feel guilty for kicking up dirt on streets where people live and also the bikes are loud so Im sure its a disturbance to some of the locals. But we never got a bad look or anything. Everyone in the villages were friendly and the kids loved saying hello when the bikes went by."

This was lots of fun definately however my brother and father were concerned about the impacts on the local community and environment. They felt that we were a bit irresponsible going through the villages too fast and causing dust to enter roadside houses. Some drivers were less cautious than others when passing locals tending cows next to the road or crossing the road. My father also questioned how much of the income from tours goes into these villages that we passed through and may have disturbed. My brother summed it up \"although I may be somewhat socially and ethically opposed to it, I had a great time\"."

It was a good opportunity to see the back roads of Cambodia and see more of the farming and rural life.The stop at the orphanage was a highlight of the day. The children who served as guides and showed us around were delightful. They were very personable and friendly. The orphanage is pretty impressive in it's own right and I am glad that we had the opportunity to visit.It was fun to travel the back roads and everywhere we went people - especially children - would run to the road waving and saying \"Hello\". The children of Cambodia are so friendly and beautiful.We all thoroughly enjoyed the day but I have to say that I have mixed feelings about recommending the trip. While it was a lot of fun, it really seemed to be the antithesis of eco-tourism. An incredible amount of dust and dirt is generated by the ATVs as they travel through the villages and I wonder if there is a less invasive way to see rural Cambodia. Usually we do biking trips on vacation and this is the first time we have ever done an ATV trip. We had a lot of fun, but I don't know if I would do it again because it seemed so disruptive to the environment and people. On the flip side, though, the opportunity to visit the orphanage is not to be missed and perhaps my environmental concerns are offset by the financial support that we will provide to the orphanage in the future that we would not have otherwise been made aware of."

However if you plan to go south to kep and kampot like we did you will have plently of opportunities to rent a bike there and see very similar scenery for a fraction of the cost (90us dollars per quad is pretty steep i think). The visit to the orphanage was the best bit as the quad biking tours clearly bring much needed money to the orphanage which is great to see. On the negative side however, I found the quad biking very slow. While i do understand that this is for safety reasons it does get a bit boring at the end and the hot air from the engine blowing on the leg the whole time also becomes a bit uncomfortable after a few hours."

A week and a half ago i had the pleasure of doing a 4 hour Quad bike trip, I was picked up at my hotel and taken to the office where Herve ( the owner ) showed my ropes on riding the quads . His interest in Safety is very important which impressed me My Guide was Savuth , a really nice guy who took me through the countryside to the orphanage that Quad Adventures supports .The orphan boys showed me around and explained the place to me , I was so impressed with there english and explaining the orphanage to me. I had to buy a tee Shirt from them ... and couldnt help but giving them a donation .After leaving the orphanage we travelled through the countryside . I was able to stop whenever i wanted to take photos and look at the countryside . What a way to see the REAL countryside of cambodia My trip was supposed to be 4 hours but ended up being about 5 hours .Just want to say that I had a FANTASTIC time .Thank u Herve & Savuth for making my trip SO enjoyable .Id rerrrrrcomend this trip to anyone ."

First we got an instruction of how the quads worked. We drove through the rice fields on sandy roads. In this area you can see how locals are really live, very authentic. Everywhere we saw kids waiving friendly, without having a commercial goal. This was a very muddy (there it rained), but wonderful trip!"

I have travelled in Cambodia before and got to see the \"real\" Cambodia then, but my friend who was there for the first time said that this tour really helped him to see the real Cambodia. You will walk away with a much more enriched experience of the country. The local children are delightful, running near to the roads and yelling \"hellloooo\" with their gorgeous little faces! Remember to take sunscreen.... I forgot and got quite sun burnt :( but the guide helped me to negotiate a deal with a local seller along the way to buy a long sleeve shirt! :) Expect to get muddy, especially in the wet season, but I thought that this was part of the fun.A few people have commented that the safety talk is a little over board but these things (ATV's) are potentially dangerous and a safety talk is more than reasonable!"

Be prepared to get muddy (although they did give you plastic shopping bags to protect your shoes which works very well). Kids all got turns at driving and loved it. We did the 1.15hour ride, saw so much lovely countryside and farms/villages where most of the inhabitants waved as we past. The 4WD's are very easy to manage, I really can't recommend this enough. We smiled the whole way through, such a fun family time and great release for kids after checking out temples :-)"

But boy was I wrong. The Quad bike people picked us up from the hotel we were staying at and took us to the meeting point. We were prepped and given a quick safety demonstration and then we were off on our adventure. Traveling along dirty roads, we saw gorgeous views and what made me smile super big was that all the little children living in the village would hear our dirt bikes and come running like we were superstars just to say hello, it was so cute. We stopped off at a orphanage which was great to see. Along our trip it rained like crazy for a little while which made it even more exciting, riding fast with the rain hitting against ya, even though we did get soaked it was well worth it.I know without a doubt why this is Siem Reap's number one attraction, its simply a breath taking experience, once in a life time opportunity, that you must check out!!!"

Hire a taxi or van to take you round the whole of Angkor Wat. Bring umbrella and lots of water!! But I would suggest to take the tour from Ta Phrom , the temples before going to Angkor Wat first. You will be totally smashing tired due to the long walks!What is Cambodia if you do not travel out to visit the traditional villages and experience what life is like? Visit www.quad-adventure-cambodia.com . Go take the ATV and visit the traditional villages. Rough it out along the terrains for a discovery ride. You may also feel like a little movie star with many kids standing along travel paths waving at you! But pls remember, do your little part. Buy a bag of rice when you are at the resting point in middle of journey. it cost only USD20 for a 50kg rice, to feed about 500 kids! The trip will take you to an orphanage!"

They are teaching the students English, Chinese and Japanese!!! HOW GREAT!! I was really really touched- and wanted to spend the entire day there with them!!

            "review": "Wonderful experience, but not all perfect. I decided to do a quad ride after reading the wonderful reviews about it on TA. I had a 1 hr sunset ride.First, the good stuff. Beautiful sunset, friendly Cambodian village kids waving hi, beautiful countryside. Interesting experience after days of temple sightseeing. The guide Max was reasonably friendly enough although I found the safety briefing earlier a little too serious.Now, the bad stuff. First, because you are supposed to keep your eyes on the road all the time, you miss a lot of the good sights in the countryside. Second, like someone mentioned earlier, the French owner of this business seemed to be more concerned about his ATVs more than anything else. Sure, safety is important for both his business and the customer... but that is not good reason enough to yell at a customer who is here and pays you for what is supposed to be a fun tour.The tour began with a demonstration of how to ride the vehicle, with overwhelming emphasis on how \"these things are very expensive\" and \"this is Cambodia and we have no insurance\", \"you cannot touch this and that\" and how you have to sign an indemnity form to ensure that \"if you die its non of our business\" and if the ATV is damaged you have to pay. Sure, these are facts but they definitely can be put across in a milder and more friendly manner.Next, the tour began with a guide in front on a motorbike and the owner and his Cambodian staff at the back on another motorbike. Why was the owner following me? The answer came when someone from the back yelled at me to stop when I momentarily swerved a little due to a big porthole in the dirt road. The owner came up to me and yelled \"right from the start I see you cannot drive!\" and \"I think you cannot do it yourself, he (the Cambodian staff) will sit behind you to make sure you do it properly\". I said sure, I'm fine with that since I want to ensure that I do it properly anyway. I was then corrected on my posture when riding and the rest of the tour went well. I think correcting my posture was a definite must to ensure safety but the rest of the remarks, angry face and yelling were totally unnecessary. Given that this is a business meant for tourists to have fun, it will make the experience so much better if the approach taken was more service-centric. I made it known from the start that I have never rode on one of these things before and making mistakes shouldn't subject me to a telling-off. A gentle reminder and correction would be very much appreciated.Further, if the prospects of damaging the ATVs and the risk involved is so high, then why use $8000 ATVs imported from the United States? If there is no insurance and risks and costs are issues of concern then it would make more sense to use cheaper machines, at least for the less experienced riders.I would recommend this tour for the good things - the sights, sounds and smell of the countryside but thumbs down from me for the negative customer service. For a better .experience at your own pace and without constantly being pressured to keep your eyes on the road and drive properly, why not consider renting a bicycle instead?I would definitely come back to ride again because I think it is fun... but only if the service attitude improves. 5 stars for the experience, but down to 3 because of the owner's bad attitude."

It was so refreshing to get out into the countryside and witness simple and authentic Cambodian village/rural life, the stunning scenery, and the smiling waving children.There is nothing I can say that hasn't been said by other reviewers. We were picked up(complimentary) from our guesthouse at the arranged time(and dropped back after the tour), had brief but thorough and clear instructions on how to ride, and then we were off for the best few hours ever! The guides allow you to feel independent, but they are always there at a safe distance ensuring everything is OK. The orphange/school is inspirational...I hope I can go back and volunteer there one day.It was also nice to stop for a break at a local roadside market and have a chat with them over some locally cooked food and a cold drink. Anyone can do this trip( I am a 49 year old woman who has never even ridden a motor bike before), so long as you have a bit of a sense of adventure, and don't mind possibly getting a little dirty (I hit fresh cow poo not once but twice...but that probably says more about my driving then the tour!!). Congratulations to the Quad Adventure team on such a unique attraction."

We opted for the 4-hr trip, which took us out of the city and into the countryside. We visited an orphanage/school full of beautiful children who were so excited to meet you, show you their school, and welcome you. We also stopped at a little refreshment stand to have some cold water, get to know our guide a bit, and just take in the lovely setting. We also stopped at a temple, heard the story behind it (A GREAT STORY!), and took some pictures. Also, our guide showed us how rice is planted, replanted, harvested, dried, sold... so interesting! The best part, though, was driving for a few hours on the ATV through the countryside -- so lush, so beautful! Everywhere we went, we were greeted by smiling and welcoming local people. If you want to get away from the tourist areas, see some of the \"real\" Cambodia, and have a great time while you're at it, DEFINITELY DO THIS!It is not cheap, as we spent $100 for this adventure (it would have been $160, but I chickened out at the last minute and rode behind my husband, instead of riding my own ATV) but it was worth every dollar. Besides seeing the ruins, this was the 2nd best thing we did in Siem Reap. They even pick you up from your hotel with a tuk tuk, so that you arrive comfortably and in good spirits! We highly recommend it!"

My girlfriend was a little nervous to start, especially after the owners no nonsense safety briefing (as any safety briefing should be). The owner (a pleasant french chap) jumped on the back of my girlfriends quad bike for the first 5 mins until she felt comfortable with it and off we went. It was just the 2 of us and our guide on his motorbike, who was super friendly and spoke perfect english. The tour takes you through rural villages completely away from the bustling tourism of siam reap, and seeing it all on a quad bike is a really fun way to see the real cambodia. On the way back we stopped off at an Orphanage which the company supports. It was a real pleasure to be shown around by two of the elder orphans, teach the kids, and learn about the orphanage,without getting pressured into making a donation or buying tacky souvenirs (as just about every other tour in asia seems to entail), which is probably why we ended up giving a donation. The tour lasted just over 3 hours and was worth every penny. I strongly recommend it to anyone, its not high-octane quad-biking but great fun nonetheless"

The trip to the orphanage rounded out our time in Siem Reap and was the highlight of my time there. We rented 4 quads and did the discovery tour - it was perfect. My two teenage sons (16 and 19 rode alone, my husband rode with our 13 year old and I rode my own. Do not listen to the review that claims Herve is sexist and does not let girls/women ride. I was worried after reading that particular review on here and thought I would not be able to ride by myself - UNTRUE. I did not even have to ask - Herve didn't even bat an eye that I was riding alone From my observation, all genders are welcome to ride if they are older than 16 and demonstrate proficiency after the easy instructions Herve gives before you start. This is not hot-rod fast quad racing so if that is what you are expecting forget it. This is a nice scenic ride over dirt roads in the country (some paved road too). Really good to schedule on another day after your temple touring. It rained the night before we were to ride so the roads had some puddles, but were not too dusty as they can be when it has been dry. We loved getting muddy and I was glad I wore my jeans and tennis shoes for this activity. Probably what I would do different is stop to take more pictures of the people and little kids we passed. I know Herve would not mind and I would love to have photos of some of them. I was just having so much fun I forgot to stop. Maybe another great thing to add would be to stop for lunch or pack a picnic.Even after the tour I had fun because on the way back to the hotel, instead of riding in the tuk tuk with the boys, I got to ride on the quad with Herve's wife and baby girl.Have fun!"

However, that made me feel kind of independent ( I have ridden dirtbikes but this seems safer - even in the rain). The ( very brief ) glimpse into the Cambodian country side shows a view so vastly different than that from the major highways and within the town; the ride is through lush, colourful country changing at every corner, and there's opportunities to stop and take time to say hello, take photographs; as well as to visit an orphanage suported by the organisation if you should so wish. I think getting away into the country side is rewarding anyway and this was easy and fun at the same time."

A totally professional and friendly service via email with Herve set a date and we'd booked a half day tour. We were collected by the friendly tuktuk driver from our guest house and taken right to Quad Adventure HQ. After a quick safety briefing and a quick lesson in how to drive a quad bike we had the most fantastic time with guide Sobei (unsure of spelling here!)  It was so much fun I wanted to do it all over again! We visited the sponsored orphanage, visited the \"real\" cambodia, saw snakes, got stuck in mud, overtook pigs on mopeds and felt like royalty when all the children along the route come running to the side of the road just to wave at you and see the big bikes! Our guide Sobei even took us to an outlook overlooking the surrounding area - ask for him. He is a really friendly, funny and knowledgable guy.(I feel the mud deserves an explanation - it wasn't planned and our guide fixed the situation within minutes! It was only due to a Cambodian wedding party blocking the main road and us having to take a different route!) Make sure you take your krama for the dust as I promise you won't stop smiling the whole trip and dust between the teeth isn't good! The stop off in the sponsored orphanage for a little tour and whizzing through the tiny villages sometimes stopping for a cold drink and a little interaction with the local kids really make this trip a MUST DO!!!I personally recommend this trip for everyone!! I know that some budget backpackers might look at this and think the price tag a turn off but I personally think it was worth every penny. They really made sure we had a truly memorable experience and that we were totally safe.Merci Beaucoup Herve and all of you at Quad Adventure! We'll be calling on you next time we're that side of the world."

The tour satisfied both of us, it took place on dirt roads on the outskirts of town around Siem Reap. Far enough away from town to experience rural life in Cambodia and see plenty of local kids on the road who waved like you were a pop star!! My girlfriend had a blast, quickly getting confident on the quad and in the end driving through large mud puddles just to get a bit more 'offroad' feeling. We stopped at a local orphanage the quad company sponsors which was also very humbling. Our guide 'Sorbo' was superb, he took his time with my fiance to show her the ropes of the quad which made her feel comfortable, and was open to conversation when we stopped for a coke at the half way mark. This is an experience not to be missed if you have time in Siem Reap."

Our 2 families with 4 teens (17 to 20yrs) had the greatest fun combined in a culturally sensitive manner of being immersed in the rural lives of Cambodians. I will never forget the smiling waving children on the roadside and the visit to the ophanage which I hope to visit again next time. Take pens and books and gifts from your country to these kids. Sure it was hot and dusty when we went but whatever the conditions Herve and co will look after you so well."

We went to many villages, the orphanage, temples and even rode up a mountain with breathtaking views of the fishing village. We also went on fast offroad trails and the whole experience was exciting and safe. The highlight of the trip was that it rained heavily the night before and the trails were muddy and had lots of water. Riding thru the terrain in such conditions is a rare chance and getting dirty and muddy added to the fun. Our guide Sombey was excellant and took care of us. We were also given a chance to test our riding skills when we took a excursion off the normal route and went thru many beautiful paddy fields. Overall the experience was mind blowing and thrill seeking. I would recommend this to all who visit Siew Reap to see a part of Cambodia that makes it so charming."

Seeing villages and sights from the car was both fleeting and somewhat detached but going through villages slightly off the beaten track, even on a quad bike that screams tourist, somehow we felt we got closer to a Cambodia we hadn't experienced before. The guide was really excellent and explained sights, sounds (and smells) perfectly. Obviously walking brings everything that much closer but we could cover a lot of ground in tremendous heat and humidity which compensated enourmously. The orphanage is a hugely rewarding stop, as are some of the watering holes on the way round. The other temples and archaeological sites are a must too."

I emailed Quad biking and they had very fast response time and I booked to go on the 2 hour discovery tour. The best part was visiting the orphanage along the way- the Chres village orphanage has 49 children and over 400 students, we gave out lollipops which brought many smiles (suggest if you have any other stationary etc. you ask the friendly owner, Herve, whether you can bring it to the orphanage!) The children's english was really good and a bunch of them actually have mandarin lessons on the weekends in the city- being chinese, when we left, they wished us well with chinese blessings which was a real surprise! It was lots of fun to go see different villages and Herve took great care of us and emphasised strongly on safety. They do 4 day tours to Preah Vihear for the adventurous! Great service with free pickup from hotel, a wonderful experience overall."

I can drive a car, but not a motorbike (in fact I can't even ride a bicycle!) and had never been on a quad before, but comfort and safety are paramount to the owner, Herve and every tour begins with a thorough induction of how to control the quad, informative and also humourous - a great ice breaker before your adventure! Driving the quad itself is simple, so the only thing you need to bring is a sense of adventure!The experience is very different during the different seasons - both the riding experience and the scenery! During dry season, it can be quite dusty, but you will already have been advised on suitable clothing, and a variety of helmet sizes and styles are available for your use. The countryside is both barren and beautiful this season, and during wet season everything is lush and green, and you splash through puddles as you go (waterproofs are also provided!). I don't know which experience I prefer, both are great fun!As you pass through villages, there are smiling, waving children everywhere, all amazed at the sight of the quad bikes as most traffic in the area is on 2 wheels, even local adults greet you with excitement as you pass and the tours give you insight into the local way of life in rural Cambodia.On certain tours, you pass by some of the temple complexes, and on all the day time tours you can stop at local stalls to sample fresh local produce, from the best bananas I have ever tasted to freshly steamed corn - lovely! Sunset tours are also available, you will see the whole sky turn pink over the fields - great photo op!The breeze as you go is very refreshing and cooling, the whole experience both exhilarating and relaxing.When you stop at the orphanage and school at Chres village, I'm sure you will be moved by the high spirit and motivation of kids who have so little by our Western standard, yet they seem so completely happy and eager to learn, especially English so they love to chat to you. Quad adventure supports this school, so part of what you pay for your adventure will sustain the local community.I would recommend these tours to anybody visiting the area, group sizes tend to be small so you don't feel like you are just being herded around as can be the case on some bus tours, the organisers will make it a much more personal experience for you - away from the thronging masses visiting the temples.This is quite simply an opportunity which you should not miss out on."

He saw that I was competent on the quad and asked If I cared to travel on different trails. We went where other quad people don't go due to it's big holes and narrow paths. Sombay had interest in my career. I am a Firefighter/medic. At one time he attempted to make this his way of living. He question me deeply regarding 9/11. We had a break at local shop and ventured to the country. Sombay and I even got lost momentarily which proves my point on different paths. I thought it was great and will treasure this adventure.The price I believe was $80 dollars but these quads have to be maintained and insured.Do this in the morning due to hot sun and be prepared to wave to all!!"

Our tour guide was excellent, his name was Sombey (Hi Sombey if you're reading this, hope all is well!). We did an early morning half day tour with Sombey leading the way on his motorbike. Sombey customised it for us perfectly, i.e. some technical parts with jumps and bumps where you could enjoy using the quad as well as backstreets through villages and farms where you could just look around and take it all in. The kids were out in there numbers, all running out towards the quad, waving frantically and looking on in fascination as our bike passed them by. We stopped at a village stall and bought some Cambodian doughnuts. Then stopped at a newly discovered part of Angkor Wat that tourists generally never see. The orphanage was next and that was also fantastic. There was only about 20 kids there as most of them were learning Chinese at a Sunday school but it was great nevertheless. They were very happy kids and seemed to enjoy practicing their English on us, the orphanage seems to be doing a great job of giving the kids a chance in life. We took some of the kids for a quick ride on the bike which they enjoyed.It will probably be the most expensive thing you do in Cambodia but absolutely worth it. Unlike other cheap tours you won't get forced into buying an overpriced lunch, pestered for tips or chased by people trying to sell you things. Even at the orphanage you aren't asked to make a donation, but when you see the great work they are doing you will probably feel compelled as we did donate a little. Cheers, Julian."

            "review": "So glad I made time for this trip. Siem Reap is one of those towns where regardless of how independent a traveler you are, you are still going to spend the majority of your time ON the beaten path. The temples of Angkor are just too spectacular to miss.That being said, I would argue that taking one of the Quad Adventure tours is also an activity that should not be missed on a trip to Siem Reap.I decided to take the 2 hour and 15 minute Discovery Tour because I wanted to spend some time in the countryside. Quad offers this tour at 7:30 am and 1:00 pm. After spending the previous 3 days at the temples, I knew better than to voluntarily subject myself to the mid-day sun and chose the 7:30 tour. That being said, there is such a nice breeze when you ride, it probably would have been fine anytime in the day.After sending a complimentary tuk-tuk to pick us up from our hotels, the owner, Herve, gave us a quick, but quite thorough intro on how to ride the ATV's, which turned out to be quite simple - probably because of the the excellent intro. Our group was small (I think all groups are small) - two others, me, and a Cambodian guide named Sopheap (I think - he said you pronounce it like Sorbet!). Speaking fluent English with a French accent (he only took up English two years ago), he later shared his inspiring story of surviving the war and eventually thriving.In less than five minutes, we were off on our adventure. It is difficult to have authentic organized tourist experiences, but this is as close as it gets. We drove through the gorgeous countryside at our own pace, stopping to take photos whenever we saw anything that caught our eyes. Herve told us in advance that we might feel like movie stars, with all of the children coming out to wave at us, and he was spot-on. Every 100 metres or so, a gaggle of kids would be furiously waving at us. There aren't many ATV's in town, so the sight only happens for them a couple of times a day at most, and they were genuinely excited, not to mention adorable. SImilarly, there were smiles from parents, teenagers, and other adults everywhere we went.We made two stops. The first to grab a drink of water. I cannot tell you how much I appreciated that we just stopped somewhere in the middle of the country, instead of a \"tourist trap\", where you are immediately approached by 30 teens trying to sell you things. We had our drinks, rested, and were back on our way.Our second stop was at an orphanage that Herve helped found and that the company helps support. This was no ploy to get us to give money, as it well could have been. It was just a well-chosen spot to show us the real Cambodia (orphans are still plentiful here) and even more importantly, to give the kids a chance to practice their English and to talk to foreign visitors. One 14-year-old volunteered to be our guide around the orphanage/school, and a bunch of his friends tagged along. While somewhat shy, their English was way better than they think it was, and it was a joy to talk to them. And it felt even better to know that some of the money we spent on our trip must get back to them in some way or other.The time flew by, and we were back at Herve's place before we knew it. ATV's are actually a great way to see the countryside. You are literally in the driver's seat, and they are quite manageable to drive while enjoying one's surroundings. Motos are most definitely not as stress-free a way to travel, and we would have seen a lot less on bikes. My only regret was not having the time to do a full-day tour, which would have enabled us to see a lot more of this gorgeous country, stop more often, and talk to more people. I will absolutely do the full day tour on my next visit."

I become aware by QUAD-Advertising in a brochure. I call the company QUAD-ADVENTURE-CAMBODIA and booked a half day trip. Next day at 6.30 h a.m. I picked up from the company and ride to the headquarter. Here I got a introduction course for the real big and good Quad. The Quadmaschine have 330 ccm and is very strong for all missions. The guide is very funny and have a lot of expirience with the Quadtour.Before 7 a.m. we started from the headquarter in to the Cambodia countryside. At first I maked some training with the Quad and outside the City we ride a very good trip trough the paddyfields. I have good luck with the sunrise on the horizont. The guide have maked the foto here on my request. It was fantastic to ride on the unsurfaced road. A littel bit dusty with the streetpowder. The sunglasses are now very helpfully. We must be ride careful, because the smileing happy children in the villages see us and run on the way to call us with \"Hello Mister...\". We call back and wave with our hands in direction of the brown-skinned and white eyes childrens.We stoped on Cres Village Shool & Orphanage. The teacher tell me the shool system with the benefit and problems. The shool is very happy about a small contribution for the childrens.We ride away to the next adventure. This real path is a very hard ride in the jungel. The surface is small with a lot of holes in the path. Sometimes you drive in a 1 meter deep hole with 2 meter diameter and jump out on the opposite side. After this 5 kilometers I need a rest for collect new power. The citizen in the villages are friendly and always happy for a joke. In this time I eat a traditional Khmer food. It was a 19 days baby duck egg. It was delicious. Try yourself on your trip.Now we started into the next adventure. The new path is so small then the Quad is more wide as the path. Never mind that is what we like. The guide tell me sometimes the signs on the trees. With red coloured trees is dangerous because there was found a landmine. Do not go around this tree in 10 meter diameter. The guide is very safe with me and we pass all coloured trees without problems.Now we go back to Siam Reap. After more as 4 hours with a lot of impression and expirience about Khmers, Children, Countryside and others we arrive the headquarter from Quad-Cambodia. I`m very dusty with the streetpowder and happy in my hearth. I learn some things about Cambodia and the friendly citicens. The manager and guide of Quad-Cambodia are friendly and correct. The price for the half day trip is o.k. I wish all Quad-Riders alltimes good luck with a lot of impressions and no accident on the road. Take care."

You will get to the feel the vibe, soak up the smells and tastes of the real countryside.The Quads are in good condition and we were able to go at our own pace.

I was told about Quad Bike Adventure and went to look on their website prior to my trip and was deciding if I should give it a go.I have to say their website and photos were a definite understatement to the actual experience I felt !! It was worth it.I never regretted signing up for the trip. And you musn't regret too.We went on the Sunset Quad Bike Adventure. The Cambodian sunset was really really beautiful compared to any sunset I have seen. It was picturesque, with padi fields, blue sky, some clouds. It was as if time stood still.I am still looking at the photos I took as they are really beautiful.In comparison to the sunrise at Angkor Wat or sunset at Phnom Bakheng, the sunset I saw while on the Quad Bike Adventure was much more rich and beautiful. You have to see it for yourselves.Riding the quad bike was easy and it was really fun going through villages, rice fields and seeing smiling kids who run out of their houses to wave to you. These are places you probably would not get to go if you were to remain in the tourist area of Siem Reap.I think more importantly, Herve and Sobey are really nice guides. Not only sharing about the bike trip but also their lives there. It has been a very enriching experience just chatting to them while on the trip.This is really value for money. And they have a tuk tuk to pick you up from your hotel to the Quad Bike location! I love the convenience.AWESOME! A MUST! I have posted some of the photos I took - unedited as they were from my camera.I wish I had more time for the Quad Bike to take a longer trip to see more sights. Maybe next time I will.Thank you Herve and Sobey! You guys are great to bring this to Siem Reap ... the experience was priceless."

This is a must do in Siem Reap if you dont take up the expereince then your really cheating yourself of seeing more of Cambodia. I took the half day tour and I was lucky enough to have a private tour which cost no extra. The service was outstanding and my guide was the greatest. Had i know it was going to be so much fun I would have booked the half day...money should not be a consideration when thinking about doing this as it is worth every dollar. You go through jungle, villages, an orphanage where EVERYONE seems so happy to see you and the children all run out and wave as you pass by. Without saying anymore just make sure you do this when visiting Siem Reap you will be missing something really amazing that you can not normally do or see......ps.. will add photos to convince you even more."

Booking was easy through their website and Herve (owner) answered our enquiries promptly. We wanted a quad bike for the two of us as my sis thought she would be safer riding with me (ha! ha!). After a quick lesson, we rode out of the HQ and I clashed straight into the neighbor\u2019s porch:( In my defense, the roads there were nothing like back home and riding the quad was nothing like driving.Herve suggested that we take 2 quads instead, with him and Sobey (another guide) guiding us as pillion. Boy, was I glad we took 2 quads (I\u2019m sure my sis was too). Both Herve & Sobey were professional, patient & fun. Soon we got the hang of it and they generally left us to do our thing, guiding only when necessary. My sis managed to run over piles of dung and splattered them all over Sobey\u2019s shoes & pants. Along the way they pointed out sceneries and interesting sights. The experience was priceless especially for someone who came from a concrete jungle.Happy children waving, villagers cooking in the open, fishing, smiling & contented was a humbling sight. The management has done an admirable job for the children at the orphanage and village school.On our return trip, I suggested that Herve drive while I pillion so that I could totally enjoy the sights. I managed to take some excellent photos. Although Angkor is breathtaking, it was the quad tour that made my trip memorable."

I was a little apprehensive at first because I thought the ride was going to be too rough, but it was really an easy ride. We shared a bike and my husbacnd drove while I took pictures along the way. The local peple are really nice and a lot of the kids run to the street to wave as you go by. One little girl even stood at the street with some flowers she picked and our guide stopped while she handed them to me. The kids a the orphange were also very sweet. We got to see them in their English classes and they all stood up and greeted us when we got there. Since we booked based on a brochurer hotel, I did not know about the orphange, otherwise I would have brought some supplies.They give the driver a helmet with a mask and the passenger a bicycle helmet. It's very dusty, so I would suggest that the passenger wear sunglasses and wear clothes that you don't mind getting dirty. They will give you a wet washcloth when you get back."

It was a totally different experience aside from the fact that I've never been on a quad bike before this. It's something that the tour groups would not bring you for. I went for the sunset ride, riding through the village and seeing the less privileged people of siem reap with the wind blowing on my cheeks was totally awesome. It was a different kind of feeling and I saw the lifestyles of people who are so alien to a city boy like me. The complete experience was like no other, the rural landscape was so un-touristy in a good way and I felt safe at the same time with all the happy villagers and children who would wave to you. The operations are run by this french man who was totally nice and all.. quad adventure cambodia is not to be missed and I'd recommend it to anyone who's going to siem reap for a holiday."

Decided I wanted to spend my birthday touring the temples of Angkor and it was only on arrival that I saw a flyer for Quad Adventure, along with their ad in the Canby guide.Knowing that I'd have temple ennui after my 4th day of trekking, I decided it was a perfect way to spend an afternoon (my last before flying home --, a chance to strike quad-bike riding off the list. There was also that allure of going off the beaten trail for a possible real-Cambodia encounter that persuaded me to call and book the Sunset ride (after debating between the short tour options). And boy, what an experience it was.Booking was relatively easy and I got details for pick-up within the same call. Being the worry wort, I called on the day to re-confirm and yes, everything was in order. Pick-up would arrive as scheduled. I expected a tuk-tuk. What I got, was a rugged Khmer guy on a dirt bike. Sweet. Another strike off the been-there-done-that list even if I was only going to ride pillion. Now, scared as I was (mild pillion rider phobia), the ride through Siem Reap town to get to Quad Adventure was quite a rush in itself.Since I didn't have a driving license, my aforementioned rugged Khmer guide (who would later introduce himself to me as Sobay, though I'm not sure if that's how you spell it) said he would ride pillion with me to be safe. And that's one of the ace points about Quad Adventure. I felt that while experiences need to be maxed, it was nice to know safety was a priority.After a crash course in essential controls, safe words and emergency techniques, we were off to ride through riverside streets, small alleys, big dirt road, alongside motorbikes and cows on their way home. There was a sprinkling of rain (monsoon season and all), but eh... it was nothing compared to the pile of dung I managed to run over and splatter all over Sobay's shoes and mine. Part of the experience, I guess.A nice feature of the trail was the diversity in sights, terrain and maneuvering. The sights were priceless -- there was something about kids running alongside waving and giggling, standing on the sides atop my bike as cows ambled pass, gazing at people's homes and admiring the fields as my guide talked about harvests that kept me going whoa. Talking to my guide also gave me that glimpse of local life, family history et al... and even personal insight on Khmer Rouge atrocities.At the end of the tour, I wished that I'd gotten to see more (even taken a trip to the orphanage) or that I had an extra day to come back. Next time I'm back in Siem Reap, I know what I'll be doing. Thanks Herve, Sobay and all for making the awesomeness possible.As a side note, the above account is for something I did on 30 July 2008. When I recently got the chance to plan a Siem Reap vacation for my boyfriend, I recommended the Quad tour and he elected for the Full Day option. That ended a few hours ago and in his own words, he's happy he did it. And the gentle nudging on his part explains how my review finally materialised."

We trusted the reviews and decided to experience it for ourselves. We are so happy we did.We took the option to take a 4 hour tour. It was the end of the monsoon season so everything was an intense green color. The red cambodian earth was muddy and we got splattered with it. Great fun! - especially for someone who thinks she doesn't like to get messy. The truth is, I do! At almost every house we drove past children stood shouting hello and waving - they are so happy to see you drive past. Parents smile too. The children at the school were very happy to see us. It's a truly humbling experience to see little orphans learning English and smiling a smile from deep within their hearts. I can't really find the words to articulate how I felt. It's something I will never forget. The group size was perfect - 4 people plus Herve (the guide). He runs the business incredibly professionally and safety is Herve's no.1 concern. Think of the quads as a way to access where car's can't go - and where your legs could get very tired should you choose to cycle. It's not about racing around the villages - you don't go fast. That would be contrary to life here. Herve wants his tours to provide an opportunity to appreciate life in Cambodia. For me, the quad tour was a perfect compliment to touring temples. The quad tour allows an appreciation of present day living and the temple tours, an appreciation of life in the past. This is not to be missed."

Unfortuately we are larger - lets say about 85 kilos ave each so to share a quad was not an option. We are also older - I will be 50 next year. So to solve the problem of my nervousness yes one of Herve's fabulous helpers jumped on to guide and teach me. Well I have not laughed so much for such a long time. We were that covered in mud from my dreadful driving that all the people we passed just roared in laughter too. What a wonderful patient team. I got the hang of it and was allowed to do my own thing once confident! For me, it was a wonderful confidence building exercise and a lovely way to see the countryside with so many lovely laughs on the way. Please don't hesitate to book this tour - my thanks again to Herve and his team for a wonderful way to end our visit in Cambodia and a life time memory that will always make me laugh!"

            "review": "Perk of the trip. I was planning my trip to Cambodia a couple of months back, and chanced upon Quad Adventure Cambodia (QAC). Besides the usual touristy sight-seeing stuff of Cambodia's cultural and historical attractions, I was looking for something out of the ordinary that provided interaction with Cambodia's people, culture and their lifestyle, and QAC did just that.Once it was booked, it was an activity in Cambodia that my friends and I really looked forward to (yes, more so than the Angkor Wat!) and QAC did not disappoint. Don't worry about not finding QAC's HQ - they arrange for a complimentary tuk-tuk to pick and return you to/from your hotel, plus they are a stone's throw away from the main city area. My friends and I don't have a license so we were teamed up with a guide each (thankfully!) to ensure that it was a smooth and safe ride. The quad bike is also relatively easy to handle - it's pretty much a button to slow down or go, and steering.The short span of time spent on the quad bike with Herve and his team (Sobey and Chang) was too short, but definitely well spent. We chose the Easy Ride tour, which was a 14km ride into the country side. Here, we rode amongst straw huts and waving children, and stopped at the brilliant green padi fields for some picture taking. We then headed back, but not forgetting the wide road of terrain where our guides gave us the green light to go full speed ahead - roaring fun!Herve, the owner, was also very kind to extend our experience a little by taking a detour. There wasn't additional scenery or anything, but the extra time spent on the quad was much appreciated.My guide, Sobey, was also terribly fun. His crazy and good nature ensured me a muddy time, while his generous patience with me while I tried to master the quad (I don't have a driving/riding license) was much appreciated - I was trying hard not to dump both of us into the muddy puddles.If you are planning a trip to Cambodia, don't forget to take a ride with QAC. The only regret we experienced was not taking the longer route."

It was a fantastic experience being able to see the villages and everyday life of the cambodians. If you are a speed fiend, you won't be able to go very fast on the quad bike at most parts due to potholes and people and animals sharing the same dirt roads the bikes went on but we were very very happy to be able to gun it at a particularly long and flat stretch of road.

First of all I'd like to say I am a seasoned traveller (14 years travel 7 times a year) and always use trip advisor for tips, though have never to date written in a review. Though after my recent travels to Siem Reap I felt compelled to write a review particularly given the Quad Experience in Siem Reap is rated the No.1 - even above seeing Angkor Wat!! Before I explain my experience I'd like to point out my wife and I are in our early 30's and are fit, which is relevant to our story. We are also not usually fussy like some people and are usually flexible to understanding not everything can be perfect. Cash also has never been a restriction for us when travelling; we stayed at Hotel De La Paix. Please bare with me on the detail of as it is lengthy, but I felt compelled to write it given this is rated no.1 thing to do in Siem Reap. (at the very least least read my last 2 points at the bottom of the review, along with my summary - paragraph before)So finally to my experience, we booked over the net a quad each for the half day tour. On the day we paid for two quads. There was four of us on the tour - my wife and I and another couple (who decided to share a quad). Now my wife and I have never driven quads before and as we jumped on our own quad, we looked at each other and thought we should do the one quad and not the 2. As soon as I mentioned this to the tour operator and driving instructor Herve, he didn't seem too keen on refunding us the difference, though he never said this instead he implied my wife and I were too large to ride a quad together!! For the record I weigh 85kg and my wife is 55kg!!! the other couple would have been roughly the same weight combined. To prove the point they even made my wife jump on my quad and push the suspension down indicating there's no way we could ride together with the adverse terrain on the way back of the tour. Before I even got a word in the owner said to me 'Sir I cannot allow you to ride together, I know, it's my business don't tell me how to run it'!! I couldn't believe the rudeness considering I hadn't even said a word in protest. Anyway that was the beginning. When my wife got on her Quad I said to the owner I was nervous her riding alone, considering she'd never driven one. Though she is actually a better car driver than myself! So the owner had one of his assistants ride with her. Now within 5 minutes of riding I could see my wife had got the hang of it, and had a look on her face of discontent in that she no longer needed a sweaty assistant sitting behind her literally guiding every turn she would make. I could see she was getting irritated. So at the first opportunity that we stopped at traffic lights I mentioned to Herve's assistant that my wife would now like to ride the quad unassisted as she is comfortable. He immediately snapped back and said 'Sorry sir this is not possible', I calmly said to the guy 'can you at least ask her how she feels\u2019, he refused and said 'Sir I know she can't ride the quad, don't tell me how to do my job!'. At this point I had begun to get irritated by the rudeness I'd experience thus far from both Herve and his assistant. Half hour later, at our first official stop, I could clearly see my wife was very unhappy having someone guide her, and I thought we have paid so much to have our own quads the least they could do was allow my wife to have the service she paid for, which was to ride her own quad. After a small argument with the assistant he called over Herve, and I thought surely Herve will understand. But no he insisted even further that it was unsafe for my wife to ride on her own. At this point I lost it, as I knew my wife's experience on this tour was going to be tarnished with someone assisting her as we still had another 4 hours of the tour. I argued with both Herve and the assistant and they were making all kinds of excuses saying she couldn't drive, she was terrible driver etc... I couldn't believe what I was hearing given that she is a better driver than me. The truth is I believe they were being discriminatory and had formed a judgement that was irreversible from the beginning when I had said 'my wife is a little nervous riding on her own (she really wasn't I was making a case of us sharing a quad, when it was refused)'. Anyway, after arguing for a good 15 minutes and my wife in tears, Herve then put my wife through a humiliating drivers test for 5 minutes 'to ensure in his mind that she was competent'. I couldn't believe it. At this point I had mentioned to herve, I will give him all my cash and credit cards as collateral to let my wife drive the quad on her own in the event she damages his precious quad. Finally he gave in!!! But the drama doesn't end there. Now in fairness this part could be true on the part of the operators, but I feel the need to share it anyway. When I was arguing with Herve earlier to allow my wife to ride her own Quad, he mentioned he was concerned that the terrain was going to be quiet bad on the way back (last hour) hence why he didn't want her to ride on her own. So in the last hour, just before this bad terrain, we all stopped and apparently there was a bolt missing from my wife's quad! They apologised and suggested that my wife could no longer ride her quad. Convenient? who knows! So now we had to leave her quad where we stopped, and guess what, she now had to ride with me for the last hour!!! Hang on weren't we too heavy together in the beginning!!!! And through the bad terrain! In the end Herve and his assistant apologised profusely over the incident and even invited for us lunch, which was very nice of them. But to be honest I still felt compelled to write this story for any would be traveller to Siam Reap. In summary I would say the quad experience can be good, but service needs major improving. I made note to Herve and his assistant that being French does not excuse them from being rude to customers, end of the day they are there to provide an enjoyable service. Particularly given the comparative cost of the tour to all other sites and activities in Siam Reap (as it is expensive). So.... don\u2019t be fooled it's certainly not an experience that must be done over seeing Angkor Wat, Ta Prohm, Preah Khan, Bayon temple or the mine museum. And if you are going to do it, PLEASE take a couple lessons from my experience1. IF THERE ARE TWO OF YOU MAKE SURE YOU DECIDE WHETHER YOU WANT 1 OR 2 QUADS BEFORE YOU PAY!!2. DO NOT SHOW ANY SIGN OF NERVOUSNESS IF RIDING FOR THE FIRST TIME! AS YOU MIGHT HAVE SOMEONE ELSE RIDING IT FOR YOU AND GETTING THEM OFF ONCE YOU GET THE HANG OF IT, IS AN UPHILL BATTLE."

Kind of Templed out, we decided to do the Discovery Tour - which was 2.5 hours - perfect time for me. What an amazing tour - I consider us very fortunate to have discovered this - the tour we took took us through several little villages, and a local rural orphanage and even a jungle temple (if you have a 3 day pass just be sure to bring it to get in for free). In addition, our tour guide was very knowledgeable (owns the business), and there is a definite focus on safety (also a big plus for me). The temples are cool, but seriously this was one of the coolest tours I've ever done. You just see so much of the villages and the people. I can't even tell you how many little kids were so excited along the side of the road waving, and the orphanage was an incredibly memorable experience.VERY, VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED - will definitely round out your Cambodia experience!"

They were tested to see if they could ride safely and our trip was slow & easy to suit everyone. We visited an orphanage as well as many villages. It was great to see the countryside outside of the Tourist route. Privately run this is a great side trip to add to your visit to Siem Ream and Ankor Wat. We even visited some of the temples on the Quad bikes. A real load of fun and HIGHLY RECCOMENDED"

After short instructions we went off to the countryside, drove through little villages and next to the rice fields. There we could enjoy a beautiful sunset before we headed back to the town. I never tried Quad driving before, but it was very easy to learn and so much fun! If we would have had more time, I would definately have booked a full day trip there.

We shared a quad bike as I was a bit uncertain about driving one.We had such a great time that when our helicopter flight was cancelled the next day we went back again for a half-day tour - this time with our own bike each since they are so easy to drive.Our guide (and the business owner) Herve, led us around the countryside where we saw some great rural scenes and views and where all the local children come running out waving and shouting whenever they hear the quad bikes coming. They're full of joy and excitement and it's great fun waving back and shouting hello to them! Word of advice for the daytime tours - if you burn easily wear sunblock and long sleeves (it can also be pretty dusty if it hasn't rained for a while). Great outdoor fun for all the family."

We went through all types of terrain, stone, mud, puddles we didn't think we'd come out of... One of our stops was an a rarely visited temple bantey ampil, we had the place to ourselves as it cant be reached easily , along with many small village stops and loads of Livestock and animals everywhere. On arrival back to the shop after our ride, we were greeted with beers and happy faces where we could chat and laugh about our experience.

Aki, the owner, and his tour guides are all lovely. I had never ridden a motorbike in my life and they were very patient with me. They spent as much time as I needed to feel comfortable on the bike before going on the road and dirt tracks. So if you're a beginner don't worry!The tour guides will stick with you and go at a speed that is comfortable for you. My brother is more experienced and he and the other tour guide went fast at the front and I followed slowly with another tour guide at the back and just met with them at points along the way.It is great because you get to see lots of the Cambodian countryside and see how the people out in the country live. Lots of kids will come out to wave at you along the way.At the end of the day they came and picked me up at the end of the off-road trail because it was getting dark and busy on the roads. It was a very cool motorbike, which had a side car. That was one of the best bits - burning through Siem Reap and taking in the sights. This is one thing in Siem Reap not to be missed!!"

The guides have gopros filming parts of the trip and giving you the videos for free via YouTube afterwards.Don't forget it's dirt bike riding and Cambodia. You will get wet, crazy dirty and sweat like hell but if that's not your thing you might be in the wrong country and better not drive a bike.Regarding trip difficulty:We both are intermediate street bike drivers with little to no off-road experience. However we quickly accustomed to the terrain and did a good job.But keep in mind, you will have to know how to kick in gears, play with the clutch and drive through hip deep water. But don't worry if you've driven street bikes with manual before, you should be just as fine as we were.After our trip we were invited to join Aki the owner for a small dinner outside his garage with his staff and had a couple of beers and a crazy funny time.Honda bikes did a good job. Next time I would however choose the Yamaha WR. Definitely worth the premium. It's like going with a chainsaw through the jungle.Keep it up Aki! I'm definitely going to return soon!"

High summary: It was AMAZING. Definitely one of the most challenging things I've done physically in some time, but it was so worth it! This review will be a bit lengthy, but if you're considering on really going- read on. The equipment is almost new/great shape (which I was not expecting.) The guides go out of their way to make sure you have a pleasant experience. The eight or so hours go rather quickly so don't let the number scare you. They provide water so you don't have to carry it around. The group also stops for lunch and a much needed break. Is it physical? Yes. Very much so. With the heat index at 106F / 42C, you will get exhausted. Expect to fall, everyone does. Don't lose confidence. I'm in my late 20s and this was grueling, so make sure you know it will be tough. Again, I cannot stress how much this is worth it. I would even argue this is as important as going to Angkor Wat when in Siem Reap. Let me know if you have any questions.If this review was helpful, thumbs up! Thanks"

The trail was brilliant! there was such a range of terrain to challage you which consist of sand, jungle and mountains. I did this trail with a group of 5 people which all had different riding abilities. Even though their abilities varied Aki and the gang are able to change pace, trails and terrain to suit. They are also trained in first aid and speak great english so i felt safe at all times. I rode both the XR250 and the WRF250, the bikes are maintained really well as Aki and the boys are proper bike mechanics. The WRF250 was incredible, its a professional bike and only a few years old. I would definitely suggest upgrading your bike to the WRF as the ride is alot more enjoyable, you feel like a pro! Aki has alot of knowledge of the history and culture so it was very interesting to learn about siem reap and their people. We would stop every 20-30 mins for a drink or food which is supplied in the cost.Next i went on a 4 day loop trail from siem reap to anlong veng with bot and chet. we stopped and stayed the night in guesthouses and hotels along the way. It was incredible to see these tiny villages in the middle of the jungle and in the middle of nowhere. You see the real cambodia where there are no tourists which is also a bit daunting haha. you also get to see alot of temples tourists dont see. Bot and Chet looked after me really well, they were always concerned for my well being. They also fed me pretty well which was good. I am a beginner rider offroad but ride road bikes so i had a bit of an advantage to someone completely new. Bot and Chet customised the trail to suit my abilities and also taught me how to ride well with hints and techniques. by the last day i could see how much my riding had improved and didnt want to stop! although i was pretty tired haha. Even though i had finished the tour and was no longer a 'customer' Aki has been showing me his culture. Its cambodian new year and i have been with him nearly everyday partying with the locals, cooking with him, showing me how to repair the bikes for when i get my own. I consider Aki as a good friend and now im counting down the days for when i can come back!"

They have all the safety gear, loads of sizes and in very good condition which meant when I had my crashes I got up laughing. Bot thought it was funny when I crashed into a nest of red ants, so did I once he's got them all off me.

First of all, Aki is incredibly accommodating and helpful - I emailed him at 11:30pm the night before I wanted to go on a day long tour and he responded within minutes and had a helpful chat with me about the details of the trip. I have never ridden a motorcycle before. He picked me up from my relatively distant hotel promptly at 8:00am and got me suited with good gear and a 150cc bike, which was perfect for me being a complete beginner. We went out with 3 guys that had much more experience and they quickly left me in the dust, so I had almost an entire day alone with 2 guides to go whatever pace I wanted. We visited some beautiful sites, had a good lunch, swam in a waterfall, etc. The guides were really nice guys - one always rode in front and one always behind me since I was very likely to crash (amazingly I never had any big wipeouts, just dropped the bike a few times, but both of my guides wiped out once). Let me reiterate that I HAD NEVER RIDDEN A MOTORCYCLE BEFORE. I have some experience with mopeds, I can drive a manual transmission car, and I am athletic. I watched some YouTube videos of how to work a motorcycle transmission and balance weight. It is NOT EASY the first time and I had to remind myself to constantly pay attention and not push myself too hard. It would be incredibly easy to end up with a shattered wrist, collarbone, or much worse if the bike is too much for you, your concentration lapses for a second, or you just get unlucky. This isn't at all similar to one of those \"Adventure\" rock climbing or bungee jumping courses where your skill plays no role in the safety - if you don't know how to ride one of these bikes and you aren't super careful you could easily end up in deep medical trouble in a country where that would be a terrible circumstance. Again, I had an amazing time and luckily no injuries. I will seek out more motorcycle experiences in the future. But this is truly a play at your own risk sport. Aki and his crew run a great service but I suggest you be completely honest with yourself about your capabilities and the risks involved."

Went through jungle trails just wide enough for the bike.passed small villages and open country.The staff are great help and love what they do and deserve all the success in the future. There is no better way to see the real Cambodia....if you can take your eyes of the trail for a second :)"

For 2 middle aged guys who have not been dirt biking since we were kids he made sure the terrain wasn't too tough for us on the way back after biking all day. The owner Aki was also very professional and very accommodating. After canceling the first booking date due to me being quite sick he was more than happy and willing to set up a tour the following day with another guide. Very happy with this company and the people who took care of us. Make sure you have plenty of water man was it hot.Thank you to you both."

The purpose of this is not to rant but to share my experience so that others will hopefully not have to go through the horrific ordeal that I did.I expressed my concern that I was a beginner yet they stressed that it was absolutely fine. I spent about 40 mins training and right at the end they switched me to a much bigger and more powerful bike. I had very little time to get accustomed to the new bike and we were already off into the trail. I lost control of the bike at a sharp turn and ended up having a horrible accident wherein I shattered my wrist.There were two guides, both of whom said that my hand was probably dislocated. They began to tug aggressively at my deformed wrist to get it back into place, probably doing more damage to it. One guide stayed behind while the other continued the tour with the one other patron. The guide did not even have a cellphone so he had to flag down a passerby to get us some help. To cut a very long and painful story short, I was in a hospital in Siem Reap where an under-experienced surgeon was convincing me to operate (ill recommendation aimed only to get my money). Thankfully I flew back home and was able to have my hand operated on by a specialist, and hope to regain full motion and use of my right hand after having it in a cast for 2 months. I have titanium plates and pins in my hand permanently now.Of course every extreme sport comes with its risks and I absolutely accept responsibility for my accident, yet this company is much to ready to take on beginners just to get their money with no consideration of their safety and no preparation should something go wrong. I just hope that other beginners will not be reckless enough to do an extreme sport like this with the WRONG tour guides and in the WRONG country to have something go wrong in."

Lots of safety gear, a good range of bike to choose from and a real friendly bunch. I was the only intermediate rider that day so I had Bod as my guide. He took me on the most amazing route. He judged my level of skill and pace perfectly and got much faster as the day progressed (which was what I wanted). He clearly really enjoys riding his bike, taught me how to powerslide properly round corners. He is a really nice guy, took me to a temple in the jungle which is older than Ankor Wat. Had loads I had loads of near misses, but that's to be expected. These guys are very professional and your safety is their top concern. Wear all the gear they offer you so if you do fall you won't get hurt, don't worry about being too hot, just rode faster!I've rented loads of motocross bikes in Asia and all have had various problems or been poorly maintained. The bikes they have are clearly ridden loads but the tyres are all brand new and brakes and suspension well serviced, they are constantly maintaining the bikes. I'm definitely going back next year for a three day tour. This couldn't get any better. Thanks so much guys"

It was an opportunity to discover the routes of the in lands of siem reap and surroundings. You can avoid therefore the crowded touristic places. Aki is extremely knowledgeable and experienced driver. So is his team. I don't see you running risks but I would recommend to know how to ride a bike before doing it. If you don t you will slow the whole group and feel miserable. Unless you are all beginners and they will teach you the basic. If you are experienced, you will enjoy this at full, riding across hidden path, pot holes, sandy roads and hidden temples. They provide the gear so there is nothing to worry about !"

            "review": "One Day Trip Around Siem Reap. Did the 180 km one day trip around Siem Reap with a small group of five riders ranging from intermediate to novice. Just for reference so you know where I'm coming from in this review, I'm only an intermediate rider and ride forests around the Canberra and surrounds.The ride consists of fire trails (dirt roads), that are from smooth graded red stone, to deep rutted woops, to water puddles knee high. We did some single track through farming areas, where you had deep mud and water to contend with, heavily thick forest where you had just enough room for the bike and you had to sit, to some very sandy single trails. If you don't like sand, take it easy as there is a bit to contend with on this ride, but nothing you cant master if hav'nt done it before.Our guide and owner Aki is a very funny and great rider. He jokes about some of the Aussie riders wanting to go flat out, and he can ride fast if you want to. For our group he was probably taking it a bit easy which suited us. We had one female rider who had ridden only road before, so it was a very steep learning curve for her. But we had a sweep rider who took Ashley on a easier path (more fire trails) and we met up at different points along the route. The only thing I would say (as the previous review did - Lorrie was in our group), be honest about your riding skills. It's ok not be a beginner, they just need to accommodate for you.Bikes were a combination of old XR 250s and WR 250s but I believe they cater for up to 450s if that's your thing. If your not a pro, the cheaper XRs are fine and do a great job. I'd only every heard they were a great bike, and they were fun to ride (I ride a KTM 300 exc at home for reference).You'll see a hidden temple along the way which is only accessible by bikes, you stop at cross roads for drinks and refuel. You'll see the Cambodian farming communities and countryside, with all its animals ranging from water buffalo, dogs and even a snake if your lucky :)Lunch is half way along the journey at a sort of local rest stop. Boots off and into a timber open shelter with hammocks. Toilets facilities are basic ;) no paper when we were there (ok harden up princess). Food was chicken, rice, morning glory etc plus a few extra ones if you wanted to try them e.g. frog. All personal protective gear is provided period. Your helmets to boots. Body armour is the Fox full torso arms version. Not sure if they supply knew pads as I bought my own. If you have yours do, same with gloves. Camelbak... Bring one if you have it. There is plenty of water carried by Aki for the riders plus stops along the way, but if you get thirsty as I do...If your just a weekend intermediate rider then this will be very enjoyable for you. You will be tired, because your day starts at 8 am and finishes about 4-5 pm. I was picked up from the hotel and returned. If you have a go pro, bring it along, although Aki does have a reverse facing mount on his camera to film the first couple of riders. With the dust though, your not really going to be able to get close enough, so if you bring yours (remember to charge the night before unlike me), you'll probably get the best footage of your ride.I think the running total was a maximun of 2 falls per rider. Pot holes filled with water can be deceptively deep here :) Yes you probably will fall off, so be aware of your riding capabilities and that you have travel insurance that will cover this. Back in Australia, you need to have a motorcycle licence I believe to be covered. Brilliant, fun, best day in Siem Reap."

Really knows his nuts and bolts and how to ride. Also really cares for the bikes and equipment. He seriously put me through my paces but I loved it. Top tip: be really honest with Aki about your experience as some the terrain is demanding. I'm suffering tonight after a fall and was probably riding ahead of my abilities today. But that said, it's because that's what I wanted. His team will cater for what you want, but remember to ride at your own pace and stay calm and safe.My best day in siem reap by far and having on doe the day it feel it represents good value as Aki is a a pro and all his kit is well cared for. He's also very organised and helpful. AND FUN!Do it."

But this???... Oh my God, this is just in another level! It's way too awesome for words to explain it.Aki, our guide, made the day completely perfect and hassle free! He picked me up from my hotel, equipped me with the most incredible and \"professional looking\" gear and there we go!I drive my regular bike now and then for work - just a simple KTM duke 125, so I can say I have a little experience with the most basic stuff - clutch, gears, etc. I also have a super electric bike that does 45 miles an hour so some experience in off-road with a normal bike also... This being said - well - I need to say that this trip with Aki just took me to a whole new level on riding a bike. It was my complete first time on the dirtbike. I just loved every second of it. Water, mud, dust ... You cover it all!You don't have to worry also about your go Pro videos. Aki will take care of it and you just have fun seeing them later while you are still drooling and daydreaming about your day!Did I mention that you'll see a Camboja that most people don't see? Countryside, the works in the fields like the years haven't passed in here? The plantations of rice and beans on the side of the road, where you have to slow down because of the leaves that are drying in the sun?Another thing - if you somebody in your group that's slower than you, Aki will leave other guide with them and will give you the blast of your life, so don't worry about adrenaline! I'm addicted to it and I had plenty of it!!After a little blast he'll go back and forth to reunite everybody again! A little bit like the Australians do with sheep in motorbikes ;)It's a must!Forget the price! It worths every penny! JUST DO IT! You can't die without this story in your book of stories!Thank you Aki! Thank you Sob! Thanks do all the team!

You can do this two ways -- one is to ride on the back of a motorbike; if you are used to riding a bike you will have your own bike and will be led by a Cambodian Trails guide. I've done several trips with them -- they are dependable and very sensitive and open to traveler needs. This is a great way to see the Angkor temples off the core site on day trips, as you also see a lot of the countryside and can explore some major recently opened sites that have been cleared of land mines -- Suryavarman II's ancestral temple is one to see in a heavily overgrown site; I've had them take me on day trips to Mount Kulen, which has incredible backwoods sites that can only be reached by a bike ride. I've taken trips with them in which some ride their own bike and others ride on the back end of another. They are incredibly flexible and are great at working up trip plans with you. They carry their own repair and first aid gear , and are do quick training with inexperienced or not-up-to-speed riders."

We drove through the remote jungle, little villages, to an abandoned temple. Saw amazing views. Ate an amazing lunch (included). We were provided plenty of water all day. Aki provided a 2nd staff member to ride behind me so I didn't get lost behind (as my pace was definitely not near as quick as Aki or my husband). We got great go-pro footage from the day. I most definitely had a few wipeouts and an unfortunate incident with a chicken running in front of me but surprisingly loved it! And I'm so glad we went! P.s. Aki was SO kind.

We took dirt bike XR250 from Siem Reap to Beng Mealea via country road through local villages. 30mins ride with 10-20mins break and chat prove to be great intensity for us.The best part that I like is the local tour guide Aki. He is an experience biker who used to compete, speaks good English, knowing every road and every village. He carefully select route start from normal road, solid dirt road, sand, then to mud, water and gradually move to more advance off-road. As an experience biker himself, he know how to select the suitable route base on rider's ability, and adjust accordingly.As my friend was first time on dirt, somehow dip into water with his bike, tour guide quickly drain water out of exhaust and knowing mechanic issue, he went and change the oil during our lunch break. Very nice.The price may seems a lot but with bike, gas, oil, proper helmet and equipment, drink and food, entrance fee, hotel pick up and drop off with Tuk Tuk (local transport) everything all included. This is a great deal.Recommend to bring a waterproof bags for all your belongings, camelbak water pack for easy to drink water as it's hot. At least one full day tour is recommended.

I myself can't ride but Aki was very patience with explaining and Bott was my instruction and was extremely helpful. Even though I wasn't very used to riding a manual bike and even got into a minor accident, the entire dirt bike tour was worthwhile.Managed to tour the countryside and saw endless grasslands, farms and rode along villages.Thank you Aki and co for the experience!!"

We chose the beginner bikes with some pre training as my girlfriend had never ridden a motorbike and it had been about 20 years since I had. They were very patient with us and gave good advice.We started off on easy enough roads but as confidence grew they would take us down more challenging tracks which kept excitement levels high. We had such a great day and able to experience a more personal insight into Cambodia outwith the normal tourist paths. They will cater for all levels of experience and tailor your trip accordingly.This was by far the best thing I have done on holiday! The guys were great and the condition of the bikes was excellent(brand new). Would love to do this again, hopefully see you guys soon."

Aki provide all the gears for your security and even movies from his camera!As we travelled around Asia, we didn't know exactly when we will start our trip with Aki but he was very flexible and at the end it was easy to managed. Aki and his staff are very friendly and proffessional!We did the last day with Bot as well, we have been to a very nice waterfall up to the mountain.The bikes (XR250) are quiet old and not in perfect condition but anyway you can upgrade to WR250!Cambodia Trails is like coffee 3 in 1, riding, discovering and so much fun!I will do it again for my next holiday in Cambodia!"

On my 50 th birthday I had the opportunity to relive my childhood glory days, by doing a day trip with Bott, Aki was busy with some returning clients on the day, and couldn't ride with me but made the effort to meet and pick me up from my accommodation!! Aki was so excited for me to enjoy my day, he is a super cool dude!!! Bott, my guide was another hidden gem of Cambodia, although I thought I was flying along, Bott must have been sooo bored, his leading was excellent, we stopped for a couple of rests, at the most amazing places. The first was a jungle Temple, totally deserted, there was no push from Bott about time, I was free to set my own pace, and explore at will. This place was so totally natural, untouched and surreal!!!!! After some more tearing through Cambodian jungle/country side, the next rest stop was at a corner shop for some cold water or whatever I wanted, all inclusive in tour cost. Some little kids from a school across the road came out to look at the big fat sweaty man, a fun time indeed, some life memory moments. Then was more fun riding before a lunch break at Ben Malea Temple, a most amazing Temple to rival any I had previously visited in Cambodia, my opinion only. Again lunch break time was set by me, although longer lunch = less riding!! Over all this day, reliving my Childhood glory, was one I could never forget. Bott was amazing and made sure in every way, allowing me to make my own pace and itinerary for the day, that this was more than I could have hoped for. Watch out Aki, Big Botts coming.A must do and I'll be back!!!"

            "review": "Amazing Off-road day with Cambodia Trails!. A couple of days ago I spent a great day with Aki from Cambodia trails who took me on the off-road dirt bike tour. I'm travelling solo and had no experience riding a motorbike so don't let that put you off if you're worried.I had an extra day in Siem Reap so I phoned the day before, even though he was on a tour Aki took my call but if he doesn't answer send him a text as he's probably on the bike!He came and picked me up and had all the equipment ready and waiting having already asked my sizes. After 45 mins learning about the bike and training I'd got the grips of it and we were off, starting on easier terrain and then Aki geared the route around my ability as it progressed. You get to see the most breathtaking views - we rode through rural towns, over rickety bridges, past local weddings, stopped off at forgotten temples and this was all before midday! Aki shot loads of photos and videos to document the day and clips of me riding which he shared with me afterwards.Although this could be bad if you're a show off like me..Towards the end of the day when he was filming I decided to go faster than an absolute beginner should on a bumpy trail and went straight over the handlebars into a ditch. Aki had kitted me out in complete chest/shoulder/back armour and all the other padding so I literally bounced straight to my feet with only my male pride damaged!The bike took a few knocks and dents but he was genuinely only concerned that I was ok which made me feel much better about it! Toward the end of our tour a hurricane like wind picked up sending a huge tree crashing across the road, inches from Aki's bike! He bounced over it just in time and I skidded to a stop in front of it - all made for an exciting day with great stories!There are a few other motorbike / dirt bike trail companies that I looked into but I'm really glad that I booked it through a local guide as his knowledge of the history of the area was second to none and you definitely feel less like a tourist just tearing up local tracks when he's waving to people he knows!This was by far the most fun and best day I've spent on my 3 weeks travelling around SE Asia!"

There was another gentleman with us who was more experienced and he would go off with one guide while my girlfriend and I went off another way with another guide. We would all meet up together at key meeting points.AKI's English is very good. He is funny and gets the nuance of the language. He is also fluent in the local language.We got to see an awesome temple in a remote jungle only accessible by motor bike. We had the temple to ourselves. Later we had lunch in a little fishing village in some hammocks. We were tired after lunch so we asked to take it easier which we did. Still got to see a lot of cool rural villages on the way back.If you're at all inclined towards adventure contact AKI and do it. You will not regret it."

If you're looking for something different to do in SR or want the experience of being alone in a hidden temple, I'd highly recommend doing a one day tour with Aki. Aki is really cool and fun and Bot is sweet and easy going. We were complete beginners but felt looked after and safe. There was always someone in front and behind us and the pace never seemed too fast.We started on the same tour as another European guy but our group was split because our levels were compete opposites. This was great as we both got private tours, we had less pressure and he wasn't bored. I'm quite small and Aki even organised to get his 14 year old cousin's bike for me which was the perfect size. They take care of everything: all the biking clothes freshly cleaned, boots and gear, water, entrance fees, lunch, hotel pick up and drop off, even videos and photos with a go pro at no extra cost so all you need to bring is yourself and a USB.It was an amazing experience. We were picked up at 8:30am and after getting fitted, were taken out to a field where we practiced for about an hour and they made sure we really felt comfortable riding before heading out on all kinds of terrain: dirt, rock, sand and river crossings even in the middle of the dry season.The road out to Beng Melea was sealed and smooth but the temple was disappointingly crowded with bus loads of Chinese tour groups. I guess the new road has allowed access to mass tourism now. However on the way back through more river crossings and jungle paths we suddenly arrived at a seemingly lost jungle temple. We were all alone and took it in without another soul. It was amazing.Even though I almost didn't do it because the bikes freaked me out, I'm so glad they gave me the confidence to have a fun, memorable day out. We got back at 6pm so it was a long day but neither of us felt the time. Thanks to Bot who was always patient and friendly throughout my many stalls. I couldn't kick start the engine so he had to come to my rescue each and every time.TipsBring your USB. Wear shorts. Book early (they're a small team. You can walk in but they might already be booked)."

Aki was extremely patient teaching us how to ride and spent a good amount of time teaching us in a field until we were comfortable enough to head out on the trails. There were three of us on the tour (plus Aki and Bott from Cambodia Trails), but the other rider was more experienced so he went out with Bott until we were ready to go. Once we hit the trails, the tour was unbelievable! We got to ride through the countryside of Cambodia and see a lot of beautiful scenery and local living as well as eat some delicious local food. Aki and Bott were our guides and one of them was always in the front and one in the back to ensure we all stayed together. Aki is not only a great guide, but a really awesome and personable guy as well, which made the experience that much more enjoyable. He also uses a GoPro to film throughout the day and provided us the footage to take home.Overall, this was one of the most exciting and enjoyable tours my wife and I have ever done.

Rented an xr250 with pillion pegs for about 4 days until my missus had to leave, swapped bike for sweet as hell wr250, played around on that for a few days(oh yeah i had a big night in town...PUB STREET!!!!!!!! and lost the keys to the xr and went and saw Aki and he didn't get mad or anything... in true big bro fashion billed me for it and i was away again in hours)Took the wr250 on a one day tour pinned it down a puddley goat track and missed a gradual right hand bend (ambition definately lower than ability at this point) hit the skids doing way to fast KM/h and ploughed into a fallen tree/ log/ mar farker!!! and proceeded to superman over the bars and projectile myself about 10+ metres into a huge puddle, whilst airborne i could see the wr doing front flips mid air behind me....whoops... :) The bike landed in the same huge puddle as me and I being filled with shock/ guilt/ stupidity I imediately tried to start it without letting the water drain from the internals...baum baum :(A front rim resembling pac man and water through the engine the bike was finished for the day and did Aki get mad? No!!! I was waiting for the abuse as the wr was his personal weapon and he just asked if i was ok (and told me to calm down a bit) then said i could grab on of the xr250s of the trailer rider and that the trailer rider would huck the wr back to the shop. Through the pain i pushed on for the day and say some awesome places and small villages, reomte communitys with got pharmacies and hidden temples, the day was a blast!!!!I'm going back as soon as i can to get into more of this action becasue it is simply heavenDirt bikes + Temples + Gnarly single tracks and hellish mudholes + Beers for Lunch and the sweetest in the world Cambodian people + The Man AKI!!! it's too much fun.If ya like to blast around on dirties and have a pension for ancient history and cultures while shooting the the breeze over beers and good food with a top people then don't let this one pass you buy. Even if you are in town with ya own bike, contact Aki and poke along with a group. You can go as hard as you like when your out in the jungle... but i recommend letting Aki set the pace.Go as fast or slow as you like we all wait for eachother and laugh when you fall in the drink... well they did all the laughing... i was crying.AWESOME to the power of SICK!!!!!!"

Awesome days ride with Aki!!!!After riding bikes on farms growing up this was really good fun and a great way to see a bit of country side,My girlfriend had been on the back on a similar tour in Laos and has gotten keen so She has had one lession before this on a little mud bug type. I explained this to Aki and he was great and sorted out an XR100 PERFECT!!! (Even emailed pictures)So off we went fully kitted up in safety gear. We hit a full range of terrain on our days ride which was cool and I had some good chase sessions with Aki only having to turn back once to save the Mrs from a bit of strife in a big mud puddle. After we had a good laugh away we went again through some tight bush sections and to visit a temple which was really cool. Stopped for a nice feed and back into it again round a few villages where all the kids are waving and trying to get ya to pull wheelies hahaAll round was a great day finished with a solid sleep!!!!Cheers AkiLance & Larissa"

It was an amazing experience and a unique way to see and experience the country and forests. Also on the trip we went to visit a small 9th century temple in the jungle. After walking through the angkor complex and dealing with the throngs of other tourists it was a unique experience to wonder around and through the temple where I was the only non local. I can't recommend them enough."

            "review": "Best part of my trip to Cambodia!. Off the back of riding 400km of the HCMR in Vietnam I wanted to try some riding in Cambodia which I heard was a very 'different' experience...different is an understatement!!! Cambodia is absolutely amazing for exploring by dirt bike! ...and I really lucked out meeting Aki and the crew at Cambodia trail riders. I was slightly worried about riding an unfamiliar bike in Siem Reap traffic so Aki got me a lift out of town and after half an hour or so of lessons and checking out my ability and a bonus lesson on using a go pro camera..we were out on the trails. (he is a great teacher, patient with a great sense of humour and made me feel confident and safe on the bike in no time). Riding in Cambodia is undoubtably one of the most fun things I have ever had the good fortune to be able to do, the trails are wild and remote and the landscape is really beautiful away from the tourist masses, with the jungle humidity cooled by motorbike aircon. We rode some local roads, muddy single track, narrow jungle tracks just wider than my handlebars, and out to a remote temple where there were not even any other footprints or vehicle tracks, and Khamer carving in stone is slowly reclaimed by tree roots and jungle vegetation. Aki is the trail finder general, he has been riding bikes in Cambodia all his life, so really is an expert on the trails, bikes and Cambodian culture. He is an expert rider and guide with heaps of experience leading groups off road and totally catered the route to my riding ability while building my skills and confidence through the days riding. 1 day is not really enough, I hope to return to Cambodia another time and will be heading straight to Aki's place to book a longer trip..he also does the best cambodian BBQ and has the biggest stash of after ride beers back at base I have ever seen :) A really friendly professional crew, with expert trails knowledge, great humour and well maintained equipment and their prices are really fair for riding in undoubtably one of the best dirt riding locations in the world. If you want to get off the tourist trail in Cambodia, dont mind getting a bit muddy and ride places the Tuk Tuks cant go..get in touch with Aki and his crew. slay on guys hope to see you again sometime..Slainte!"

During our tours to the Angkor Wat, floating village and Khulen Falls, you would really see that he's very knowledgeable on what he does. He explained everythimg that we need to know. Another great thing about Aki is his flexibility when it comes to the type of tours that you want, schedules etc. I think he also accepts longer tours (5,9 or 11-day tours or whatever) and motorbike tours. If you're having an adventure in Cambodia, i would definitely recommend Aki as your guide."

He was very knowledgeable and he really knows what he's doing. We went to Koulen Mountains to see the waterfalls and then again he explained the history to us in a manner that we will understand. We also went to Tonle Sap with him on our last day and he was also able to give us a background about the floating village. He's a nice guy and he knows a lot of people around town. Very adventurous and he'll surely tell you about some of these as you go along. Will definitely choose him again on our next visit, Phnom Penh, maybe? Thank you, Aki, for being our tour guide. You were awesome and we really learned a lot from you. Cheers!"

We had an awesome time over 3 days trip, bikes are very well maintained, Aki and Bot know the whole region like their pocket and are fantastic guys. Oh yes, each of us (we were a group of 3) dropped a few times, in the mood, in the sand, but always had an helping hand from the guys to get back on track. All the tooling is carried by the team, anything happens:a solution is just right there (had to change one flat tire: less than 15min! Your chain got stuck? Bot unmounts the whole thing in less time needed to say it, you feel a little weak? Aki got for you vitamins and energy drinks, etc...).

I have just returned from a 17 day trip in which I was lucky enough to complete 3000 kilometres with Aki navigating the whole of Cambodia and it is tough to put into words what an amazing experience and what an amazing person Aki is.I'm not a professional rider by any means and I suffered many moments of self doubt where I was unsure I would complete the trip however when these arose Aki was always there to lift my spirits and find a way to keep me riding.He has an explicit knowledge of his country and this means the trails you take show you the real Cambodia, at times you feel like the only tourist in this beautiful country and it's a fantastic feeling having what seems the Jungle all to yourself.As for Aki his communication was fantastic from start to finish, he was extremely flexible with how we completed the tour, his English is exemplary and I'm pretty sure there is not a single person in Cambodia he does not know! The highest recommendation I can give is during my stay I was not made to feel like a client, but another member of his family. I met his friends, his family, nothing was too much trouble and his only concern was making sure I had the best time possible.If you are thinking of coming to this fantastic country contact Aki and let him help make memories that really will last a life time."

At 8 in the morning we sat on the indestructible Honda XR 250 and started .... history was made :-). With all the beautiful experiences in beautiful Cambodia, I have to admit that this was the best. We have seen the hidden parts of Cambodia, the hidden temple, where many tourists do not come. Driving through the jungle, driving through the river, met the people in the forest who have never seen tourists .... they left their job to keep us welcomed ... Certainly magnificent experience, which has become even better because of our guides Aki, who told us about the history of where we are and assisted in communicating with the local population ... and of course, safely returned us to Siam Reap ... where we were honored with dinner .... and a few beers were good there after a full day under full equipment at 30 degrees. I recommend to all people with a little or a lot of adventurous spirit"

Within an hour, we were roaring out of town on a solid Honda 250, and an hour after that we were bushwhacking to abandoned temples in the jungle with not another soul around for miles. An hour after that we were totally lost, on a trail that petered out into a muddy river. We mudded around for a while and had a blast.

Although Aki was away on a trip, his brother, Virak took care of me and showed real patience and enthusiasm in helping me learning on the dirt bike. He really ensure that my ride was smooth and away from potential dangers. Aki kept on checking through telephone to make sure I had a great time. It was a fun ride around rural areas of Siem Reap. Definitely a great experience! Thanks a lot for an amazing memory in Siem Reap! Will definitely look more into dirt biking in the future!"

It was with huge excitement that I arranged to do a trip with Cambodia trails this summer and from the moment I first contacted Aki, the trip was professionally and brilliantly organized. From the moment we touched down in Siem Reap the service was impeccable and this same level of commitment to a high quality tour rolled on throughout our trip across Cambodia.Everything had been expertly pre-organized but there still was a complete level of flexibility. If I told Aki, our tour leader, the night before that we wanted to do something else, it could easily be worked into the plan for the next day. The distinction I draw with the trip we took is that unlike other tours I have done across the world, I count Aki as a great friend following our trip. Whatever your preferences our trip was tailored to our needs; furthermore Aki was with us on most activities, and with with us every step of the way. He knows the history of the land and knows every good bar, restaurant and hotel from the border of thailand to Saigon. A high level of service, prompt and excellent English. It is an experience I won't forget and I am already planning a return trip next year. Cambodia is one of the most beautiful countries in the world and I have completely fallen in love with the place, however so many people who come to this great country only scratch the surface. Book a tour with Cambodia trails and see everything this amazing country has to offer, stuff you didn't think even existed! Take the stress out of it as well with an excellently planned and booked tour, everything is arranged, you just have to sit back and enjoy the view!Really, this is the best tour company you will ever use. Fact!"

It was also good that all food was included.The downsides of this trip were that the tour was very expensive and the distances provided in our itinerary were too far for beginner riders. It's hard to appreciate the distances until you are part way through a ride and the heat makes you sick and it becomes difficult to concentrate and ride the bike safely. The small bikes are not designed for sequential days of long rides, and you will have a sore back and backside. If you cannot complete the ride there is an additional charge to get the bike sent home. There is no partial refund for the days the bike is not used, which is a shame given the high cost of the tour.In all, I'd say this would be a great trip for experienced riders who are not susceptible to heat sickness. We are quite young and healthy and I still became very ill in the April heat, even with rehydration powder, I was not able to make the ride.My advice to anyone booking would be: think hard about how far you will be riding, your experience levels, and the climate at the time of year. If you can't hack it, its a lot of suffering at a hefty price. Consider a short tour or a 4-WD tour if you think you might be like me."

The city, Angkor Wat, and Bayon are wonderful but now we wanted more. We had our trip organized by Hidden Cambodia Adventure Tours. Seeing the countryside and rarely visited temples was a wonderful contrast to Siem Reap -- however delightful that city and the Angkor Wat temples are. We went to the Koh Ker temple complex and the big pyramid temple, Prasat Thom, which served as the capital of the Cambodian empire in the 10th century. Koh Ker is 120 km. from Siem Riep (about two hours one way). This out-of-the-way site has only recently been opened for access and is much less developed. But it is both fascinating and less visited. Without HCAT we would never have found it. An added plus is that HCAT has a traditional style lodge behind the Koh Ker temple where you can stay for a night or two while exploring this fascinating, and remote area. A final surprise us: a visit to a rural school supported in part by HCAT; it was a slice of the \"real Cambodia\" that is 90% rural."

The day was amazing - a massive cultural immersion for my 3 kids (15, 12 and 6). We stopped at markets, visited an Eco home, went to the Tonle Sap lake, visited a Vietnamese floating home; had a wonderful freshly prepared Khmer style lunch and watched the monsoon rains come and go from a hammock. Later visited the local fishing village and larger market. Got back to hotel around 4. A definite highlight day - well supported by the HCAT team. Trip 2: Temples of Angkor - again our guide Lom collected us from the hotel at 8am and took us to the archaeological park. Lom was extremely knowledgeable about all of the temples we visited and could answer any question that the five of us through at him. It was a hot hot day and the constant supply of ice cold water and air conditioned mini van (between temples) was well needed. Again everything was prepaid and arranged for including the set lunch at local restaurant. We got back to the hotel around 4 for a swim and shower and then driven to local restaurant Champey for another beautiful meal.Thank you Hidden Cambodia team - you really gave us some great insights into Cambodia, were well organised and professional.

Sheila and Paul were extremely helpful, accomodating and flexible with my schedule to book my dates for the trip. The trip was actually an entry into the heart of Cambodia - touring the countryside, visiting local people, learning the culture and lifestyle, authentic Cambodian culinary and not to forget the famous temple ruins spread across the country. Adventurous off-road rides through the jungle with Slim (my guide for the trip) and exploring places which are out of reach for regular tourists unless with a reasonably well powered motorbike is an experience to remember for a longtime. Negotiating white sand, clay, red salt and rice fields on a dirtbike definitely challenges once skills as a biker and leaves one with freshly learned skills and confidence ( unless you are already an expert at the art of riding on off-roads). Slim took me to mountains with ancient rock carvings which weren't listed anywhere in google and gave me amazing company and guidance throughout the trip. Highly recommend this experience to all adventure enthusiasts who are visiting Cambodia and to those who would love to see the many wonders Cambodia has to offer beside the Angkor Archaeological Park. Would definitely come back for this experience in the wet season :)"

They organised a tour for myself and husband with VERY late notice to visit Khampong Khleng (Tonle Sap Lake) and Beng Melea. Khampong Khleng was an amazing place, with very little tourists and a lot of diversity in things to see. I have read bad things about other villages on the lake but this was great! All the other side trips to see things were also very interesting. Nothing felt like a waste of time. The lunch supplied was delicious and there was a lot of food.But, what made the trip for us was the guide. He was knowledgeable not only in what we were seeing but also the nation as a whole. His interest in international politics also made for some great conversations. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because it was a little expensive.I was a little annoyed by the badgering from Paul to write a trip advisor review - I almost didn't write one out of spite. But the tour itself was so good I felt I had to write something!"

The first was a guided trek up the back of Phnom Kulen and the second was a bike tour of Angkor Wat. The bike tour of Angor was truly memorable. It was myself, Mr.Slim (a guide) and Paul (one of the owners of Hidden Cambodia). Mr.Slim knows the single-track trails between the Angkor temples extremely well and led us to some incredibly scenic, isolated viewing spots. The riding was fast and varied - I understand Slim gauges his customers and chooses trails that suit their ability. The trip to Phnom Kulen was also very enjoyable. Thanks Paul and Sheila for a great experience!!"

Our family got to know Sheila and Paul many years ago and have used them several times for our own family trips throughout Cambodia, but also recommended them to friends and family. Living in Asia we are always looking for something new and exciting. Sheila has worked with me to arrange off the beaten track trips, allowing our kids to really see Cambodia beyond the temples and towns. Each of our guides is not only well versed in the history of Cambodia, but willing to share a part of their own history. This is important as we want our children to understand what transpired in the 70's. Sheila is prompt to respond, advise, suggest and with the dedicated team she and Paul have established over the years you can't go wrong. Hidden Cambodia is by far one of the best operators we've used in our 18 years living and traveling throughout Asia."

Plenty of communication and flexibility on their part prior to our arrival, and plenty of procrastination on our part saw us yet to plan the route on arrival. This was no problem. A short tuk tuk ride to Paul and Sheila's saw us map out a 3 day tour. Next day we were off and with many varied abilities in the group, Paul and Slim made sure everyone was safe. Although still the wet season, plenty of off-road tracks were found that were passable. First day saw us ride through some very remote countryside visiting some places where the locals react like we were the first westerners (and dirt bikes) they had ever seen. After a few moments, all the villages kids were gathered around for some memorable moments and photo opportunities. That evening we headed to a village near Preah Kahn and homestayed with the local Mayor! We landed in the middle of a religious festival, so that evening we were off to the local Pagoda for a party Cambodian style. The next day we went through plenty of single track to get to Preah Kahn temple. The temple was in absolute ruins, but it was still an amazing compound and temple plus all the monk children that happened to be there made the visit very special. Then off to a couple of other temples through some pretty wild tracks. Rest of the day we travelled through plenty more villages, found a good (?) spot for quick lunch, then headed off to our destination for the night in the town of Preah Vihear. Lovely hotel here and an interesting dinner with plenty of stories told by Paul. Next day off to the temple of Koh Keh. Very remote and quite amazing. The pyramid temple is a must see and missed by most visitors that only go to Siem Reap. An excellent lunch at the temple was then followed by a decent ride back in Siem Reap. All up in the 3 days we covered about 600km (which went very quickly and we had plenty of stops), stayed in one homestay and one hotel, all traditional Khmer food and as with everywhere in Cambodia, all the people were so friendly. All in all, an amazing experience and one I highly recommend. So much so, that a couple of days later we booked another 2 day tour across to Battambang with Slim as our guide. Thanks Paul, Sheila and Slim for an incredible holiday!"

First of all, Hidden Cambodia did an excellent job of organizing the trip. They responded promptly to our questions and met with this us prior to the excursion. Our tour guide -- Sal -- was outstanding; he was informative, dedicated, kind and thoughtful. The driver was also great, and the home-cooked meal was absolutely delicious. Secondly, the places we visited were spectacular. Kampong Khleang is the most remarkable of the floating villages, and it was an incredible place to see, both on foot and by boat. The homes were beautiful; the children swimming and waving; the music from weddings filled the air; the floating fish market was fascinating. And Beng Melea was a very cool and exciting temple to hike through -- unrestored, raw, natural. Don't miss this tour and book it with Hidden Cambodia."

Following the recommendation of our daughter who has been on 2 Hidden Cambodia Dirt Bike Tours, my husband and I went on a 1 night /2 day tour to the border of Cambodia and Thailand to visit the temple Prasat Preah Vihear. The trip was organised by email before our arrival in Cambodia and then we met with Paul, the owner of Hidden Cambodia, a couple of days before heading off for our adventure finalise details. Everything was taken care of including my request to be in a 4 wheel drive rather than on the Kawasaki 250cc bike due to my complete lack of experience with bike riding! Although braver souls can apparently be taught the skills of tearing along red dirt roads in remote parts of Cambodia on these 2 wheeled unsteady looking things. My husband set off with Mr Slim, an experienced and passionate dirt bike rider and thanks to Vannrith my accommodating driver where possible I was not far behind in the 4 wheel drive with the camera at the ready. It was a wonderful trip, seeing the countryside, stopping at places along the way for coffee or food and certainly gave us the chance to see a different side of Cambodia. The temples were as interesting as those around Siem Reap and with far less people - in fact none others at some! Mr Slim and Vannrith were informative guides and good company as well. I can highly recommend Hidden Cambodia if you are interested in getting off the beaten track, and if not they also do tours closer to Siem Reap."

The village itself is just unreal. Not a touristy village at all, so it's a great way to immerse yourself in the day to day life of the Cambodian people. We got to see the houses high up on stilts as well as some floating houses further out on the lake! Our tour guide even bought me an amazing coffee from a floating coffee shop boat!!!!

            "review": "Get away from the Temples for a fantastic trip. So, purely by chance a friend and I stumbled on Hidden Cambodia in 2009. We discovered that they did dirt bike tours around the region varying from one day trips to a few days away on the Thai/Cambodia Border. It didnt take much convincing for us to book a one day excursion, a decision that was rewarded by rare sights into rural Cambodia interspersed with well timed visits to rarely seen temples and ruins, where you dont really see many people, let alone pale faced tourists. Topped off by a steady supply of adrenaline fueled on the back of an XR200 dirt bike whilst navigating an array of varying roads, river beds, goat tracks and erosion scars. Thoroughly enjoyable to say the least!! Fast forward to May 2014, My wife and I decided to take our two young kids on a trip to SE Asia. Naturally I delicately (hopefully!) placed the option of popping into Hidden Cambodia to enquire about their ever expanding Bike tour options - Incidentally they are well equipped and actually deal with all types of tours all over Cambodia, not only bike tours, so if you need anything from a bus or a guided trip around the temples or tickets or even general information they will be pleased to help or point you in the right direction. So, moving on - much of our stay in Siem Reap was arranged through them anyway so on the day we arrived in Siem Reap we went in to discuss the following days with Paul and Shiela (The owners) and discovered that we were able to at the last minute squeeze in a day on the bikes.Obviously the kids couldnt travel on the bikes with us as the terrain was pretty challenging in places - this meant a logistical nightmare but they made the necessary arrangements and in the end the kids had their own little itinerary planned for a 4x4 excursion to Kulen Mountain and we had a couple of bikes and a very pleasant guide on his own bike and a very talented rider! So we all set off , the kids in their 4x4 with 2 very pleasant ladies who work at Hidden Cambodia to accompany/babysit/escort them as the very accomplished Hidden Cambodia guide and driver Mr Slim, and us on our bikes. Again I was not disappointed with the route and terrain on which to ride. My wife had not been on a dirt bike for some time but our guide was very patient and before long we were rounding sandy corners on narrow dirt tracks in clouds of dust and sliding back wheels, traversing dry river beds and crossing wobbly wooden bridges. After approx 70km we all arrived at Kulen Mountain and met up with the kids to discover a National Park, River and waterfall of astounding beauty and of significant religious significance to the Cambodian People. We enjoyed a huge tasty Cambodian barbeque on the river banks prepared by the ladies and Mr Slim and then went swimming in the river, beneath the waterfall, joined by the monks from the local pagoda, also taking a break from the midday heat and cleansing themselves with the waters from the holy river. After a great lunch and spiritual swim we all boarded our various means of transport and headed off for the journey back to Siem Reap in a cloud of dust and rising levels of welcomed adrenaline! We had fun, the kids had fun and it was the highlight of our stay. All I can say is , email them and ask them what they can arrange for you - you wont regret it and its a far cry from pounding the same route as millions of others through the same places in Siem Reap."

My family of five (kids aged 11, 8, and 6) did the \"Kampong Khleang fishing village/Beng Melea VIP Combo\" tour and loved our day trip with Hidden Cambodia. It was really nice to get outside the city and explore local ways of life! The first stop was to a traditional stilted house, complete with its own fishing pond, gardens, and livestock. Our kids loved the piglets, the baby calf, and feeding rice to the chicks!Next, we visited a remote (not overrun with tourists!) community of stilted houses near Tonle Sap lake. The lake itself expands and contracts based on the seasons; during wet season, water levels rise to within a meter of the house floors and recede to dry ground during dry season. Our tour guide Bunlem led us through his own village of Kampong Khleang (even pointing out the house he grew up in and bringing gifts to his mother) and then led us on a boat ride down the canal leading to the lake, where we passed by a floating Vietnamese village. Along the way, we saw many local fishermen and stopped to learn about the fish smoking process. Afterwards, we were served a delicious lunch in a stilted house.From there, we visited a local school and got to distribute supplies to the children. We had also pre-arranged to donate water filters to some local families, and it felt good to give them a resource for clean water. They were so thankful to receive them, and I appreciated partnering with Hidden Cambodia's efforts to give back to local communities in real, tangible ways.Last, we visited Beng Melea, which turned out to be my kids' favorite temple. They loved climbing around and over the jungle-hidden ruins, making their own paths! Finally, it was back in the car for the return drive past beautiful, rustic countryside to Siem Reap. Overall, a wonderful day spent with Hidden Cambodia! I would recommend this tour to anyone wanting an authentic taste of rural Cambodia."

I stayed in villages outside of the usual tourist path, ate from roadside stalls, drank too much Cambodian coffee and watched the sunset from the top of the pyramid outside Koh Ker. Mr Slim was a great motorbike guide, and a good guy to hang out with for three days. There was initial confusion when I got to HCAT as they had thought from their booking info that I was a man (no) and that I had recent dirt biking experience (no); however they changed the itinerary to accommodate this and all was well. A buzz around in a paddock to get used to the bike, and then off for three days of caffeine fuelled temple appreciation and village chicken avoidance."

The smells and sights were challenging for us all, but the careful explanations made things much more accessible, and the faces of the locals were full of life and laughter.On to the stilted village.Speaking with other travellers who had \"done\" the \"floating village thing\" it was clear that they went somewhere else. They described to us a heavily touristed event, jostling for space with other visitors.

I read up a lot and exchanged a lot of emails with tour operators before making the decision to go with Hidden Cambodia. From the get go, I got a lot of answers to my unending queries, and not merely the canned responses you usually get. When my group of 4 finally got there, we were met at the airport, transferred to the hotel, checked us in (!), and allowed us time to freshen up before coming back to go over our itinerary - what we want changed, preferences, suggestions to prep us for the week ahead. We had three guides, a driver and a \"nanny\"/cook traveling with us through the week we spent in Cambodia. Everyone of them were EXTREMELY knowledgeable, fun, and flexible. We were always slow in going around the sites looking at every nook and asking for stories they know about that's more about what the local people know of than what the books say for the interesting spots. We had to keep changing our time schedule to fit our whims! They let us linger as long as we want in the nice places and quick to assess if a place is not quite capturing our interest. They know the great spots where there aren't so many tourists and what time to avoid the crowd. When we're on the road, they keep pointing out great snippets but not so it wears you down. A few times, we diverted from itinerary bec we got a glimpse of something on the road - a local festival where they set up an area for dancing, stalls with street food, locals throwing powder and water at each other, a procession, a lady making some delicacies at the roadside, buying and snacking lotus from a vendor - we were the only foreigners in these places! Again and again, we kept adjusting our time table to fit as many experiences as we can. We skipped a couple of minor sites but we don't regret it at all.Best of all, HCA was involved in the communities and gave us a chance to experience the culture, not just see the sites. We stayed overnight at a local home, ate lunch at anotherhome of a local, shopped at a floating convenience store (bought mundane but interesting pottery that's not usual tourist stuff that had the people at airport security shaking their heads but smiling), played with school children (I brought with me a bunch of story books and school supplies from home to give the kids), attended an important festival at a Buddhist monastery to get blessings from the monks (had a smoke with a couple of them!)...I could go on and on :)The money I spent was well worth every penny and more! They took care of everything and it was a worry free vacation!We went on the Angkor Wat complex tour, petit circuit tour, kbal spean and surrounding areas, floating village tour, 4wd beng melea and koh ker tour.I traveled with my 16-yr old and 2 friends - in our mid to late 30's. All of us, including my daughter (never heard a complaint) enjoyed ourselves immensely.I plan to return and use Hidden Cambodia again!"

We have never ridden bikes before, but were so curious. We spent around two- two and a half hour learning how to ride, then went 70km out of Siem Reap and saw the Beng Mealea Temple... Honestly if you want a good time and to try a less dangerous adventure sport this is the thing to do!! Mr Slim our coach was AMAZING, such a great guy, the whole team did a fantastic job!!"

I lived in Cambodia for several years and I've made multiple visits to the temples of Angkor, seeing it initially from the ordinary tourist point of view and subsequently that of the locals. I've since moved abroad but it wasn't until my return this year that I was able to explore Angkor from an entirely different aspect. I happened to be in town at the same time as my friend who was looking to enjoy his Indochina trip to the fullest so after some researching, we ended up at Hidden Cambodia Adventure Tours. We opted for the full day mountain biking tour in and around the temple complex. Our experienced and knowledgeable tour guide, Art, picked up us from our hotel at around 5am and we biked to Sras Srang for the sunrise. From then on, it was from temple to temple stopping for lunch at a cantine (on us). The highlight of the tour for me was that some of the temples we biked to were appropriately \"hidden\" from the generic tourist route, literally in the jungle. Another view I thought I'd never see was Angkor from its surrounding walls. We biked up and around the main temple perimeter, following the moat. That was our last stop of the day and we headed back to our hotel afterwards. Now, this was the most grueling part of my day. At this point, I might as well didn't have legs and the fact that our hotel was on the other side of town didn't help either but we made it back in one piece and I have no regrets. Okay, so I don't remember the exact prices but I do remember that it was inclusive of your bike and a fee for the guide. You can also bring your own bike and just pay for the guide fee but in any case, the prices are reasonably worth it. Shout-out to Art and my friend, Jigar for getting me on board this amazing experience that I would happily relive. I highly recommend Hidden Cambodia and this particular activity for anyone who wants to see Angkor in an exciting and exclusive manner."

Words can't quite articulate how amazing the trip was, seeing the country from a dirt bike. I did a 3 day tour. We travelled on ancient Angkor roads, in the mountains to goat trails through the jungle. Swam in waterfalls, dodged water buffalo and chickens and randomly stopped at huts in remote villages and interacted with the local people. Paul was a wealth of information and always had something interesting to say about the way of life for the Khmer people. I would recommend this adventure to anyone. The guide was very friendly and informative. I always felt safe and secure and I would do it again. He can accommodate people with different riding levels, from families to people who have never ridden before."

They organised our hotel in Siem Reap - our tours of Angkor Wat & the surrounding areas as well as our 4wd tour to Ko Ker for an overnight stay. We took sleeping mats to one of the \"dirt poor\" villages where the people with nothing shared their smiles with us. We saw what a difference a well could make to these lovely people.In 2010 our we & some friends donated a well in memory of my wife's father.So now it's 2013 and we returned for a 3 day / 2 night 4wd trip to Bakan,Preah Vihear and of course to see our well in action which was great - the people are still doing it hard but they no longer have a 10k round trip to fetch water. I noted that one reviewer complained ( maybe commented rather than complained ) that it was expensive compared to 5 star hotels. Well - yes but when u stop & consider 5 Star hotels are cheap in Asia, he and we had the services of the wonderful guide Yousurin from 8.00am on day one until 6pm on day 3. Plus a driver, some tours have a cook as well, a 4wd vehicle and as the other reviewer points out the most remarkable experiences with local people.This time we took uniforms to a school & it was a priceless experience that we will never forget.Back in our lovely hotel with running water,flushing toilets & swimming pool we reflect again on just how lucky we are & how much we take water for granted.We will definitely be asking Hidden Cambodia ie Paul & Sheila to organise another well for us .Of course that will probably mean we have to come back - great!Btw they now use a different guest house in Preah Vihear where the food was good & we got a great nights sleep."

Not being motorbike riders, we opted for the \"4WD, driver, guide and cook\" option. The result was that our overnight trip to Koh Ker with Hidden Cambodia was the indisputable highlight of our two week stay in Cambodia.The amazing, less-travelled temples of the Koh Ker complex were a joy to explore. In most cases we were the only people there. They are well worth the visit.By late afternoon we arrived at the rustic Hidden Cambodia's own house, affectionately called The Lodge. Koh Ker village has no running water or electricity; the lodge is the only building with a generator (but only till the fuel runs out at about 9pm - then lights out). By our own normal standards the facilities are very sparse indeed (simple furniture, exposed to the elements, outside toilet and wash room). But a quick look around shows how palatial this most basic of amenities can seem. We were deeply grateful for what we had at the Lodge, and ever mindful of what our neighbours did not.Before dinner, we were escorted on foot around the village, meeting locals as they prepared for their evening meals and the night ahead (before sunset and darkness descended). What a privilege that was! Following breakfast the next day, we made our way to the local schools. This was a deeply moving and enjoyable experience which we will never forget.More than just being a tour director, Hidden Cambodia has a deep affinity with the people and community of Koh Ker. If you desire, they will even provide advice on how you can support the villages or schools you might come in contact with.We returned to Siem Reap via Beng Melea temple having been expertly tutored throughout our two day sojourn by our guide Yusarun, driver Mr D, and cook Asuhn (apologies to each of you for my spelling of your names). Thank you to each of you for sharing your own incredible stories with us.We are eternally grateful to Hidden Cambodia for the matchless insights, sensitivity and learning. We cannot recommend you highly enough. We take a very special and unqiue memory of Cambodia home with us to Australia."

So I don't know if I can say this was \"overpriced,\" but it was at least as expensive per night as a five star hotel-- and this given that one of our nights was at a farmer's house and another at a really creepy border hotel where there was a used condom in the wastepaper bin (there are no other hotels so this was the only choice). That's said, the experience was much more meaningful than a few nights in a luxury hotel."

Our tour guide and leader, Mr. Yousurun Chet was the absolute best, with expansive knowledge about the history, religion, and architecture of the Khmer empire. His knowledge and experience contextualized the temples of Angkor Wat and his enthusiasm was especially appreciated on the more \"off the beaten path\" temples at Beng Mealea, Koh Ker, and Preah Vihear. Paul and Sheila organized a custom 4-day tour for us, complete with an unforgettable camping adventure in Koh Ker. On days 1 and 2, we started by seeing the main temples of Angkor and an eco-tour of Tonle Sap Lake, complete with a homecooked meal by Ms. Alin. Ms. Alin again accompanied us as we drove into the more rural areas of northern Cambodia during days 3 and 4, providing us with the best camping meal I've ever ate, enjoyed as we watched sunset at our campsite amidst temple ruins in Koh Ker. Another highlight of the trip was Beng Mealea, where every man/woman can live out his/her Indiana Jones fantasy by exploring a lost temple in the jungle. The trip ended with a beautiful mountain-top temple, Preah Vihear. It had spectacular carving and architecture -- without the crowds of Angkor Wat and Banteay Srei.We really enjoyed the entire tour. Paul and Sheila were very flexible, helping us craft an itinerary that mixed local, more off-the-beaten path experiences with the must-see tourist stops of Angkor Wat. We felt that we got to see the history of ancient Khmer and (a bit) of the day-to-day life of rural Siem Reap. The staff at Hidden Cambodia organized the tour, transport, and hotel, allowing us to take in the beauty of Cambodia."

We were able to stop whenever I asked, and explore the scenery. We took side-roads and dirt tracks, completely untouched by other tourists and saw local shops, schools and other things that were fascinating. We even stumbled across some local fisherman diving into a lake fully clothed with their net, trying to trap some fish.The guide I travelled with spoke very good English, but was a local who'd been doing these tours for years so also very knowledgeable. The lunch and other food/drink included was all nice; there's really not much I can fault with the whole day.The customer service outside the actual tour itself was also excellent. I bought a souvenir hidden cambodia t-shirt, which I later lost in Thailand, and they went out of their way to post a replacement to the UK for me (obviously I paid for it, but still it was a lot to ask)."

Finally we decided to do it and we chose Hidden Cambodia as the team to take us. Our guide (Slim) and our sweeper (Mr Kim) really added to the experience. My friend and I are both confident riders and so they were looking out for the roads to give us the most challenge and fun while matching to our abilities. They were also a great source of information along the way as they spoke about the history and stories relating to the temples bridges and customs we were seeing along our journey. Oh and yeah they did a great job taking all our photos for us and teaching how to speak the basics of the local Khmer language. I recommend you try and say basic things in the local language as the people really respond to it - changes your experience completely. The other thing about doing Cambodia on dirt bikes is that you can get to places the tourist buses simply can't. As a result, we only saw one other tourist in the four days we were on the roads. We had the secret temples to ourselves, and we saw some amazing carvings in the rocks done by the monks. All in all this is one of the best holidays I have ever had and I absolutely recommend these guys to take you. Two thumbs up."

I got to see great ruins off the tourist path, lots of rural villages and lots of great countryside, not to mention all the fun riding. The bikes were great and took a lot of punishment. Accommodation and food were all good. The guides were really competent and friendly. At the end of it I wished I had booked a tour that was a couple of days longer."

The scenery was great and it was a pleasant change to be walking out and about in the countryside, rather than seeing it whiz by on a bus or car. The hike takes in several local attractions, including a beautiful waterful, a bat cave, a large budhha statue, local monks, and some other carvings. Our guide, Paul, was very friendly, enthusiastic and knowledgeable. The hike was of low to moderate intensity - there's a reasonable amount of ground to cover but it's mostly pretty flat. Our only gripe was that I suspect the tour company is more geared towards dirt bike riders (they follow the same track) rather than hikers, and the cost was somehwat high relative to other excursions we went on. We were only a group of two, so probably the cost would be reduced for larger groups. All in all, a recommended experience."

One of our last activities was a day trip by motorcycle and 4WD to some temples further out of Siem Reap. Paul Hay, the owner of Hidden Cambodia, met us that morning to see us off on our trip. He's a good guy, and knew exactly what we wanted before I even told him. We wanted to avoid the other tourists, experience the countryside, see some beautiful temples, and do it together despite not traveling together. My wife doesn't ride a motorcycle, and I didn't feel comfortable riding with her on the back of my bike. She traveled separately in a 4WD with a guide, driver, and a cook.The route was well-planned and easy for someone like me without off-road experience. I had to keep my wits about me for dogs and other animals, but otherwise, it was smooth sailing with my guide leading the way on his bike. We stopped periodically to rehydrate, look at the scenery, and recover from the heat. The bike I rode definitely saw some miles over the years, but I never had a problem with it.The cook that came along in the 4WD made an excellent lunch. We stopped at a great spot near some ancient carvings, and the guide that was riding with my wife in the 4WD was engaging and funny. We had a great time laughing and eating while the a freak rain shower poured down around us.I highly recommend this group to anyone who wants to visit the lesser known parts of Cambodia and miss out on all the tourists."

I had two gides, one of them was in training. The bike was somewhat in less good state. The gears didn't work perfect. I had to pay extra for boots. After a few weeks I did a dirtbike tour in sihanoukville. That bike was in better shape. And it was cheaper. Overall I can say that the tour was great in siem reap. The gides were great. The bike was not in excellent shape and it was rather expensive. But a fine tour!"

The accomodation, Angkor Wat complex, jungle trekking, village visits & dirt biking to Beng Melea were all well planned. Though exhausting for a newbie adventurer like me, I have no regrets at all. Hidden Cambodia made all the trips great with excellent tour guides. With no license or biking experience, Paul & Mr Kin made it possible for me to ride a cute 125cc bike! :o) When I got too tired after 2 hours, I became a pillion of Mr Kin & he is super patient & experience. What did I enjoyed most? When he showed off his biking skills through the bumpy roads & humps.....WEEEEEEE!!!!!!! The team took care of us from the moment they pick us up from the airport till the day they sent us off at the same airport. I would recommend Hidden Cambodia to anyone who wants a lifetime memorable adventure!"

            "review": "Once was not enough!. In December 2011 our family returned for a second time to Siem Reap, for a once in a lifetime trip through the Cambodian countryside with Hidden Cambodia Adventure Tours.Our first trip was in 2009 when we took a magical day trip to Koh Ker and Beng Melea with a home cooked lunch at Paul's home in Koh Ker. My boys were 5 and 13 at the time and loved it. Part of our trip included dropping off donated water filters to families who were drinking dirty ground water. Also we checked on a few wells that Hidden Cambodia built with past guests and dropped off a large bag of rice to an elderly Grandma that was looking after her orphaned grandkids. We were able to meet with so many local people and were touched by the kind spirit and good feeling of the Cambodian people. My youngest son enjoyed playing with the friendly kids we came across. Play seems like a universal language at that age! My older son was inspired to come home and raise enough donations to build a well like the one we had seen.For our trip back we wanted to take an overland trip through the countryside and see some of the remote and amazing temples we had heard about during the first trip. We felt totally comfortable in the hands of Sheila and Paul. Paul, his guides, and drivers literally know the countryside like the back of their hands. On our first day in Siem Reap, we left my 7 year old with a sweet Khmer babysitter at the Sofitel and myself, my husband, and my 14 year old son went to Paul and Sheila's house to do a half day of dirt bike riding! We suited up in protective gear and then headed out to our \"practice area\" for a couple hours of lessons and practice riding. My 14 year old had never been on a motorcycle before and was thrilled. Once we were deemed \"acceptable riders\" we took off into the countryside with Mr. Slim leading our group. It was a very cool day for a middle aged American Mom, like myself, to be barreling down a red dirt trail on a big powerful 250cc dirt bike trying to avoid water buffalo, chickens, and waving at the cute kids who smiled and waved as we went by. Our guides took excellent care of us and made sure we were safe. I would recommend a half day or day trip on the dirt bikes to anyone who visits Siem Reap and would like to do something really FUN and who would like to head out into the countryside to see the \"real Cambodia\".The next morning we launched off on our adventure! With two Landcruiser's carrying our gear, Paul, Mr. Slim, Mr. Dee, and our family we set out on our adventure. The first day we headed to the hard to reach location of Prasat Bakan. It was such an adventure to travel on the red dirt oxcart roads and to even make our own road sometime. We were able to camp right at the temple at Bakan. It was the most magical and amazing evening. Paul hired two local soldiers, wearing flip flops, and toting AK-47's to provide security. Also we invited the two sons of the local Head of Commune (like the Mayor I guess) to camp with us. We were the only ones at the huge amazing old temple complex. Wow. Paul, Mr. Slim, and Mr. Dee cooked up the most delicious barbeque over a huge roaring bonfire. As the sun went down our eclectic group enjoyed ribs, beef, grilled veggies, fresh french bread, lots and lots of cold Angkor Beer, and laughter and stories around the campfire. In the middle of the night I stepped outside my tent and was amazed by starry sky unmarred by any lights for hundreds of kilometers around. Wow.The next day we broke down camp, visited some nearby temples and continued our journey to Khampong Sralo on the Mekong River. Near the little town is a huge waterfall. We had to hike the last couple of km's to get to it but we were the only ones there. It was grand on the scale of Niagra Falls but totally remote and natural and we had it all to ourselves. Wow. We spent the night at a clean guesthouse on the Mekong River and had a lovely dinner on the deck overlooking the water. The next morning we took a wooden boat, complete with a hammock and driver who looked like an extra from Apocalypse Now, across the Mekong to a market in Laos. Upon our return Paul found us some motor bikes to rent and we explored the area. We stopped at the local school and chatted with the English speaking principal and he took us to a classroom with kids the same age as my oldest son. We were invited in and spent some time talking with them. The next day we traveled to Sre Eim which is a bustling military town outside near Preah Vihear temple. We had a fine dinner, shopped in the markets, and even got my 7 year old a real Cambodian army outfit to wear to Preah Vihear the next day. The next morning we went to Preah Vihear and it was even better than I had hoped it would be. The temple is breathtaking. Currently it is occupied by probably thousands of soldiers and their families. Paul's brother is one of the leaders there. I was very troubled by what is going on at Preah Vihear. I totally support the Cambodian's and hope that they can prevent Thailand from taking the temple or continuing to damage it with firearms. It is a terrible thing. You can see bullet marks and bomb craters from the last time Thailand bombarded the temple and killed many Cambodian soldiers in the process. I would recommend going to Preah Vihear to anyone but it is very important to go with someone like Paul. Because his brother is there and is only a cell phone call away, we knew it was a safe time to visit. I wouldn't have gone otherwise.After Preah Vihear we continued to Samrong, stopped for sightseeing along the way, and finally back to Siem Reap. We were able to visit a silk works that employs handicapped workers and gives them a respectable way to make a good living. The products were so beautiful and I had to buy several to bring back. We also stopped at Anlong Veng. Importantly we spent an afternoon at Banteay Chhmar. Paul found motorbikes for us to rent here too and we enlisted a local guide to take us around and into the temple. Within the depths of one of the quiet hidden temples he spun tales of the local legends of the spirits of the temples sending shivers down our spines. This was an especially magical stop. We did so many other side trips and stops I can't list them all or this review would be much too long!I can't say enough about Paul and how well he took care of us. He and Sheila treated us like friends who were in town for a visit. Paul is so friendly and charismatic. We spent a lot of time listening to his fun stories and just talking about most anything. He is a people-person and everywhere we went we stopped to talk to the local folk. He was especially kind to my young sons. He decided my 7 year old should have a respectable sling shot like all the Khmer boys his age. So on one of our stops he was able to find a friendly local who sold us his own hand carved sling shot. Although Mr. Slim encouraged him to use it get us a chicken for dinner this, thankfully never came to fruition. A different time he dared my son to ride a water buffalo. So we stopped at a traditional Khmer house along the road that had some water buffalo milling about. He asked the lady living there if my son could ride one of her water buffalo. A small crowd gathered around to see the little foreign boy try to ride the big water buffalo who wanted nothing to do with this exercise. Then the lady put her little Khmer boy on the back of the water buffalo and it calmly just let him ride. The crowd was laughing hysterically at the buffalo's preference for the Khmer boy and distaste for foreign boys! An adventure with Paul on the back roads of Cambodia will ensure that you come home with many special memories just like that one."

No question that the most magic part was the motocross adventure though the jungle. We went places no tourists go, seeing people living the way they have for 1000 years. Hearing us coming down the trail, the little kids would run from their huts to the trail to wave at us with such animated expressions, and when you looked them in the eye or waved to them they broke into a frenzy of joy. It felt like a parade to celebrate our visit to Cambodia. I\u2019ll never forget the feelings of importance and how they charmed us. The ride was more challenging than I expected with branches above and mud holes below to navigate. Connor ditched twice in the mud. Cool sights and temples along the route and then a night in the jungle with so many noises you could hardly sleep. Food was great because everything is fresh. No power in the jungle for refrigeration so they pick your vegetables and slaughter your food on the spot. The motocross tour was by http://www.hiddencambodia.com. We let them arrange the last few days of our trip. While the motocross was high adventure and kind of risky, the rest of their work was full of luxuries and conveniences that we could have done without in retrospect (dinner show, high end lunches and dinners, taxi and guides to everything, hoity toity hotels etc.. That said, they could put together a whole itinerary to your specifications."

Whether you or your group are looking for Cultural, Adventure (4WD, dirt bike , trekking & walking), Eco- tourism , Humanitarian or a Relaxing Holiday HCAT can provide tailor made tours and accommodation packages that are practical, well supported and well managed. With a free day in Siem Reap (while my partner enjoyed the swimming pool, good food and a massage) I booked a a dirt bike trip to Beng Melea with HCAT. I had heard that HCAT was something special but still I was very impressed. The trip itself was amazing, following old Angkor roads, visiting villages along the way, and visiting Beng Melea itself, but the careful organisation and planning by HCAT was even more impressive. The director and destination manage of HCAT (Paul and Sheila) offer vast local knowledge, cultural sensitivity, business acumen and practical operational skill to deliver a tourist package tailored to particular needs and interests. Give them a call!"

We are a family of five with three teenagers and our brief to Sheila was to avoid the tourists, see real Kymer life, food. markets and be a bit adventurous. We joined Paul and a driver in a comfortable minibus for five days ranging from swimming in beautiful rivers and waterfalls to living with a family in their river home on stilts (this is a must do), visiting the very local market by boat, visiting numerous little visited temples, staying in a remote village in a typical village house and going up to the Thai border to see Preah Vihear which is stunning and we shared it with two other tourists and about 200 army (this will change when the border opens). We had some excitement as it was the rainy season and we ended up getting to and from the remote village in an ox cart. The kids loved that. The only disappointing part was the visit to the Thai border crossing which consisted of two casinos and not much else. Paul was a great host and fixer and he could offer a warts and all description of Kymer life which gave us a good insight into Cambodia. Yes there are mosquitos but going in the rainy season meant it was less busy and actually it did not rain that much. Prior to our adventure with Hidden Cambodia we stayed in Siem Riep and had a few days with the tourists but the Temples are extraordinary. In Siem Riep it is worth wearing long trousers as my wife did contract Dengue Fever there which is very rare but evidently possible (and not as bad as it sounds) but we still loved the country and the Kymer people and the kids had a really positive and educational experience."

Wasn't planning a dirt bike tour in Cambodia when I booked my trip but chanced upon this company here in Trip Advisor while researching what to do in Siem Reap. I am so happy w/ my experience I highly recommend them. The owners, Paul & Sheila, ensured all my expectations were met. They were also very specific in their e-mails as to the activities & the cost for each item so definitely no unpleasant surprises.I paid a small portion of the 2 day tour through pay pal prior to arrival & paid the rest in cash to Mr. Paul upon check in at my hotel. A Toyota Camry w/ driver & tour guide promptly showed up the following morning to take us to Angkor Wat & the surrounding temples. Although I already read up on the history & info of the sites, I was very impressed w/ the tour guide's passion & eagerness to answer our questions. Added bonus to hiring a private guide is that they know the best spots where to take pictures:). For lunch Sheila gave me a choice of a homecooked authentic Cambodian meal or a nearby restaurant. I of course chose to eat at their house & remember wishing my 16 yr old daughter could cook as good as their 16 yr old. Although not included in the itinerary, our tour guide volunteered to take us to the night market & pub street that evening. Saved me quite a bit of money because prices were much lower compared to the tourist shops in the temples.The second day was the dirt bike tour to Beng Malea a temple still overgrown by the jungle about 60+ km from Siem Reap. Mr. Paul & I were on dirt bikes while my 19 yr old daughter rode on a 4WD w/ a guide & a cook who prepared a very delicious lunch for us. I haven't actively rode on a dirt bike for more than 20 yrs & Mr. Paul was careful to give me options on how much challenge I was willing to take on. Let's just say I had a blast. There were potholes galore, heavy rain, mud, a flat tire, shared the backroads w/ water buffaloes which all contributed to a very exciting ride. I did get a lot of stares from the locals, it is not often they see a middle-aged female on a 250 dirt bike. BTW helmet, elbows & knee pads were provided.There is so much more to the experience than what I can fit in this review. I do feel that I want to go back & book another tour w/ them. Thanks again Paul & Sheila, Mr. Lam & Mr. Yam & I apologize I can't remember everyone's names but I do hope to see you again someday soon."

You can see the ruins of old architectures, though several are still functional and inhabited by many monks. But if you select Hidden Cambodia tours with dirt bikes, you would be overwhelmed with experiences. For the first thing, biking would be giving you opportunity to get into adventures and for the second you would be getting closer to rural lives of the Cambodians. They are poor, no doubt about it but you would be impressed with their hospitability and smiling faces. In one word, if you wish to explore real Cambodia, Hidden Cambodia adventure tours are always recommended."

I've never been one for touring in any organised way so I was wary of having a guide and any kind of itenerary, but from the moment I first took off from Hidden Cambodia's office on a SL230 I felt like I was riding with a friend. Just me (thirty something female) and my guide, Lis, with his amazing knowledge of his country and it's culture. I have around 10 years road riding experience but had never even sat on a dirt bike before. This wasn't a problem for the HC team, with Lis taking it easy to begin with before we were up to speed. He helped me out when I needed it and taught me a thing or two about dirt bike riding.I rode an SL230 through the coutryside for three days and then decided I needed a challenge and tacked on an extra day off-roading on an XR250. This was easily organised by HC at the last minute.There were one or two problems with the bike but these were easily fixed by Lis on the road. There was also a small mistake in the payment which was immediately fixed by Sheila in the office with no hassles at all. Great communication, good value for money and a unique experience.

The tour guides he had spoke English very well and had a wealth of knowledge to go with every site we saw. The bikes ran good and any problems that arose was quickly fixed by them in no time. I would recomend this group to anyone who is looking for a unique experience outside the regular tourist stops."

After riding a motorcycle many thousands of miles through several different countries and states without ever hiring a guide I was very hesitant at first to pay someone to show me the way around Cambodia. All I really wanted was a map and a bike and to be left alone. However after the first 30 seconds I realized that Hidden Cambodia was something much different then what I expected. They are not some fly by-night operation that was able to acquire a couple of grey market dirt bikes. Nope they are in fact a very professionally run outfit that hires a few local motorcycle enthusiasts who thrive on gasoline and showing foreigners like me some of the best roads Cambodia has to offer. My guide (Seng) really knew his way around the area. He never needed a map and thus we were able to keep our pace up as we sliced through the jungle. He knew the good places to eat, the cool places to see and most importantly, he knew how to ride. At no time did I feel like I was riding with a tour group or some slacker noob. It always felt like I was out riding with one of my buddies on a new local trail. Seng even took some time to help me improve my sand riding skills and was right there to help me up when I dumped the bike in the loose stuff. During all this my wife and our friend were on a separate jungle hike tour with Hidden Cambodia. The pictures they took and stories they told were right on par with my day. Professional guides, safe drivers, good food and at the end of it all they even had a couple of cold beers waiting for us back at the shop. Hidden Cambodia is a real first class outfit. Highly recommended"

I discovered the dirt bike tour after arriving in Siem Reap and was unsure about my ability on the bike. I had not been on a dirt bike for several years.. Paul took me on an hour evaluation ride (reasonably priced) and I was hooked. The following day we were off and ripping around the country side. I can't say enough about our Tour Leader Leem and the Sweeper/Mechanic Slim. They were professional and very personable. Our group traveled the rural country side taking in the charm of the local Cambodian Villages, the awe of the many different temple sites, and the thrill of some challenging biking. You can choose the degree of difficulty you want to experience biking and the sites you want to take in. The nightly accomodations were in small rural villages and as a fussy eater, I was very happy with the meals. This was a great experience both physically and culturally. To top it all off, Hidden Cambodia gives back to the local communities by providing a number of water wells.Roger"

Hidden Cambodia was great - guides, drivers were informative, accomodating, helpful, friendly, all with their own personal story to tell. We got to see places and people whose daily lives were yet to be inundated with tourists. It was the real Cambodia:Inspiring - the work being done for people to become more self-sufficient Haunting - the Killing Fields' graves that were covered in butterfliesJoyful - the kids - the responsibilities that they bear with smiles on their facesHeart-warming - the sense of community in the fishing villagesFrightening to think there are 3 - 5 million undetonated landminesAwe-some - the temples, Angkor WatHidden Cambodia was with us all the time. They provided my husband and I with the most adventurous, awe inspiring, eye opening, experience ever! We have little doubt now that our trip, had it been without Hidden Cambodian, would not have even been half as good as it was. Despite the stomach bug from eating something I shouldn't have and the cold I brought with us, the adventure raised in us every kind of emotion and I have no doubt we are better people for it. We cannot wait to hang our two hammocks we bought in the trees in our NZ home.And for you Kiwis out there, we visited S21 (torture prison) and you may be interested to know the NZ documentary on the New Zealander Kerry Hamill who died in S21 will apparently show later this year (Titled 'Brother Number One'.)After much travel in Asia, it was the best trip ever. My husband and son would like to go back to do the dirt bike adventure and I'd still love to see the bird sanctuary on Tonle Sap Lake. Who knows?"

We chose Hidden Cambodia because we knew getting out to Tonle Sap would be interesting and we wanted to avoid the usual quick tourist village version. We were taken to Kampong Khleang, traveled on a small but comfortable boat out toward other floating villages, had lunch in a floating house, visited an active village temple, inspected the fish pond, rice wine making, and other activities as a local farmhouse, even met the guide's parents at their home. It was well worth the price to have a private tour of this very exciting part of Cambodia, able to stop wherever looked interesting, and have a full and informative conversation with our guide. An extra plus was our stop at Beng Melea Temple, which few people see -- very interesting contrast to the main Angkor temples."

I didn't go with all of them, I ended up booking a 4 day 4wd trip to Beng Mealea, Koh Ker, Preah Vihear and Anlong Veng and a Kampong Kleang day tripA month before we left I decided to organise our Angkor guides through Hidden too, as well as a Kulen Mountain day trip and they were happy to obligeWe paid a deposit via Paypal, and the remainder in cash on arrival in Siem Reap without problemsWhat really sets Hidden Cambodia apart are their guides, who made our trip amazing and gave us an amazing cultural experience - they were happy to take us to 'local' places, eat local food (including helping us find crickets, spiders etc etc) and indulge our efforts to learn some Khmer during our trip! Angkor (two days): we did the petit circuit and Angkor Thom on the first day - and this was a long day, the second day we went to Banteay Srei, Kbal Spean and Angkor WatI definitely suggest Kbal Spean as a great way to shake it up a bit - the jungle scenery helps battle temple fatigue, which DOES set inOn these two days, lunch was in package tourist type restaurants and we HATED the food - however this is not Hidden's fault, as there are no other options in the Angkor complexIt would have also been nice to have the same guide for the two days - however we loved both the guides we had - Lohm (?sp) and Som (Sarat)Kulen Mountain: was a great 4wd trip with a guide, driver and cook - definitely worth seeing, a nice relaxing day - had an excellent lunch by the waterfalls, got blessed by a monk on the mountain, and went for a swimOur 4wd trip was a highlight and Preah Vihear was our favourite temple in Cambodia, our guide (Lohm) and driver (Slim) were fantastic - friendly and good fun... we ate in local restaurants, and the guys were happy to introduce us to new food, and explain things... they were also very adaptive, changing the schedule to make sure we were enjoying ourselves, and not rushing / tired, but we still did everything that we were slated to do... doing the four day trip gave us a bit more time to fit everything in, and I'm glad we didn't go for the three day option Kampong Kleang: the only disappointment on our trip, we were supposed to be picked up at 9am, but no one arrived - we rang Hidden 15 mins later, and there had been a mixup and nothing was organised - but to their credit, 30 minutes later everything was organised and we were on our way!Also a great trip, nice time out on a boat in the middle of the Tonle Sap, observing life on the lake, followed by an excellent packed lunch on the balcony of a stilted house Hidden Cambodia is on the expensive side (for Cambodia, not by Western standards) but the cultural experience we had was priceless... their guides really are fantastic!You can go cheap, have a haphazard trip with 5 million other tourists, and be pushed through the usual sites - or you can have an amazing Cambodian experienceWould definitely use them again"

After conversing with Hidden Cambodia through emails, and not being entirely sure I wanted to do a day tour at all, I waited until I was in Cambodia to actually book a trip with them.I worked with Paul in arranging it, and frankly, I'm surprised by a previous review that found him pushy. I found him flexible, accomodating, and not remotely pushy, even after telling him that I had 10 days in Siem Reap and no definitive plans. After confirming via phone that I wanted to book a day trip, Paul met me at my hotel, collected my money, checked on my preferences for what I like in a guide, different route options, and food for lunch.After having been to Cambodia, I now see that you can book tours to the same places for cheaper, as tour services there are overly abundant, however, I just used Hidden Cambodia for these two trips that were a bit farther removed. Looking back, I think the money was well spent, as my best moments were with Hidden Cambodia. If you want to see tourist areas, but maybe go further or deeper than the average tourist, or have a more local experience, then this company makes it safe and approachable.Both my guides were great, spoke perfect English, and were highly approachable. They were constantly checking in with me to see what I liked, and would ammend the schedule to show me something they thought I would like based on those preferences, even if it meant unscheduled sticky rice stops paid for by them. On both my trips, I saw very little tourists, but when I did, they asked who I was touring with, as I think they were a bit jealous of cool stuff we were doing. For example, I had lunch on a Cambodian family's porch in a stilted house overlooking the river, I got blessed by a monk on Kulen Mountain, and not to mention my guide took countless pictures of me, recognizing that I was a solo traveler and thus far had had none of myself.Overall, I would do it again in a heartbeat. They were great, and the extra money was well spent."

Having organised a 14 day tour with Tucan Travel in Vietnam, I wanted to see Angkor Wat and to do something off the beaten track that would give me a view of real life in the Cambodian countryside. I found HCAT online and I liked that they are faciitating donations and helping rural communities to build wells. I contacted Sheila initially via email and received a sample of possible itineraries for my trip. After some correspondence, I decided on the 1-day Angkor Wat tour followed by 4 day trip to Beng Melea, Koh Ker, Priha Vihear and Anglong Ven. The guided tour through Angkor Wat was good and included a fantastic lunch. Though HCAT usually take dirt bike tours, I asked for a smaller bike and they offered for me to ride a \"local\" bike - a 125 Honda which was perfect for me! I decided to book my own flight, but they organised my hotel, transfers from the airport, on the bike trip all my meals, accommodation and fuel were included, making it a very hassle free experience for me. My guide Mr Liss was very knowledgable and happy for us to take our time and stop to take lots of photographs. Even in remote areas, there were hotels with air-conditioning! The countryside was beautiful, and even though some of the roads were dirt, we just took our time and it was great! I thought it was very nice that Paul phoned each night to see how we were. Our route took us past several of the wells that have been donated by Hidden Cambodia customers. HCAT have also offered some support for my friend Helen's project to provide wheelchairs (www.joinhelen.com). At my request, HCAT also amended my itinerary to include the Angkor Wat balloon, the elephant ride, the Siem Reap shooting range and the Silk Farm. I would definitely recommend the experience to potential travellers. Some of my photos are on Facebook here: http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=20672&id=100000663385393&l=31d648e1c3"

I wanted to do some bicycle touring to the Angkor Wat temple complex outside Siem Reap, Cambodia, and contacted Hidden Cambodia to make arrangements. They were responsive, and even eager to sell me lots of tours I had not requested. I felt the pressure of the hard sell before I even met the main owner, Paul. When he met me in person, it became clear to me that he did not focus on bicycling tours-- their main business is motorcycles. Fair enough. I decided on a one-day tour; I kept saying I wanted a half-day tour, but he kept resisting and would not actually plan a route for a half-day. In the end, I decided to go with his planned route and see what happened.The next day a great guide, Yoursuun, met me with two bikes. Both bikes were in terrible shape. Mine in particular had a broken rear derailleur cable (no shifting on the back was possible), it was filthy dirty (even the frame had lots of caked mud on it), and there was a bike bottle in the cage that had a little bit of used water in it. Yuck! There were no tools in sight-- no tubes, pump, patch kit, multi-tool for any repairs, nothing. For an 8-hour bike ride in the country, this is a bad idea. To compare, I rode with Bali Trailblazers in Bali, and they had everything-- clean, well-maintained bikes, tools, mechanical knowledge, snacks, water-- everything one would need for an all-day ride.We spent the first hour of my tour at a Cambodian bike shop while my bike was repaired. I actually did not mind this, as the guide and I talked a lot about Cambodian history and culture, about which he was very knowledgeable. Finally we got going and had a lovely day. Because the bike saddles were so old and not in good condition, both the guide and I had some major saddle soreness by late in the day (I ride 3--4 times a week and am pretty hardened to this). When I received email from this company after my trip, I responded, telling Sheila (the other owner) my story about the bad bike condition, and also asked her for some information. No one has responded to me since (it has been about 3 weeks). I consider this pretty unprofessional. moral of the story: go with your instinct when dealing with tour companies. This one seemed dicey, and it was. The guides they use are wonderful, but their selling tactics and the horrendous quality of their bikes suggests that one should avoid them."

What drew me to the organisation was great community work they do in the villages, and the excellent email communication with Sheila.

It was fabulous!Our first contact with Youserin at Siem Reap airport, and Paul whisking out a SIM card for Grace's mobile phone, all within an hour of us arriving at Siem Reap gave us a great start to the holiday. The tours were all so well organised. Camping in the shadows of Beng Mealea Temple was just magical. The homestay at Kor Ker was lovely. We could have stayed there a week! It was just so comfortable, and the food prepared was delicious! The staff who helped us were just all so wonderful. We had a great time with them!The tour of the Angkor temples with Youserin was wonderful. WONDERFUL!! He is everything a dream tour guide should be and more. We have experienced a few tour guides in our years of travels, and Youserin is by far the best, and the best by miles. His immense knowledge, his attention to our safety and comfort, and his professionalism is highly commendable. He insisted on carrying our backpacks when he thought we looked tired, made sure we had enough water, and kept an eye on tour daughters as we all clamoured up and down the temples and mountains. He knew when we were tired, made us sit for a quick break in the shade, and then entertained us with a story from a legend, or about one of the Kings. He was tireless! He made it all seem like he was having fun too, and was just so enthusiastic in telling us all this information. It made the atmosphere of our little group light and happy, despite how exhausted we all were especially towards the end of the day. We had all read up quickly on the history of the Angkor temples, and the Ramayana before our departure, but did not quite truly understand it all. Youserin brought it all together and to life for us. His detailed explanations really made and increased our experience of the temples. He also explained the culture and the way-of-life of the locals. Visiting the villages of Koh Ker and Kampong Kleang was a great experience too. Youserin would talk to the locals, and then translate for us, giving us a true and better insight into their lives.We have been back home for 7 months, and have still not stopped talking about our holiday in Cambodia. The attention that Sheila and Paul give to each and every tiny detail of the tour is remarkable. I have and will continue to recommend Hidden Cambodia most highly to anyone visiting Cambodia."

Riding on tracks through rice paddies and grass lands and jungle was amazing, and stopping in small villages along the way for a drink and meeting the locals was unforgettable. One of the best bits was the kids at most houses coming out of their yards to wave as we went by. To top off the great riding was the stop at Beng Melea, which were my favorite ruins of all. They are more overgrown with trees than the others and there were less tourists. Such a beautiful place that you really must go see if u're in Siem Reap.

We also went to the lake and took a boat out to the floating village and went up to the waterfalls at Phnom Kulen and visited Wat Po. Hidden Cambodia arranged picninc lunches for us which were great.

Actually I ate better there than at the Siem Reap posh restaurants (including The Nest).Be warned however that in the hot season, it is\u2026 hot\u2026 really hot\u2026 And you will have some long periods during the day where you stay in a house without any good fan or airco. They brought plenty of water, but that is not enough. You should always bring with you some dehydrating powder \u2013 unfortunately I had it planned, but due to some silly mis-communication it remained in Siem Reap. The fact that I drank in a few minutes one liter of fruit juice after my trip is good evidence of my state of de-hydration.I was a bit disappointed with the house where we sleep. To be clear, I have no trouble with limited facilities, shower with bucket, limited power and fan, no airco\u2026.. and the village life, with the roosters waking up at 4 am and the whole village following at 5 am, is part of the experience. But what is annoying is the clear impression that the tenant of the house is happy to cash our money without doing any effort to clean up the plastic littering the house and garden, or keeping it a bit tidy. There was also only one deck chair, so you must decide with your partner who sit back and relax during the long afternoons. The guides do their best to make us comfortable, but the whole village seems to suffer from apathy, and there is garbage all over the place (which is unfortunately the common fate of the whole country). But let us be clear: the experience of visiting the villages, the contact with the people, which has been thoroughly described in the previous reviews, is mind blowing."

I spent two days on tour with Hidden Cambodia Adventure Tours dirt biking from Siem Reap, staying in Koh Ker overnight and then riding back through the jungle the next day in March 2010. The biking experience was fantastic - the route was chosen for me and tailored over the course of the trip as well, and my guide Lise was really helpful too. Depending on your preference you can focus on the biking or spend more time looking at temples - I wanted to focus my energy on biking so didn't spent too much time looking at temples but there was lots of opportunities to visit some of the more remote sites. I would say that the accommodation I stayed in only had electricity on a generator for some of the evening and no running water - so if accommodation is important to you it's worth discussing this with them first. I was so tired out I slept pretty well even without air-con. It was a great opportunity to get out into the more rural areas of Cambodia too. Highly recommended!"

They kept us well stocked with cold water at all times. These were all arranged before we left the UK with a 30% payment and the balance one we arrived (in cash).Koh Ker. Not many tourists go this far north and you get the feeling that you are alone exploring the temple ruins. We managed to see rural villages and spent time donating water filters. Lunch was great. We even had our own cook that prepared it \u2013 \u201cLin, it was amazing food\u201d. On the way back to Siem Reap we managed to squeeze in Benh Melea. Big thanks to the guides as this meant they had a long day. On this trip you do get a sense for rural Cambodia.Banteay Serai & Kbal Spean. Banteay Serai is small and can feel a little crowded. We didn\u2019t leave the hotel until 8am on that day (our choice) the guide and driver were willing to do 7am start. However it is nice to see, you just have to start early or plan around the crowds. Then on to Kbal Spean. This is a nice walk about 1.5 miles each way and steep in places. This is a tricky walk if you have any physical problems. Its coming back down, especially if you have knee problems. If you don't do this you won't miss much. Lunch at a local restaurant was nice with service a little quick. At one point we ended up with 3 course on the table at once. It isn\u2019t a problem you just have to smile at this and tuck in.And of course we did Angkor. The guide was very good. She worked around what we were interested in. Just the right level of detail, time to ourselves to have a quick explore and could think on her feet to avoid the main tour groups. This was a 5.15am start for sunrise, worth seeing and then getting a good head start on the tour groups while it is still cool.Please ask about Hidden Cambodia\u2019s humanitarian work \u2013 Clean water projects and see if you can help with a donation. Normally people get a few water filters at $15 each and you drop this into a family as part of the tour. Also money in raised to build wells.Thanks guys we had a great time with you"

I wish we had more time to spend in Cambodia so we could really take advantage of the off-the-beaten path adventures that Sheila and Paul offer. We booked a 4WD day-trip and HIdden Cambodia was willing to customize as we wished. We opted to spent the day at Koh Ker with a trip to a nearby village to distribute school supplies, sleeping mats and water filters. Sheila and Paul offer a wonderful and unique opportunity to give back to local communities and villages while experiencing history and learning about an incredible country. While hard to see the poverty, it was amazing to see the spirit of the people and know that you are really having an impact. Our guide (Yousroeun), driver (Mr. Slim) and cook (So Linn) were fabulous and we had a great time exploring the countryside with them! The stop at Beng Melea on the way home isn't to be missed...what an amazing place. Sheila and Paul's love for Cambodia is evident through their desire to show visitors the real Cambodia. I fell in love with the country and can't wait to spend more time with Hidden Cambodia!"

From the moment we arrived we were looked after and didn't have to worry about a thing. Hotel accommodation was very good (we had a pool and it included breakfast). Our guides who took us to the temples and also to the overnight adventure to Koh Ker were amazing. They were very friendly, knew the area and the culture well and were really passionate about explaining their culture, the history of the sites and all about life in Cambodia to us. I was so so so impressed with the food as well. As it was an all inclusive tour I wasn't expecting too much from the food, but it was amazing. We dined at really nice restaurants for lunches and dinners and when we went for the overnight trip to the village of Koh Ker we had our own cook with us who cooked delicious khymer food! The experience of meeting real people and visiting the village of Koh Ker was life changing. It was so moving to meet these people and to see how they live and the great stuff work that HC are doing in these villages.If anything all I can say is that no other tour would have cut it. This had everything in it and the best thing was that they were flexible the whole time, dependent on what you felt like doing. I had a fabulous, life changing experience with Hidden Cambodia, don't bother going with anyone else!"

I have nothing but good things to say about the staff at Hidden Cambodia, both in their ability to create once-in-a-lifetime vacations, and in their great humanitarian efforts. I was only in the country for a few days, but they helped make the trip worth taking by showing me a side of Cambodia that I wouldn't have been able to see on the normal tourist trail. In one day they taught me how to ride a dirtbike from scratch (I had never been on a motorcycle of any kind before), and then took me out by that dirtbike too a remote temple where Lis (my knowledgeable guide) told me more about the history of the country. Riding back through the small, impoverished villages of Cambodia I was very touched by the poverty, yet great kindness, of the people there. So when we got back to the home base I was also very moved by the stories Sheila and Paul (the leaders of Hidden Cambodia) told me about their humanitarian efforts in the region: building wells for drinking water in villages that have none, and their new project building solar panels for villages with no electricity. I was moved enough to work with them to donate a well of my own, and I consider it one of the best things I've done. If you are in the Siem Reap area and have a day or two to spend getting to see the \"real\" Cambodia, and to help out with a good cause, I cannot recommend the people at Hidden Cambodia enough."

The night we spent camping outside a jungle-covered temple was truly magical, as was the day spent traveling through a floating fishing village. The home-cooked meals were delicious and the van comfortable and spacious . But perhaps what impressed us the most was the genuine warmth and wisdom of our guide, Liss. As he shared his stories of his childhood under Pol Pot, and introduced us to the challenges and beauty of Cambodia today, we felt privileged to be given a window to one of the most fascinating spots in the world. Our only regret is that we didn\u2019t have enough time to do any of their dirt bike tours.

Sheila and Paul met us as scheduled with our detailed and well planned itinerary. Our English speaking guide, Lis, and driver Slim, were knowledgeable, entertaining, and all around fun.First overnight was in koh ker. HC provided unparalleled access to not only the temple, but also the village where they own a rustic house. Because of HC's prior efforts in the area we were well received and able to view a \"real\" Cambodia village (e.g. a village not entirely fueled by tourism).Second overnight was in prey vihear, where Lis was a real sport and climbed the 800 meter \"old trail\" to the temple with us. Thankfully he met a few army pals on the top and we were able to hitch a ride down the mountain on the back of two scooters. Without Lis' local knowledge and friends it'd have been a long, long night hiking back down.Third overnight was in Along Veng. Sheila, Paul, and all of their guides have a genuine interest in Khmer Rouge history. If you are not interested in this skip Along Veng as the roads are rough and the town so-so. (It would make an excellent dirt bike ride however).Four day: dirt biking. Definitely the way to travel in Cambodia despite the ever increasing number of paved roads.HC is a bit expensive but they look after all the details in a way other tour operators in developing countries do not...in my opinion, a few extra bucks goes a lonng way when you have just traveled 10k miles too see a sountry. To be clear though, you are not paying for luxury. You are paying for a smooth trip with guides that know that about which they are talking."

They took us by back routes, where (and just as importantly, when) the crowds were thinnest; and they took us to the bits that mattered most, explaining their significance brilliantly, in what almost became a sort of narrative, so that I left their company thinking that I'd begun, at least, to understand something fantastically rich.

Having spent 4 months travelling through Russia, Mongolia, China, Japan, Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia, I can Honestly say this was the whole highlight of the trip. HIdden Cambodia.com brought us to destinations people only dream of when thinking of temples in a jungle. We booked a 2 day trip to Koh Ker, an Angkorian site in northern Cambodia, 100 km northeast of Angkor itself. The trip itself was comforable in a big 4X4 and when we arrived at Koh Ker, we were the only people at the temples except for the security guard asleep outside on his hammock. The temples are covered by forest and jungle and are so quiet and green. Its a wonderful relief from the crowds at Ankgor Wat.We spent the most enjoyable evening in their house in Koh Ker which overlooks one of the Temples and ate the most finger licking delicious meal, squid with kampot pepper, beef with holy basil, tasty pork, chicken with lemon grass and chillies, amongst other yummy dishes, it was a feast. The next day we got on motor bikes and took off into the forests to meet some of the people living in the communities. HC have facilitated the insallations of Wells and Water pumps so the women dont have to walk 2 hours to collect dirty water any more. The have made a huge difference to peoples lives! Later we visted a floating community on the Tonle Sap which had JUST been opened up to Hidden Cam. so we were the first people to visit here, stopping off in a temple to hear the buddhas chanting. We visted fish farms, saw the families smoking the fish, all on houses on stilts. It was an amazing two days seeing so many things many people never get to see all their lives. Sheila and Paul of Hidden Cambodia are organized, efficient and very friendly. They are very knowledable and personable and can taylor make any type of trip to suit you and your needs. Sheila and Paul of HC are also great fun and it was a real pleasure to be with them for the few days to share our wonderful experiences. Competely Recomended!!!Sarah."

Excellent way to see a little of the countryside. Very nice equipment (ours were Polaris 4-wheelers). Different sizes for different ages. Both of our boys drove their own. A guide in front & back of the group guides you, stops traffic at intersections, etc. Literally riding among the cows as they came home at night next to rice fields and farm family homes."

Half the time you're on the road trying to get to the paddies, and the other half you're annoying cows and villagers. Mostly it felt tedious and boring, the noise makes you oblivious to traffic, you can't talk or hear, the bikes are hot, and you feel like a stupid revhead foreigner disturbing the peace in quiet villages. To be honest I was happy when the tour finished."

This really is a great way to explore the local countryside and paddy fields and in real contrast to the scenery you will see when exploring the temples. Everything from start to finish is professional- prompt and friendly hotel pick up and good introduction to the bikes which none of our family of 4 had ridden quad bikes before, but literally within less than 5 minutes of practice with an instructor on the bike with each of us, we all felt confident and could ride happily alone. We had Phalla and Cheresk as guides and they were really friendly and helpful. We wanted to stop at the local orphanage which was an incredible experience and the guides helped us buy a massive box of over 50 noodle packs before we arrived to give out, but when we arrived some other local kids were attending school there too so we didn't have enough, so they helped us form orderly queues and nip off and buy some more- as we couldn't leave any of them empty handed! I would highly recommend doing this if you have time as it is very humbling and also a great reality check for our teenagers to keep life in perspective and appreciate that issues such as slow wifi are so trivial- or '1st world issues' as my son conceded! Top tip- just don't wear trainers. You don't use your feet at all on the bikes as you use the hand break and they will get absolutely filthy and covered in red dust- especially if you go for the early morning tour. Just wear flip flops- so much easier! If you love puddles and getting wet and muddy then go for the sunrise tour, if you are not so keen or just don't want to get up early, we did the 1pm tour which was perfect and in fact most of the puddles had dried up so we only got a bit wet but incredibly dusty! A really fun way to spend a couple of hours and see more of the real Cambodia."

This was much easier though. We did do a little practice around the block and it was fine.Things I wish is done differently: wore long pants (I wore \"long\" shorts and got totally burnt even though I put sunscreen on) and maybe a long sleeve shirt. It is soo hot but better to be hot than burnt.Our guide showed us where to stop to take some good pictures and overall it was just a really cool experience outside of all the tourist attractions - we drove through little towns, rice fields, countryside, etc.Note: we opted to not visit an orphanage after reading that tourists are discouraged from doing so as it negatively affects Cambodian children (i.e. They're not really orphans/ their parents put them there to beg, etc.)Overall would recommend but be aware 4 hours is a pretty long time on an ATV in the sun!"

It was fantastic to experience handling the quads, riding the dirt tracks and enjoying the freedom and sights of the local countryside. Our two guides were our best friends for the morning. The views and stops will live with us forever. SR Quad Bike Adventure has a fantastic team of professionals. It's very safety conscious and excellently organised. They collected us from our hotel. They provided helmets, face masks and a safety test run before we set off. They tailored the route and stops to suit our interests. We learned so much about our surroundings. They also took the trouble to provide a 16th birthday celebration for our daughter at the end of our ride, picking flowers and preparing a cake. It was unbelievable! She was so happy.Although this is not a cheap activity, it is worth every last cent. We couldn't recommend it more highly. It really was the trip of a lifetime. Thank you Vong Savuth and the brilliant SR Quad Bike Adventure team."

One thing which we might need to know was that Sony brought us to a place which he said it was a monastery but in fact it was a cemetry for local rich people."

Stopped by a temple and then to a wide open field to catch the sunset. The guide helps us buy ice cold beer and water from the nearby store and it was a perfect ending to a wonderful ride. Total time: 2 hours 30 minutes.

Brought lollipops and gave out a 100 to kids along the way (as it was a school holiday)Loved this experience. Expect to get very dirty though"

There was more road driving either end of the trip than we expected from what they said. Roads are busy, although on some junctions they did have staff members to help you across. In the dry season dust levels were high. Sunglasses are needed, they provide a mask. Lovely to see outside the town and the sunset. Great for teenagers."

Water Buffalo, little kids that want High 5's - not $, croc farms (optional $3 safe), ancient temple (1000+yr) not on the circuit, backside view of Bakhong, I saw a Khmer wedding, new temples built next to old temples (100yr), villagers, workers, paddy life. It feels like you are in the middle of nowhere, but you are right in the middle of a whole way of life. Really too incredible a day to explain, and that was a 4 hr trip. The guide was at my pace, he had suggestions, but was not pushy. really awesome!"

The company sent a tuk-tuk to our hotel on time. When we arrived, a brief training session on how to use the ATV was provided. Included in the fee is a private guide to show you around the city and countryside. The rice patties are simply breathtaking. And you will see how the avg Cambodian really lives and works. It is disheartening to see the poverty that exists in the country, but whenever we passed by the kids and toddlers would wave and smile. How sweet.While traffic conditions in the city make driving not for the faint of heart, it is truly an unforgettable expedience. Our guide was very friendly and showed us around some of the temples as well. Luckily our temple pass from the Anglo Wat had not expired. The equipment they use is quite new and very safe.One word of caution. The guide told us that if we wanted to ride our bikes \"up the mountain\" we would have to pay 8 USD each to the police. Not sure if this is against the law but the whole business was shady. The view is incredible and well worth the money in my opinion.Overall it was a blast. We where covered in dirt from head to toe. Except for where the face mask that they provided covered. The company provided cold water and a cold towel which was a welcome relief at the end. We enjoyed it very much. I would like warn any novice riders its a little crazy on the streets. But if you follow your guide you will be fine. Just watch out for cows and tuk-tuks!"

At certain points, the one guide stops traffic so we can cross the road. It was such an awesome way to see the country side/villages. The local children are adorable when they run out to wave and say hello. We stopped at a beautiful rice field to watch the sunset/take photos. Both our kids had a quick driving test they had to pass prior to going so We all felt confident. The guides also do a great job explaining the quad as well as other rules. If you are looking for something as a break from temples, I would absolutely try this out."

With Sony, who was very accommodating, we stopped at a local market outside of town that services 10 or so villages. What an experience. We did not expect our guide to offer much in the way of history, so we were not surprised when he didn't. His English was decent. We stopped at a temple and had coconut juice along the way. A nice lunch was included. After lunch we had seen enough so we asked to go back. It was very warm and extremely dusty. Expect to be covered in red clay dust from head to toe. They provide masks.

I have driven before so in my group it was just me and one other girl. This made it more enjoyable because we could stop as often as we liked to take photos and our route was longer. Our tour guide was fantastic and even doubled up as a photographer. This is an absolute must-do in SR!

We were kitted up with helmet and mask,given a short safety briefing and a chance to drive the bike up and down a quiet road before setting off.

I recommend anyone who gets the opportunity to take this tour, to ask for him. He was a local, very informative and always looked after your safety. He did a tremendous job in taking the right picture/s and knows exactly how to work a camera. He found the right spot for the sunset over the rice fields and I was blown away.I cannot stress enough how great this tour was. Expect to get dusty in your clothes.

Our guide Kong took us on bumpy rural roads and we took in villages, fields, livestock, a charming monastery, a jail and other photo worthy points of interest. It was my first time driving an ATV and the staff were very patient and friendly training me on the quad before we set on our journey. Kong was an awesome tour guide, his English was great and he was very patient with our photo taking demands and millions of questions. This ATV ride truly was an adventure and opened my eyes to how Cambodians live. The children were so sweet and every one of them waved as we passed. I wish we had thought to bring something to hand out to the kids. There were so many sights to see and I highly recommend this company to take anyone on an adventure who wants to see another layer of the Cambodian way of life. BYOWater"

They gave a good overview of the quads to the (mostly female) group, although all you really needed to know was accelerate and brake as they looked after the rest! They took everyone around the block on a test drive, it was pretty easy as long as you've driven some kind of vehicle before. They fitted everyone out with helmets and face masks for the dust, then we went off in small groups through the country side. It was a really lovely ride, you see all the locals on their way home for the day, some walking their livestock home (blocking the road at times!). Felt safe the whole way, even for the short periods we were on roads, the guide looked after us and made sure we were ok. My only regret was that I didn't take a longer trip!"

Initially we rented two ATVs - one adult and one kid on each, but my wife wasn't able to pass their little drive test, so they insisted we rent another (it was fair, she was not comfortable driving by herself), though at the full price, which I would think in that situation (with a ton of ATVs not being used) they could have reduced the price, but whatever. The terrain we got into was really nice - getting to see the villages that were really far out was a good experience. The kids (10 and 12) loved the ATVs, and were actually able to drive it themselves with a guide on the back."

We booked a one and a half hour trip as a compromise....and, at the end, we were both sorry we hadn't booked a longer one. before starting out we were kitted out with helmets and given tuition on the bikes and taken around the block with an instructor. Once he was happy that we could handle the bikes we were allowed out with a guide on a motor bike ahead of us to lead the way. It was such great fun and definitely one of the highlights of our trip. Although apprehensive to start with, I felt the tuition and the guide made me feel very relaxed and I thoroughly enjoyed it and would do it again in an instant. Don't be put off thinking it is a young person's activity, I am a few months short of 60 and found it fantastic fun."

My daughter was afraid of hitting the cows, hence she was riding so slowly that we almost missed the sunset.The guide was efficient and responsible in ensuring that we knew how to ride the ATV through a short practice and told us what to avoid hitting such as the cows and dogs. More importantly, we should avoid the cow dung on the country road (the cow dung will flip in the air, turning into dANgerous bullets that will attack the person riding behind you). The sunset was so pretty, along with the scenic views of the padi fields. It really is not an experience to miss, especially when you're in Siem Reap.

We booked them through our hotel even though their location is just a minute walking distance from our hotel. We arrived there with a bunch of people waiting for everybody to arrive before the instructor demonstrates the basics of riding the ATV.Riding the ATV is pretty simple. Maneuvering the vehicle requires no sweat. Even for first timers, getting a hold of the vehicle is easy. We were a group of 8 in our trip. We had the lead motorcycle to guide us in directions and two more motorcycles to assist us with the car and motor stopping in the intersections. Riding along the countryside and see the different side of Siem Reap is one of a kind. We saw the folks in their houses doing what they normally do from their day to day lives. We witnessed their simplistic and rural lifestyle along the way. We went to the rice fields to stare at the yellow-orange-pink changing sunset. (One comment though) we asked the staff if we can roam around the rice fields with our ATV while waiting for the sunset, they were a bit hesitant to allow us to enjoy the ATV in the fields given that we paid for it to have fun. They allowed us to roam but in just one minute. And we were like what can we do in one minute? how are we supposed to have fun? Oh well, overall the experience was enjoyable. But it would be more fun if they have given us the freedom to ride the ATV to our own desire."

Books, crayons, sweets, clothes, toys and biscuits etc. The sunset was beautiful and then the ride home.... great afternoon!

The staff are friendly helpful and went over all the basics to our small group about the quad. They make sure newbies have assistance and a drive around the block so the individual feels comfortable and in control. When everyone is set off we went driving through paddie fields, the countryside, small little communities and farms etc which was a wonderful experience. The local children all come out and wave with their beaming smiles and you get to see the rural way of life seeing cows, buffaloes, pigs, chickens etc around small wooden houses. Camodian people truly are amazing who really add to the South EastAsian adventure. We took the 1 hour quad trip, saw the sun turn an amazing red colour when we all parked up together, but you can also stop at any point to snap photos without losing track of the guide. Really wish we had bought some sweets or toys maybe for the kids, they have nothing and live and play in extremely basic conditions but have the happiest, warm, friendly and genuinely lovely characters. The scenery is special and so are the locals - especially the kids & their big beaming faces."

In the 8 hours we saw lush paddy fields, local villages, markets, temples, monasteries, schools and lots of children happy to wave you by. Our guide was great, as it was just my girlfriend and I he basically took us wherever we wanted to go, there was no set route so you never felt like you doing the 'same same' as everyone else. We could stop and take as many photos as we liked and he was always on hand to tell us more about our surroundings.Drinks were bought for us throughout the day and food was provided (lots of choice and a good meal). We had to pay for drinks at lunch but everything else was well laid on.At the end of the tour our guide asked if we wanted to go to a shooting range, this is completely optional and wasn't forced on us but as Ive always wanted to go we said yes, again another great part of the trip (you just pay for the bullets).I would highly recommend this to anyone thinking of going and wanting to see as much of Cambodia as possible. A few tips would be bring lots of lollipops for the kids ( 5 bags for $1) you will need them all as kids come running as soon as they here the engines, also have an idea of what you want to see if you have anything in particular you are interested in."

Cambodia is very flat, so there were no steep hills and jungles to cut through. We travelled mostly along dirt tracks between paddy fields. The most hazardous part of our 90-minute mid-morning tour was a bit of traffic on the paved roads at the start/end of our tour, and one ankle-deep puddle. So, it was all very manageable.All 26 machines and helmets appear well maintained and serviced, and were fully fuelled up before we set off. All staff speak English well.My 9-year-old son sat with an instructor (who was also the tuk tuk driver who fetched us - punctually - from our hotel) on a small quad bike while I followed on a large one. The instructor stopped at various points and offered to take photos of us with our camera.If I was forced to come up with any concerns it would be that:1) no insurance was offered, although the owner explained this was due to the absence of any insurance company that will offer such coverage (besides, if you're going quad biking you should know it's a \"risk sport\", and travelling to Cambodia you should anyway have travel insurance [which might or might not cover you for quad bike riding]).2) no receipt was given for the fee paid in cash before the tour. Given how incredibly corrupt Cambodia is I feared we might be forced into paying \"additional fees\" before being sent back to our hotel. But I need not have worried. No such requests were made, and the owner was friendly and chatty. We were offered cool towels on our return from our ride and sent back promptly and without fuss to our hotel. I'm not sure whether credit cards are accepted, but credit cards are anyway frequently not accepted in Cambodia. Btw, don't expect Cambodia to be cheap. Bring enough US Dollars in cash."

That would suppose to start at 5 pm and there was a Pick-up service. Our hotel made the reservation and they were told that we should be ready for Pick-up at 4.30 pm.Around 5.05 still nobody to be seen. The hotel called and then they were reassured the Pick-up would come. At 05.15 we talked with the reception about cancelling because sunset would be around 5.38 (according to our iPhone). Then at 5.17 pm they showed up and rather reluctuntly we went along.We arrived around 5.23 and found a little chaos because they we trying to get a group of people (10 to 15) as quickly as possible on their quadbike and on their way. After a few minutes there were 5 people left and 4 quadbikes remaining. Than we said we would like to cancel because sunset was almost over and had enough of the situation. So this makes a 1 for planning because the were to late in the Pick-up of people and also had a shortage of quad-bikes.But as for service I still give them a 5. They were easy about The cancellation and quickly gave us our money back (which we paid to the hotel). And after a few minutes a lady that seemed to be running everything brought us back to our hotel by car personally and made serveral appoligies. I think you see true customer service when a companie slips up and I think they handeld this well. Of course it was a real shame we couldn't go but mistakes happen."

We enjoyed the ride through the fields at reasonable speed, taking time to have a quick stop for some pictures and admire the scenery. This is the real Cambodia without the touristy stuff. Here is where you get to see the villagers, the water buffaloes and paddy fields.Do bring along a few (Yes, a few!) bags of candies, pencils or erasers to give to the village kids as you move along the villages, but don't make too long a stop as it would get dark after sunset and not see much. At the end of the trip they would provide you with a cold towel to wipe away all that dust, sweat and buffalo poo (I'm just kidding) from your smiling faces."

We were picked up by tuk tuk at 4.30 and taken to the quad centre. Myself, my boyfriend (both 20) and one more guy were given a talk on how to use the bikes and we were off! Given brand new helmets and face masks riding clean and modern bikes. We were taken through lots of villages you won't see normally and stopped off to see the sunset. We were swarmed by little children and wish we took them a little something so if you remember it's a nice idea! Saw an amazing sunset and then back to the centre. So worth the money and I think an hour is enough, maybe the hour and a half but not sure you would see the sunset. Overall really glad we went and I would recommend to anyone visiting Siem Reap."

We were given a Tuk Tuk pickup from our hostel and the staff were kind enough to drop-off us at the end. I was new to quad biking so the guide had me go on a 10-minute trial, teaching me the basics. The guides spoke excellent English. We were then biking through the villages and countrysides where we stopped to catch the sunset overlooking the paddy fields... gorgeous views! I really enjoyed the trip as it was a rare chance to see the local people and their everyday lives as we passed through the villages. The only thing that I had to get used to was biking on the right side of the road! Would definitely return for more."

After a quick 15 minute orientation we were off to explore the countryside. We took a 3 hour tour and had two quads with an adult and child on each one. The quads were in top shape and never gave us any issues. The guide was great and spoke great English. We stopped at an orphanage so we children could drop off some gifts they had prepared for the kids there. Our kids played with the resident children for about 30 minutes and it was quite an experience for our 9 year old. He spoke about it often afterwards and I could tell he was moved by the experience. The countryside was beautiful and you really get to see how rural life is. We stopped on a few other occasions for drinks at shops. I would recommend this for any family traveling with children that want to get outside the city and see Cambodia's rural beauty."

Two of the girls were assessed as not being too confident and had a driver sitting behind them for added safety. Beautiful scenery and felt at ease on the bikes. They are automatic and easy to handle once you get used to it. Really fun riding through villages of smiling and waving kids.

Everyone comfortable and happy with their ride. An enjoyable (but dirty) afternoon!"

I only went here to start with because we wanted to do something exciting that wasn't so touristy, and they had some great reviews on trip advisor. The prices are all very similar around Siem Reap for riding a quad. We took the 2hr afternoon trip and it was one of the best days of my Life !!!, You get fairly new bikes, and it takes about 3 mins to get out of town and onto some dirt roads and see the real countryside. There isn't really a speed limit and you can kinda do what you want within reason if you know how to ride- which I can and used to own a quad. I was able to drive one handed and film about 30 mins of footage, take photos all the trip, we only had to beep the horns and the guide would pull over for us and take pics of us together. We visited a lot of small villages and families and donated money all afternoon, and nothing will ever replace seeing all the little smiles on the kids faces by simply giving them $1 usd. The guide took us to a military place where you could fire guns, and if you really wanted they also had a rocket launcher, but it was much more satisfying just donating money to all the children and families on the way around. I could not recommend this tour enough to anyone who visits and would love to do it again. You do get really dirty and need a shower afterwards though lol."

I really enjoyed my hour on the quad bike getting out into the countryside of Siem Reap - I went by myself and they were happy to accommodate. You are given a quick lesson on how to drive the quad, and then a 5min trip around the block where an instructor sits behind you to make sure you can control the bike. Then, away you go!You follow the guide who is on a dirt bike, who uses hand signals in good time to let you know where you are going and when you need to stop. He was happy to go at your pace (in my case, quite fast!) and adjusts his speed according to yours. He took me around to see a wat, which as it was 5pm meant we witnessed the monks performing the drum-banging ceremony. I had booked the sunset trip, but during monsoon season you are unlikely to see the sunset, so we went to the rice field where you would usually watch it and enjoyed the ambiance. My guide spoke reasonable English and was chatty and friendly.My only quibble was that he asked if I would like to take pictures of some of the local children, who line up along the road and give you high-fives and are generally quite happy to see you (not so sure about the adults who have quad bikes tearing around their villages each day!). However, this is a personal thing as I don't think it's right....personally I would suggest bringing some sweets to give out in exchange for a photo, or just to be nice.All in all a nice trip out with a professional outfit."

We were picked up promptly at the time indicated in the email confirmation by our guide. He brought us to the ATV office area where we were fitted with helmets and waited for our turn to test drive the ATVs. For a tour in a developing country, I was impressed by the attention to detail and safety. Each person in the tour was given private instruction on how to use the ATV and then with a guide riding behind them, brought to a practice area to go over various types of terrain and varying speeds. Riders were able to practice for as long as it took to feel comfortable on the bike. Upon returning, we we were given masks to keep the dirt out of mouths, and off we went. Each family or group headed off on their own. So as a couple, it was like a private tour which we didn't expect. Our guide made stops along the way so we could take pictures of the rice paddies and was always offering to take pictures of us. The ride itself was ridiculously fun. Since we felt comfortable on our bikes, the driver adjusted his speed to go faster and take us along more bumps. Take the company up on their suggestion to wear long pants, because you will be covered in dirt when you leave so it is good to protect your skin.Highly recommended to anyone staying Siem Reap for 3+ days. It is a great break from the temples, a huge adrenaline rush and a great way to see the countryside!"

This could be just ok at the beginning if we could stop to take pictures but we had to follow the others people. All in 1, quite disappointed but may be, we were unlucky on that day\u2026I will not recommend the quad actvity to my friends visiting Siem Reap."

Everyone goes on a practice around the block before they are allowed out on their own (given the traffic in Siem Reap this isn't as easy as it seems!) and then we were off on our quad bikes. We had excellent tour guides who were friendly, spoke great english and wanted to tell us about their community as well as find out a little bit about us and what Australia is like. We visited a Pagoda, went through rice paddies and stopped where we could get the best sunset picture. Had an amazing time and would highly recommend it to anyone wanting something a little different."

The hotel that we stayed at in Siem Reap organised the tour for us, and we were picked up on time from the hotel in a tuk tuk which our boys absolutely loved! We arrived at the office where another family were also waiting for the tour. After a very thorough and informative session on how to use the bikes and what to do/not to do, those of us who were not so confident were taken on a small training ride to check we could go out without assistance. This was very reassuring as my two boys had their own bikes and wanted to be independent, so it was professional for the team to check that they were confident. Then we set off.......the tour was superb! Paddyfields and villages, temples, and buffalos, cows, and ducks, as well as children and villagers waving and smiling all the way round. Exhilarating when we were able to get some speed up, pushing through deep puddles, and even avoiding the cowpats all led to some exciting riding. We were exhausted, covered in mud, and water, but very very happy when we got back! A fab way to see the local side of Cambodia. Thank you very much, recommend to anyone, and 90 minutes is just enough time. Our children thought this was the best part of our holiday. Thank you! Highly recommend."

Then we were quickly taught on how to operate the bike in a few easy steps. The instructors were all very professional and they took safety precaution by going with us on a trial ride before they deem if it was okay to go on the bike alone or with an instructor sitting with us. The village routes were muddy, with many puddles but it makes the ride even more adventurous! My instructor Da, was super patient and friendly even though i cant control the bike very well. We had a long & interesting tour around the village, a great way to sight see a village. Overall, a worthwhile experience when you are in siem reap!"

The thing that impressed me most was the fact that, after the rundown about the bike, they take you for a quick ride (with instructor) to make sure you are comfortable with the bike and still happy to go ahead. It is only after this, that you complete the paperwork and pay. If your not comfortable, you can still opt out and not lose your money.If you are in Siem Reap, I would highly recommend you do this.

We stopped a few times ( gives your bottom a rest) as we took the 2 hour ride. One of the homes was where a young girl who spoke very good english. The kids all come out to wave and the are looking for lollies or pencils. I would suggest that you buy about 50 to give away as there were lots and lots of kids. Our guide was knowledgable and it was really fascinating to see how the people lived. The bikes were in good working order and clean. It is on the expensive side but we had a wonderful afternoon.

The ATV people will get a tuk tuk to pick you up around half an hour before your scheduled ride. The staff working in this company can speak some English and will bring you for a short test drive to ensure that you are familiar with the control of the ATV. Normally I think it\u2019s 2 person to 1 guide. I had 1.5 hour of riding, exactly what I paid for. The guide will ask you if you would like to go to visit an orphanage during the tour. You should kindly declined as this will not only eat into your ATV time, but you will also be brought to a shop and requested to buy food for the orphans. The food cost is atrociously high. Near the end of the journey, there would be some amazing water crossing and dirt path. I think taking the 1.5 hours package for around 40 USD would be best. It is sufficient for you to enjoy the ride and not too long that it gets boring. If you\u2019re interested, you can also request to swap your ATV for your guide\u2019s dirt motorbike."

Our guide Koy was very nice, we drove out near his village so he was very knowledgeable about the area.

Communication via email was great, and pick up as promised was at the hotel on time. The quads were in good order, and seeing the countryside in this manner was fantastic. There was a long section with muddy potholes, and my teenagers had priceless fun bounding through them and covering each other with mud. It was expensive, but overall worth it. Unfortunately, I would share with you a few issues that left a bit of a bad taste in my mouth, and took a bit away from what could have been an outstanding experience. I paid $760 for 8 of us. Not a small amount of money, but I have travelled enough to know that as long as you do your homework, you often get what you pay for. When handing over this amount of money I am accustomed to getting a receipt so I asked for one. The folks at the office said they would have to ask the owner? So about 10 minutes later, they brought me a IPad with the owner on skype. He said he heard I wanted a receipt. I said yes is this a problem. He said no, but he would have to send it over email. This was just over a week ago, and nothing yet.The other 'issue' that quite bothered me...The guides had several planned stops including picking up candy/soap for kids along the way, drinks and a crocodile farm. Entrance to the crocodile farm cost $3 each - $24, for what was essentially a 5 minute stop to look at crocodiles of various sizes in holding pens. A small bag of hard candy was $3 (I bought several, soap, and 8 waters and think I spend $25) and drinks at a village in the middle of no where cost $1 for a can of soda - By comparison, I was drinking Ankhor beer for $1 a glass at the hotel. When I mentioned something to the head guide in jest, he said he had no idea about prices anywhere, these were random stops along the way - I have no doubt the guides were getting a cut, but really, what to do. Not a huge amount of money, and I didn't really mind giving to some of these village vendors, but that is really not the point. The point is - I am not cheap, and really not bothered to pay $1 for a can of soda, but I felt nickle and dimed and overall taken advantage of by the guides. I would have much rather paid $100 a person, and have water/admissions included. For what its worth, I took my family on other similar types of tours here in Siem Reap. On every other occassion, drinks were included, fruit was bought along the way and served (included in the original cost), entrance fees included, lunch included, and when my son wanted to try something at a village store (some kind of tapioca/ice dessert), the guide negotiated the price and we paid about 25 cents I think. By comparison, this was absolute horrible service...Upon drop off, I told the guide he and his friends could have easily made 5% (around $40), and possibly up to $80 in tips if they would have simply taken care of me and my family and gave us an experience where I felt they took care of us. Its a lesson I am sure he will soon forget, as I suspect they regularly take advantage of folks on this tour."

Driving through the villages and farm land was a real experience especially at lunch time when all the kids are out of school and waving at you as you go past. The tour guide picked us up from the hotel complimentary (arranged by our hotel) and he gives you a run down of the bikes controls and then accompanies you on a quick ride around the block to ensure you have the hang of it. My wife was initially very nervous so the guide made sure that he went slowly on the trip so that she felt comfortable. While obviously I would have preferred to go a little faster I was very happy that they considered my wife and our tour ran 25 minutes over the allotted time in order for her to go at her own pace. We did the 90 min tour but next time will go for longer and do the 4 hr sunset tour (we will definitely be coming back). Guide was more than willing to stop when we needed in order to take photos and as with our other experiences in Cambodia he was a real pleasure to deal with and very patient.Both my wife and I agree that the Quad Bike tour was on par with seeing the temples and was well worth it. It just really gives you an up close view of the Cambodia way of life and seeing all the children waving at us really made the experience so worth while. Really cant recommend this enough and no Cambodia trip would be complete without this on the itinerary."

Not only did they go quad biking, they were also given the chance to try shooting. In the back of my sons mind (though he had never told me, his mom) he thought maybe a career involving shooting might be of interest. This experience was an eye opener, and one that cemented the idea that shooting guns would not be something he'd make a career of after all. However, he has kept his souvenir target practice paper showing just how accurate he can be shooting handguns and semi automatic machine guns. YICKS..... it is a good thing I wasn't there and decided to go shopping on Alley West by Pub street instead. GREAT shops there by the way, especially Smateria!"

The guide told us that the view is very different in rainy season. To be honest, I probably wouldn't recommend this activity in wet season, knowing that most roads we took are raw red soil, not asphalt. The guide took us to the village where he lived and showed us his house. I am very touched. Khmer people are lovely, unrefined in the most natural way butvery inspiring because of their simple life.We stopped to watch the sunset. Covered with red dust, exhausted but happy, because I feel closer to their earth.It is not something you do on every holiday, but it is a great experience and very good value.P.S. do not wear white, wear appropriate gear, and no shorts!

We decided to include quad biking in our tour of Siem Reap, for the most part to make our 10-year old son happy (I would never have considered it otherwise.) Having said that, it turned out to be one of the best things we did!In addition to being good fun, it was the very best way to see the countryside around Siem Reap, with it's amazing rice paddy fields and scenery, the villages and most of all, the beautiful people. We had so many young children coming up to us to have their photos taken or just for the opportunity to say \"hello!!\" a few dozen times.We will definitely do the trip again next time we visit Siem Reap. I would recommend not wearing anything you don't want to get very dusty and dirty, as you come away looking filthy (but nothing that doesn't come out in the wash!)."

We booked directly through their online booking system the night we arrived Siem Reap. I woke up the next morning with the confirmation sent at about 6 am. Thats an excellent start!We chose to do the half day (4 hour) ride. You can choose to start either at 7 am or noon. We picked 7 am and did not regret as the weather was nice and sun was not very hot. On the day of the ride we were picked up from the hotel and arrived at their location where we signed the disclaimer, and off we went!The ride itself is excellent and we drove through the countryside/small villages and there were a lot of excited children waving to us. You can stop as many times as you want to take pictures. Overall a very nice experience and I would definitley recommend it if you have time in Siem Reap, just be ready to get vey dirty!"

The ATV itself is amazing, we got to see the very poor people in the countryside, the just-harvested paddy fields, as well as the scenic sunset. We really enjoyed riding the ATV on the sandy pathways although they were very dusty and dirty, we thought it's a once in a lifetime event, why not? The villagers seem very happy, waving around at us. However, our tour guide was just trying to get us to tip him off, he couldn't stop rambling about how poor HE is, how he has to look for snakes and frogs to eat later that night, etc. But he shut his mouth as soon as my husband gave him some money IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TOUR. Overall, it was a great experience and I highly recommend it."

This company is very professional and organized. The hotel arranged the tour for us, the tour company picked us up at the hotel, took us to the bikes and after the ride brought us back to the hotel. The quads were in very good condition and they provided us with helmet, face mask (it it very dusty) and brief explanation of the quad. We did the 3 hour ride, which was maybe a tad to long. The guide asked us if we wanted to visit a school and we said \"yes\", the school turned out to be an orpange with a school and the visit was uncomfortable for us, so I would skip this part."

After this, we started our tour! Dusty and sandy roads, amazing landscapes, beautiful animals and people met (children!!!). If you are scared about quad because it's the first experience... don't worry... fear will disappear after 1 minute, discovering how much fun there is in riding quad (try on the sand!). Good and young english speaking staff. Have a nice trip with quad!"

We were picked up at our hotel by a tuk-tuk sent by the company. They had my kids, 13 and 16 try out the bikes with staff drivers behind them. My sons were apprehensive about riding alone, so each had a driver from the tour sit behind them during the tour. This made each boy feel very safe, yet allowed them to drive the bike themselves most of the way. The 2 drivers on the kids' bikes led the tour onto the dirt roads past rice paddies, homes, water buffalos walked by barefoot farmers, waving children. I was surprised at how friendly everyone we passed was, given the noise of the bikes. We took photos with a spectacular sunset. Well worth it!"

That accelerator going all the way back to the plastic was amazing. Every time I did it gave me a rush of adrenaline. WOOOOO!!!!!! The beautiful countryside, the dusty orange dirt, and the awesome 4 wheeler. The best experience so far in Siem Reap, but remember wear an orange or red shirt (if you have one) and be prepared to get down and dirty.

I was lucky enough to have an overcast day.

Having a guide with me was not bad as he would tell me about the places and also riding alone for 2 hours might be boring. The vehicles were very new and in very good condition.We saw a lot of beautiful scenery along the countryside. You can get a lot of marvelous photographs there. The locals will smile and wave at you whenever you passed by. There were a lot of buffaloes and chickens running around, so you will have to avoid them and their dunks. It is rainy season currently, so the place might get a muddy. However, they did provide plastic bags to cover your shoes and also raincoats in case of raining. It rained heavily and my long pants got dirty anyway. So I would advise to go during the dryer season and the owner actually suggested to do the ride in the morning as it is unlikely to rain early in the morning.It was really a fun ride and the staffs there are really nice.

We went through beautiful areas and loved the view of the countryside.The bikes were easy to ride so give it a go."

We were picked up from our hotel and dropped back after. Safe, brand new quad bikes, excellent English from Dom who really knew his stuff. Definitely worth doing.

Wearing a long pants is strongly advised as the hot air from the engine can be quite uncomfortable. However, it was still bearable with shorts.P.S.

We did the sunset tour but I reckon any time of the day would be good and you wouldn't be rushing to get back before dark. The guides are Cambodian and it is locally owned. The bikes were in tip top condition and had both front and rear brakes. My husband and I are both motorbike riders and they went thru what we needed to do differently as neither of us had ridden quad bikes before. They were insistent on going thru all the safety procedures and take you through a short safety ride beforehand. You can stop and take photos along the way - the guide stops when you do. All the kids come out and wave when you go past their houses but this is most likely as they are often rewarded with lollies."

We did the 2 1/2 hr afternoon quad bike tour, 13yo son, husband and myself, we were very happy with the way they went through the safety procedure as none of us had experience on quadbikes. We had two guides with us, they were wonderful, constantly keeping an eye on us and never far away. My son was allowed to ride the quad with the instructor on the back and he had an absolute blast, just loved every minute of it, as did we. The scenery outside of Siem Reap is lovely, going through all the little villages was fantastic, children coming out along the way. We chose not to go to the orphanage as we strongly believe this is really not of any help to the kids and we also did not hand out lollies to the children along the way, again as we believe this is of no help to them it just encourages them to come out and wave then expect that they will get lollies etc. We found it to be absolute value for money and we would highly recommend it to anybody. Give it a go, its lots of fun and a change from the temples, warning though you do get covered in dust if you are behind the lead quad and yes the engine does get very hot."

Two of us did the sunset tour (~ 2 hrs for USD25/pax)... though the sunset itself was disappointing (too cloudy!), we had an awesome time quad-biking through the fields of Siem Reap!!! we went in dry season (end March) so we were \"lucky\" in a way.. didn't really get all muddied-up! we arrived at about 5pm & was met by the friendly Savuth who gave us a quick overall idea of what we were about to do... then we got to do a short practise run around the neighbourhood to familiarise with the controls of the bike. the steering part was a bit hard at first but once we go used to it, it was fine! soon, we were off! along the way, kids would run out of their homes to wave as we go past their homes & fields... some parts involve some crossing of the roads but our guide was very responsible and we felt completely safe with him leading the way and helping us when we had to make crossings etc.. I got stuck at one point (totally my own fault!) and didn't know how to reverse but our guide was alert and came around quickly to help me! we stopped midway at an area with padi fields to view the \"sunset\"...and spent some time conversing with our guide and also took pictures with the kids etc...soon it got dark quickly and we had to already use our headlights to start driving back home.. which was kinda another experience to drive at night with the headlights on... once back at the shop, we were given wet towels to wipe our faces and get ready to be amazed by the amount of dust/dirt! haha... so wear clothes that you don't mind getting dirtied for sure!!! i would recommend long pants too coz the engine part gets pretty hot near the ankles.. but i wore shorts & slippers and it was quite ok too! Overall we had a really great time quad-biking here and highly recommend it as a definite must-do in Siem Reap!!!!!"

At one stage we stopped to watch the sunset and we had ten children sitting on our bikes, talking to us (not that we could understand) and loved having their photo taken.

Dont get me wrong, I brought over 80kg of stuff for a charity school and a soup kitchen, and I feel for the children. However, at the orphanage, a boy brought me around, and kept pausing at the place where they sell t-shirts for $10, saying the profits go to the orphanage, and even told me directly to give tips to my guide as they depend on it for a a living. the \"principal\" of the orphanage sat at his doorstep with his child, and didnt bother with any greeting. I specially brought them a bag of brand new coloring books, colouring pencils, children toothbrushes etc, but it seem like they'd have prefer cold hard cash. tips: wear jeans, the engines get hot around the ankles!! **and bring at least 100 packs of tidbits for the children!!** I felt so bad for the kids whom i encountered after the orphanage, cuz I ran out of tidbits for them. They were so charming, asking whats your name, hows your day, where are you from... I bought those thin packets of wafers at US$5 for 60packs in minimarts. you will also pass by those roadside stalls on your quadbike, paid 2500 riels for a big bag of 16 packets, and the kids were so happy with it, skipping all around with the snacks and going \"yay!\""

One thing I was concerned was that we drove in the middle of a small village. I had to keep my eyes on other motorbikes, children and cows. It would be better if the company asks the riders to drive slowly when passing the village because the ATVs cause a great dust wind and there can be a safety issue."

Children heard the sound of our convoy approaching and ran out to greet us - we were told that some tourists gave the children lolloies so we stopped off at a local stall and brought some lollipops to distribute.

            "review": "Rural Experience - highly recommended!. Siem Reap Quad Bike Experience - We took a 2 hrs Discovery Tour and was delighted with the experience! Thorough instruction how to run the bikes, high quality newly purchased bikes (all automatic), and a chance to see some of the out of town life. My only complaint is that is is hard to take in the all the beautiful sights as well as steering away from potholes, cow dung, dogs and chickens - but all part of a fun couple of hours! There was opportunity to visit a buddist temple, temple ruins, and an orfanage. We loved meeting the children and seeing some of their classes, plus getting to view village life as the guide took us down dirt tracks. Recommendation would be to have sturdy shoes (trainers) and trousers covering the lower legs as the engine gets hot by the ankles...and you are likely to come back covered in dust! We were more interested to drive around rather than the stops, so dont feel that you have to stay long at them unless they are of specific interest to you - however it is good to get off the bikes from time to time and plenty of things to photograph!"

Gave the kids a quick lesson and much to my surprise we all had to ride on the road to get out into the countryside, which my 13 year old son loved. He had the guide on the back to make sure he was ok.My 18 year old daughter picked it up fine. They were one quad short as the other tour had not arrived back, told the owner I could ride his Honda XR 250 trail bike (as I am a dirt bike rider) instead of waiting for a quad, he said no worries, so I was very happy with this, not sure if he always does this, but you can always ask if you would prefer the bike.You head off down the road and in 5 minutes you are in another world, where the real people live, kids run out to wave, thought they were very friendly, but my guide tells me the tourists give them lollies (sweets)so felt bad I did not bring any, so take some if you can, the kids get so excited as they can hear you coming 200 metres away.So the roads are very rough, narrow and dusty and watch out for the cow dung! But this is all part of the adventure.You ride amongst the Rice paddies, farms, water buffalo to see the sun set over the fields and get some pics of the trip.Gets dark here real quick and I thought we were off back to base but no ,the adventure continued well into dark.In the end the 60 minute trip took 90 minutes so for $25, it was a bargain. Take long pants and shoes,if it is dry ,you do get dusty and if it's wet, I think you may get muddy, but all part of the deal.They supply you with a paper dust mask, so wear it, makes a big difference and take some sun glasses to stop dust from getting in your eyes.If you have a child or friend who can't ride you can double for a few dollars more.It is a new company and the quads are in very good condition.On return they give you a cold wet face cloth to wipe off the dust, which is a nice touch and will pick you up and drop you off at your accommodation included in the price.So for a fun short trip I totally recommend these guys."

The owner is Cambodian and has just started the business. The bikes are new and obviously looked after very well. This trip takes you through the back villages of Siem Reap. By far my favourite part of this tour is the many children running out to the road as we rode past to wave at us- they were gorgeous. My main fault with this tour is that we were taken to an orphanage. I felt very awkward being shown around the orphanage as if it was a tourist attraction. I know that there is some great work being done in Cambodia to stop this type of tourism but obviously hasn't filtered down to everyone. Next time I would ask to skip the orphanage."

I thought we would be going on a purpose built track or some wasteland but you actually go all around the village and rice fields, which is fun and the guide was a really nice guy, very helpful and friendly. However, this cannot be nice for the locals, you pass by many houses and lots of kids playing in the street.

But we were so lucky that the booking wasn't that full that morning so we were still able to enjoy the adventure. Staffs were very nice. We needed to sign a waiver, nothing sketchy. A lady (probably the owner) explained what we were gonna do, and then we tried driving the vehicle before we drove farther from the location. There was a staff sitting behind us on the vehicle during the trip to make sure we are safe. He took over control of the vehicle when it is appropriate (e.g., when the traffic is busy) . We stopped at a temple for a break and the staff gave us a mini tour of the temple and took pictures for us. He was extremely friendly. After we were done, we were given a bottle of iced water and wet nap! Overall it was an awesome adventure. Cambodia Quad Bike does want their customers to play safe and enjoy the trip as much as possible. Highly recommended. FYI: We booked online and were given 10% discount."

We travelled mainly on back lanes and through paddy fields. There were small numbers of local people living and working in the area and the children waved and wanted to high five us as we went by. The guides initially took us out for a test ride (sitting pillion) to show us the controls and to ensure that we could handle the machines and then we were split into two groups of 7 & 8 and taken different roots to a meeting point - so as not to be too disruptive to the locals - we then had pictures taken at sunset before heading back all together. It was a brilliant, brilliant day."

We got one quad bike each for $50 (10% off for booking online - we picked FUN quad by the way). Surprisingly, we got picked up by a car. Before going on the road, we were asked to read and sign some short agreement, given instructions on how to use the bike, and was told not to drive too far from our guide. Our first stop was a local market, then to one of the new temples. We were told that children love to come out and see tourists on quad bikes so we decided to buy a bag of snacks to give out to those kids. So we drove thru the road, then to the country side. There were small huts on both sides were kids come out an wave at us. We played Santa and handed candies to the kids, it's just the most memorable part of this activity - seeing grateful faces for such small gifts, it's just really humbling and touching. After the touchy-feely part, we headed off to the rice fields. It was a great ride as we were allowed to go fast. The dirt road was really bumpy but i guess thats the fun part. Our guide would sometimes stop in the middle of the field to let us enjoy and intake the beauty and smell of nature. The challenging part was when we drove thru waters. It was pretty difficult for me yet the mud splash was so much fun. It's optional though, you can choose the \"cleaner\" path... I'm blabbing too much now. In conclusion, our guide Mr. Chan was very nice and friendly. After 2 hours in the sun, we were greeted with ice-cold water and refreshing towel after the ride. This is one great memory and we are thankful for the staffs that made this experience possible and enjoyable for us."

Wife and I had no problem riding it and we were set on our way. We had a guide in front of us in his dirt bike which was nice, he always made sure we were safe, we then stopped by to see the countryside market, and bought snacks for the children at the villages, The kids and locals waved at us as we drove by, we then visited a temple which was really nice. Mr.Chan our guide gave us some information on what was on the sites and about the monks living in that pagoda. We then went to the grasslands where we got a little wet and some mud on our shirts which was great. The quads preformed perfectly.  Took some photos of the rices fields and buffaloes.We then rode back to the garage where we were greeted by the owner and a much appreciated super cold bottle of water and towel.We thanked Mr Chan our guide and he drove us back to our hotel."

Make sure you have long sleeves and long pants. We went through villages, paddy fields, saw buffalo, stopped and got to pat one. Stopped at a piggery, saw ducks with babies. Lots of children, temples. Beautiful country side. Stopped and brought packets of noodles and as we drove through the villages stopped and gave a packet of noodles to the children.

This was our first time on quad bikes and was a great first experience. We got to see the local villages, buffalo, and some temples. The tour guide was more than happy to take photos for us in spots he recommended- this was great. All the staff were really helpful, offering us free water and a hose down at the end. What I liked about it was that we were able to go at our own pace and could request certain routes which appealed to us. If you do this tour then make sure you wear older clothes - you can request to see the buffalo (amazing!) But the route is extremely muddy, wet and dusty. We enjoyed this but be prepared to get mucky! One side point that needs mentioning is the crocodile farm. We were offered by the tour guide to visit the crocodile farm for $10 - there was no pressure on us at all to do so, but we said yes. As soon as we arrived I regretted this - the farm is packed full of crocodiles in poor conditions, and the purpose of the farm is to make souvenirs. There was even a smelly pile of crocodile heads that were 'souvenirs'. This should certainly not stop you from doing the quad tour as it was not part of the tour as such (it was just optional). However I'd recommend you say \"no\" if you're offered this. Overall a fantastic experience I would recommend to all!"

I assume they have some kind of understanding with the farmers because they didn't complain.I did feel a bit apprehensive about the role of the noisy tourist but even though this must be an everyday sight for many, they didn't seem to be bothered and many keep waiving at the loud tourists. Most of the time, we were in pretty abandoned places though. Got stuck once. Fun! Pay pushed us out getting himself all muddied up, which he later washed in one of the ditches like the farmer boy he probably was (now studying economy at University!).Our 10 and 13yr old girls loved it. Dress for the occasion though: old clothes that can get dirty, shoes that can get soaked.We were lucky with the weather but I understand these guys sail rain or shine.The only minus: the engines get hot, really hot. They should have a solution for that."

Before commencement, they conduct tests on each driver, to establish if drivers can ride alone on single quads or need guidance with instructor on double quads. If you book a double quad but have failed the test as driver, you have to top up money to a single quad with instructor. Probably due to miscommunication, they had not told us the exact reason for failing some of us. I have been to other quad rides in other countries and find this test drive too short, the testers/instructors too brief in communication and yet hasty in establishing drive results. Overall a good experience, if not for this test drive bit."

We went through the countryside which I can say offers some very scenic views of the paddy fields as well as views into the lifestyles of the local village peoples. Not only was the experience beautiful, but it was also eye opening in terms of a cultural experience. And not only that. but the guides that are assigned to you are super helpful and friendly. For me, my guide was Phalla, who was very friendly and knowledgeable as well as humorous.Overall, it was an experience to never forget!"

Borey picked us up right on time, and took us in a tuk tuk to the main shop. We were given instructions on how to use the ATVs...and off we went. Borey started slowly, letting us get the feel of the paths and fields. We went through water and fields and villages... as we were on the ATVs longer, the challenges got a bit more ... muddier...off path etc. We felt safe and taken care of. Thanks for a great time."

Especially, it will be crazy fun in rainy season. You drive through rice paddy field, soak your quadbike and you into muddy and full-of-water countryside road. Then sunset views are something awesome to finish the quadbike. This is a must if you come to Siemreap."

My partner and I did a half day tour, I am an experienced biker, but she is not, however that did not matter one iota, we had a ball. We were led by two of the staff members on a motorbike and the pillion passenger took photos of us (and the surrounding scenery) the whole time, absolutely brilliant touch (downloaded onto usb at the end, voila, 150 photo's of our adventure!)Seeing the countryside from this 'angle' was amazing, as other reviewers have mentioned you drive through villages where the residents come out and kids waving, smiling, awesome :-)The staff were excellent, the bikes in great condition, all in all a must do while in Siem Riep in between temple gazingIt had been raining the previous days, which just added to the fun!!!5 stars"

I was really happy to see they had flag man stopping traffic each time we had to go on the road.. Impressed with that. It had just finished raining so the rice fields had a little extra water and much to add to the excitement. We did the afternoon ride so got some good group pictures with our tour gang.. I had my wife on the back and she was quite confortable with the large seat we had. I own the same Polaris so had no trouble riding it. I thought the 1 1/2 hrs was a little short as we spent a lot of time stopping for group pictures and a beer. Would have like a little more riding. I am used to 2-3 hrs at a time."

The tour guides picked us up at our hotel in a pair of tuk tuks at 5:00am and took us back when the tour was over. They gave us all a good, brief instruction on how to use a quad bike, or ATV, took each of us out for our a test drive, to make sure we would be ok on our own, then our adventure began. What a great adventure it was! We took farming roads and trails into the rural countryside on the outskirts of Siem Reap, watched the sunrise over the farms and trees, and even took a pit stop at a crocodile farm (that was an extra fee, but really fun!). The guides knew exactly where to stop for some good pictures and did a great job of keeping the group together. They were professional, polite, fun, and genuine. It looked like they were having just as much fun as we were. I would recommend this to anyone visiting amazing Cambodia. It is absolutely the most fun way to see the rural side of the country. During the months of April and May, I would recommend taking this particular tour (the Sunrise Rider) to escape the heat of the day.All of us involved in the tour said that it was the highlight of our trip (through giant grins on our faces). We are already thinking about a second trip to Cambodia, this time with our kids, and if that becomes a reality, we will call the Cambodia Quad Bike company again!"

Our group of 5 (from age 55 to 22). We had two guides, (so wish I could remember their names!) who led us on their dirt bikes. After making sure we were comfortable operating the machines on a short test ride, they led us through the villages, shrines and rice paddies of the surrounding area, all they way giving us a great overview of life in Cambodia from a local's point of view. The ride was sometimes fast and sometimes very bumpy as you go off across the paddies. Our guides spoke English well and answered our many questions about the history, culture, economy and politics of Cambodia enthusiastically and informatively. We just loved chatting with them and I was sorry to have to say goodbye when the tour was over. Being the dry season, the paddies were dried up and we crossed the many ruts and bumps without getting muddy. It's a bit dusty and definitely recommend wearing some kind of eye protection. Sunglasses are fine for the way out, but coming in after the sun has set, it can be hard to see with those on. So bring a cheap pair of clear plastic eye glasses or goggles to keep the dust and the occasional bug out of your eyes. They provide helmets and dust mask for your lower face.Everyone is so friendly. They smile and wave as you pass. Such sweet people. The folks in the villages are very poor and the guides give you the opportunity to stop at a small general store to buy some goodies that you can distribute to the children as you pass through. There are about 200 of them but the foodstuffs are very inexpensive by American standards and the kids are most appreciative. I would definitely recommend this adventure to anyone going to Siem Reap."

Renting Quads is one of the more expensive activities in Siem Reap, so before we rode, I was unsure if it would be worth it. But let me tell you - It is totally worth the price! I am so happy we did it. Cambodia Quad Bike had good equipment everything ran well, handled well, and was very safe. Safety is really emphasised, but don't worry you will have plenty of fun and excitement opening the quads up on the wide, open (and safe) Cambodian fields. We loved the wide open space of the countryside, and seeing cows and buffalo roaming. We even got to see them up close. It was a great break from the temple visits and so much fun. Our guide was really cool and knowledgable. totally recommend it!"

Then we got to the bikes and met up with our guide, Silo, who explained to us how to maneuver the bikes and we then headed out with our helmets, bikes and tour guide through the amazing sceneries of the villages in Siem Reap. Our guide was an amazing young man, silo, who made a stop at a temple in a village where we met three young kids and Silo explained more about the area and temple. We then bought a few bottles of water and continued on to the vast green field with its small bumps which made the ride even more fun.Silo then stopped near a small herd of buffalos where we took a few photos and watched the beautiful sunset and the sky changing its colors.When we returned we wrote our names on the wall and were given some drinking water to cool off.Silo then took us back to our hotel in a tuk tuk which was an great ending to our amazing day.Thank you Silo for making our start in Siem Reap an amazing experience!"

In the village, we stopped and got a box of food packages and gave them out to the school children. I was afraid that it was going to feel contrived but it definitely did not. it really was a very moving experience and totally unexpected on a day booked for a quad ride. We then rambled off to the country side. Once our of the village and in the fields, our 9 and 10 year olds took a turn a driving (well, sort of driving, we swapped seats and were sitting right being them while they steered and pushed the accelerator). This was an absolute thrill for them. It was completely unexpected, but I think this was one of the most memorable things that we did on a 10 day trip to southeast asia."

Still good any time but sunset would certainly add to it.The crew took great care of us and we got to see a bit more of the real Cambodia than you would if you stick to the tourist spots. Thanks!"

I joined an old flatmate and her husband for one of the half day / 4.5 hour treks whilst we were having a short stay in Cambodia during a recent fortnight trip to Asia where I was catching up with a lot of friends in different places. From the outset the manner of the staff, facilities, instruction on using the bikes and the equipment all inspired confidence, I have ridden quad bikes before numerous times in the UK, but the value for money and enjoyment was just worlds apart in Cambodia. We were taken on a long touring trek of the local area with Samnang leading us on a motorcycle and my friends riding tandem on another quad, stopping every so often to have refreshment breaks, take in the amazing scenery and get photos taken, we visited temples, a leather works and a crocodile farm among other sites and just had an absolute blast riding the quadbikes with more of a feeling of purpose in getting between interesting places rather than just the usual circuits of a pre-fabricated route or track I've had back home. Well worth checking out, excellent value for money compared to other similar experiences I've had. my GoPro videos can be found on my youtube channel; Stewbacca117"

We were super impressed and had a blast, definitely one of the highlights of our time in Cambodia. Our guide Stela picked us up from our hotel and it was only a short tuk-tuk ride to their shop. After a quick safety briefing he took us each for a practice ride, which covered the types of terrain we would drive over later - good to see how bumpy it's going to be in places!We set off and visited a pagoda, crocodile farm, local villages, old temple ruins and saw so much that we wouldn't have otherwise had the opportunity to see. Stela was amazing - he knew so much about each place and answered all our questions, and was so enthusiastic about showing us around. He spoke good English and had a great sense of humour :) he also offered to take lots of pics and videos for us.At the end of the ride we went off-road and raced across open fields - so much fun!!! Be prepared to get dusty and take lots of water/sunscreen. I would recommend closed in shoes and a scarf to wrap around your mouth. They do give you a face mask but the scarf breathes a bit better.Definitely do this - can't recommend highly enough!!!!!"

The quality of the bikes are excellent and equal to the pleasant staff. Our guide was Mr. P and he is a delight. And if my words aren't enough you should see the hundreds and hundreds of comments written on the walls of their building. If you have any nervous people when you pull in, just read a few of the comments on the wall and go experience your own. If a clear evening, book the sunset tour. The towns are lively at that time of night. We followed up with a morning 2 hour ride on a weekday so were able to see a little business side of Cambodia. Make this a part of your Cambodia trip!!"

At first I had my hesitations and I was very anxious because I've never drive anything in my life, but their guides were very encouraging. They actually told me I can manuver well - and the practice course was very helpful before you actually go out in the countryside and drive.We took the Sunrise tour (which people probably rarely do) and the owner told us it was really a good choice since it is in the morning where the locals go out and about for their morning activities. I really appreciate that we stopped by a Local Market and tried the food like the Fried Noodles and the Grilled Banana-Covered Rice Cakes. The Cambodian experience can't anymore authentic than that. Most memorable of it all was the fun of riding the Quad Bike itself - it was a Bumpy Ride, you are driving in Rice Fields after all - but going over uneven terrain makes it more fun. I never thought I'd do but I had so much fun."

They got to go faster following the other guide and let me tell you that it made their day. Needless to say my caution was holding them back and the guides sensed it and took charge. The best part of the ride was going along the countryside in SR. We rode through villages and farms and stopped for a mesmerizing sunset. My only concern is that the guides asked us if we wanted to stop by the store and buy some gifts for the village kids. The store wanted to charge us $5 for 20 used pencils. Sounds like a great idea except unless this is done in an organized manner it can be more detrimental than helpful. My hope is that the company set up something with a school or orphanage in a more organized way.I have already recommended this company to my friends who will be going to SR soon.

I went with my partner and another couple, and because the two females were abit more hesitant on the quads after about half an hour one of the guides took the two men off on a more adventurous fast ride. This was amazing, got the quads full speed and flying over small ridges getting them off he floor. The guides were amazing, we have 2 for the four of us, one leading and one following. Although 90% of the time we were off road there was some times getting too and from the fields we had to use the local roads, the guide at the front would stop all traffic to allow us to cross quickly and safely. Final good point was when we stopped the guides took photos of us, they took some amazing pictures! Some of the best of our whole trip. If you are thinking of doing it don't hesitate it's safe and really enjoyable.Side not they won't let you have two people on a quad if they weigh over 130kg together. Positive they have helmets with camera mounts so you can attach go pros etc."

            "review": "BRILLIANT!. Extremely good day out and absolutely the highlight of our adventures in Siem Reap. We did the full day tour with our guide Lucky. He was great! He picked us up at the hotel in a tuk tuk and we were taken to the Cambodia Quad Bike HQ. There we were given a safety briefing and a test drive. The quad bikes are in excellent condition. The whole day was spent off road crossing fields full of buffalo, going along red dirt tracks and passing through little villages.I recommend wearing clothes you don't mind getting very dirty (or as we did, buy some baggy elephant trousers for USD 2-3 and a t-shirt for USD 2-3). Make sure you use a lot of sun protection. Also there is a chance to give out goodies to the children as you pass through the isolated villages. The guide organises for you to buy a box of instant noodles to give out (which the children were extremely excited to receive). But if I did it again (which I most certainly would) I would go shopping for pens, pencils, books or toys for the kids."

This site said 2013 polaris and my husband who is a farmer , knows his quad bikes. He was suitably impressed. The were in excellent condition. We were given a safety briefing and test drive before we left. We chose the 3 hour country tour and it was perfect. We saw a different side to cambodia. The took us to a small farm and my husband was fascinated , rice farming, rice wine 40% proof!! Pigs , ducks. It was brilliant. We saw lots of children so I asked our guide why they were all waving and smiling. He said some people bring sweets. This was his chance to rip us off offering expensive sweets but I asked him to buy and he spent \u20ac4 and gave me 2 huge bags full. He was lovely. Every Child was so grateful and said thank you. It was a real bonus. We saw a temple , schools. Absolutely fantastic. I could not recommended them more. Thank you so much. Well worth the money."

With our wonderful tour guide Viseth - A and F - we arrived to our two to three hours tour. From start to finish were treated like royalties. Sharita is an amazing lady who puts no effort to be kind, she is naturally a queen beauty inside and out. I bet when Brad Pitt arrived to his Quad Bike ride he had second thoughts to adopt Sharita...we also wanted to bring her back with us home. We had an enjoyable training to check out our abilities but when we were ready to rock we have been given a most wonderful guide, who took us to see the many wonders of Cambodia's countryside. Our most memorable event was not just to tour around but the visit of one of the Pagoda's where we were introduced to the deep meaning of Buddhism and the effortless living of the monks. Return to base was a quad race for us Snow's. Luckily we have not melted on the way, the weather was just perfect for our ride. So was the delicious welcome home and the yummy home grown bananas. We hope to return to Cambodia and as we felt home there, became sisters and brothers with many of the locals, and we definitely will come by to give a hug to Sharita and the boys. We hope to quad around some more and experience even more wonders of this beautiful place. Many thanks to everyone involved making our time memorable and fun. See you all soon. Love from the Snowman, The Snowball and the little Snowflake..."

Sapay (not sure of the spelling) showed us how to drive the quads and we set off on our journey! Some of the terrain is rough and bumpy so if it's your first time driving a quad can be a bit scary but just listen to the safety briefing and concentrate on what your doing. After 5 mins you'll be a pro and all will be fine. Seeing the local kids wave at you and run along with you is really lovely and some of the countryside is amazing. We stopped to take photos beside a herd of water buffalo and finally arrived at our beautiful sunset destination. We had never been on quads before but really loved this experience. Our guide took loads of photos of us and was excellent throughout. I would highly recommend this company."

Other people were 2 on the quad so we asked if she could come with me. One Quad for 2 person is cheaper so they were not very happy. Finaly we went together on 1 quad but they make us pay the price for 2 diferent quad! We where ripped off. We also paid to drive 1 h 30 hour and to see the sunset but our driver stopped at least 15-20 min before the sunset ( all the others were still driving) and we waited there doing nothin! Driving quad is really cool but we shoud have taken an other agency Many others have better rates. Unfortunately they are not very professional and not honest"

We got to fang around the outskirts of Siem reap through rice fields, past farming and even the prison. Heaps of photo opportunities! Don't wear good clothes cos you end up dirty- but that's all part of the fun! An awesome experience that I'd highly recommend you do whilst in Siem reap!! We would do it again in a heart beat!

You drive through the paddy fields and the roads and get a great experience, we then went on to stop for sunset. This was all about driving the quad bike, they do tend to take your party/group on individual tours rather than everyone going as a group. The other tour company it seemed took everyone as a group. Everyone pretty much stops at the same place for sunset. Take your pick on what you like. Overall great experience and would recommend."

Being from the US and an experienced motorcycle rider I was concerned the guide would force a slow pace and stop more often than I wanted. This was not the case. Chan took us on awesome back roads and through rice fields most of the time. I was able to push my quad to the limit without having to slow down or stop very often at all. The few times we did stop they were for awesome photo ops and we were back on our way as quickly as we wanted. I highly recommend this tour. Two hours was enough for us but if you love quads or want a more leisurely pace go for the four hour. Oh, and ask for Chan."

Our pick up was on time and we were greeted very nicely at the facility. The instructors went through the safety procedures and let us each have a turn riding the bike to make sure we were confident and competent. We chose to take one quad bike so I could sit on the back and take pictures (I'm not as much of a thrill seeker). The instructor was very safe and friendly. We drove through villages and saw many children, cows and the daily life of people. We stopped for a rest break and the instructor encouraged me to have a turn he made me feel very safe and I'm very glad that he encouraged me to ride otherwise I wouldn't have experienced it. The instructor spoke very good English and stopped for a chat whilst we had a break. He was obviously very knowledgable about the area and assessed what my boyfriend and I would like to do and catered exactly to our needs. I would recommend this tour for anyone to have a go it was very worthwhile. A great company to go with, very professional, safe and FUN!"

Only downside was the constant egging for us to buy the children \"cake\" or \"noodles\".

These scams are prevalent all over Asia where the food you buy for the \"children\" is overpriced and ends up back in circulation for another unknowing tourist to buy. We ended up giving money directly to the children because if we bought the cake the children would get nothing and the guide a cut of the purchase.The guide also recommended we go to the floating village but we were aware of the scams there in advance so declined ($25 entry and $50 sack of rice that allegedly is for the children) Keep this in mind before you go!"

My youngest, 12 year old son, had a older employee ride with him but my son still got to drive. This was a very good solution. I was not worried and my son still had a great time. Two other young guys, employees, rode with us to guide us and make sure everyone was ok. We stopped by the crocodile farm which was interesting but really just a diversion and a little sad seeing crocodiles laying on top of each other.

The scenery was amazing and a definite great way to see more of the countryside and villages. Our wonderful guide Thea did a great job looking after us and patiently stopped when we needed to either take photos or just a breather from all the bumpiness. We would definitely do it again!!"

Explore off the beaten track with a quad bike, you get to see a lot more of the local life and wildlife as well as charge through various fields and streets on your quad. Extremely fun and a must do, saw the sunset over the rice fields and it was incredible. You WILL get extremely dirty so wear a paid of clothes you don't mind getting dirty and also your shoes could possibly get waterlogged so don't wear your best pair. Take a pair of sunglasses but if not you are given a paid as well as a mask to stop the dust."

Are we ever so glad things turned out the way they did!We decided to splurge on this activity since we really wanted to get out and see the countryside around Siem Reap up close. Cost for us was $100. for 2 persons, and included the guide, our own quads, and bottled water.As luck would have it, the tour we originally wanted to book was to go south to Tonle Sap Lake and look for migratory storks at a Wildlife Refuge a couple of hours from Siem Reap. Since our remaining time could not accommodate this, we opted for the quad tour instead. We really were kind of sad that getting to the wildlife refuge at the Tonle Sap lake was out of our reach time-wise, and had to resign ourselves to seeing the elusive Painted Stork some other year. Well, guess what? Once we got out to the countryside and were surrounded by rice fields, what did we see but a flock of Painted Storks, egrets, and a host of other migratory birds as well as a black shouldered kite hunting the smaller birds. So, in the end, we got our tour of the countryside, our photos of migratory birds, an excellent and fun quad experience, and an all's well that ends well kind of day.Needless to say, this was an outstanding tour and one we highly recommend."

Visited with a G Adventures group - we did the tour around 4.30pm in order that we could catch the sunset towards the end of the trip.It was very comforting to see at the start the safety procedures in place and each driver undertook a quick tutorial & 'driving test' to ensure they were accomplished enough to drive on the roads. Those who weren't confident about driving on their own on a bike were offered the opportunity to ride with a staff member.For our group of 8 drivers there were 4 staff drivers accompanying us with a couple at the front and a couple more at the rear - they also assisted at junctions in making sure the entire trail of bikes crossed safely etc. 2 of the staff were on 2 wheeled bikes so they could easily drop back to accompany some stragglers who got separated from the main group after a junction. Overall I was very impressed by their responsibility and safety.The ride itself was fantastic fun with great scenery and plenty of opportunities to stop for photographs with the staff all willing to assist in such photo taking.I would definitely do this again if I was in the area. The one thing I would warn customers to do is to bring clothes that they don't mind getting dirty as they will get a lot of clay-like red dust in their clothes and shoes!!!Highly recommended."

However, if you are good in riding, you can ride the bike yourself!! I think this is a great arrangement for those who wanna play but worst in driving or for those who good in driving.My tour guide named Mr. Phy, he is nice and great!! He take care us so much during the riding, for example he help to take photos of the surrounding views when I am riding the bike; he will wait the customer when they stop the bike to enjoy the views. The most important, he is a photographer. He helps us to take many beautiful photos, the photos as like as pre-wedding feeling. We saw he lie down and climb up to take the photos, we thanks so much with him.Moreover, the service of the company is cool and thoughtful!! They provide pick up and return service and they provide cold water and wet wipes after riding. I really enjoy the experience at Cambodia Quad Bike."

The cost is high for Cambodia, even for anywhere, but they were very professional. Picked us up promptly, made sure both of us had good control of the 4-wheeler and did a 10-15 minute training in a local field before we could drive. He (sorry I forgot the guide's name but he was awesome- young guy) started off very slow as requested. Kids sat in behind us and later in front and had a go on the flatter roads, with my thumb very much in control of the accelerator and brake! Once the guide realised we were Ok, we picked up speed a bit, slowing down for traffic (other books mostly). It's safe as the passing vehicles are going very slowly. Stopped in picturesque rice paddies and a beautiful temple. He was constantly checking we were Ok on the bumpy bits and very friendly. We rode mostly on dirt tracks but the roads were smooth. It is dusty and I advise a mask and dark clothes as the mud will stain. My son had a brilliant time. We stopped for drinks at a corner shop as it started to rain a little, which helped the dust. When we got back there were cool damp towels waiting for us and cold water. The place was professional and they took our safety seriously. I would recommend this for anyone and for older kids who have had enough of the temples."

Our hotel contacted Cambodian Quad Bike tours at 11am and they were able to fit us in at 130pm. When we arrived there was only the two of us on the tour, can't complain with a private tour. Our tour guide Borey was excellent, very informative, ensured we were safe and ok all the times. He obviously knew the back roads well as we cut through paddocks and streets on our return.We opted to buy some candy from a local store to had out to the local village kids, being a holiday all the kids were home! Needless to say we ran out of candy and had to restock half way. Yes we probably spent a good amount of time handing out candy then actually quad biking but it was well worth it just to see how happy the kids were. They were all so polite too. I know it was a hi light of my husbands trip also. Would recommend this tour to friends any family and would do it again if we ever came back to Siem Reap, I'd probably bring more candy though. Tip, it was rather dusty so we were covered in red dirt, don't wear anything white. We also got a bit muddy going through puddles. Wear sunnies to protect you eyes from the dust too."

There were guides in front and behind us, guiding us all the way. Going through the ricefields, seeing the farmers, the cows, the haystacks and then the sunset was really beautiful. What was really uncool was their upselling us on doing an hour and a half rather than an hour for$10 more per bike. It got dark after about 45 minutes so there was really nothing to see after, just follow the person in front. And, we weren't out an hour and a half, we were only out a little over an hour. when we pointed it out on our return, the woman said they didn't know it would get dark so early. Really? If not for the phony up selling I would've given it five stars.  It was by far the most expensive thing we did in Cambodia. Good time but not good value."

For some ridiculous reason, everyone else on my tour group decided to visit a floating village (apparently it was nice but nothing like as fun as this by the sounds of it) instead of doing the quad biking, which I had already pre-booked in a bundle before I left the UK.Alone and nervous, I was picked up from my hotel in a tuk tuk and taken to the quad bike centre. I was pretty worried as I'm naturally awful at driving things, but after signing an indemnity letter and being given a nice helmet and new mouth/nose mask, I was completely put at ease by a thorough safety briefing and instructions on using the bike. My guide Mr Thao (might have spelt that wrong) sat on the back of my bike and gently guided the handle bars occasionally if I had any issues steering or going over bumps. He also said that we could stop any time I wanted to take photos. First we went on a small trip down a side road (all roads were like red dirt roads) to ease me in, then we went on a 1.5 - 2 hour trip through villages and down roads before going across the flooded rice paddy fields, which was really really fun. I met two boys from another tour and our guides took lots and lots of photos of us on the bikes, jumping in the air, of the water buffalo etc. Then we watched the sun set across the paddy fields with the mountains in the background which was just incredible.Mr Thao was excellent and truly put me at ease. I really appreciated his efforts in photo taking too, I now have some amazing photos to remember this. Professional, friendly and above all, safe (this includes the ATVs).You'd be mad not to do this, it was worth every penny and more."

On the way back we were taken through a marsh like paddock which was awesome fun - lots of splashing and mud churning. A great time all round!Be prepared to get wet (in wet season) and the mud does stain clothes if not washed out straight away. Also make sure you sunscreen! The tuk tuks picking us up arrived early and then we forgot by the time we got there so our arms got roasted."

            "review": "Great Fun. 2 of us booked 1 quad bike for a 2-hour tour including the sunset at the rice field. We are totally new to Quad Bike (no knowledge on motorbike as well), but we felt very safe with the guidance of our guide, Heng, who picked us in person from our hotel with tuktuk and he is also our patient trainer and great photographer as well. He is always energetic and very attentive to us as new learner. We have a short training on the operations, and both of us will have a small trial to make sure we are capable to take care the bike. Since the sunset tour on website is for 1 hour, so we sent an e-mail to confirm if we can extend till 2-hour. The reply is so efficient and flexible to all requests. Next time we would probably do a longer tour and take care one bike individauly. The quad bike itself is in good condition mentioned by others. We did saw some other quad bikes on the way, but apparently ours looks newer.We drove to the farmland and saw many kids saying hello to us (they are different from the one we met at the temple, no offence, but they say hi without asking for anything) We stopped at the rice field and Heng made sure we took nice pictures. It was a good experience and we definitely recommend to all of you who are looking for some fun after all the site-seeing in Siem Reap."

It must be noted that there are a few companies doing this and the way to notice the difference is the Colour of the Quad bikes they use, Ours was the company that had the BLUE quadbikes and is 100% Cambodian Owned (I'll stop short of naming the company to avoid an advert type of review but I'm a firm supporter of locally run family businesses anywhere I go).Ask for the a tour guide named Borey as he speaks good English and always has a smile on his face and ensures we are safe. The bikes are in great condition and we were a little sad that we did not opt for the longer packages at the end of the journey.Note: Do wear long pants if possible as the location of Engine vents on the Polaris ATV\"S are poorly taught out as they are placed next to where your left foot resides and can get quite toasty. A fault of the manufacturer and not the tour people I reckon.Visited October 2015"

We are a family with 2 teenage girls and we are not all that \" adventurous \" and were a bit nervous about our ability . We had guides accompany our daughters ( and me ) but in the end we all did a lot of driving and enjoyed the afternoon immensely. The scenery is spectacular and we saw Cambodian countryside living up close .we did buy the noodles as suggested by the guides ( and they were expensive - $15 ) BUT the children came running out to greet us and really made the afternoon special . It was a small price to pay for such added enjoyment and memories . Our guides Lya , Bokey and Samnang were patient with our driving and were very interesting to talk to . They are to be highly commended . I would thoroughly recommend this adventure - especially to the non adventurous - we surprised ourselves and had a fantastic afternoon in the country ."

The guides take road safety seriously so you are in safe hands but allow you free reign once you are off the road and can go around the rice paddies going into big dips and ponds which was great fun. It is a beautiful time of day to see the countryside around Siem Reap and it ends with a view of the sunset."

We rode 2 to a quad, which worked fine for us. After a quick training session the quad was easy to drive and with 4 wheels it's safe. It was fun off the roads on rain-soaked dirt or muddy trails. We went through many small villages, met kids (our guide persuaded us to buy snacks to give the kids), and saw vast fields of rice being cultivated by hand and with the use of cattle. I thought about the notorious land-mine problem, but decided there was enough local back-road traffic here, and so many cultivated fields on all sides, that we wouldn't encounter any problems. We didn't. The guide stopped at the Sunset View point and rambled on a bit of a political rant that we didn't quite follow, but it was a great ride and we covered a lot of ground and saw may interesting sights. Highly recommended if you want to see more than just city streets!"

We rented the ATVs or Quad-Bikes for 3 hours and had a blasting good time!!!We were being ferried from our hotel to Cambodia Quad Bike. The crew first gave us a safety briefing and we had to sign an indemnity letter. We were then given instructions on how to operate the vehicle before we went hands-on with an instructor. The bike was easy to operate except that it needed a bit of power-steering. We were then fitted with some clean helmets and a surgical mask (to prevent breathing in dirt and mud splashes!) and we were good to go!My friend rode in tandem with our guide, Mr Heng, who was a young and very friendly chap! He brought us through rice fields and villages. Due to a heavy downpour the night before, we rode through puddles and mud, a lot of mud! It was an exhilarating experience and it provided us with a unique way of exploring Siem Reap.Mr Heng was a very attentive guide. He made sure that I was keeping up with him and would frequently turn back to check on me. Not only did he give us ample time to take in the expansive scenery, he was also our 'official photographer' snapping numerous pictures of us and getting us to be in various poses! =DA big thanks to Mr Heng for making our experience a fun and memorable one!!!"

They gave us nice clean helmets and face masks. They also taught us how to operate the bikes before we left and we had a practice run nearby. We had 2 guides coming with us. 1 on a quad bike and 1 on dirt bike to stop the traffic when we had to pass the main road. Overall, we felt safe the entire trip. The kids didn't want it to end. They were very sad when they had to go back."

Our driver Siela realized quickly we were the adventurous type and after a drive through the Cambodian countryside,which brought us through many villages and even a tour through a Buddhist temple, took us through \"adventure road\". Which took us through rice paddies and other marsh like environments. I can't put how special how this was into words. It was absolutely incredible. If you come to cambodia and are the adventurous type this is a must. We were well taken care of throughout the entire experience I felt at ease. All of this was due to Siela.

The hotel booked my family and I on a sunrise tour with Cambodia Quad Bike. At @ 4:00 AM our tuk-tuk driver was at our hotel with a smile on his face. That early in the morning we were delighted to see people our building fires and cooking. It gets so hot later in the day that early morning is the best time to build fires. We loved the tuk tuk ride.At the Cambodia Quad Bike headquarters we were given a verbal advice and then we each took a Quad Bike test drive. My Quad driver could sense that I wasn't real comfortable driving so he kindly offered to drive so I could take pictures. Our ride consisted of only my family - all females. I have to say that not for one second did I not feel safe. The drivers and tour guides were friendly but business life.We headed out for the rice fields, which was a trip in a life time. Just as we were getting there the sun came up. The sun rise was spectacular. I am not a good photographer but every picture that I took of the sunrise was beautiful. The guides allowed us to pull over and they took pictures of our party with the sunrise in the background.The trip into the country allowed us to see families outside cooking, working in the rice fields, and working with their water buffalo and their cattle. Some of the animals were staked out by the road; they were close enough to reach out and touch them if we wanted to. It truly was up close and personal.The quad ride allowed us to see a part of Cambodia that we will forever treasure. We were there early morning and met lots of local children riding their bikes to school. We were able to stop at a road side store to buy pencils and Ramen noodles to hand out to the children as they passed. The kids in that area were obviously poor but were so clean and kind and polite. We also bought a box of Ramen noodles to be taken to a local school.By far this excursion was my most favorite. Everything about the event was wonderful, especially the tour guides. They were the ones who made sure that we had the trip of a life time."

My partner and I had our own guide, and we spent 4.5 hours touring the area around Siem Reap. Our guide, Somnang, made sure to take us where we wanted to go, and stop for photos when we wanted to. You'll definitely get dirty on this ride, between the sweat and road dust, but it was lots of fun. Although it's one of the more expensive things to do in Siem Reap, we're really glad we went!"

Our guide Sophy was good at anticipating when we were finding out feet and when we were gaining confidence. Somehow we managed to find a way for my husband to go faster and have some fun and also for myself to go at a slightly more relaxed pace! It is a great way to see the Cambodian countryside. Be warned, don't wear anything too nice as you will get muddy! Recommended."

Lets get the price out of the way - it was worth every penny.Our guide picked us up bag on time - and off we went to the very professionally run business - safety briefing and wee test and we are off. The experience we got of the off the beaten track Cambodia was exactly what we wanted and being just two of and the guide made us fell very privileged. The roads are easily handled by the quads - this is not a tour to test the equipment or our skills we took easy and let the world around us do the rest.Boat trip and floating village (part of the tour) amazing - agin we are in the low season so felt almost alone - well organized and the village life was great to watch and photograph. Nest it was off for lunch at the house of our guides uncles - brilliant food and an insight to Cambodian life we never forget. Tour around the village on a ox cart was interesting! We were greeted by endless streams of children on the way back and their smiles were one of the highlights of our day.Could go on and on - but really if you are lucky enough to a have a day available spend it with these guys! @Cambodia Quad Bike - can you reply and add the name of out guide he was great!"

As you can tell from the rest of the reviews this place is awesome, the guides are knowledgable, accommodating, and know exactly what they are doing. I felt safe but also like I had room to push it a little bit and have a ton of fun. I could not stop smiling and I had the biggest grin on my face for hours afterwards. Obviously they are fantastic so I just want to give some specific tips. 1. I was really glad I wore long pants and closed toed shoes. The heat from the engine was warm but not at all uncomfortable with long pants. 2. I had a lot of fun and got muddy and dirty because of it so if you plan to really enjoy the experience be prepared to get dirty. I was soaked up to my knees! Puddles were awesome! But you can also easily avoid them.3. They give you masks but definitely bring sunglasses to protect your eyes from the little bit of dust and of course the beautiful Cambodian sunshine.4. They had a couple of helmets with GoPro/adventure camera mounts so be sure to bring yours!5. Don't be afraid! They are very safe and take you for a practice ride before you go out and there are at least 3 guides on the ride who even direct traffic for you. Recommend this 100%! I had a lot of fun taking pictures on the ride too so if you're interested in getting off the beaten path and taking pictures of the gorgeous countryside this is also a great trip for you! The guides were truly extraordinary too. Do it!"

They take you on a short safety lesson and were very accommodating that we did it together on the same quad but took us each individually with the guide. We then rode the beautiful Cambodian countryside for an hour with Tuy being willing to stop whenever we wanted and take as many photos as we wanted. He is also a great photographer :) Even though it is rainy season, we appreciated the time spent especially since it was our last night in Cambodia and the last night of our month long trip traveling. We could have done an hour or so more but we were tight on time and were glad to at least have the hour that we did book. I would definitely recommend it and this company if you are in Siem Reap."

We went to a local school (very small and very local ) and they practiced their English skills and it was marvellous . I wanted to give the teachers $20 for pencils etc but our ride leader suggested we should buy food treats at the small shop. I was sceptical but done as he suggested ,so on we ride to a Buddhist sanctuary ? And he showed us where the older Cambodian widows lived (sanctuary ) and they cooked meals for the monks as payment and again it was suggested we buy rice ,so to the local store and this time $35 for a bag of rice with no consultation with us ! I I let him know we were not the cash cow he thought we were and maybe we should do some riding!this was the only negative , otherwise the riding and scenery and bikes were sensational."

It started raining halfway through our ride and our leader was very quick to produce rain ponchos for us all. When going through a paddyfield we came across a small boy riding a water buffalo blocking our path so we stopped for a chat and he let us stroke it before they waded off into the water.

Our group of 5 visited 20th July 2015.We first rode into the countryside to see sunrise. It was too cloudy so after a brief stop continued on to a local market. It was very different to Siem Reap, only locals selling local produce and it was great to see. We then had the option of adventure or smoother road. We chose adventureThis gave us the chance to really gun it. We blasted through farmers fields with lots of little obstacles and it was great fun Flying over ruts and getting air. The guides were happy enough to let us be as adventurous as we wanted.But credit goes to when one of our friends took an unexpected swim. When passing a large pool of water at the edge of the field, he went too close and the bike tipped throwing him in! It was so funny. The guides helped pull the bike out of the water and check it was okay. A little wet, we continued back towards the start.Thanks for a brilliant morning! Pick up was bang on time, they gave you water at the start and end too. A must do if you like some adventure!"

We were led by guide - Somnang & Leh who brought us to nice paddy field for pictures taking and the highlight of the tour was to do some charity along the way - providing noodles to the kids in the school. We had so much fun interacting with the children.Thank you to Somnang & Leh ensuring our safety through the tour!"

Thought that it would be a good way to end of the day since I didn't have anything planned that evening. In the end, I decided on the 1.5 hour sunset tour and it was one definitely a great choice. My guide, Mr Tuy sovath, fetched me from the resort and expertly guided me through some really picture perfect rice fields and villages safely. In fact, I agree with some of the other reviewers who praised the dedication the company has for their clients as well as their commitment to safety. I will definitely recommend them to anyone who wishes to experience Siem Reap countryside"

He led us to villages, padi fields and best part was giving away packets of noodles to the kids. We were so glad that he suggested this because the highlight of the tour for me was seeing the smile on the children faces.He also took us to crocodile farm and temples, the good thing about him, he suggest a place and always said, it is up to us to decide.Give it a shot if you want to try something different.

Experiencing that is totally different from just wandering cities and you are just left speechless. Regarding the Cambodia Quad Bike company I can only say the very best. They were very organised, with a lot of staff ready to help you. Moreover, their devotion to safety is total. The guides are also knowledgeable and take good care of you.

For me, I felt that the tour explored parts of Cambodia that tourists aren't used to seeing. Beyond Angkor Wot and the bustling city life, there is a quieter farming community. The locals are all so happy and if you smile and wave they will immediately do the same. The kids will run up to your bike and hold our their hand for high fives, it really is a very cool experience. I am so happy and feel very blessed that I had this opportunity and hope I get many more like it. Good job to Cambodia Quad Bike!! And to Thea!"

It's not too informative of a trip (our guide didn't speak much English) but the visual/cultural aspect of it is worth it. WORD OF ADVICE: it's a lot of time in the sun with little shade.

We had been on a shorter quad ride on a prior trip to Cambodia with a competitor. We decided to give this outfit a try and we're glad we did. First, we decided to take a pretty long ride this time (4+ hours). It's a lot of riding and you will get dusty and exposed to lots of sun! So, think about bringing some long pants to slip over your shorts, a windbreaker/jacket, tennis shoes, and do use the goggles/dust masks provided. The company does a good job upfront on safety and prep before you hit the ride. The tour guides know the roads and sights well, and will take your input on things you want to see if you have some specific desires. We wanted to go out to the Tonle Sap, see some local temples and local life, stop at a crocodile farm, and see the expected sunset in the rice paddy field. What's nice on a long ride is you can go at your pace, decide on changes on the fly on what you want to see, and stop/tour anything along the way. The guides are very accommodating on taking pictures. What a thrill it is to run into and pass through a pack of oxen on the road, and the young kids all along the route run out and wave eagerly. The quads are all well maintained, clean as a whistle at the start, and in excellent mechanical condition, almost like new. Having ridden a couple different quads before in Cambodia I really like the Polaris Trailboss 330's they use here. Plenty of power and suspension travel to deal with the rough roads. When you get back from a ride, they have water and good facilities to clean up in. Also, Wifi is available onsite if you want to post some pics right away. We thoroughly enjoyed our ride, our friendly tour guide, and highly recommend giving them a try!"

So for first timers like myself they helped me feel excited and comfortable to the point where I was ready to take off. The team led us through streets, rice paddies, dirt roads, bumpy off roads, dust, sand and cows crossing our paths. We stopped to watch the sun set over the rice paddies and water where a delightful young boy was sitting with his water buffalo. He was there for our purpose which I loved. Got to pat and sit on a big buffalo. Thought it was worth every dollar. You get to have a bit of speed and also go slow. The best."

The bikes go pretty fast so you have to be confident enough to be able to control the bike's push throttle, and slow down on the bumps, but you're looked after by the crew on trail bikes and their professionalism and enthusiasm adds to a safe and enjoyable experience. You can even add your own tribute to their walls afterwards."

Extremely professional and easy to deal with when booking and asking questions, as well as on my amazing three hour quad bike adventure. I chose Cambodia Quad Bike for their flexibility in start times for my ride. Chan, my guide, picked me up at my hotel exactly on time, drove me by tuk-tuk to the company HQ and we started with a quick lesson right away.It didn't matter that i was the only one booked on the tour, in fact it turned out to be amazing as my one and only request was immediately looked after- I wanted to meet the local kids. Being told before hand that there will be a lot of kids around, i came with presents- toys, stickers, hair clips, books, colouring books and crayons etc. Chan took my camera and snapped away photos of me and the kids- preserving the very best memories I have of beautiful Cambodia. The scenery, the awesome heat and dust, the buffalo, the monastery and temple and the fresh squeezed sugar cane juice were also highlights, but I cannot thank Chan enough for giving me the time I wanted with the local kids.All in all, I have to say this was one of the most unique experiences I've had and cannot recommend Cambodia Quad bike enough. Oh, and by booking online, I was given a discount I wasn't even aware of- great, honest company! Thanks Chan and crew! And thanks for the bananas after my ride! Delicious!"

He answered all our questions, took some great photos and helped us both feel confident on the quads. We did a little bit of driving through the fields which was such fun. The spot he chose for the sunset was spectacular. It was just us in the middle of these fields and the sunset was great. I really enjoyed the trip it was $35 for an hour and a half. I would definitely do it again!"

This isn\u2019t a knock on Angkor Wat by any means, but when I travel I do like to get my heart racing a bit and get the adrenaline going; this tour was the fix. If you do sign up for the tour, sign up for the sunset ride. The ATVs take you out to the countryside where you can ride through the rice fields past water buffaloes, beautiful landscapes, and Cambodian farmers at speeds up to I would say 40-50 mph. Our guide, Heng, was great as well, stopping at various points to let us take photos and take photos of us. But the best part of the tour was the sunset. We stopped at a rice field with practically no one else around. In front of us a family of about 50 ducks marched along without a care, and a water buffalo chilled beside us. The sunset itself was incredible, so serene and vibrant with color. Whereas the Angkor Wat sunrise was amazing to see because it was both iconic and awe-inspiring, the sunset we saw in the rice fields was spectacular because of the zen-like calmness it brought."

The bikes are super easy to control, even for old man like me. Easy to control...my wife and I need that! We rode tandem with only us and our guide. The bike we rode and the other ones we saw looked like new. Our guide, Phuy-Phy, was great, he knew all the cool off road places to go...definitely go on this ride planning to get a bit dirty and wet...this is the fun part. You see the back country of Cambodia and the little villages with the friendly local people. Everywhere you go, friendly people waving to you. Dirt roads, trails between rice patties, mud flats; you and your bike will return looking like you had fun. We did!The bike company gives you an opportunity (up to you) to give back for the good things our lives have given us. Phuy-Phy told us about the poor kids and encouraged us to buy a box of noodles, small or large, large has 50 packs of noodles to give to the kids as we go thru the villages. Direct adrenalin insertion to your heart! We bought the big box, 50 noodle packages to give to the kids as they surround your bike when you stop. Many stops in many little neighborhoods. It was so rewarding that we bought a second big box, so when we were done we gave 100 kids noodles (not candy...food!). They thought it was a trill to see us! We thought it was a thrill too! The ride is cheap...so were the noodles (we paid $30 for 100 gifts of food to smiling faces so that is 30 cents per kid). Our hearts were so warmed...the mud puddles where so cool. Definitely do this adventure...it is a great company that enables you to be a meaningful part of the world! And have a thrill!"

You get to drive the quadbikes by yourself through the beautiful countryside of Siem Reap. There is a guide in front who shows you the way. He will go quite fast if you want, so you never feel that it's too slow. If needed there is also guides that go with you on the bike to help you drive. It's very adventurous to drive through the dusty dirtroads, see the farmers and to encounter cows etc. on the road. The best part was the stunning sunset , one of the most beautiful ones I have ever seen! The tour can seem a bit expensive for Cambodia, but it is definitely worth it. I can highly recommend to do that tour while in Siem Reap."

All round it was a great 4hrs, we'll be back again to take Sophy up on his offer to do a longer, forest, ride next time.We booked online from Australia and had no issues, just check your spam filter - it sent their replies to the spam folder. We also got a 10% discount for booking online.Thanks for a great ride Sophy."

They also advised us to take goodies to give out to the children, which went down a storm!To start with the team are very courteous and professional and we knew from the outset this was not a riproaring race through the jungle (so if you think it is, dont book). They are safety focused and our briefing and training ride was good enough to know I felt safe taking my 13 and 9 yr olds out on these bikes. Our rider was very clear that we would not be 'tearing' through villages as this was not appreciated, rather it will be a lesiurely drive through the villages, stopping off to say hi and giving away the goodies we brought. This suited us just fine.The pace was perfect as we were able to apreciate the beautiful landscapes and we stopped so many times and were greeted by many kids and families, our kids were humbled at the sight of young kids herding cattle, tending the rice fields and having little in the way of clothing or other modern conveniences. A great lesson for my kids on how lucky they are.We finished off with a gorgeous sunset and a nice staedy ride back through open fields and tracks and we finished wanting more.So we went back after 2 days and did a 2 hour ride (we got the same guide which was great) and the manager gave us a discount for returning so quickly. And as we had no more goodies to give away, our guide recommended we purchase some noodles at a local store and hand these out rather than candy, as it would feed a whole family. This was a brilliant idea and cost nothing, again it was really appreciated by the families and we again were greeted warmly by everyone. Our guide took us on a totally different route and included some nice offroad action and a stop off at a temple which he told us all about, he gave us lots of info about cambodia too and its history.The steady pace at which we went through the villages and the respect we gave to others on the roads went a long way. We did see other quad bike rides tearing around near the end of the sunset tour but Cambodia Quad Bike company dont allow it.The team will pick you up at your hotel and rreturn you, our guide was great and we even had his Father driving us to the quad bike location...nice.Loved it and would do it again, make sure its with Cambodia Quad Bike if you do it and book direct rather than through a hotel, you may get a discount.

The location of the quad bikes is only about a 15 min journey from the centre of town. The operators of the company were very professional throughout our our. We were each asked to sign away all liability responsibility should we have an accident or run over a farm animal. We were given a quick lesson on how to ride the bikes and a little test before we were on our way. The bikes are really easy to ride and anyone can operate one after a few minutes tuition.We rode on dirt roads and tracks around the outskirts of Siem Reap, through small villages and rice fields. We stopped briefly at a Buddhist temple and orphanage. A couple of boys from the orphanage begged for money however our guide, who himself grew up in an orphanage, advised us not to give them money but to buy packet noodles across the street and hand them out. Apparently noodles are areal treat for the kids as they mostly just eat rice. We bought 30 packets of needles for $12 and handed these out during our ride through the villages.We really enjoyed our ride and I would thoroughly recommend a quad bike tour while you are in Siem Reap."

My friend, however did not have any guide on her bike so whenever we stopped for a break the guide would fill her in on what we had talked about. At any point, if we wanted to stop to take a rest or take pictures we could and I enjoyed that very much. We were picked up from our hotel and received training shortly on how to drive the bike before taking off. They provided the helmet and a mask since the country roads are quite dusty. After the tour, we were given water, wet tissues to clean up and a ride back to the hotel. We took the 4 hour trip and I loved every minute of it! I would absolutely recommend this tour to anyone who wants to get out of the downtown full of people. The villages were so interesting to see and my guide was great. It was a bit hard to ride around for 4 hours even with breaks, but they also have shorter trips for those who feel like they might not like to be riding around that long. Luckily, this is Cambodia so after my 4 hours on the bike, I went and got a massage! Also, make sure to wear sunscreen or cover up because you will be out in the sun for a long time. It gets hot on the bike so choose what you wear wisely! You will come off the bike quite dusty afterwards."

It was a brilliant day as we went through the countryside and along the way you will see locals especially small kids waving and saying Hi to you and the sunset at the paddy field was just amazing. Definitely a unique way to see the other side of Siem Reap but with a little bit of action thrown in it. :)I suggest you do at least a 2-hour tour to get the most out of it. (we did a 1-hr tour but felt it was a bit too short since we did a lot of stops along the way). Also bring some sweets / candies for the kids as you might be making a short stop at a small village and the expression on their faces is just priceless. Seeing how they live is also a reminder of what a luxury world we are all living in. In short, don't hesitate just do it! ;)"

The beginning of our trip was a little crazy - we were on the bikes and zooming round before I really knew what I was doing - but pretty soon I was gaining confidence and going really fast.It was a great way to see the countryside. The sunset was unlike any I've ever seen - so beautiful over the rice fields.Our guides were friendly and helped me when I got my bike stuck in the mud.. oops! All in all we had a great time, and I'd highly recommend it."

The ride was amazing even though it had been while since I last rode a quad bike (Queensland circa 2005), so I was definitely a bit rusty. The guide was very patient and drove slow until I really got my confidence and coordination. We stopped a couple of times to take photos. When passing the village we saw a number of kids playing around the street so my guide asked me if I wanted to give them some treats. I agreed because there was a shop near by from which I purchased approx 20 pkts of crisps for $6 usd. The kids were delighted as all of them came running to me and patiently waited for their pkt. I didn't feel pressured into buying them the treats or anything. And it was a very small price to pay for the smiles on their faces. The sunset was beautiful. Over the paddy fields, it looked so peaceful and calm over there. I realise that the quads are pretty noisy but I don't get why tourists who ride these bikes and then leave reviews stating that it's unethical due to the noise pollution. My response to that is, just don't do it then. This is a developing country- they have other bigger problems that they concentrate on rather than some silly sound that comes from a bike. Also, this is providing employment to a lot of locals so I don't see why it's so bad."

We were firstly prepped at the base and given helmets. A short lesson was given, with a guide, to get us used to the quads. Those who were not confident then had the option of having a guide for the ride. We then headed out of town into the country side- seeing rice padis, harvesting the rice manually, chicken farms, duck farms, buffalos and much more. The trip culminated with a fantastic sunset over the rice fields. A great afternoon. A very well run company, with experienced guides and extreme safety standards. Would recommend to all.

We got up close to some water buffalo soaking in the mud, saw some rice farming, and generally had a nice day in the sun. Even though it was hot, the breeze made it feel good!

I was the only tourist, so I simply followed behind my guide on his two wheel motorbike.The quads bikes are sturdy, feel very safe and have enough grunt o enjoy the experience of \"wind rushing through your hair\". We went along some quiet roads, then across an open field, where I could gain confidence in the bike. After settling into the riding, I simply enjoyed seeing the rural villages roll by and to witness the local life.We stopped off at a Pig farmers house, tried rice wine and said hello to the whole family. The kids are always looking for a smile and a wave. We also visited a temple, a crocodile farm and rested near an old temple, where we had the most delicious iced coffee.Returning along more rural roads, it was fascinating to see how the rural Cambodian people live. A harsh life, but they have great spirit.The whole trip took fours hours and was both relaxing and entertaining. Had lots of fun!!!!"

They were serious about safety and went on a \"test run\" before we headed out. 3 of our kids had were allocated riders to sit behind them and help which was no extra cost. With all that said the experience of riding through the quiet back streets was simply amazing, one of the best things I could recommend. Towards the end of the ride we ended up in an open field that was wet and muddy and we were allowed to go through it if we wished. Well we wished and it was the most fun thing I have ever done with my family. The guides, about 5 of them on motorbikes, were there to make sure we stayed safe but allowed us to really enjoy the experience. All in all I would say if you come to Cambodia its on the top of the list of things to do and I would recommend this company due to the safety aspect. 10 out of 10!"

The local guide also stop there at the community to explain to us about way of life of the community. I can see that the kids and community people started to come around us to join us.

We are travelling with a 16 daughter and 18 year old son and weren't quite sure if this type adventure would be appropriate for the younger one with very little to no (car) driving experience and license yet. So decided against taking the younger one and just went with my son who was quick to call this the \"best part of our trip so far!!\".Keeping things in perspective (let's not forget the main reason of our trip to the area ;-)) I'll have to admit this was indeed a fun and very safe activity! In hindsight, I wish my wife and daughter would've come along for the 2-hour ride over mainly dirt roads, rice fields as well as through nearby villages. As others have reported, we saw many friendly and smiling faces along the way, so make sure to be respectful, slow down and smile back! Chitra Hour - our awesome English-speaking guide - led by example and was very helpful by letting us know when to go easy and when to let go off the throttle. He also pointed out places and shared a few experiences during a couple of stops that felt \"special\", so the two of us definitely felt taken care of in a very caring way. Wear clothes and shoes you do not mind getting wet and (permanently) stained from the red mud. I wore flip-flops, shorts and a short-sleeve 50SPF shirt. Make sure to apply sunscreen liberally and you will thank yourself later!I didn't bring a water-proof bag for my phone/camera and wallet but Pon Pov (the owner) provided one as well as drinking water for the trip before departure.You will have to sign a waiver (used to that from home, so no problem) releasing the operator from any liability and making you responsible for your actions. Again, nothing unusual in my mind. Received some quick instructions from our guide and off we went!Overall, great experience and we could've gone on for at least another hour!Time flies when you're having fun but now back to the equally awesome temple tours... ;-)"

Great way to see local life past a lot of smiling and waving kids. Luckily we wore old scrappy shorts and Tshirt as it was the wet season and there is mud everywhere... which is the whole point of the trip! We went through every puddle full speed which was the best part. We got caught in a downpour which made it even more fun. We then stopped by a village for done drinks and they brought us water from the well to clean off the mud and even bright a plate of chicken liver for us to munch on with our drinks. We tried it but it wasn't to our taste so our guide happily ate it all himself. I can't recommend this your and outfit enough. Don't miss it if you're in Siem Reap!!!!"

They turned that around straight away with their welcoming smiles. The place has enough staff that they don't leave anyone waiting. We had a group of over a dozen yet I always felt taken care of and never had to wait for anything. The instructions were very clear and the bikes easy to drive. Before going on your own they teach you, provide a helmet and test your ability to ensure safety. All the staff have great English. Once you hit the road it's fantastic and then at the farmland it gets even better. Flats, Bumps, Puddles and the occasional slowing for a herd of cows. People like me could let loose a little and the more conservative drivers went at their own pace. There were enough guides that getting left behind or held up weren't options. Every single person had the time of their life and walked away with a glowing smile, dirty wet shoes and no regrets. I don't think anyone should travel through without making time for this experience. Thank you Cambodia Quad Bike! xx"

We could stop to take photos whenever we wanted and although the sunset was rather cloudy, we still had an amazing, adrenaline-filled time. Workers and children stopped to smile and wave as we passed. It was so much fun to see parts of the countryside not seen from the main roads. Go for it - you'll regret it if you don't!!"

We had seen Ankor Wat via helicopter in the morning (a must-do btw, even if it was a trifle expensive at $150 pp for 12 minutes) and had booked the quad bikes for the afternoon. May in Siem Reap was bloody hot. Ambient temperature in the shade was 38 deg C so we were in two minds about heading into the hot countryside. As it turned out, it was one of the best things we did in Cambodia.We took the 75 minute blast and at $35USD it represented excellent value for money. The quads were very well maintained - spotless, tight brakes, wicked suspension, good handling and with a 330cc power plant, plenty of grunt to get the back end sliding. Which we did. A lot.Our two guides were on chook-chasers and were very nice guys. They soon figured that the three of us were not there to drive Miss Daisy so they found some epic dirt trails in the hinterland where we could let loose. We got airborne on several occasions but the machines were very forgiving.As per previous reviews, be careful when you head through the small villages. There were some places where it felt as though you were intruding so treat the locals with respect and button off to a slow crawl when passing through.THINGS WE DID RIGHT: We had some mountain biking gear so having a sweat band, proper glasses, a good ventilated helmet and gloves made the whole experience even better. Also, wear your trainers. Best of all, there was a cold Cambodia beer waiting back at base camp to knock the dust off.THINGS WE DID WRONG: Not doing it all again the next day. Fantastic fun."

First of all, they picked us up at our hostel and brought us to the office, gave a great, simple, informative briefing about what we were going to do and how to use the quad. At first we were a little apprehensive, not about the quad but because there were so many other people there we thought it might be boring to all caravan around the plains. What they did though was take us on our own with 2 guides on motorbikes so we could go as fast as we wanted and didn't have dozens of other people around! When we got to the spot to see the sunset they took heaps of photos of us together and got us to do silly poses with a beautiful sunset for the background. They told us funny stories and about the culture, weather and lifestyle of local Cambodians. LOVED this tour, thanks for a great time!!"

Tuk-tuk pickup included, then a run through of the basics (I was a first-timer, but had no problems picking it up after a little test circuit to get our bearings). Each tour is led by a motorcyclist who guides you onto the safest and smoothest part of the road or track (very handy if you're not used to driving on the right hand side of the road like us). We even had our own traffic controller who rode up ahead to stop traffic at busier intersections - VIP experience!You'll ride through small villages, past farms and rice fields and go into a few areas which I think are just on the tour to let you max out on the throttle - great fun! You'll occasionally share the road with a cow or two which is a novel experience for an Aussie. For our tour, we stopped in an open area around sunset so there's plenty of time for photos and getting some information about the surrounds. I'm an adrenaline-junkie, but I also like knowing I'm safe and this ticked both boxes for me. Staff were super-friendly and the whole thing came across as very professional from pickup to drop off. I'd highly recommend and I'll be coming back for a longer tour next time I'm in Cambodia. One of our Cambodia highlights for sure."

Also put the visor for the helmet down and even wearing sunglasses helps reducing dust entering your eyes. The safety briefing & test drive at the start was professional too, and they have sinks and hoses to clean down afterwards, and a bottle of water and wet tissues to cool down with as they get the tuk tuk to take us back to our hotel.

Certainly a great way to add a bit of adventure to your visit of the beautiful sites of Angkor."

            "review": "INCREDIBLE way to explore Siem Reap. A friend and I traveled Cambodia in January 2014, this was one of our absolute highlights. We took the quad bikes off past the rice fields and watched the sunset over the farmland. The sunset tour was meant to last around 1 hour but we had around 2 hours on the bikes and we didn't feel rushed to head back at all. We set off just us two and a guide which was great as we could set our own pace. As I hadn't driven a quad bike before and wasn't as confident the guide was happy to sit behind me and direct me, this was optional and there was also the opportunity to go quite fast. It was a fantastic way to get to see the local villages and a completely different side to Siem Reap. The guide was happy to answer any of our questions but didn't force too much information at us. I would highly recommend, definitely worth every penny!"

It felt like being in a game like Far Cry :) I was lucky to be alone with the guide so we could drive at fast speed all the time. He took pictures and guided me to a great spot to see the sun going down. In the end u get a water and a refreshing towel. Perfect for men who loves to feel speed and if you want to explore cambodia on the countryside!"

            "review": "For the adventurer. What a fun trip with the family. My wife and I had our own bikes, kids of 15 and 11 rode with a guide who let them drive more and more as they showed proficiency. We saw the countryside with little kids waving at us as we passed their homes. It's the dry season, Feb, so lots of dust but the guides were ready with masks for us. We stopped at a monestary/temple and interacted with some of the kids who the monks look after. The guide also said we could stop at an orphanage if we'd like. No pressure but he did suggest, that if we wanted to help we could take them food rather than cash since we are sure they would use the food. We stopped at a local market and the shopkeeper tried to take advantage of us, 50 Usd for a bag of rice and 20 for a case of Ramen. Unfortunate. The orphanage was great lot see, kids were very cute and we did take them some suckers. Advice for future travelers, find a way to purchase the stuff before you get out on the road, maybe take a soccer ball or some other gifts for the kids. The kid who guided us spoke excellent English and they have daily English classes with one time a week Japanese. We opted not to give cash, but will donate later, wish we had more to bring them. The ride out through the countryside was lots of fun, rice fields and people moving cattle and riding bikes and scooters. We stopped for a picturesque sunset. If you are in Siem Reap this is a great way to get out of town and see some of the country. The company is Cambodian owned, equipment is top notch, rode well, started easy, and the staff was excellent. I highly recommend this company."

We explored villages and fields we couldn't have seen any other way. Plenty of time to stop for photos, and they do trips of all different lengths. If you do this though, please don't give hand outs to the children who come out to wave - they are learning to approach tourists for goodies, which makes them very vulnerable."

We spend two hours going by small trails through villages that most tourists don't get to see. The sunset over the rice fields was truly breathtaking. Our guide was very helpful as well.

            "review": "Cambodian Countryside by Quad 4x4. While visiting Cambodia for the first time (Siem Reap/Angkor Wat), I was anxious to rent a scooter to get around town. When I asked my hotel (Le Meridien) about renting scooters, they said it's not common, as tuk-tuks are so available and cheap ($2-$3 into town). But they mentioned that there were companies that have quad 4x4 tours.My time was limited in Siem Reap, so I was pleased to find out there were half-day and full day tours. My plan was to visit Angkor Wat Temple complex at sunrise and do Cambodia Quad Bike's 'Sunset Tour'. With a pickup (via their own tuk-tuk) from a 22 year old Cambodian boy (who ended up being my tour guide - I can't remember his name, but he was GREAT) at 4:45pm, we arrived at their place of business and was greeted by their very friendly staff. After a quick, but thorough safety demonstration, we waited to see if there would be anyone else to join our group. Luckily I have my own private tour (the guide rides on a motorbike ahead of you). The quad is very easy to drive (even if you're a novice), but still powerful enough to be exciting.We toured the country side of Cambodia and got a taste of how many of the farmers live. We stopped by rice patties with a view of the sunset over a 'mountain' (large hill - but still very scenic). My guide even stopped to pull some rice out and show me how they extract it (it was red rice, one of two types of rice they harvest). This was interesting for me, since I've never seen it before. We drove past many livestock, literally inches from you on the road, and many farmers and their adorable children who all wave at you. My guide even stopped and let me drive fast on a circle of dirt roads, so I could go fast.Overall, I would highly recommend the Sunset Tour, especially if you don't have a full day to use. It was only $30 and I tipped the guide an extra $10 because he was so friendly. Upon arrival to the business at the end of the tour, they greet you with wet towels to clean your hands/face and bottles of water. The owner even came out and introduced himself. He was very friendly as well.If you are choosing between Sunrise Tour and Sunset Tour, I would suggest the Sunset Tour - go to Angkor Wat for Sunrise! It was amazing.I only have one negative - is that there wasn't more of the 'off-roading' I was expecting. However, that is not their fault, it was my fault for not understanding that the Cambodian landscape is extremely flat. In retrospect, it was a great experience.James"

We did the Sunrise Discovery Tour on the 18th November, 2013 and this was one of the most memorable highlights of our trip.Our Tour Guide \"Sin\" led us on the most amazing journey through the very colourful countryside of Siem Reap. Words cannot describe the beauty of a Cambodian Sunrise with the array of contrasting colours over the rice paddy fields. To see the early morning farmers and villagers go about their daily business away from the mainstream was truly fantastic. All of the locals greeted us with a bright smile and friendly wave and the children would come running from their homes with eager anticipation... be sure to have plenty of bags of lollies/candy to hand out to them along the way.This tour is worth doing just to see the smiling children alone! And the Quad Bikes themselves were all brand new with plenty of power and so fun to drive. Our Tour Guide \"Sin\" we compliment very highly, he was very friendly and informative all the way through. We highly recommend tour and company. Cameron & Skye."

            "review": "Amazing Christmas Day!!!. My partner and I did the half day tour (4 hours +) with these guys from around lunch time till sunset on Christmas Day. The price was USD $100/ quad bike. We got a quad bike each. Totally worth doing (I am so happy I didn't share). And it's such good value for the time you get to quad bike. Also these guys are a new company so all their quad bikes are brand new (2013 models) and in fantastic condition. The owner told us that all the quad bikes are imported from the USA. And these bikes are fantastic. They have very easy handling, stability, and can go up to 80km/hr. We can not describe how amazing these guys were. Firstly our beautiful tour guide picked us up from our hotel. When we got to the quad bike shop, the instructors took the time to show us how to operate the bikes (was quite easy), but then they took us on a test run to make sure we were ok riding them. They also ensured we knew their safety rules - again very impressive in a country where sometimes safety isn't considered greatly. They then set you up with a helmet and face mask and off you go. The tour itself was amazing and so picturesque. We were taken all around rural areas surrounding Siem Reap - make sure you take your camera as the surrounds are a photographers dream. The highlight would have to be the kids though. As you drive through the farmlands and rural setting, all the children run out to wave to you as you pass them. They are so beautiful. Our tour guide helped us buy a few bags of lollies and we stopped on several occasions to hand out lollies to the kids. They all loved it. And it definitely made our day seeing their faces light up that way just from a couple of lollies. So make sure to buy a few packs of lollies when you go out as it is so much fun stopping to speak to the kids and giving out lollies. This was honestly one of my highlights I'll take back home. We had the greatest day thanks to our tour guide. He took us to the most beautiful places, answered all our questions, and always ensured we were both ok. We even had an afternoon detour near a temple for some fried noodles for lunch - delicious!! If you are in Siem Reap and templed out, I would highly recommend this on your trip agenda as it is amazing and I haven't seen anything else quite like it in Asia. You won't regret it. These guys are absolutely amazing and will look after you so well whilst you are in their hands. Hope you enjoy it as much as we did. Thanks again Cambodia Quad Bike for an amazing afternoon we will never forget. Regards,Christina and Goran from Australia"

            "review": "Once in a lifetime experience - Sunset over the rice paddy. I joined the team of 4-5 friends to take this new Quad bike from the town of Siem Reap to the rural area. It was safer than I thought and especially this company provides us with insurance for 3rd party. This helps my friends not to worry while driving in the countryside in case we might accidentally hit the stray dog. The best time to start this tour is either early in the morning for the sun light is beautiful for the photos or do it in the after noon for the sunset over the rice paddies. I did the evening one and i love it to see the farmers heading home, bringing hay to the cattle, or washing their cow in the small pond. This is how we can see the livelihood of people and it is outside the urban city where is not authentic. Come with this company as sometimes they have the project to bring some books or commodities to give it back to the poorer communities outside the center. So it is not only fun and adventure, customers get a chance to return something to the poorer communities."
