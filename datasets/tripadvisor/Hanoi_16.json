Lots of touts at the entrance trying to sell fans, cyclo rides on the way out etc. It's an interesting place but really small - hard to believe it was once a university by modern day standards, you can probably cover this well within 45 minutes if you read the signage, take some photos and wander the 2 shops. It has some architecture which wouldn't look out of place in China. The shops inside sell some interesting goods which we haven't seen elsewhere in the city and prices are pretty reasonable so we didn't even barter over the small amounts of money involved. We were lucky and watched as the security guys fed the koi fish which are otherwise hidden in the pond. There were a ton of them!! Definitely worth a visit."

It is evident that there was also heavy Chinese influence in the history of Vietnam. The location exudes tranquility and peace in the middle of the busy town.

Beware of trishaw cheats!!! The taxi fare from one tourist spot to another one is usually less than 100,000 VND. Do not take small taxis, they are usually run by cheats with rigged taxi meters. A short trip from Ho Chi Ming Mausoleum to the Hanoi Opera House cost me 485,000 VND! It should only be about 100,000 VND according to my estimate.

All of which is true.But The Temple of Literature is significant in many respects.Firstly, it is a truly historic place, and many of the sculptures and stone statues here hark back to many hundreds of years. They would be valuable collector pieces if one were so inclined.Secondly, this location, and the streets around it demonstrate what an old city Hanoi really is. This is the very first university of Vietnam.Hanoi city is over a 1,000 years, and this temple to Confucius, and learning in general, is not much younger (built approximate 1070AD apaprently).Thirdly, this is literally a monument to the value of education that is held by the people and culture of Vietnamese.So now you know why Asian kids are so smart!"

The temple itself is nothing special though the grounds surrounding it that are a joy to walk through. I would say that this is a must visit when in Hanoi. There is a small fee for entrance. Come in the late afternoon when it isn't so hot (if you're here in the summer that is).One word of warning. Do not get into one of those touting \"taxis\" that are waiting outside at the entrance. These are independent operators and cons. They may have meters but their meters are rigged and you'll end up paying at least 3 times more than the normal fare. Walk a little away from the entrance and hail a cab. If you try to hail a cab in front of the entrance the touts may get aggressive. As a general rule in Hanoi, look for the taxis that are from one of the main companies (e.g.Taxi Group, ABC). They will display the fare rates as well as a Driver ID prominently on the dash. It's a shame that these scammers are allowed to operate as they blemish an otherwise pleasant city."

It was very hot, and part of the time it rained, but I still got a good feel for the place. This place was the first university in Vietnam. It's been here for nearly a thousand years. It's clearly been restored and is in very nice condition, with plenty of effort spent on the gardens in particular. They had a variety of topiaries, trees, flowers, ponds, a temple, statues, shops, and carved, decorated historic gates with some fairly good signage explaining the stories of the past. I enjoyed the beauty of the plants and the elaborate, ancient style of the architecture, even without a guide to explain too much. I had researched it ahead of time, so it wasn't too difficult to walk around and get the idea. It's not too complicated to walk through- one main path goes down the middle, through a series of gates, gardens, pavilions, and courtyards, to the temple in the back.The best part was the courtyard edged with rows of turtles with the 'stelae of the doctors' on their backs. The stelae are 72 large stone tablets, listing the names of university graduates over hundreds of years. Many carvings were faded and worn away, but taken in its entirety, it's very impressive. It really brought alive the idea of the scholars coming there, year after year, for hundreds of years, hoping one day to see their names carved on a tablet like the ones in those rows. What surprised me was that each turtle was a little different, unique from one to the next. I guess it's natural, since some of them were made many generations after the first ones, and styles and techniques change.Overall, a very enjoyable 1.5-2 hours to wander around, buy a postcard and a souvenir, enjoy the gardens, read the history, and take lots of photographs. There are a bunch of shops towards the back, in the courtyard before the temple. You could get a drink or a snack (and lots of other souvenirs) and enjoy it in the gardens. There was a bathroom, but if I remember right, you should be sure to bring change, because it costs 1000 dong to use it."

The most inner courtyard (5th) is the Imperial Academy/University. We learn from our guide that the historical literature and philosophy are Confucius-based. Built in the 11th Century, this temple and layout is based on the original Confucius temple in Shandong, China. The traditional early Vietnamese-based writing system is based on the Chinese character writing system (Han characters) with a few additions of local words. The pervasive Vietnamese Imperial examination system that filled the civil bureaucracy for centuries is based on the Chinese Imperial Examination. Even the titles of the first, second, and third place finisher of the examination are the same as those of Chinese. The students had to learn all the Chinese literary classics such as the Four Books and Book of Rites. In the 16th century, Portuguese missionaries invented a phonetic language system based on Portuguese alphabets - for the main purpose of evangelizing. It was not officially adopted until 1918 as part of the nationalist movement. The Latin system is easier and quicker to learn, thus bring more people into literacy. However, the government now recognizes that this cuts the newer generations of citizens off from the country's early written history. So now it supports transliteration of older and more obscured classics. Around holidays, there are calligraphy masters outside of the temple that write out greeting and good-fortune signs on red papers."

The temple of literature had 30,000 dong admission. Well worth it for the insight into education and learning in Vietnam. Various graphics provide information. The gardens are lovely and tranquil.

We arrived mid-morning with a bus load of Buddhist monks in hot pursuit, we had a 2-minute head start on them and the film crew following the Thai TV stars that arrived at the same time. There was trouble brewing in the air and we couldn't tell who was going to kick things off. As it turned out, everyone was well behaved, even our 2 kids who took a keen interest in the amazing Bonsai trees scattered throughout the complex. There's five stages of the complex that represent the 5 elements of Vietnamese culture; earth, fire, water, metal and wood. Each of these are typically represented at the alters honouring one's ancestors that seem to be everywhere in Vietnam. We had a guide with us from HanoiKids and this was the best way to view the complex. Make an effort to go through all 5 sections as most people seem to crowd the first 3 and not delve back far enough to appreciate the history behind the temple and the university that's seen in the 4th and 5th. The gardens are also immaculate and worth a visit just on their own. Well worth the VND30,000/Pax entry fee with kids under 15 free."

Grounds are sparse.Be careful of taxi touts at the front. We were so hot and sticky so decided to get a cab and head back. We paid 60k from hotel to west lake which is further but this guy charged us 163k for a shorter ride back. Before we got in the cab I asked him how much. He said meter. Something made me look at the meter but I didn't register as i was all hot and bothered. The meter started at about 115k. When we reached our corner (he didn't even drop us in front of the hotel as he knew he was scamming us and we could have got the hotel to help sort it out), he said 163k. I said what. No way. Not paying that. Afraid he may be a gangster so said I will only give you 100k. He asked for 150k. I paid him only 120k which is still double the cost for a shorter ride. Remember to use only Group taxi. Even if they said meter, don't trust them. His reason was that the taxi was one way as in one way traffic. He even stopped before the lights turned red. He didn't even move when lights turned green. He wanted to clock up the meter. My husband got the Google map out and I noticed the driver was fully checking out what my husband was doing. He was doing it on purpose so that the driver wouldn't take us on a round about longer way. Cheats. This makes Vietnam look bad and let's the country down as it has tarnished it's reputation for us."

The site of Vietnams first university where original entry was only granted to those of noble birth. We didn't book tickets in advance. We were trying to go to the military museum but it was closed during middle of day so went here. This was way better. We took a cyclo from the old quarter to the temple. Prob a good 15 mins to get there thro crazy traffic. But this was a highlight too. We saw so much from the seat of the cyclo with all the traffic buzzing around, and toward us! Def go by cyclo. They are comfy and it's exhilarating. At the Temple its good to have your lonely planet book or info with you so you can actually sit in the gardens and read about the history while you are there. It makes it more real and enjoyable. As usual in Hanoi, tiger beer is available nearly everywhere so my partner and I sat in the shade, had a drink, watched local university graduates have their grad pics taken and immersed ourselves in the centuries of history of the place we sat."

We were there on an exceptionally et day, and we had to keep darting Dom one spot o another, but even that didn't detract in any way from the overall impression we got that this place is something right out of the top drawer. It was built in 1070 and, although it is only one of several temples in Vietnam dedicated to Confucius and his sages and scholars, every inch of it resonates study and learning. The site consists of five courtyards, as well as 82 Stelae of Doctors. This is what remains of originally 116 steles, each based on stone turtles of varying appearance. The fifth courtyard was only reconstructed in 2000 because it had been destroyed by the French in 1946. The whole site is set in beautiful grounds and is an absolute \"must see\" hill in Hanoi.Entrance fee is 15,000 dong and it is open for 8.30am to 4.30pm, although it does close for lunch. I think it is also closed on Mondays and national holidays. . It is about a 10-minute walk from Hoan Kiem Lake."

If you visit the temple at the beginning of the year or in May when many important examinations take place, you will catch sights of numerous students who come and rub the tortoise head. Such an act is believed to bring them luck to pass the test.If you are keen on architecture, Temple of literature has one of the most typical architecture style for centuries in Vietnam, composed of wood and tiles.

On our visit , many graduation photos were being done.Buy the brochure with your entry ticket to help understand what is what ... Or.. Just wander and appreciate the beauty , serenity and coolness amongst the trees.. Some over 100 years old.Well worth the time visiting it."

Nice place to walk around for a bit. They had a guide brochure of sorts which we bought thinking it would provide a map of the grounds and a bit more information about what we were looking at. Didn't turn out to be the case (really wasn't that informative), so if you're looking to save a little money, you could probably take a pass on that. We only had less than a day in Hanoi and easily fit this into our itinerary since it's close enough to the other main sites in town."

The entire complex is enclosed by a peremeter wall except for the entrance, thus what's within the complex is indeed surprising.Wall through the 3 door gate (centre - royalty, right - in, left - out) and a quiet, enchanting garden awaits you. There are many sections to these temple including the main temple buiding that still stands after more than 1,000 years. The temple was build by the Chinese who ruled Vietnam for a very long time. It was dedicated to medical graduates from Vietnam. There are many stone tablets engraved with the graduates names on them. It's indeed surprising to know such a cultured society lived in Vietnam a few centuries ago.If you are hungry, there are a few eating place outside the complex. Turn left when outside and you will see a Bun Cha eating place. Quite good and on budget."

We walked out the gates and followed the road up along the outside of the temple. It was towards the back where we realized we had missed an entire area. The main temple/school is behind the building housing the statues of Confucius and the teachers.We had missed this entirely as there's no clear path around or any clear signage. We had seen the information describing the layout and were confused at not seeing this final spot, now we know why.We turned around and tried to get back in to go see it, but we couldn't get in without a new ticket.This was hugely disappointing and could've been avoided with a little clear signage.Altogether we enjoyed our visit but would've liked it much more if we had made it to our main destination.

Major disappointments are that most explanatory displays are only in the Vietnamese language and there are too many gift/souvenir outlets spread throughout the complex, at least 5. Allow 1 hour to visit. Entry free VD30,00."

The Temple of Literature is not a place that impresses immediately, when seen from the slightly chaotic entrance, but as you pass through each courtyard section the place starts to pull you in. The temple has been there for almost one thousand years and the Confucius connection and all those stelae honouring doctors and mandarins of the period as well as the memorials to great philosophers of the day start to work their charm.Our guide seemed to have his own private descriptive version of each courtyard and lost interest around the 3rd or 4th. It was only by luck we pressed on to find ourselves among the buildings of the 5th courtyard. There were some Vietnamese girls playing quiet melodies on local musical instruments and the atmosphere was much more tranquil in that area and even the air seemed cooler. Hardly anyone else seemed to have reached that end of the complex so it was possible to explore the lower and upper floor in relative peace. Coming back through the courtyards we found most of the tourists and locals clustered around the souvenir shops and drinks/ice-cream outlets.Read a good guide book or online source before coming here, it will make the whole visit so much more worthwhile."

You would not understand Hanoi if you just confined yourself within the maze of streets in the Old Quarters. You should venture west and explore the attractions which cluster around the Citadel, the Lenin Square and the West Lake. I started my exploratory `Journey to the West\u2019 from my hostel in the Old Quarters. Early morning, I visited the bustling Dong Xuan market, strolled my way to the Imperial Citadel of Thang Long, passed by some beautiful pagodas, the renowned Catholic Church of Hanoi and visited the aged old Chua Tran Quoc Pagoda at the tranquil West Lake. Turned southwards from the West Lake, I also visited the Military Museum and by the time I came out from the museum and walked across the road to show my respect to the statue of Lenin, it was already past noon. After a short rest at the Lenin Square, I proceeded to the Ho Chi Min mausoleum and the Presidential Palace before culminating my one day\u2019s exploration in this Temple of Literature. The temple is located beside a park towards the south of the Citadel. I visited the park and the side door into the temple was open on that day and I entered without buying an admission ticket. The outlook of the temple bears the stamp of the same unique and elegant Vietnamese architectural design you find in temples and pagodas in the imperial city of Hue. However, the interior architectural layout, the courtyards, the deities and the doctor\u2019s stelea resembled those I saw in the Confucian Temples in Beijing and Qufu. Even the characters on the walls were in Chinese characters and showed the deep influence of Chinese culture and Confucian philosophy in Vietnamese culture. The feudal ancient Vietnamese dynasties adopted the Chinese model of the Confucian Imperial examination to select talented government officials to run the country. Surprisingly, the Academy was built with a focus on educating the royal families and the elites. The emphasis in Confucianism is the cultivation of virtues and values in the individual like filial piety, loyalty, benevolence, integrity and his character. Through the imperial examination, people of character and good virtues are elected to run the government machinery. It was one of the best system during those era where the lower socio economic class of the society can find their way up through the academic ladder despite their class status, thus an advanced and a very meritocratic educational system. However, the assessment syllabus was based solely on literature and the humanistic arts not on science or engineering. As such, the country remained technologically backwards like China under the Ching Dynasty and could not withstand the onslaught of the cannons of the French colonialists. When I walked out to the front entrance of the temple, I noticed a young pretty Vietnamese lady donned in white `ao dai\u2019 costume was standing near the entrance of the temple. Her gorgeous figure, the shining black long hair and her silky smooth white Vietnamese traditional costume contrasted in lustre with the front fa\u00e7ade of the temple, creating a unique, mesmerizing and spectacular local appeal. Despite suffered severe damage during the Vietnam War, this Temple retains her quaint beauty in the ancient architecture set in a background of well-manicured garden landscape dotted by the few frangipani trees planted near her entrance. Among the attractions in Hanoi, I would rank the temple as one of the best."

First time he drove around and around (I have been to Hanoi twenty times) meter got to 69,500vnd, too much but no big deal. When I went to pay he yelled at us that it was 700,000vnd which is AUD $45. He was actually quite scary and very loud. I had to get very firm and start shouting for POLISI, at which point he quickly took off. Today, we hailed taxi, got a few metres and realised his meter was already at 46.000vnd, told him, he changed back to 6,000, but in about 500metres it was up to 60,000vnd! Told him to stop, took photo of him and his cab, he quickly said no money, no problem and sped off. This is obviously becoming a bad problem.

While walking around many young teens came up to us to have their picture taken with us and also practice their English. We were a little shocked by this but our guide explained that many of these kids are from out lying areas and do not see tourists that often.

Like most of the signature \"places to see\" in Hanoi (and in Asia for that matter now) This place was overrun with tourists from buses. Many of the people hop off the bus and begin jostling for \"selfies\" at the entrance and throughout the park-like setting. This Temple is actually a series of plazas and compounds joined by a central walkway. It is serene without the blast of people---so plan your visit accordingly---otherwise you may just end up walking through and leaving. Sometimes too much of a good thing is a bad thing! Please, people, no more selfies! Is it not possible to simply go and enjoy a place quietly and remember it in peace?"

Inexplicably, a completely different building was recently built in their place instead of rebuilding the old buildings, so the fifth courtyard no longer has any historical reference.The stone steles were good. Pity that none were translated though - it would have been interesting to know what they said."

We often visit with our young children and it nice for them to run around and see the buildings, but we are often harassed by local people asking for photos with them because they are blonde haired (a rare and special thing in Vietnam!). It is a great place to visit for an hour or so and there is a nearby shop called Craft Link which offers fair trade products made by ethnic peoples. There is also a well-known restaurant called Koto nearby, which trains some street kids in the hospitality business.

The complex consists of 5 courtyards separated by walls.The first two courts are gardens with trees, it\u2019s a serene place which makes you forget the noise of the traffic outside. The third courtyard has a large pond, the \u2018well of heavenly clarity\u2019. On the sides of the pool are stelae, each one carried by a tortoise, the symbol for longevity and wisdom. The stelae show the names of the successful doctorate students. The fourth courtyard is the courtyard of the \u2018Sage sanctuary\u2019. There are buildings on three sides, the largest one is the \u2018House of the Ceremonies\u2019 with an imposing statue of Confucius. On either side of the courtyard there are souvenir shops (which look out of place).The last courtyard contains a large wooden structure with statues and museum exhibits. It is flanked by a large drum and a bell tower. The place is interesting for its architecture \u2013 I\u2019s a great place for people watching, too: a bride and groom had their pre-wedding photographs taken, school classes posed for pictures and in one of the halls young kids were sitting on low chairs to listen to a lecture."

Again here I felt weird being a tourist and looking around while people were worshiping at these statues. There was also a large crane like statue and people appeared to be doing some sort of ritual where they rubbed the belly and then the legs. They were taking photos of each other doing it.We also returned here another day with our tour guide from Intrepid and we learned much more with our guide than we did on our own, and also discovered there was a whole section up the back that we didn't know about and had not been to the first time.The gardens are beautiful and peaceful and I enjoyed contemplating the history of this place as we walked around."

There are contemplation pools, a beautiful pagoda and of course the ancient stelae (stone edifices of the results of examinations and those who passed with the highest marks). The stones stand on the shells of tortoises and have stood the test of time. Students still come here to try to absorb some of the knowledge of the scholars who studied here over the years.

Like the Bac Ho site, this is one of the places that is filled with locals, not just international tourists. Like the Lama Temple and the Temple of Confucius in Beijing, this temple has a series of stele to commemorate those scholars who passed their exams here at the Imperial University.

We had the eBuddies with us explaining the rich history of the temple and got to know that the temple used to be an university during the good ol'days and now, it's a temple where majority of the students would drop by to pray for good grades. It was so much bigger than I thought. We toured the whole university for more than 1 hour and it was a very worthwhile trip. We got to see graduating students in groups celebrating their convocation and it was indeed a sight not to be missed. I would recommend this area of attraction as this is not a usual sighting at most Asian countries."

This is a Confucian temple, so not really a temple in the religious sense, the name to me is a bit misleading. It was first built 1000 years ago and it was an important step in the national examination system for which a person can become an high ranking government official. This place therefore has great historical and culture significance.Just a run down on what this place really is and why it's significant:Vietnam was ruled by China for many years, and therefore they follow a similar examination system as China. In order to become an official in the imperial court, which are the highest ranking people in the country, a scholar has to undergo many years of studies and many levels of examination. This place is basically the last stop, in which by the time you finish, you take the final exam that would make you an official. Also like in China, this is pretty much the only way a commoner gets to be transformed into a nobleman, so it's almost like a divine procedure that gets you respect and status. This is the basis of the scholar mentality which is deeply ingrained in many East Asian countries even today. Inside the grounds there are beautiful gardens, places of ceremony, many stone seals, including ones that documents events of significance and the ones that containing the names of the people who has passed the final examination. A walk through of this place almost takes you back in time. If you're interested in culture and history, this is a must see."

With 45 minutes to kill, we went shopping at the non-profit store, Craftlink. The actual grounds are very beautiful and well manicured with a lot of history as well as photo opportunities. The mosquitos were out enjoying the temple as well, which were enough of a nuisance that I wished they sold bug spray at the souvenir shop. As stated in my nat geo tour book, the souvenir shop should be bypassed as the prices are inflated. My significant other still wanted to buy postcards. Buying the postcards wasn't an issue but buying the stamps to accompany them was. One stall had an abundance of postcards to choose from but stated they did stated they \"didnt have stamps\". Needless to say, postcards are a moot point without the stamp. We went to the store across the way ask if they had stamps, their answer was yes. So we went back to store with the good selection of post cards and bought our cards. They magically had stamps. However, they didn't have the exact amount for the U.S. Stamp ( which should be around 15000 VSD) but they tried to sell me other stamps (19500 VSD). Since I had mailed of postcards already the day before, I knew I was being ripped/scammed. Although it was about a quarter more, it is the mere event that infuriated me. Bought my postcards without it's stamp and went across the way to try to buy stamps but they wouldn't sell stamps without a postcard purchase. Left the temple stampless.Tangent over! What I'm trying to say is purchase things with caution in general at the Temple and everywhere in Vietnam. If you're in need of stamps, your friendly hotel staff may sell some."

It's primarily a self-guided tour (unless you bring your guide), so read the wiki page or other materials before going, those will give you some background.

We visited the first University in Hanoi and walked through the archway to the Temple of Literature just prior to exams being held so the grounds were full of students studying. We were privileged to watch a ceremony involving the blessing of students for their upcoming exams. Strolling through the beautiful gardens to the amazing statues of past scholars onto the Khue Van pavilion built in the early 1800s is a great experience. There is so much to see that celebrates the achievements of Vietnam's finest scholars, it is definitely worth a visit. Our guide from EXO Travel was able to provide many details of the history involved and I would recommend a guided tour of this site."

There is no signage for that. Another is the roof across the upper floor that housed the statues of prominent people who built the temple.

The majestic and beautiful architecture is simply stunning and for the mere simple fact that this beautiful temple was built in 1010 is awe inspiring and should make anyone and everyone want to go and see it for themselves. When I walked through the archway, I felt an overwhelming sense of pride and joy because this temple was built to honor literature and education. I actually couldn't help but chuckle a little to myself while standing in front of one of the stone slates with names on it thinking, \"This was the gold star every student strives for in the 11th century!\" I also thoroughly enjoyed standing in front of the pond with lotus flowers and gazing in to the water; it was a magical moment for self reflection and to feel connected to a culture that I knew nothing about prior to visiting the country. Teachers and education and revered and treated nobly with the utmost level of respect in Vietnam and it touches me to my very core. Whenever someone would ask me what I do and I would tell them I was a teacher, they would shake my hand or bow to me. Walking further back, there is a temple devoted to Confucius and it was extremely insightful to see how respect is payed to one of the great philosophical thinkers. Temple of Literature is a special and beautiful place in the heart of the hustle and bustle of Hanoi's Old Quarter and the juxtaposition of old in the middle of the new is very special."

If you visit in mid-summer the temperatures are very high but the tourist numbers are very low, so you can either beat the heat and join the throngs or suffer in peace and quiet. To be honest I have been in Hanoi in winter and summer and prefer the cooler weather. The temple is close to the fine arts museum and Koto training Restaurant so you can make a day of it. You will find the temple at 28-29 H\u00e0ng C\u00e2n, Ho\u00e0n (The entrance fee for the complex is 10,000 VND (about 50 US cents). Opening hours: 8:30 to 11:30 and 13:30 to 16:30 every day except Monday and national holidays. Rated No 2 landmark in Vietnam in 2015 for good reason. The temple was constructed in 1070 under Ly Thanh Tong\u2019s dynasty, first to honor Confucius and nowadays it celebrates the doctorates and high rank scholars of Viet Nam. In 1076, King Ly Nhan Tong continued the work and built Quoc Tu Giam as the first university of Viet Nam. Get a v\u00e9, ticket to see the temple which is divided into five courtyards, each with its own significance and history. Look for the hung drums called tr\u1ed1ng. 1) The first courtyard stretches from the main gate to Dai Trung gate.  2) The second stands out with Khue Van Cac pavilion. You should notice the pavilion symbol on all street signs of H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i.  3) The third courtyard is where doctor\u2019s names are listed on tombstones above tortoise backs. There are a total of 82 tombstones, with names and origins of 1307 doctors, corresponding to 82 examination courses from 1442 to 1779. If you visit the temple at the beginning of the year or in May when many important examinations take place, you will catch sights of numerous students who come to rub the tortoise head. Such an act is believed to bring luck passing tests, so rub the rub the tortoise head hard.  4) The fourth courtyard is dedicated for Confucius and his 72 honoured students, as well as Chu Van An - a famous teacher known for his devotion to teaching. This is also where local authorities choose to cherish brilliant students in H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i, like those with top entrance results to university or top graduation outcomes.  (5) The last and also furthest courtyard is Thai Hoc house, which used to be Quoc Tu Giam- the first university of Viet Nam. Thai Hoc house holds a small collection of old time costumes for students and mandarins, as well as explaining the process of taking and passing the national examinations. This ancient site offers a lake of literature, the Well of Heavenly Clarity, turtle steles, pavilions, courtyards and passageways that were once used by royalty and is revered as a place that has seen thousands of doctors\u2019 graduate in what has now become a memorial to education and literature."

A nice place to visit and get away from the traffic, but seems like a place where you \"been there done that\".I suppose if you bring a guide he/she can tell you more interesting thing about the place.

There are three places of worship frequented by many locals as well. Be sure to walk to the far end of place: many visitors seem to stop at the first large courtyard, and they miss the sites found there (e.g. an enormous bell and \"drum\" suspended within lovely, traditionally decorated \"gazebos\"). There is a museum with displays of the original facility, clothing worn by the university's graduates, etc. and climbing the stairs next to the massive wooden pillars take you up to a peaceful spot, plus a balcony overlook too. And those marvelous stelae atop carved turtles, with the names of professors and graduates engraved on them, date back to the 1400's (very cool indeed). Enjoy :))"

Staying in the Old Quarter, we caught a quick taxi ride there as it is was a bit far to walk. Built in 1070 and dedicated to Confucius, this first University of Vietnam was traditionally for royal and noble students. It\u2019s a beautiful site to visit. Wonderful old buildings are set amongst five courtyards with well planned and laid out gardens, trees and lotus ponds. The whole layout and design is perfectly balanced, based on yin and yang. It is nice and tranquil, secluded with trees; you can easily forget you are in the middle of busy Hanoi.You can also see the historic stone stelae of carved blue stone turtles, honouring the top scholars. 82 of these great turtle stones remain today. There are also some wonderful decorative statues honouring Confucius himself and past founders. As well as traditionally being an historical important place of education, as we walked around many current students filled the courtyards. Young school children were running around as part of an excursion. Graduating students in their beautiful traditional white gowns posed for photos on the grounds. Really picturesque relaxing spot to walk around and enjoy this historical site. Well worth a visit."

Then when we were leaving a group of recent graduates from college were taking their pics, all smartly decked out in their traditional Vietnamese dresses (ao dai?). According to our guide from HanoiFreeTours, Van, who also recently graduated, graduating is a big celebration with dresses made, make-up artists and photographers hired for the day! The Vietnamese treasure education and this a lovely place to celebrate it."

Inside the wooden structures, visitors can see statues of past kings and altars dedicated to Confucius. Of special interest were the crane-standing-on-turtle statues next to the altars. We noticed some visitors rubbing the stomach of the crane, presumably for good luck. Overall, the temple gives visitors insights into how prestigious and privileged education must had been in ancient Vietnam."

A learned young Vietnamese girl acted as guide for us (who was very fluent in English). She explained the various details about the temple in length. Whatever we understood from the guide\u2019s briefing was......This temple was built in 1070 at the time of King L\u00fd Nh\u00e2n T\u00f4ng and was reconstructed during the Tr\u1ea7n dynasty (1225\u20131400) and in the subsequent dynasties. This temple hosts the \"Imperial Academy\" which is Vietnam's first national university (established in 1076). It covers an area of over 54000 square metres, including the Literature lake, Giam park and the interior courtyards which are surrounded by a brick wall. In front of the Great Gate are four tall pillars. The gate opens onto three pathways. The centre path was reserved for the monarch The left path was for the administrative Mandarins and the right path was for military Mandarins. The interior of the site is divided into five courtyards. The first two courtyards are quiet areas with ancient trees and trimmed lawns, where scholars would relax away from the bustle of the outside world. The third courtyard is the \"Well of Heavenly Clarity\" (\"Thi\u00ean quang t\u1ec9nh\"). After third courtyard one finds the doctors' steles. These are 116 erected steles of carved blue stone turtles with elaborate motifs to honour talent and encourage study. The turtle (\"quy\") is one of the nation's four holy creatures. The others are the dragon (\"long\"), the unicorn (\"ly\") and the phoenix (\"phuong\"). The turtle is a symbol of longevity and wisdom. In the centre of the fourth courtyard is the \"House of Ceremonies\" (\"Bai Duong\"). The fifth courtyard was constructed as an imperial academy. I don\u2019t remember much about fourth and fifth courtyards.A must see place in Hanoi. You may buy various souvenirs from here including Water Puppets, Stamps, Wooden Masks Miniature Statues and Musical Instruments You can also play the traditional Vietnamese musical instruments in the temple for free."

The temples and grounds are dedicated to the Chinese philosopher Confucius and a number of other scholars and mandarins who graduated from the school here that served as a center for higher learning. Typical of Vietnamese temples, a gate leads to an outer courtyard garden which leads to another gate and the Well of Heavenly Clarity beyond. The temple of Confucius can be found at the end of the pool. Monuments and stele to various scholars can be found off to the right and beyond the altar of Confucius are altars and images of various scholars and immortals. Many students visit here and light joss sticks and bring offerings. The temple is an oasis of calm and reflection in what you will find is a very busy city. I recommend a few hours of peace and solitude here. Afterward, a restaurant named Koto is a nice place to have lunch. As you depart the main gate, turn left and then look left at the corner. It's in the middle of the block running alongside the temple."

We were there just as university graduates, having completed their studies elsewhere, come here to take class photos at the original university before going their separate ways. With 100s of undergraduates celebrating in temperatures close to 40c, it was excessively hot and crowded but full of energy. Sadly, bomb damage from various wars demolished some of the original buildings, although these had been rebuilt. Look out for the Turtle scrolls to the top students down the ages when it was still a university."

I thought the most interesting part was the carvings of the names of graduates, many of which were very old. The temple itself was very pretty as well. I didn't have a guide, but had a good time anyway. Though if you are looking to get more specific information on the various aspects of the temple it might be good to get one."

The Temple of Literature was founded in the year 1070, and was dedicated to the Chinese Philosopher, CONFUCIOUS.In 1076, it became Vietnam's 1st University. An archeological study has found that the majority of the site belongs to Ly (1010-1225) and Tran (1225 - 1400), it really is very old. There are side passages between the five courtyards, and these were used by Royalty who entered through the main gate, and students had to enter via the side passage ways. The open pavillions in the courtyards were used for students to study. The 1st two courtyards are mainly gardens and trees, with the third courtyard being taken up by a large pond called 'The Well of heavenly clarity\" On either sides, there are pavillions with steles which are sitting on top of a large Tortoise. These steles honour the schools successful doctorate candidates. The next courtyard is the Sage courtyard which is paved and has buildings on three sides. Here, is the \"great house of ceremonies \" and inside is a large lacquered statue of Confucious. The last courtyard is Thai Hoc, and here you find the large Drum and Bell Tower.We visited here on a city tour, and this made it all the more interesting as we were told the details of all we were looking at.It is open Tuesday to Sunday from 7.30 to 6 pm (8 am to 5 pm from November to March"

If you don't want a guide it is worthwhile to buy the booklet for 8000 VD (it's 40 cents come on) and you understand the whole background. This kind of exination halls are presently being revived in China. But they lack all the atmosphere of this temple.

There are courtyards and pagoda style buildings leading to many other pagoda style buildings and courtyards, all very spacious and tranquil looking. There are inscriptions and signs to help you appreciate what you are looking at, and pleasant landscaped gardens and lake. If you are lucky you will hear one of the many public musical recitals of ancient Vietnamese music at one of the pagodas and at others you can see locals and visitors burning incense to the gods.there are a few souvenir shops dotted around but most of the things are rather tasteful and although some, such as the water puppets, are over-priced many souvenirs are affordable and not much more than if you were bargaining in a market in the Old Quarter. It's a very pleasant site and one which I know has delighted all our visitors, and ourselves, so far."

The stone stelae (sitting atop carved tortoises, and engraved with the names of professors and students dating back to the mid 1400's) were a treat to see, as were the statues of Buddha (still actively used as places of worship). I spent a relaxing afternoon there, enjoying the marvelous architecture and peaceful surroundings in the heart of the city... don't rush through this place, but take time to find a quiet corner (e.g., near the giant bell, hanging outside in an open-sided structure), and partake of the Temple's pleasant ambiance... well worth your time to visit, indeed :)"

The current temple, however, is not the original. Unfortunately, war took its toll on Hanoi and the original grounds were destroyed by Allied forces. So, Hanoi had to rebuild the place. Nonetheless, the courtyards are beautiful and there is a lot of history here, with many of the old statues still intact and reused. We had a guide with us, so we spent a good hour or longer here. It's one of the main attractions and worth a stop."

The Temple of Literature and the first University of Vietnam was one of two attractions we had down to visit and we were not disappointed. It is about 40K VND by taxi from the Old Quarter where we staying. Entrance fee is 20K VND per person.The Temple is designed similarly to all other temples in China and elsewhere in Asia devoted to Confucious. Part of it is original and other structures rebuilt after the war but in keeping with the original architecture. A guide is a must to really appreciate the history and the symbolic nuances of the place. The ticket office can quickly arrange for one at 100K VND - ours was an English speaking guide who is also a historian! The Temple is built in courtyards nested within courtyards surrounded by well kept gardens. Discover the tablets dating from 1000 years old bearing the names of the scholars who passed the old examination system to become officials and ministers of the land. Walk into the inner sanctum to the temple where Confucious and his top disciples are worshiped. This is still a working temple and students visit to pray for guidance during exam time. The precinct is also used for graduation ceremonies for the present University. The second floor of the temple has wonderful views and here you will find the Kings from two of Vietnam's dynasties who valued education and knowledge. We loved the tranquility of the temple surrounds and it was a great respite from a crowded and busy city."

The animal signs, which are the year you are born in, are pruned into topiary designs in the garden are a lovely attraction.

Although there are few stairs, there are lots of \"ledges\" to negotiate, so wheelchair users might find it difficult to navigate the site.In the road that runs up the side of the park, Van Mieu, there are three great shops, which sell souvenirs where all the profits support poor communities.

Built in 1070, the ancient temple, organized upon the principles of Confucius, is beautifully laid out with lovely peaceful gardens and reflecting ponds, and several altars for worship. The temple is the site of Vietnam's first university, and a place where wisdom and education are still exalted. The site consists of 5 separate courtyards, and you have to climb over several thresholds to move between courtyards. I don't think there are any ramps for handicapped people and there are also few handrails, so keep that in mind if you have mobility issues. An elderly woman in our tour group fell after tripping over a step, and it sort of ruined the rest of the trip for her...The souvenir vendors who patrol the sidewalk outside the Temple are very aggressive, and you have to just push on and don't make eye contact or you will be mobbed !"

This rehearsal actually is meant to bring good grades and luck in their final examinations.This is a thousand year old Centre for learning, the first university that was established in a temple. It is well preserved. Stone tablets with names of first university graduates and Ph.Ds adorn the garden.The system of education since then to modern times, is depicted on story boards around the area. Images of spiritual mentors including Confucius are the mainstay. Local crafts and arts are on display with a couple of musicians playing traditional music."

There is a small token entrance fee of around USD1 - an absolute bargain given I can spend 1-2 hours in this beautiful place. Made up of several courtyards ending in the shrine to Confucius, you can simply wander along marvelling at the wooden buildings and Chinese deities. There are unfortunately not too be many signs or descriptions as to what you are looking at. We visited on Graduation day as well as we could see the excited faces of young graduates about to start their working careers and it adds to the atmosphere of the place.There are gift shops in the central courtyard and toilet facilities which charge a small nominal fee for usages.There are no cafes or restaurants but once you are done with your visit, there are a number of cafes where you can refuel just on the road left of the main exit."

This is a minus but, it is also a plus because students are dressed in full color, are very friendly and wiling to be in the pictures with people that look a bit different to them. It was fun!"

During our visit there were a lot of students celebrating their graduation and taking pictures. The temple itself is nice to see but not extremely special in my opinion.

This is Vietnam's first university, where the Emperor personally delivered oral exams to doctoral candidates starting in the 11th century. Much has been rebuilt (notably the wooden structures), due to wartime destruction, but the stonework is still there, including the turtle monuments, which honor each new doctor of philosophy with a unique inscription. People still go there to celebrate their own graduations, so you'll see groups of students in cap and gown taking pictures. People also go there to pray for intellectual achievement. You can no longer rub the turtle heads for this purpose (students used to do that before taking their final exams), but you can pray to Confucius, any of his four top students (even Mencius!), Chu V\u0103n An (Vietnam's own \"Confucius\" and rector of the university during his time), or your choice of three different emperors (L\u00fd Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng, who built the temple, L\u00fd Nh\u00e2n T\u00f4ng, who founded the university, and L\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng, who came up with the idea of the turtles). While I was there, L\u00fd Nh\u00e2n T\u00f4ng was getting the most attention from worshipers. Plenty of nice souvenirs available (they take credit cards), but bring a VND 20,000 note to buy the two nice CDs from the traditional music ensemble, because they only take cash.

The day I went, a Sunday in late October, it was packed with students taking photos and the place was completely overrun by them. This is a good and bad thing. Good, 'cause they are so excited and it is a lovely energy and it was actually the highlight of my visit, just watching them, BUT, it was overrun with them and certainly NOT the peaceful experience that I was expecting. 2. I made the mistake of not hiring a guide. I highly suggest you get a guide, so you can appreciate what you are seeing and the significance of this place.*** If you go, and want peace and quiet, ask about when the best time to go is AND definitely HIRE a guide.

The gardens are peaceful, with floral characters representing the core education principles honored in the pursuit of education. We were lucky enough to visit around university graduation time--when groups of soon-to-be graduates gathered for photo sessions. Their exuberance was a real treat. Visiting either early or late in the day might be an advantage. The presence of the students was an infrequent occurrence and, barring that, wandering the gardens and courtyards in a quieter time would be lovely."

It was nice seeing students drawing pictures and rubbing the steeles (which you can't do any more). Couples were having wedding photos done which was a nice touch. The open space was wonderful and overall it was a good place to visit and cheap enough to get in. However, after visiting this place several times you realize that the place has been rebuilt and made to look old and the original owners would be turning over in their graves if they knew how commercial this place has become. Why is it that I can buy a frozen treat in a 1000-year old temple area? Really!!!"

Coming here, you might see many Vietnamese students visiting the places as a ritual for good luck before they enter an important exam such as the entrance exam into college. Several attraction including Turtle Steles, Well of Heavenly Clarity, Lake of Literature, and Constellation of Literature Pavilion.Today the temple of Literature is an oasis amidst of Hanoi\u2019s traffic noise. If you are interested in its architecture you will need a lot of time to explore the different meanings and usages of the five yards and its differences. The complete compound is arranged in the form of the human body. While the entrance to the compound is the feet, and the grave at the end the head.This is a most fascinating university compound. To grasp its logic and academics you will need an excellent guide. It is well worth a few hours of immersion and study."

When we went further into the temple we saw some performers of the Vietnamese musical instruments so, we let them do and perform the music by using their traditional instruments. It was very nice to watch them and listen to their musical instruments. After the show, they started to sell their prepared tapes for donations.

Unless you;re in the vincinity, visiting the tower flag, HCM mausoleum, HCm museum etc. then the temple of lit is just round the corner, 10mins walking distance. If you are in that area just to see the temple then it will not be worth it. 20k vnd entrance fee though, but you can spend up to an hr inside looking at the shops, eating an ice cream or just taking pictures in the water lily lake or main temple."

I wouldn't normally mind so many people, but the pathways, staircases and spaces around the statues of worship are quite narrow. We did a lot of waiting - waiting for people to move, to finish taking photos, to finish praying - all so we could simply look around the place.There are a few signs in English, but they're very wordy and difficult to get through/understand.There was lots of litter, in the water and in the garden displays - made me feel a bit sad for the place, it deserves better care. It's also quite touristy inside, with lots of shopping available, which takes away from the atmosphere.I'm sure this place would be very interesting, maybe even serene, if you go early to avoid the crowds, and perhaps if you take a guide so there's someone to tell you about what you're looking at!The one thing I really did enjoy was the short music display from three talented ladies - nice to see the monochord being played so beautifully.

The site of Vietnam's first university, from the eleventh until 18th century, the temple is now a historic site and active temple, consisting of pagodan buildings around a front and central courtyard, with stone statues and other religious altars and images.We found the temple complex very well maintained. The gardens are lush, with lily ponds full of lotuses, and beautiful old trees, and we spotted several frogs. The buildings and statues themselves were in good condition, without having lost any of their historic charm.What I enjoyed the most is that the temple is still visited by Vietnam students, who pray and give offerings to ensure good school marks and entrance at the university of their choice. There were well over a hundred young scholars there when we visited, some with their parents (in some cases praying harder than their children!). A lovely glimpse into a tradition where modern Vietnam meets ancient.The complex can be visited in an hour. Try sit in the gardens while you're there as respite from bustling Hanoi."

It is so picturesque and has the ability to transport you back a thousand years when scholars would study Confucianism here. Nowadays university students come here on Graduation Day to take pictures in this wonderful backdrop. If you are lucky you may be asked to be in their pictures! Highly recommended."

Likewise, you can always find the occasional nervous student attempting to rub one of the many stone turtles' heads in the hopes of having some good luck during their next exam.The only major downside of the place is that the exhibits are often poorly tended to and usually have no descriptions whatsoever, but this does little to spoil the effect of walking around the grounds.Simply put, I have been here at least 5 times with guests and I can imagine returning at least another 5 times when we have company in Hanoi"

As we turned back to the booth the ticket seller produced the 50,000 and 100,000 bills from by the side of her...no apology, and very coincidental that both of us would suffer a genuine mistake, it was just as though she was waiting to see if we would notice! I would advise all travellers to double check your change when visiting.This took the shine off what is a very nice temple in honour of Confucius and a history of learning in the country. It is well kept, and whilst we were there it looked like students were celebrating passing their exams by posing for pictures in their robes.For this reason I have to give it a low score to highlight this potential problem."

I visited the Temple of Literature on my first day in Hanoi, hoping to escape the bustling city streets in exchange for some peaceful grounds. While the architecture and history was intriguing, there were several large tour groups at the site which made it rather difficult to fully enjoy. I would recommend going early before the midday crowds."

There are five courtyards, with the first two featuring manicured gardens, and a banyan tree that is 1000 years old. The third courtyard contains a large pond, with buildings on either side that house stelae (tablets) dating from the 15th century. These are inscribed with the names of scholars. A path through the centre of the complex leads you between high gates and walls. Present-day graduates often come to this temple to have their photographs taken, and it is a treat to see their happiness and pride. In the centre of the complex, The Altar of Confucius, contains statues of cranes standing on tortoises, which are symbols of good luck. This leads to The Temple of Confucius, where there are statues of the great man and his disciples. This beautifully-kept complex is well worth a visit, and guided tours are available."

After about 1442, all gifted children were allowed to enroll. The are many stelae which record the names of scholars that achieved distinction in their studies. The temple itself is entered through an imposing doorway. A nearby pagoda houses a large statue of Confucius.

In the third of five courtyards are rows of stelae on the backs of stone turtles. On the stelae are the names of students who passed the royal exam - delivered by the king - from the 1400's onwards. At the far end of the complex are two large buildings; one being a temple with statues of Confucius and his followers. On either side of the temple are a bell and a large drum. Amazing history to realize that the royal exam has been conducted here more for centuries."

Admittedly, there's only so many temples one can visit, but if you're in Hanoi, this is a good attraction. But if you've seen other temples previously, then maybe not.

The place is home to the Imperial Academy, the first national university of Vietnam. The temple traces its history to the year 1070 during the reign of Ly Nhan Tong. The temple is modeled after the temple that is built in Aufu, Shadong, and the birthplace of Confucius. The temple comprises five courtyards out of which the first two courtyards were meant for relaxation amongst trees and manicured lawns. The third courtyard is meant for promoting study and recognizing talent. The fourth courtyard was meant to honor 72 disciples of Confucius. The fifth courtyard recognizes education, culture and national traditions of Vietnam. The fifth courtyard in essence was the beginning of the university."

The area is enclosed with a wall and has many old large trees to give you 'photo backdrops' that are not just 1960s concrete buildings... nice. The entrance gate is lovely framed with a wall and trees - on both sides. There are several ancient trees with vines/roots hanging which look great too. Inside are a plethora of nooks and crannies - plus several temple areas with cranes, turtles, icons etc.. all very photographic. Nice small lake towards the centre which can produce nice gate reflections. Recommend a 200m and 11-17 type lens plus a flash for inside work - although I did not I prefer grainy high-iso shots of the interiors... Note - most signs were ONLY in Vietnamese.

Many of the structures were built in the eleventh century, and it comprises a sequence of courtyards and ponds, with gateways, shrines and other buildings. The temple dedicated to Confucius stands at the far end of the central spine from the main gate. It houses a statue of Confucius as well as those of several Vietnamese kings of the eleventh and twelfth centuries. We were particularly taken with doctoral stelae - gravestone-like stone slabs carrying the names of doctor laureates in exams held between the ends of the fifteenth and eighteenth centuries - housed in open-sided buildings on both sides of one of the main courtyards. We went to this ancient site just before Tet (2014) and found Van Mieu, the street to the east of the site, filled with calligraphers practicing their art."

The compound itself is historic, but I didn't find it the least impressive considering other relics in S.E. Asia. There are many students that go there to pray for their exams. Our guide did tell us a funny story that he took an exam without studying, only praying, and then failed the test.

Try to imagine running an empire using people who didn\u2019t know how to read or write, couldn\u2019t count in numbers or know the difference between a thief & a taxman. This Chinese centre of learning not only established Vietnam's firm Chinese identify by adopting its system of education & ethics but also created a new class of intellectuals, warlords & administrators in this far-off insignificant province who ironically used these same skills to eventually stand up on their own two feet & fight off the very same Chinese. How do they say it? Biting the hand that rocks the cradle.Interestingly, the weak Kinh-speaking nation of Dai Viet (Vietnam) would probably have been destroyed by the Hindu-Muslim kingdom of Champa in southern Vietnam who were expert looters, pirates & slave traders. The Temple of Literature provided the Vietnamese with written language, a code of ethics & military technologies from China such as strategy & tactics which were useful in defending their borders. As China\u2019s most southern province, Vietnam was the gateway for China to clasp its iron fist on the rich Hindu kingdoms of the Khmer in Cambodia & Majapahit Empire in Indonesia. Gold, women & jewels is what it\u2019s always really about. The Temple of Literature's design is said to be similar to the temple in Qufu, China, where the great philosopher Confucius was born. Confucianism spread rapidly in Vietnam thru this institution & is still the basis of Vietnam\u2019s culture today, respect for elders, family & the importance of education. Throughout the complex from the front gate are 3 walking paths. The centre is for the emperor, the left is for the bureaucrats & the right for military officers. These classes of people represented the 3 types of students the centre educated, administrators, royalty, & military officers. Not escaping the destruction, the World UNESCO-listed temple\u2019s fifth courtyard which housed the Royal Academy was destroyed by the French in 1946 as part of their invasion to re-take Hanoi after the Japanese surrender. The Vietnamese had retreated to the courtyard hoping its ancient walls would discourage the French from attacking them & thus destroying the ancient temple but the French let their artillery do all the talking. Ironically, the French had earlier surrendered all of Indochina, including Cambodia, Laos & Vietnam to the Japanese in 1941 without so much of a fight, pretty much what they did again when the Germans showed up on their doorstep in 1940."

The complex is roughly the size of a small city block and contains ok landscaping, some ornate stone gates, a number of buildings to check out, and a few other minor attractions (big bells, bonsai trees, etc). My favorite part was the building at the far back which was a mini museum with two levels. Entry was 20,000VND and a printed guide can be purchased for 8,000. There were a few English signs scattered about that talked about the history, but I suppose a guide (book or person) might be necessary to get a full story. I spent roughly an hour checking the place out, but I was also moving slowly and didn't have anywhere else to be.

There is a charity that donates all proceeds from food sales in their restaurant to help children from poor families. The place is to the left of the Pho 24 restaurant"

While the architecture and setting are truly quite pleasant, I found the history connected to the structure to the be the most interesting aspect of visiting. There are a number of explanatory panels, but I think without a guide or a local that knows the history, one would be a little lost as to its significance. We had a local friend show us around and that made the experience that much more interesting. This destination is walkable from old town, although if you tire easy, take a taxi.As a tip, there's an awesome juice place, Vu Canu, en route from the old quarter. Stop in for some refreshment."

I was actually hoping to see graduating students in ao dais for photoshoots but I was not lucky. There are boards that provide important information about the site. Architecturally, I didn't find the temple interesting or special although I understand its significance is more historical and symbolic. Most people recommend hiring a guide to understand more about the place (which I failed to do) but overall, it's a good place to wander around or sit down to write postcards for a bit."

No library or anything. Dont be surprise to see Coca Cola cans around saint Buddha or here Confucius. I asked our guide why they put it there because it looks awful to me.

While it was interesting to be greeted with the Vietnam's national costume on the female graduates, their happy chatter and laughter (and blocking most of the gateways and paths with their phototaking) makes for a rather unexpected experience. Even so, it was interesting to have a glimpse into Vietnam's education historically, and to find heavy imperial Chinese influence as well. I believe it would have been a better visit if there wasn't much group activities going on, this temple is like a sanctuary within the bustling Hanoi, and it would have been nice to visit it like that."

It's a decent 1hr walk around away from the hustle and bustle of the city, but I wouldn't really go out of my way to go see it."

It is about 2 km's west of the Hoan Kiem lake so it's not too far from the Old Quarter (which is where you should stay). Although it is always crowded it is a very pleasant oasis of calm. It is essentially a string of 1000 year old courtyards with well tended gardens, ornate doorways and statuary. At the far end there is a room (temple ?) in which (on all of my visits anyway) there are 6 or so musicians performing Vietnamese music. All this for a $1 ! I always combine my visit with lunch (or whatever) at KOTO just across the road, shopping at Craftlink, a fair trade outlet for hand made products from all over Vietnam, also just across the road and the Fine Arts Museum at the top end of the road (Van Mieu) (see my separate reviews of these places). They all make for a very satisfying, conveniently close to each other day trip."

Turns out that it was a graduation day, hence the reason we saw so many young men and women, the latter dressed mostly in colorful and sexy ao dai (or the Vietnamese costume for women).Very good photo opportunity for the timing of our visit, so if you can catch it too, you will find colorful costumes, groups of women and men posing for pictures, balloons all over, flowers too and of course there were those souvenirs in the stalls.I think it cost us VND 10,000 per head for the admission fee. Very good bargain as the place is quite big. After we went through the picturesque main gate, there was a big garden with a nice leafy green lawn and trees, then through the second courtyard with some symbolism attached to present day Hanoi. A third courtyard had a big pond but what was interesting hereabouts was the large number of stone turtle steles - apparently it contained lists of those who passed the exams. Our guide explained the somewhat bewildering and challenging levels of schools that students had to go through (wow, so many). I noticed that the turtle seems to be a recurring symbol which is quite important to the Vietnamese people. We also reached the fourth courtyard, and aside from souvenir shops we saw, I noticed some musical performance going on at the side, Turns out that there was a short performance for bamboo instruments. Very nice - its free, though you are offered some cds containing some bamboo music. I didn't regret buying one because the music was soothing and a great background for parties.At the other side was an altar which seemed to be devoted to Confucius and his disciples. There seemed to be a lot of incense and altars..which am not sure how to identify now. Anyway, again another good photo op :-)Visit for at least an hour to two hours if you are interested in the cultural, religious and educational significance of this historic site."

There is a musical performance at the building at the third hall. They play traditional musical instruments.Pay attention to details in this complex, especially at the rear sections. To reach the backyard of this temple you need to go through a small path.Best visited after lunch, and at the school holiday season.

It's sort of inspiration saying that one day they would graduate. The gowns are available for rent.Well, it's where you can see a lot of pretty Vietnamese girls in their national costumes!"

It is nice to have a tour guide with you who can tell you what is it that you are seeing. But it is not impossible to read it up ahead and navigate the place on your own too!The day we visited was graduation time I think so there were loads of students taking their pictures in graduation gowns. Also the girls were wearing their traditional Ao Dai and boys were handsomely dressed in suits. They added color and festivity to the place and it was nice touch of the modern in a rather old and historic monument!"

Some buildings were destroyed by the French in the 1950s - your tour guide can point these out - but many are original, including the turtle stelae.Suggestion: visit with guides from Hanoi Kids.

It has been of course refurbished many times but you have feeling of \"new\" in almost all temples I have seen in SE Asia.

Temple of Literature was formed in 1076 as Quoc Tu Giam - Vietnam's first university, also referred to as Van Mieu in Vietnamese, was established within a temple to educate Vietnam's royalty, mandarins and members of the elite. The university functioned for an incredible 700 years and its gardens and well-preserved architecture offer a fascinating glimpse into Vietnam\u2019s past.This is no doubt a great place to see and enjoy 1/2 hour walking, make sure you come with a tour guide to understand the place throughout."

The layout and the beauty iof the first square s astounding. Large ponds on each side within the enclosure greet you with lovely walkways and well manicured lawns and foliage. Tranquil, beautiful, peaceful. The next area (they are divided by ancient \"gates\") is a square with manicured lawn and pathways. In the third square, there is a masoned square with shops and other buildings. Here you can buy souvenirs and some small snacks and drinks (soda, tea, etc). Finally, in the fourth square, you enter the actual temple area with stele (stone monuments) with the names of successful scholars dating back over a 1000 years. Some, unfortunately, have suffered from time and those candidates are no longer remembered. You can't touch anything here; you can only walk and look. To think of the many who have come here over time, many failing and others being successful, and thinking about how hard that they had to work and to study to pass the exams, this is more a monument to learning and scholarship. At the back, there is a \"temple\" (just to help you to understand, in Viet Nam, a \"temple\" is Chinese and a \"pagoda\" is a Buddhist temple where one can revere their ancestors as they do not \"worship\" them; however, they do ask for their good passage through the afterlife). Here one can burn incense and see those who are the most venerated of scholars. They all actually do \"look alike\" as they use the same mold or model for all of them because no one really knows what they really looked like. This is true throughout all of the temples and pagodas in Viet Nam.But wait! There is more. Walk around to the back of this temple area and there is a \"final\" square with another temple at the back and side buildings. In the temple, every day, are musicians who perform traditional Vietnamese music every day. They also sell CDs, DVDs and some instruments at the best price I have ever seen anywhere else in Viet Nam so far.Overall, this is a pleasant, relaxing, thoughtful and educational experience. I spent 3 hours here with NO camera. Next time, I will take my camera and take photographs that can help you out."

Still, there can be ways for skipping the crowds: avoid lunch-time visits or between 5-7pm, when traffic is at its worst.Also, don't forget that the Temple area has many parts, and once you've gone through the first few courtyards, there is a side entrance to the last courtyard -- it might seem silly, but many people end up skipping this last part simply because they're not paying enough attention."

A guide is essential as limited English Information available. Impossible to understand without help and significance would be lost. The photos attached do justice to the scenery. My teenage kids got bored quickly and became a distraction so beware. Our guide didn't have much nice to say about the French but nobody does here. Seems they were fairly spiteful in their destruction on departure. Have to see it whilst here."

The gardens are beautiful and very well kept. The water lillies were flowering when I was there and they were lovely. The history of this temple (built in 1070) just blows me away given I come from such a 'young' country with very little history! The stories and legends about various symbols - crane & turtle, dragons, fish etc - were something I only discovered because of my guide.Yes there is an area of the temple that sells cheap and tacky tourist stuff but we just kept walking straight past. Yes there are moto & tuk tuk drivers at the entrance - just like every other attraction in Vietnam!! These things didn't take away from the experience for me. I just chose to ignore them. Definitely worth a visit if you've got local knowledge/research/English guide"

Built in 1070, the temple is truly a heritage of Hanoi.The temple is divided into 4 different sections. Do not miss the stone tortoises at the third section, which the names of the candidates who were succeed in royal exam in China was engraved. The tortoises which were built 1484 - 1780 AD, have been recognized by UNESCO as Documentary Heritage of the World.I saw many graduates taking photo in the temple with their traditional costume. Many of them were friendly and didn't mind to take photos together with them. More about my sharing about the temple is available in my blog bettyandlingshing.blogspot.com/2013/05/ho-chi-minh-mausoleum-and-places-nearby.html.By the way, the architecture of the temple resembles the Chinese temples.

The site is large. There are a few historical relics, but most of the explanations are in Vietnam text and verse; so foreign visitors do not benefit much.

I recommend a visit mid week and as soon as it opens to avoid the crowdsIt should be noted that this is a working temple where people come to pray and pay their respects and they are very tolerant to us tourists. It would be good to see tourists giving some respect back and allowing people space and privacy while they pray Good photo opportunities here but please do heed the note about the local Chinese faithful who come to worship Confusius"

Inside is a magnificent garden and peaceful surroundings. It is one of several spiritual places which the non-religious Vietnamese are still proud to exploit as a tourist attraction. They have adapted the site to the Vietnamese way of thinking surrounding the father figure of Confucius with motherland images more in keeping with Vietnamese spirituyality. The Vietnamese regard Confucianism and Chinese Communism as different versions of the same brand of oppression of the Vietnamese people.Nevertheless the Temple was the first University in Hanoi [lacing it along with other old universities in Western culture. It was aplace of learning for the well to do - but had a practical side as the students had to learn horticulture skills to grow food to feed themselves.It provides another glimpse into the tortured history of Vietnam and its testy relationship with its northern neighbour China. Over the centuries there have been many waves of refuhees and attacking forces that have roamed the country. Vietnam has 54 ethnic minority groups inhabiting its borders - most of them refugees at one time or another from China.This chequered history can be further appreciated with a visit to the Ethnology Museum and the Museum of History in the french Quarter near the Hanoi Opera House ( a replca of the Opera Garnier from Paris - a fine colonial building and the site of many wedding shoots."

It is essentially a shrine to the Mandarin academic tradition, and it is clearly held in reverence by VietNamese and Chinese visitors. I did my best to work up a reverential mood, but it reminded me too much of the hidebound nature of the Western academic industry to be regarded with sufficient earnestness.The temple's main exhibit is the collection of stone stelae which commemorate famous scholars. The stelae (without intentional irony) are mounted on the back of lumbering tortoises that remind one of Mt Casaubon... The site is appealing for its architecture and the gardens, though the coachloads of local and Chinese visitors made it rather difficult to appreciate them.Well, at least I can tell my VietNamese friends that i went there...And, oh yes, watch your change!

There is a brochure you can purchase for 8,000VND which might be worth getting if you want to learn about the history of the site.

There was a throng of students from all grade levels and the place got a little too crowded to take decent photos.There is a 20,000 VND fee where USD1.00 = 20,000 VND. There are nooks where you can buy souvenirs."

Those students who successfully passed exams over the entire course of study could become functionaries in the royal government at that time. There are many buildings here and they present a complex view of the academic culture of ancient Vietnam. Artifacts of past times are provided. The area had many local tourists visiting while we were there, and this could be distracting. But if you focus on the buildings and their history, you realize the depth of academic interest in ancient Vietnam, the Confucian influence from China, as well as the influence of Vietnamese local dieties. If you have time, this is a worthwhile place to visit."

The temple is featured on the back of the 100,000 Vietnamese \u0111\u1ed3ng banknote (about $5usd). During the T\u1ebft celebration, calligraphists will assemble outside the temple and write wishes in H\u00e1n t\u1ef1. Great for gifts."

We went to our hotel for help, and the staff there said we had to pay $15 to the corrupt police force just to get them to look at our report (we don't expect to get the phone back, but we need the report for insurance purposes). Not sure if this money even went to the police -- or just into the pockets of the hotel staff. Very upset with the people of Hanoi right now. It seems like everything is a scam."

You can really take your time, walk around as there is plenty to see, plenty of room and enjoy the experience of the temple without being pushed around by tourists."

A definite must-see when you're in Hanoi, if only for the contrast between the incredibly peaceful Temple grounds and the chaos that is the Hanoi traffic outside! If you've got time to kill, you could definitely pass a couple of hours sitting and reading in one of the little alcoves that are scattered throughout the grounds of the Temple. The Temple's gardens are stunning, and the history of the National University is quite interesting as well. On the morning we visited, we had the pleasure of watching some local students graduate from high school, which was both lovely and very entertaining!"

I counted my change at the counter and it was short. The lady just stared at me blankly whilst I made her count it three times... with a contemptuous attitude she finally threw the right change at me.I mentioned this later back at the hotel and another traveller said she had the same thing happen. Another traveller I mentioned this to a week later also said they had the same thing happen to them at this place.Be careful - Dont be ripped off........."

It would be well worth while to either read up about the temple before a visit, or to go with a guide. There is so much of significance and so many interesting artefacts that one would bypass if uninformed.Have you ever wondered why the Vietnamese use a Latin script? That came from the time of occupation by the Portuguese. That was just one of the many facts of interest learnt from our guide.The temple has a number of courtyards, all of which have a different significance. Bonsai trees, some of which are over 400 years old, are an attractive feature, as are the colourful and tranquil gardens. The temple is a haven in the midst of Hanoi's frantic traffic.One word of warning: be careful of the very aggressive T-shirt sellers at the entrance to the temple, and don't let them see your money. One woman had her hand in my bag and tried to grab a handful of notes. She became loudly abusive when stopped. The modus operandi seems to be to thrust T-shirts at people and then demand payment. So beware and be aware!"

Half a dozen graduates in lovely white dresses were there on a photo shoot; actually we encountered photo shoots for weddings or graduations in similar attractive places we visited in Ha Noi.Entrance fee 20k VND per adult.Highlights:Attractive courtyards, and many bonsai plants.Doctors' stone stelea.Historical items, such as parchments, writing implements, gowns. Important: Walk all the way to the far end courtyard, as few tourists seem to venture there, there are historical items on display, and also go upstairs. Also another food/drink shop.Also, in that area, there was a small auditorium with a small ensemble of women playing traditional instruments as well as singing...the singer had a really beautiful voice. Naturally there were CDs for sale of them, and so now I have a sound track for my travel slide show! All that made this visit worthwhile.FYI, nearby are two \"charitable\" restaurants, we ate at KOTO (Know One Teach One) which was fine and not expensive, the other Cafe Smile (which we did not see) - both in in Van Mieu St I believe."

It's pretty hard to travel around without being wary of taxi scams anyway so going for a group tour probably gives you a peace of mind. APT Travel, the agency that handled my tour is a safe bet."

There is so much symbolism throughout the Temple that we would have missed a great deal if we had not had help.Our student guides took time to stop and pray for good exam results. I hope it works.Each courtyard has meaning and the whole complex has developed over the centuries, each building has special significance. Temple to Confucious is magnificent and the staircase in the Kings' building is one to remember.For me the defining moment was seeing the stellae, inscribed with the names of those who achieved their doctorate."

Imagine a tree-lined shady avenue which opens in what is apparently asian architecture and lacquered deep red pillars; well this is so much more..it's like a combination of garden and square basins covered by large waterlilies, which was established in 1076 in honor to Confucius and cultured scholars, notably mandarins. When these guys got a degree, their name was placed on marble slabs hung on turtle-shaped stands in the garden, and there are so many! We may well consider this place a campus of nine hundreds ago, like the Oxford of Asia. Well worth a visit!1"

Especially, there's an interesting tree just to one's left upon entering the place. I didn't know how old it was but it's large and the root system seems to have grown above the ground. John, our guide, was really helpful. He provided us a lot of interesting information about the temple's history. His explainations gave us a thorough idea about the place. There was only one negative fact, that were some ladies just outside the temple who were pretty pushy about selling their postcards, but other than that...no complaints!

However, I think most short term visitors would be better off skipping Van Mieu (as the Vietnamese call it). The same goes for many other of the city's \"attractions.\" Hanoi is a city for taking in the atmosphere. Do sit down for coffee at a quaint place in the old quarter, sample the local street food and draft beer (bia hoi), stroll around Hoan Kiem lake while senior citizens are doing Tai Qi, love birds are holding hands, students are reading books and youngsters are playing badminton. Hanoi is not a city for sightseeing. Its monuments and museums can be pleasant and interesting. But to be honest they are generally modest and unimpressive compared to what you would find in many other historic Asian cities (i.e. Shanghai, Beijing, Yangon, Kyoto, Bangkok, etc.)In a nutshell, Van Mieu is a small, historic, temple-like compound with some gardens, pavilions and altars. Tour books may point out that the site was founded as a Confucian academy 1,000 years ago, but like many places in Vietnam, it has suffered from harsh weather conditions, war and until recently, neglect (the original architectural planning has been maintained, but many of the buildings you see are relatively recent reconstructions. )If you have several days in Hanoi, by all means visit because its very near the city center and the admission is cheap.

The event was a cultural experience for me because many of the visitors laid money at the foot of the altars and prayed. I have a picture of the roof with money scattered across it. That would never happen in the United States (someone would snatch it for sure). The only problem I had was the ticket vendor tried to take 200,000 d out of my hands when the entrance fee was only 20,000 d. As an aside, you have to pay 1,000 d to use the restroom."

Unless you can read Chinese, they are indecipherable, which is a shame as it would give you further insight into what was clearly a rigorous academic culture for so long ago. One thing that did let this attraction down, however, was the presence of tacky souvenir stands and hawkers (even one women who had parked herself and her wares underneath a sign out the front that warned people off for buying and selling goods at that location!). It was unecessary and definitely detracted from what was a very interesting and pretty peaceful experience."

It was formerly the most prestigious school in Vietnam, founded and maintained in the Confucian tradition, with the names of students in each class who passed three rigorous exams carved in stone tablets, and the names of top students memorialized in the temple inside, where statues of three famous headmasters stand today. The buildings, classic examples of Vietnamese architecture, sit among beautifully landscaped grounds. The boys especially liked the elaborate dragons at the entries to the inner complex. It is a pleasant, peaceful stop amid the bustle of Hanoi. For more details of this and other parts of our trip, go to http://maketrax.blogspot.com"

To give it its Vietnamese name \"Van Mieu\", it is the ancient training school for national mandarins and is older than Oxford University. Her the top government officials trained and took their exams which were set by the emperor every few years. Although traffic circulates right around the Van Mieu it is often a haven of peace in central Hanoi and best to visit early in the mrning or late in the evening when there are fewer visitors. It is built much like a forbidden city or a pagoda with several parts that culminate at the end one. There is a rebuilt building (the former one was bombed by the Americans) housing the stues of kings and scholars still revered today. A must on a visit to Hanoi."

As it was much colder compared to our first trip, we did not see visitors wearing ao dai. However, we still enjoyed our visit, seeing throngs and throngs of locals and tourists coming in and out. We arrived in time in the early morning to witness some senior ladies, garbed in very colourful traditional costumes, singing and dancing outside one of the inner temples.There was also a \"live game\" inside, which looked like chess, with a giant chessboard. As an announcer mentioned the latest move of a player, a man with a flag would move the marker to the correct location.Outside the Temple of Literature there were many artists writing calligraphy on red scrolls to encourage their customers so that they can do well in their studies.We plan to visit this place every time we make a trip to Hanoi."

When you pass through the walls which separate the Temple from the busy streets, you could easily imagine how it felt 1000 years ago when a scholar passes through the gates for classes. With the high brick walls and big trees, the sounds of Hanoi are muted as you work your way past the courtyards.The Temple was built to honor the ways of Confucius as the learning pedagogy at that time leaned towards on the Chinese style. The third courtyard has a murky pool in the middle with stone turtles bearing slabs on their shells surrounding it. The next courtyard holds a temple with a red lacquered statue of Confucius and a gift shop. When we were there end Oct 2011, no guided tours were available. It might be a good idea to read up on the Temple before heading over to appreciate the buildings and courtyards that you pass through. Entrance fees are about VND10,000. You would need a minimum 45 minutes to explore the place."

Right away one senses the reverence that Vietnamese give to learning early on in their history. It is evident in the physical layout as the place is graced by five courts and a memorial to outstanding scholars. Hedges are trimmed to look like upright books while altars are dedicated to the famed professors of old... To this day students troop to the temple for good old-fashioned lectures and prayers led by esteemed temple scholars. I have no doubt that VIetnamese of today and the future will continue to benefit from the virtue of learning from the Temple of Literature."

REVIEWThe building itself is beautiful and the grounds are well preserved. The fee to get in is small but it is very overtouristed. We enjoyed our brief time here mainly because of the photography exhibit which was on display out the back (visited on the 1/12/2011). If it wasn't for this I would've found it possibly a little bit boring.CONCLUSIONDefinitely worth a visit due to it's proximity to old quarter and it's fine architecture.

I only stopped into the Temple of Literature because it was \"on the way\" walking between the Ho Chi Minh mausoleum and the Hua Lo Prison.

When you have walked for 20 minutes through noisy bustling Hanoi, and you pay your entrance fee (10,000 Dong, or about US$0.50), you step through into another world of calm tranquility. There is a loveliness to it which is hard to express. When I arrived, for reasons I never really worked out, there were a lot of young pretty Vietnamese girls formally dressed up, running around laughing and holding hands. I remember thinking to myself that if this wasn't what Heaven looked like, we had to at least be getting close...If you walk all the way up the far end, there is a housed area which presumably hosts the museum. Not much is provided in English, so you need to try and work things out a bit for yourself. But there are a collection of very old looking scrolls on display with dates like \"1405\" written next to them. Even if you don't fully understand, it is pretty enigmatic.But the gardens and ponds and the flowers and pavillions all make for a very welcome break from the hustle and bustle.

Wonderful place to take pics and get to grips with the early eductaion system of Viet Nam. You will need to find out the process of a Mandarin as well as why they are represented by Turtles. You will also see a different way of offereing money by throwing it on the roof the main building ? I know just stand next to it with a big net but the notes are smallest in Viet Nam and worth about 10p or 15cents. A guide is recommended as there is so much to learn about the buildings and how the functioned as well as all the symbols and carvings. It gets very busy around school holidays so trya nd avoid June and July or just go early in the day. It much cooler anyway and easier to get around"

I am glad we went back another day as it is well worth a visit.Even though there are crowds of people milling around, there is a certain sense of peace and tranquility that comes when entering the Temple. The Temple complex and grounds are lovely and we spent quite awhile just looking around. We didn't go with an organised tour or guide - so not sure what we missed out on information wise - but maybe that added to the tranquillity of this place for us - we could just wander and read information at our leisure.It was also nice to visit a place that did not have street vendors or touts trying to get you to buy something. Instead, there are a couple of nice souvenir shops if you want to browse or purchase something.Tip: If you are looking for somewhere close by for lunch - Koto is just across the road."

The girls were like beautiful butterflies and the boys sedate moths in their dark suits and white shirts and ties. It was a delightful experience, made even more memorable for us when a young Vietnamese girl got up her courage to talk to me - my Lonely Planet book was the ice-breaker. She knew about it the origins of this icon of the traveller's world because her teachers had told her about it - maybe communist Vietnam still wants to learn the lessons of how an individual can make good if they come up with the right idea at the right time!While the visit itself does not take long, it is one of the \"must-see\" sights of Hanoi and we found it was walkable from our hotel in the old quarter."

            "review": "Small, Crowded UNESCO Site. Many guidebooks describe the Temple of Literature as a half-day obligation, but it is really only a 1-2 hour activity. Its prime claim to fame is a collection of stone steles (large stone slabs) inscribed with the names of the graduates of Vietnam's first university. The entirety of the temple complex is actually rather small and overrun with Vietnamese school children who visit to pray for good grades and admission into the schools of their choice (in addition to common tourists).On a nice day, it's a good activity to pair with the Ho Chi Min Mausoleum complex (gardens, museum, etc.) because they're only a short walk apart.The temple is one of the main attractions in Hanoi and should be included as part of a visit to the city, but don't expect a large comple with good English-language signage -- read up on the sight's history before visiting or take a tour with a local guide from one of Hanoi's numerous tour companies."

It was mildly interesting with a few interesting facts here and there but overall it wasn't the most exciting place to go. The green areas surrounding the temples/shops are quite relaxing but there seems to be a limited amount to what you can actually do. Overall, I believe there's probably a great deal of history the place but I wish they had provided it more clearly (and not supposedly through an extra brochure you had to purchase). Just visiting without a guide (we had a guide but they weren't not extremely knowledgeable on everything when questions were asked - but please note this was an external guide) or paying for more information makes it quite substandard."

Once upon a time, Vietnam or at Least Northern Vietnam was ruled by China.Not quite as nice as the Chan Clan Academy in Guangzhou, China but IGuess it had similar history. The courtyard, the gates, the walls, theGarden's layout are all Chinese. Once upon a time, this was animportant place - it just didn't look it when I visited.Very popular among the tourist - domestic and foreign.As a photographer, my eyes were more keen on the vendors outsideSelling handmade sweets, toys, snacks since they were unusual andDistinctly Vietnamese.There were some hole in a wall snack houses/restaurants nearbyThat served Vietnamese food.

Sure the things there are old, but nothing is translated into any language other than Vietnamese. Going here you will have no idea what you are looking at. The things here are protected fairly well, so maybe that is why it is a world heritage site. There were not many people when we went, but there is really not much to look at... We stayed like 30 minutes, walked through the whole thing and were thinking hmmmm what did we just see...Something that is not good is that kids touch the turtle heads, eventually it will ruin them.If you are tall, beware of low hanging beams! I am about 190cm tall and I nailed myself on one of the beams going under a door. Watch your steps and your head!Overall I am not impressed with this site.By the way, if you are looking for the Koto restaurant, as you exit through the main door turn left, walk to the first street at the end of the temples and then turn left again, look across the street and you will see it within about 30 seconds of when you turn left. It is a little difficult to find because the sign is not easy to see and the colors make it difficult to see. But, it's there. It's probably the only restaurant opposite the temple on that side of the street."

A thorough visit requires at least one hour, preferably more, as it is mentally difficult to rush through such a place. There, the first Vietnam university was established in 1076 for educating the elite within the framework of a Confucian Temple (named Van Mieu) erected a bit earlier (in 1070). It displays among other things a series of 82 steles (not gravestones) of doctors who graduated there between 1484 and 1779. The steles are sitting on the back of large stone turtles (see picture). The entire place can be visited including a first floor in the worshiping place dedicated to Confucius and his followers. Around the inner courtyard of the temple, you will find, unnoticed by most visitors, a display of bonsais, some with tiny characters or small pagodas (see picture). Souvenirs shops. WC (fee: 1000 dong) on the West side. Essential explanations are posted in English and French. Guides in both languages available against fee.The Temple of Literature offers an area of peaceful and relatively quiet environment in the otherwise hectic and noisy traffic in Hanoi. It is popular with tourists as well as the local population. Don't miss it!"

The \"Temple of Literature\" is basically a Confucius temple like you find all over China and the Buddhist world, except not quite as attractive as many of the others. So, if you've been to Confucius temples elsewhere, you don't need to go out of your way to see this one. However, if you haven't seen them, then this is a nice stop on your city tour of Hanoi. Take a guide with you to explain about it, or at least buy the brochure, as there isn't much information inside to help you understand what you're seeing.It was partially destroyed in the war, but rebuilt, and parts of the temple date back about 1,000 years. There are statues of Confucius and Vietnamese kings, where local people come to pray and students pray to Confucius before their exams. However, this type of temple is not as important anymore in Vietnamese culture as it is in Chinese culture. It won't take you very long to visit here, about a half hour is probably enough, but if you have a guide to tell you about it, and you haven't \"been there, done that\" yet, then this is definitely worth your time to stop by for a visit. Perhaps the nicest part is that it's like an oasis in the middle of the city - you step inside the walls and barely hear the honking and motorbike engines from the streets around."

Although we weren't blown away by the attractions in Hanoi, the Temple of Literature was a surprisingly above average sight-seeing experience. We walked there from the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum, which took about 15 minutes. Be sure to purchase a brochure (3,000 dong), as it contains important information for understanding the site.The temple honors important contributors to Vietnamese education and societal development. It is interesting for its architecture (king's passageways vs. those for commoners), historical stone stelae (names of those earning doctorates carved into stone), and devotional areas to Confucius and scholarly kings. Built upon the grounds of the first national university, the temple is still actively used by the Vietnamese, for both prayer offerings and for celebrations. We witnessed gatherings of school-aged children dressed in beautiful gowns, perhaps marking an important educational accomplishment, such as promotion or graduation.Be sure to count your change after purchasing your tickets -- like another reviewer, we were short changed 10,000 dong. Change is given out in small bills, making it difficult to know instantly whether it is correct or not. Once we realized the error, we returned and the worker was quick to hand over the 10,000, almost like she had it ready just in case. \"Mistakes\" such as these are unfortunately common in Hanoi -- always be on guard."
