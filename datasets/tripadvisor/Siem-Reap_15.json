A pretty temple some distance from Siem Reap (about 25 miles) and from the main temples of Angkor Wat (15 - 20 miles) also called the 'pink temple' for it's colouring or the 'lady temple' as it's more intricate carvings are thought to have been carved by the more patient hands of women.My wife and I perhaps made the mistake of cycling there as we were feeling pretty athletic and were relishing a different sight-seeing experience. The heat and humidity weren't too much of an issue as we made regular stops for drinks along the way from the few villages that we cycled past, taking in fresh sugar beet and young coconuts where ever we could and the flat roads were generously dressed in shadows of the tall trees of the adjacent jungle so fitness wasn't an issue either....The real problem was boredom, once out of the area of Anghor Wat the more interesting sites of temples, gates and moats soon disappear and are replaced by less inspiring jungle and a few stilted shacks.Banteay Srei's certainly worth visiting but I'd only consider it as part of an organised tour, it's too remote for tuk-tuks and there's nothing much else within the area - there's a pretty but small garden, some market stalls and a couple of restaurants. Also, the temple's much smaller than those closest to Siem Reap and it's walls aren't very high so there's little shade from the Sun. Consider the time of your visit carefully and refuel with fluids when the opportunity presents itself!"

It was the least busy and the sellers all seemed to be well organised and controlled (and so didn\u2019t have an impact on the actual temple itself). This temple is quite a distance from Siem Reap, and the journey in a tuk tuk was half the enjoyment. We wandered, we took photos, and we enjoyed the tranquillity. Although it is challenging to get here this is the temple I would recommend to anyone coming to see Angkor!!As with most of the temples there are stairs, steps, rock falls, and uneven surfaces to be aware of."

While walking will get an opportunity to see lots of greeneries, possible habitat to some animals. Spotted a buffalo and few dragonfly.There will be a ticket check point before the temple.

Because of its lack of proximity, you'll find that the tuktuk driver will likely ask for a couple bucks more. Considering the hour long roundtrip travel time, it's worth it. You'll also get some spectacular views of the Cambodian countryside. Our tuktuk driver suggested that we take his car instead (for more money, of course), but the truth is that tuktuks are more fun.As for the Banteay Srei complex itself, the temple is exquisite, but small and may be slightly disappointing when compared to the other sites at Angkor. That's why the journey itself is half the attraction. Also, keep in mind that among the sites you visit at Angkor, this will be on the newer side, open to the general public for less than 10 years."

It was also probably the best example of the facade carving decorations out of all the temples we visited.

I understand the temple needs to be protected, especially to preserve the delicate carvings, but it's sort of self-defeating when you have to strain to see them. Not as many photo ops as a lot of the other temples, either. I think the problem was my expectations were too high. Go there with lower expectations and you'll probably love it.

If you are interested in souvenirs and basic shopping highly recommend to shop from the various shops near to the complex. Could bargain little but prices are so reasonable that one does not feel squeezing for a better bargain. Really need a tour guide to highlight the depths and insights of the Hindu mythology etched on the temples and stone carvings. "

Took a stroll around the small complex then went to the outer part where the lilies pond was. Nice view with reflections of the water. Some kids were asking for money but with a firm no they didn't push. They wanted to be photographed so we asked them to smile and showed them the results and that made them happy. On the way back we stopped by the Landmine museum. Not the best but it raised awareness of the seriousness of the issue, victims and people who cared.During our memorable 4 day visit to Siem Reap (3 yrs back), we used the service of a fun and knowledgeable young driver, Sochet (nysochetra@gmail.com, +855 12 331 664, driveangkor.com) who took us around in his sedan or nice tuk tuk incl. from/to the airport.

Stop at the Cambodian Landmine Museum and local markets to ensure a maximal time spent on the way.

Because it comprises a small area, however, it is well worth arriving first thing at 730 so you can see it all in the tranquility it deserves. There is a beautiful walk to be had if you follow the signs towards the boats. The boat ride looked good but I had run out of cash.

Located about 20 kms north of Angkor at the foothills of Kulen mountain, this Jewel of Khmer Art is a temple of great beauty from 10th century,with splendid miniature proportions devoted to Siva and pantheon of Hindu gods. Meaning of Banteay Srei is \" Citadel of the Women \" or \" Citadel of Beauty \". It's also called as Isvarapura. Unlike other major sites at Angkor this is not a royal temple but is built by Yajnavaraha, one of the ministers of King Rajendravarman, who later became guru of future kings. Signage board at the reception is quite informative. I was tremendously impressed by the delicacy of each carving and unique arrangement of central platform that followed cardinal principle of Yama from south and rest such as Kubera, Varuna as per the traditional pattern.Since it's located away from Angkor there are no crowds and I could enjoy fresh breeze and slight drizzle as I walked on causeway to main tower. Lintels and pediments with sand stone reliefs are rich in ornamentation and need to be enjoyed without any hurry. Stories from hindu mythology depicted on carvings are quite exceptional and a treat to appreciative eyes. Same ticket that was for Angkor Wat is valid here. There is also a restaurant and few shops selling souvenirs inside the campus at entrance.One has to plan in advance by hiring Tuk Tuk to reach the place and take you back to the hotel.Not to be missed."

Although, the ticketing process is handled efficiently our guide did help with getting a ticket quickly, with a photo taken, and the queues can build up with tour bus loads arriving...so get there as early as possible to beat the crowd. The temples are well worth the visit. Known informally as Ladies Temple because the thought is that the stone carvings are so detailed that only women could have done such fine work. The pink coloured stone makes this temple a must see for a different experience. The site offers easy access to temple area and it is not difficult to walk around this temple.

The whole side trip was definitely worth doing.Unlike the main Angkor temples, Banteay Srei is made from pink limestone, not gray limestone.

It is unique in the detail that remains on the reliefs. The surrounding land is very beautiful. There was a band made up of land mine victims that we sat and listened to when we needed a break from the heat and hiking. Of course, it is important to tip them or buy a CD. You can grab food, drinks, and souvenirs there as well. On the way, stop and visit the Land Mine Museum and the butterfly garden."

Banteay Srei was worth the drive to see the small scale Hindu temple with very intricate carvings. The temple is essentially all at ground level with no climbing. The monkey statues guarded the east facing entrances to the main temple tower. The guide had extensive knowledge of history but his English was a bit hard to understand. Our tour stopped at a restaurant south of Banteay Srei, popular for tour stops, with great food including Khmer Amok served in a coconut."

Apparently the French justified taking some of the temple back to Paris on the basis no human could have done carving that good.

If you have done Angkor Wat and other major ones already, this is a good choice provided you still want to visit another Hindu temple."

You could easily get a tuk-tuk for $20 USD, but we paid $25 USD as we really appreciated our driver. Banteay Srei is well worth the visit. The carvings are very intricate and detailed and you see different shades of pink depending on the time of day. There is a platform outside the main wall of the temple from where you can get a great view over the wall of the entire complex - you need to follow the track towards the boat rides.This temple complex is like a little village."

He kept saying no. Suddenly another police approaches, asks for $5 tip for a private tour. What can I do? Had no choice since I couldn't come back the next day and otherwise they won't let me in. Was there for about 20 minutes took some pictures. Nice thing was that there were no other people. Highly recommend to visit before 5 at least. On the way back in the tuktuk was a bit scary since there is nothing on the road. Even the tuktuk driver told us to put everything away because he didn't know the neighborhood.

The temple itself is small and often overcrowded once inside. But the carvings are worth seeing. The temple is farther away from Angkor Wat so some people might skip it.

And of course, appreciate the temples more.I would love to go back and see the temple again and hopefully get to see the carvings closer."

Getting to the Lady Temple will take you about 40 minutes on a tuk-tuk... its a drive but worth the time and very easy to see why its worthy of its Unesco World heritage site monument.. (right before the entrance of the Banteay Srei Temple. With thanks to a small musician's band at the far end of the temple the air is filled with birdsong and melodies from a more gentle time - there are several eateries and shops around.. be prepared to haggle, prices are super inflated ( 70USD for a small silk table cloth..and normally when you walk away the price drops to 10USD.. amazing..) Back to the Temple.. have a camera handy.. and patience.. tourists are everywhere..making unique pictures hard to come by.. the site is blessed with an abundance of picturesque moments.. and and some rice paddies and such in the area if you have the time to explore."

It is well worth the trip.The temple is very different from the others in that it is constructed of pink sandstone. The colors are beautiful and very unusual. My guide told me that if you are there at sunset, the temple walls \"shine\". I had hoped to visit the temple during the time of day when the sun would be at the right angle but unfortunately our schedule put us there in the middle of the day. Still, the temple was beautiful and it was one of my favorites. If you have the time, don't miss seeing this very different temple."

This is one of the older temples, yet it's in great shape. The sandstone here has more of a pinkish hue to it than the more gray sandstone found at Angkor Wat and company.Because Banteay Srei is so small, it can easily get inundated by tour groups. These groups typically arrive at Banteay Srei in the late morning or early afternoon, so I would try to arrive there earlier in the morning or later in the afternoon.It takes about 45 minutes to drive from Banteay Srei from Siem Reap. It's a pretty drive, however, as you pass through many rice fields, and countless homes on stilts. I think the drive alone is worth the excursion, as it will give you a feel for rural Cambodia.-- John Shors, bestselling author of Temple of a Thousand Faces: A Novel of Angkor Wat"

What really differentiates it from other temples:- The temple is made from \"pink colored\" stones. That's why it is very often to be associated with goddess or ladies. - This temple depicts the story of Ramayana (Rama and Sita). So you will see Hanuman statue as the guard of this temple. - You can't get inside the temples - you can only walk around and see from the distant. To walk 1 round is only like 15-20 mins - so not really much to see, but again, this is the pink temple. - Since you can only walk around - when there are group of tourists walking around - it is a bit chaotic, noisy and you can't enjoy the tranquility of this temple. So best time is to get to this temple in early morning. - To get this temple is like 1 to 1.5 hour from Charles De Gaulle Boulevard (using Tuk-tuk). The other nearby objects/things-to-do are Landmine museum (1-2 hours visit) and Butterfly Center (I didn't go to here). So think carefully if you have plenty time to get to this temple or no, as the travelling time from and to Banteay Srei can take like 2-3 hours."

It is close quarters here so you can easily turn around and enjoy the design. This \"Citadel of Women\" also presents a rarity among the many temples of Siem Reap as one should look for the mitering of the \"window\" openings. Banteay Srei truly complements the many temples you can visit and should be on your list."

You pass through lovely little villages and get to see authentic Cambodian life. The temple itself is really nice especially if you are into the beautifully preserved carvings but apart from the carvings it doesn't have that wow factor and it is just so incredibly hot there due to it being so exposed to the sun. There is very little shading to escape the sun so we rushed through it and didn't really appreciate how beautiful it is. The trip should be combined with the hidden gem of the Angkor temples - Banteay Samre which is just stunning and is on the way to Banteay Srei."

Although smaller than some of the other temples, there are some lovely intricate carvings gracing this 10th century Hindu temple. We took a tuk tuk there which took about 45 minutes. The drive itself was part of the experience for us, we enjoyed the cool breeze while we were driving through the scenic countryside.When we arrived there were not very many people there and that combined with its location made it feel serene and tranquil. We were able to take our time walking around and easily spent an hour looking at all of the detailed carvings.We\u2019d been told the best time to visit this site was before 10:00am or early afternoon around 2:00pm to take advantage of the light hitting the sandstone to get the full benefit of the red colouring of the stone. We arrived at around 9:00am and did see the beautiful colouring of the stone. It was also a good time to visit to avoid the full heat of the sun. I think it has been my favourite temple so far and can easily see why it is considered a \u201cprecious gem\u201d.Entrance to this temple was included in the Angkor Pass. To visit any of the Angkor Wat temples you need to have an Angkor Pass, available in 1, 3 or 7 day passes. This gives you access to the temples for any of those number of days in a given week, or month if you have a 7 day pass, they don\u2019t have to be used on consecutive days. We went with a 3 day pass for $40. When you go to the main entrance to get your pass your photo is taken and printed on the pass, which you must present on each visit to a temple.Would recommend a visit even though it is a little way out. The drive out there is part of its charm."

Well worth the trip. The site is well organised with the entry point away from the temple with information and a shop. On one side there is a museum and a market and restroom. On the other the start of the walk up. An easy walk until you get to the step (not many compared to some of the others).Inside you can tell it was not for devotion but for practical purposes. The iconic religious symbolism is less prominent but the protective icons are there. Apsara are the images most seen but the highlight are the monkey guardians around the main structure most intact and very detailed (see image).The tour round goes round the gardens or the lake both of which were dust bowls when we were there. It has been so hot and dry but a nice walk. Be wary, the market is more expensive than the central markets with no uniqueness or additional quality and not the friendliest if you look but find it too expensive."

It's more brown than pink; completely no roof so immensely hot; quite a small and compact temple, especially when the inner part is closed (can see from outside); unluckily went at the same time as 2 big bus tours so it was..hmm...full of women trying to pose and look good under the blazing sun in front of every stone. However, you find amazingly preserved carvings and structures, which are usually lost in the other temples. Must wear clothing that cover shoulder and knees~ (i just wrapped a shirt around my waist and was let pass~)I do not regret spending the money (had to travel by car due to the long distance, not by tuk tuk) and time on travel to get here. Note that according to the driver, when it rains it's impossible to drive to these far away temples, so beware if you are traveling during the rain season (starting from May I think)our day plan for your reference:Board car 5am at hotel, see sunrise at Angkor Wat, look at the galleries we missed in our first visit; jump back on the car by 8am, go to landmine museum en route to Banteay Srei; spent a little bit longer than we should in the museum as it was so informative and important, ended up having less time to see Banteay Srei; drove to Beng Melea, turned our head around to a restaurant as it was already noon, way too hot to be walking around; saw Being Melea after lunch (unfortunately it's a big ruin, without a guide we couldn't really make sense of it; and we only had less than an hour as we wanted to see sunset in Rolous Group; 5 minutes stop at Lolei temple as it was under renovation; longer stop at Preah Ko, as it was almost empty (our 3 days temple visit conclusion: any crowded temple is unattractive temple; any empty temple is amazing temple. TRUE! As there's always so much to see so much to explore if you have the space); and at last to Bakong Temple for sunset. The car for the day: UDS75"

For all the sombre majesty of the imposing structures at Angkor Wat and Angkor Thom this little red sandstone temple sits in isolation as a tiny miniature. Banteay Srei is a 10th century Hindu jewel that packs a different kind of atmosphere. More peaceful, delicate, gentle, feminine. Its name means 'citadel of the women' or 'citadel of beauty' and the intricate bas relief carvings on walls and above doorways are amazingly well preserved. Apsara dancers. Elephants. Kings. Gods. Demons. Battles. Chariots. And the statues around one building feature a guardian group of human figures with animal heads that conjure one of the major fight scenes in the 2001 'Tomb Raider' film.The Angkor temples deserve so many adjectives but Banteay Srei is the one for \"beautiful\".Unmissable ...!"

The grounds include botanical gardens and a fishing lake but really, it's the temple itself that has to be seen. Because of its great condition and delicate sandstone, you can't get as close to it as some of the other temples closer to the city but just to see it is good enough. just like the Koh Ker temple system, it's a drive but if you flew all the way from the US like I did, it'd be a shame not to drive just a little more and see this wonder.

At Banteay Srei, both these are extextensively used for for both purposes.Bantei Srei is so called today because of the lovely devatas carved on its walls.

It just makes you marvel at how this was created and what it all meant to the makers.The band at the exit is pretty incredible too - and deserves your donation.Take your time and stop along the drive out to the temple because the people are \"just living\" but are so warm and willing to share their lives with visitors. It will make your time in Cambodia so much more meaningful."

The detail is quite exquisite and given it is so remote it feels a little bit special. What's interesting and sad all at the same time was our guide let us know they are yet to know where the stone came from... be it that given the land mines they are still yet to explore the local area.

It was on my \"must see' list along with Angkor Wat because I wanted to see the intricate and detailed carvings that everyone was talking about. My first impression was that it was so small compared to all the other temples we had seen that day. Besides its diminutive size, it was remarkable because of its red color that our guide explained was due to the use of laterite stones used to build the temple. He further explained that laterite is often mistaken as basalt, or some type of volcanic rock, there are no volcanoes in Cambodia, so this isn't possible. Banter Srei is also called the \"lady temple\" because it is presumed that the carvings were done by women, not men, hence the level of detail in each of the carvings. The other plus to this temple is that the carvings have not been defaced or ruined as they have been in many of the other temples as the kingdom went through alternating periods of Hindu and Buddhist leaning leaders."

A belated review, as I travelled in January and am still catching up.!Further out of Siem Reap than most, but the stunning setting, intricate stonework, and even the slightly different slightly dark rusty colour of the temples themselves, make this longer than usual trip worth it. Still quite busy, but NOT on the scale of the larger Temples.Everyone else has said everything about Banteay Srei, but I will add that behind the complex, to the right as you face it , there's a path that's signposted as 'fishing and boat trip'. Don't get too excited about the boat trip, but head that way..it's 5 minutes, for some spectacular photo opportunities over the surrounding open countryside and distant hill or two. The car park (entrance) is well signposted, you won't get lost.!One other top tip I can certainly give some of you is :If you wear contact lenses, travelling any distance outside of town on the dusty roads is NOT a good idea. For your comfort, and so not to ruin your day, remove them and revert back to glasses. Luckily I had my glasses with me, otherwise it would have seriously ruined my day. Be warned.Also, tie this trip in with a stop at The Cambodian Landmine Museum....a very small but poignant Museum with a big message.!"

It's in the middle of nowhere, quite far but taking a tuktuk ride is worth taking because of the sceneries along the way. And, Banteay Srei is kind of special compare to the others as it is pink though it's quite small, we had a great time. Have a look, especially for those temple lovers"

We combined it with other remote sites on a day car trip. It's not too far from Kbal Spean (although you need to be in the rainy season to make a good visit here) and works well with Beng Mealea, albeit about an hours' drive."

My guide said this is called the \"Lady Temple\" because of the delicate details that you can see on most of the buildings; it also has a pinkish hue. The detailed carvings are still deep and distinct because the stone used is more durable than the softer stone elsewhere in Angkor Wat where many details have worn away or dulled. The beautiful carvings are visible from a distance as well as up close in many of the passageways. It takes a little time to drive to, but it's uniqueness makes it well worth the trip."

This has been more commercialised which had the benefit of some more information boards detailing the history and this temple being older than some of the others is different in style. It has cafes and lovely countryside and a boat trip you can take too.It has had a couple of renovation attempts during the last century and has been roped off which helps in preserving, but also allows you to take pictures without other tourists. Make sure you visit Banteay Samre on the way. There was hardly any one there for us unlike Banteay Srei!"

Finely carved on the pediments of temple are scenes from famous Hindu mythologies such as Ramayana and Mahabharata.

Located a 20min drive from Angkor Wat, this temple has some of the most spectacular carving detail that we saw in our 2 day tour with the excellent Siem Reap Tour Guide Services. A smaller temple that feels more intimate than the others. Don't miss this if you are in Siem Reap!"

So sometimes its frustrating as you have to wait on others to get their perfect shot before you get a chance to appreciate the beauty of this temple.Others have mentioned going before 10:30am. I do agree. I got there before 10:30 and had a beautiful view of the temple. After that time the position of the sun do put some of the depictions in yhe shade n harder to seeNote to tourists: if you are there only for a photo op note there are people there who are actually there to see the temple!"

It is built from a different sandstone than the other temples and so stands out in its pink-orange hues. You get a sense of how the average Khmer person is anywhere up to 50% smaller than the average westerner, and the women more so, because all entrances to this temple are roughly four feet in height. Definitely a must on the Angkor circuit. None of these major temples should be missed, and this one is no exception. All are amazing feats of architecture and quite awe inspiring. If you are visiting in the wet season you might want to space out your temple visits over a few days as it is easy to become tired after seeing two, and you risk not experiencing them to their fullest. Hire a guide for the best experience, the Khmer guides are highly informative and exceptionally friendly, and will show you small interesting intricate elements of the temples you might otherwise miss."

After spending the first few days exploring the closer temples we took a tuk tuk about 45 min to Banteay Srei (definitely recommend this vs a car- a bit longer but you take in the scenery, smells, etc so much better and very much adds to the experience). We got there right as they opened (7:30am) and missed all of the tour buses (9am or so)which made for a great experience. There were local musicians on our way out as well as some shot hiking (flat) trails and even small boats for hire to explore the local river which really added a great component to touring the temple. Would highly recommend, we headed to Pre Rup and Ta Phrom afterwards. Made for a good day."

From Pub street, we have negotiated $10 Tuk Tuk return fare. We have combined Bantey Kdei and Shooting Range in this trip. You immediatly notice an organised parking space packed with buses and a real reception center, with bathrooms, ticket counters, souvenirs boots and some information on the site. This temple was my absolute favorite. The sandstone gives it a rich deep pink colour and the carving is much more intricate and detailed than all the other temples, including Angkor Wat.Many historians have asserted that this temple is the highest achievment of art from the Angkor period. There are amazing opportunities for photos here. Easiest temple to walk around with no major climbing and takes less than two hours to see. Not so many tourists at this one when we went in the late afternoon."

The temple is quite small, but it has beautiful intricate carvings, created with incredible attention to detail. Its rich ornaments earned it a name of \"Ladies' Temple\". All the structural details are very well preserved.Plan your visit early on the day or later in the afternoon, and do not forget your camera - as this is probably the most photogenic of all the temples. Once you arrive, you walk past a very smartly developed \"visitor centre\" with facilities and shopping stalls, where you can peacefully choose your souvenirs. Unfortunately, that is not enough to stop young children running after you and peddling all sorts of things, which can be annoying. It is generally not advised to buy anything from them, as their parents are likely to push them into selling things instead of going to school.Still, you forget all the annoyances once you enter this little gem of a temple."

Really hot if visiting in the afternoon, evening or early morning will be better for sight seeing. Make sure you carry water bottles and wet wipes."

I was personally overwhelmed by a crowd of at least 30 old ladies that took pictures on a one-by-one basis in front of each piece of interest... but there was no way to escape without falling into another group with a guide, a colourful umbrella and a loudspeaker."

Banteay Srei is a small temple so 10 bus loads of tourists crowd it out quickly. Since the temple is small and if you have the option of your own transport you can probably wait 15 to 30 minutes strolling around some of the other areas around the temple and let the tours work their way through. Bantay Srei is definitely worth visiting but dont expect large temples - it is about the fine detail in the intricate carvings which are worth taking your time to appreciate."

Because of the distance, the crowds are less. A further side benefit is that you get to see some of the countryside of Cambodia, passing through small villages and by many farms.The temple itself is carved from pink sandstone and has much more detail in its carvings than the other sites. It was built as a Hindu complex and has a different look and feel from the other sites of the Angkor Wat Archeological Park. It is more compact. The main temple is surrounded by a moat which becomes a reflecting pool for the structure. We visited fairly late in the afternoon which made the whole site appear to be a peaceful retreat from the other more famous temples. Don't miss it!"

However, you still get in using the regular park ticket. Because it is relatively isolated and much further to travel, tuk-tuk drivers charge extra to come here (about 10$ more than they charge for whole day trips to the park itself). On top of that because of its isolation and small size the crowds have less places to disperse to, and so we found it the most crowded temple that we visited (and we visited them all). It is said in the guide books that the reason to make the trip out to Banteay Srei is the great quality of the carvings there, but the quality actually on display didn\u2019t strike us as being much better than we found elsewhere, although perhaps items now transferred to the national museum may be better than those left on site. To be clear they were stunning - just not particularly more stunning than elsewhere. Unlike other temples there was a nice display area about the restoration work and the \u2018Malraux affair\u2019 near to the entrance building which is worth a look. When we got to the temple it was mobbed. In an attempt to avoid the crowds we took a side walk through the woods and came upon a place doing boat rides and so took one (7 US$ for 2 people \u2013 refused to barter). It was great and something a bit different and extra to what is on offer elsewhere. We moved along at a snails pace through lotus and lily beds surrounded by dragonflies for about 15-20 minutes, but instead of taking us in a circle back to where we started, the guy dumped us off at the far end of the entrance car park. We attempted to make our way back to the temple without having to trek back through all the shops and the entrance buildings but it must have looked like we were trying to get in without showing our park ticket, since they scrambled an official on a motorbike to intercept us, and ask what we were doing. He was fine when we explained what had happened and showed him our valid tickets and he allowed us to continue back to the temple along the \u2018exit\u2019 route. By the time we got back to the temple it was lunch time and what a difference, most of the tour bus crowds had dispersed and walking around the temple was much more pleasant and relaxed. So based on our experience here are 3 tips: 1) if you are not part of an organised tour then aim to visit around lunch time ie 1200 to 1330h, it is way less crowded then. 2) don\u2019t take the boat trip until after you have been to the temple and you intend to leave the complex. 3) if you try to get in without showing a ticket they will catch you. (The fine is 100 US$ apparently)"

Walking through this masterpiece and learning its history should not be missed."

It is about an hour drive out of Siem Reap so you get the chance to see local people going about their daily life in small villages along the way.Banteay Srei is a Hindu temple dedicated to Shiva. It is cut from stone that has a dark pinkish hue. The carvings are very deep so they look 3D and the whole temple, though small, is very well preserved. It is a square temple that has an east and west entrance and it is one of the few temples that was not built by a king. It is believed to have been built by a brahman in 967AD. There are three central towers and these are decorated with male and female divinities and beautiful filigree relief work. There are also many carvings of women wearing traditional skirts and carrying lotus flowers in their hands.Banteay Srei was the first major temple to be restored.Beautiful temple that is well worth a visit.

To get there, you will pass a very old temple that in itself is worth seeing - but Banteay Srei is the star attraction; it may well be the most beautiful and haunting temple in the area. Sometimes known as the \"pink temple\" because of the unique color of the local stone it is made of, it sits in an area enclosed by a moat, with the illusion of undisturbed time. The light in late morning causes the temple to glow with a warmth that is beguiling, and the carvings are in good condition. This may sound like heresy, but given only one chance to see any of the temples, I would choose this one above all others."

The touristic shops and large car park is a bit of a let down after all the intimate temples you find in the forest less frequented by bustours.Great new white toilet building a couple minutes past East Mebon with a stunning views, worth a stop as it will be another 30-45min yo Banteay Srei."

This time our longtime friend, guide and tuk-tuk driver Phon suggested a longer trek to Banteay Srei, a small temple beyond the main Angkor Wat wonder. Took about an hour along leafy, shaded country roads before we arrived at the mini-park and was it a surprise. (Tip: You must have an Angkor Wat pass to go here, as is true of most of the temples in the area. Since I was going to be in Siem Reap twice in about four weeks, I bought a week pass for $60US. It is good for seven days (a single-day pass is $20) but you can use it any time within a month time frame).Banteay Srei is one of the best facilities I have seen. You are greeted with a clean, attractive reception building adjacent to a nicely organized, extensive area featuring Cambodian crafts and souvenirs. A short walk, much of it shaded by towering trees, takes you to the temple. All along the way you see wonderful carvings, lintels and other delights. You pass by a traditional Khmer band demonstrating their skills (tips appreciated). You will see occasional vendors but they seem less aggressive here than at other sites.The trip was pleasant (and we stopped by Khmer Kitchen, an excellent little restaurant which I have reviewed here, for lunch) and the temple, though fairly small, is stunning. With a lunch stop this can be a very lovely three or four hour excursion and there are opportunities for other stops along the way."

The temple is built largely of red sandstone, which makes some of the wall carvings stand out. Combine a visit to this temple with a visit to the nearby Landline Museum."

Beanteay srei is an hour's drive from angkor wat but a must visit place and certainly a highlight of my trip. This is a hindu temple dedicated to lord shiva and hasnt suffered extensive damage to the artwork unlike other temples and it is stunning. And the best part is you can combine with a trip to landmine museum which is halfway between angkor and banteay srei. On the way you can cover few places which are best enjoyed from tuk tuk like srah srei(a massive rectangular water storage reservoir and another spot for watching sunrise after angkor) and pre rup temple(massive temple but suffered a lot of damage). On your way back, you can cover phimeneakas, elephant terrace and terrace of the leper king. So this circuit has plenty to offer once you are done with big three(angkor wat, ta prohm and bayon)."

Some of the carvings look like they were done within the past decade, not 1000+ years ago!While this is a bit of a trek from Siem Reap City, it is well worth it. A lot of the large tour companies think so, too...so be prepared for large busses FULL of tourists. It can be tricky to get decent landscape photos without a ton of people in the field of view. I suggest heading outside the facility, along the corner of the moat, and capturing some expansive views with reflections in the water. You can also get good close-up shots inside the parameters of the temple."

A few minutes later another policeman came over trying to sell us replica police badges which we did not want. He then became quite aggressive asking us how much we'd paid his colleague.

One thing I don't like is when we exit from the temple, someone look like a police man trying to offer a ride with 1 dollar, after we rejected him, he counter offer selling police batch. This is a disgrace to himself as a police."

The other reviews are absolutely right!The extra 1:30 ride going back and forth was worth it. After the Angkor Wat sunrise and tour, we went to Banteay Srei. At first, I was worrying if it was worth our time. When we got there, my heart sank a bit because it's mostly ruins and it's just a little temple compared to Angkor Wat. But later on as we've come to the main area, I noticed what makes it special. Other reviews have mentioned about the carvings. I realized that's what makes it different.The carvings are very intricate and detailed in Banteay Srei. If you look closely, every carvings tells a different story. I just couldn't imagine how they did these from way back. Or how long it took to create it. We are lucky enough that these were preserved. The red sandstone helps this temple to stand out from the rest too.You could have breakfast here as well. They've got eateries by the exit. But the prices are really high. Since we're asians, we got a lower price than what the menu says. Better to haggle. Or some say bring your tuktuk driver with you to get a better price.It was good timing too that we went here early at least not a lot of people were there already."

However, keep several things in mind. 1) This temple is fairly small and located some 20 km away from the rest of Angkor complex, it is however on the same road as the Kulen mountain, so combining those two things together will save a lot of transportation time. 2) After visiting other Angkor attractions, including Angkor Wat, where people wounder freely and touch anything they want, except for very few particularly delicate carvings or dangerous ruins whicj are fenced, here you'll find many 'do not touch' signs and many fences which not only limit what you can touch, but also what you can see: we were unable to get anywhere close to the famous carvings which are advertised in the guide books. I would also recommend an early morning visit, as there is no shade to hide in. There is also a very nice souvenir market on this site, which has big variety of wood and stone carvings."

Although still very Angkorian in style, it has a distinctly different feel, this may be because it was the only temple which wasn't commissioned by a Monarch.We passed here at lunchtime on our way to Kbal Spean and the car park was packed, when we returned later in the afternoon it was even busier which meant continuously queuing behind tour groups to get a quick look at the carvings.

Set in the midst of greenery, the temple is much more peaceful and less crowded that the ones in the main complex. It has a good visitor centre too with toilets and snack kiosks. The Landmine Museum along the way to Banteay Srei is a recommended stop not so much for the museum itself, but for getting insights into the tragedy that the landmines brought upon the people of Cambodia."

Much more organised than the other temple sites, with clean toilets, little shops, cafe and visitor centre."

En route you can see palm sugar being stirred or mango leather cooked. It is a lovely ride through villages and rice paddies."

Some routes/circuits are 10-12km, but you obviously don't have to follow the recommended three day tours. Biking allowed us to observe daily life in the rural areas outside the temples as well as Siem Reap as a whole.Note 2: do not go ticketless! They will fine you. Grab tickets en route to the temple roads, on your right approx. 3km before arriving at a fork in the road. Angkor is to the left of the fork. Note 3: Money is changed in USD, Cambodia uses the reil as change, like cents. Note4: snack stands and beverages available near Angkor Wat - restaurants too, and vendors line up near other temples. Prices slightly elevated but it's not ridiculous inflation."

I would rather spend this 45 minutes to tour around Angkor Thon area. However, you can see the nice rice field view along the way to this temple and try the ready made sweet palm fruit biscuit."

I couldnt go as we were having a small baby with us and found hard to walk more. I have seen waterfall photos. The stone carvings can be found on the rocks over there. The massive rocks used to construct Angkor Wat had been brought from those mountain through canals. We saw the sunrise at Angkor wat and directly headed to this temple. What I enjoyed more is the en route. It gave the real picture of Siem Reap today."

On the way you will see daily life, rice paddies, rivers, children playing, and all those amazing Asian sites you want to photograph and remember. It has excellent carvings and is in a great setting with water and forest. There is a bit of a walk to get to it but well worthwhile. When we were there a band was playing, all of the members were land mine victims. The amazing music they played really made the setting seam like a place from another time. The best time to visit if you want to stay away from the tour groups is early in the morning. Alternatively go in June or July when no-one is there. However be aware June and July can be very hot so an air con car is a good option. You will visit several of these sites in the same day trip as they are much smaller than Thom or Angkor Wat. If you want a go to the sites a wee way away from Angkor such as the Roluos group or this one you need either a good tuktuk or car driver. Try to get Mr Pahna he is the best in the business. Phone him on +855 1286 45 81 or 855 975085708 e.mail and facebook panhachhouk@yahoo.com and arrange him to pick you up from the airport. If you do manage get him as your driver ask him to take you to the local market for a tour, well worth a look and you can get real gems stones there. On your way into Cambodia you are unlikely to have your full quota of kgs of luggage. Most airlines offer 30kgs but most people take nearly empty suitcases into the country and fill them while they are there. Don\u2019t take a half empty suitcase into Cambodia, fill it up with children\u2019s books, educational toys (no battery operated toys), toothbrushes, soap, shoes, technology items and other useful things. The items don\u2019t need to be new, just in good working condition. Please don\u2019t take lollies or sugary stuff and don\u2019t offer religious items, Cambodians have a diversity of religions available to them, let them choose. You can ask your hotel to distribute the items or take them to the Children\u2019s Sanctuary."

It was a pleasant enough ride, seeing and smelling the local countryside was much more relaxing then a bus or car for us.The walk to the temple is shrouded with the usual hawkers. Including the local police who quietly came alongside offering to sell their insignia and police identification badge and being quite convincing in why I should buy them . We resisted but several others we saw succumbed to the pressure salesman in the local police . The visit to the temple is humbling to say the least . The intricacy of the carvings in what is a fairly small temple is unbelievable, especially noting it was made by females and so many centuries ago.It began raining as we started our tour of this temple which made it very frustrating trying to progress through with visitors huddling in the limited door ways and passageways sheltering from the rain. This temple is advertised as being especially pretty as the sun rises on it to capture the colours; we weren't that committed so didn't arrive at sunrise however pleased that we took the long journey out to see it and begin our Angkor Wat Temple visit. A word of caution, in addition to the pressure to buy everything and anything from the locals, I personally found this very confronting as it was my first contact with landmine victims who were performing as an orchestra as you leave the temple and Just up the road, a severely disfigured young lady approached me begging for money, obviously the victim of a fire or land mine blast and facially unrecognisable, but I'll live with the image and sound of her wailing for years to come.I mention this as several people I spoke to during the tour spoke of similarly graphic encounters that will haunt them because like me, they were not prepared to see this, nowhere is there warnings or guidance."

The pink color of the stone, and the multi colored aging create highlights and depth that are incredible to see. The figures seem to come to life. This temple is very serene. I could have spent an entire day just soaking up the history and the calming atmosphere. The king who built this temple dedicated it to his mother, so this temple is one of the few honoring women. The detailed architecture is superb and worth seeing all on its own. I personally loved the monkey-like seated statues in the inner courtyard.

Yes, the urchins are at other temple sites, but seemingly more so here. But, it is not just the children. Once past the checkpoint I walked down the road towards the temple and 2 uniformed policemen started to approach me. I stopped and one took out a badge and 2 patches identical to the ones on his uniform. He said, \"$10 for all three.\" I said no thank you, and started to walk away and he said, \"OK...$8.\" Again, I politely said \"no thank you\" and continued to walk on. Another policeman also accosted me on the way out with the same scam.Now the bad news for serious photographers. This is the only temple in Siem Reap that I have been to that forbids \"professional photography\" without a permit. Professional photography means...no filters and no tripods, and possibly anything else that does not look like a point and shoot camera. It all started when I was outside the main temple area on a \"grassy knoll.\" There were a total of 3 people; myself, another tourist, and a staff member. I set up my tripod positioned the camera for a wide exposure of the complex, then put on a \"Big Stopper\" for a long exposure to \"hide people.\" When the filter went on the staff member came up to me and said I couldn't use it. I asked why and he said something about changing the color. I explained the purpose, took a picture and showed him that it didn't change the color. I took a few more shots and another staff member came up to me and said I couldn't use a tripod. I asked why and he told me there were too many people. I politely informed him that there were now only 4 people in a 10 meter perimeter of the tripod. But, he was adamant so I packed up and went to the info booth. Sure enough...there is a sign there that states \"No professional camera equipment without a permit.\" But, nobody on site knows anything about the permit.I spent less than 1 hour at the site. The site is small, the buildings remind me a lot of My Son in Vietnam. Morning sun brings out the pink coloration in the buildings so get there early. Perhaps my experience jaded my rating. I would go here if I had time, but I wouldn't put it on a must see list.Actually, the trip to and from Banteay Srei was probably the best part. Lots of \"local\" photo ops along the way. I stopped the tuk tuk driver as we passed a field with a man plowing his field with oxen. I walked through the field and got several shots, then he even allowed me to give it a go and I plowed 2 rows for him...although not quite as straight. He and the driver had a good laugh."

We visited the temple first, then the display and then back to the temple again as we understood better what we were seeing. It's 37 kms from Siem Reap and included in the Angkor Wat pass, so don't forget your pass or you won't get in. The tourist police here were vey pushy trying to sell you bsdges (this happens at other tempkes as well). They also were quite aggressive about my hat. I had bouht a Vietnamese traditional hat at the start of tour and wore it everywhere without problems. Here, one of the tour guides from the site tried to snatch it from with me with no explanation except to say I couldn'twear a hat in the temple. As other tourists had hats on I thought this was another scam, so I continued on. Suddenly I had 2 policemen telling me to take off my hat. I tried to ask why but they just kept sayimg no hat. Eventually one said it was Vietnamese so I couldn't wear it. The penny then dropped about the significance of this hat. I felt mortified as I try hard to be respectful of other cultures. This was the first time the hat had been mentioned as an issue (by this time I had been through Angkor Wat and Angkor Thom without issues). Once they bothered to explain the issue, I stopped wearing the hat. So just beware around sensitivities on this."

We used the afternoon of our second day to go here and to Banteay Samre.Quite a lot of the temples are similar to each other but this is set apart from those by the intricacies of the carvings and the smaller scale of a temple that dates from 968.Our minds were settled by this little extract from a guide written in 1944 by Maurice Glaize, a member of the \u00c9cole fran\u00e7aise d'Extr\u00eame-Orient and conservator of Angkor from 1937 to 1945:\"Given the very particular charm of Banteay Srei - its remarkable state of preservation and the excellence of a near perfect ornamental technique one should not hesitate, of all the monuments of the Angkor group, to give it the highest priority. Although, in our opinion, there is no gain in trying to classify the quite different monuments of Angkor Wat, Banteay Srei or the Bayon in order of merit - nevertheless, Banteay Srei is by popular consensus a \u201cprecious gem\u201d, the \u201cjewel of Khmer art\u201d. This commendation, however, also carries with it the only justifiable criticism - which is that the work relates more closely to the art of the goldsmith or to carving in wood than to sculpture in stone.\""

Because of the distance your driver may require a bit of cash to cover costs. No more than $10. Depending upon your stamina my advice would be to visit Cambodia Landmine Museum, Banteay Srei and possible end with Bang Mealea or Banteay Samre. Get the furthest ones done in one sitting"

We took a Tuk Tuk from our hotel and it took about an hour to get there but the country side is beautiful and it's nice to take it all in. It costs extra for a Tuk Tuk to go out there, prepare to pay 20-30$. The grounds are well kept, it's nice to walk around. They have boat rides available too - which we didn't do on our trip but the option is there. The only thing I would mention is that one of the police officers approached us and said we had to have a guide (this is not the case), he insisted that he be that guide and we pay him $5 US. We did not want to argue so just did it, he actually had a lot of great information but it was dodgy and forced. Don't let that deter you though, it's a beautiful place and worth the trip.

I took a day trip out to Banteay Srei via Tuk Tuk and was actually pleasantly surprised by the grounds and the visitor centre. I wish I went here first as it has quite a lot of info about all the temples in Siem Reap and some of their history and restoration info. The temple itself is quite run down but beautifully detailed. There is no shade so be aware of the hot May sun. Would recommend combining this visit with the Landmine Museum which is not far away"

We're still patting ourselves on the back because we arrived at 7.30am and there were only 3 other visitors there. The silence was very different from the buzz of noise from other temples we visited at other times. It was lovely to stroll in the cool of the morning and dawdle at the carvings and generally take time out to enjoy the atmosphere and antiquity of this magnificent temple. We also really enjoyed the Interpretation Centre with its informative photos and text about the history and restoration of the temple. A suggestion that may make the walk in the general surroundings more pleasant would be to make more regular rubbish pick-ups."

After thinking about having seen the main attractions - Angkor Wat and friends, this temple is a bit of a letdown because the drive out by tuktuk which already takes about 45 minutes is not really worth it. People have raved about the intricacies but (I'm sorry) to me the other temples were similarly intricate. Perhaps what's so drawing about this place is that historians guess women built the temple, therefore the carvings are more detailed. I can't remember for sure but 45 minutes by tuktuk and eating dust didn't seem too good."

It features beautiful red stone carvings. It is still a very touristy attraction once you get there, so just beware there will be many visitors. Make sure to hire a good chauffeur to get there (it can be a dangerous ride otherwise).Overall, it's a different type of temple and well worth the ride if you get to see other attractions on the way there & back."

Because you'd have seen Baphon and Angkor Wat, you'd have looked at pictures of Banteay Srei and think it was the same scale. No, the buildings stand cheek by jowl with each other. You could see it all in half and hour and there's nothing much else around, just come rice fields, a garden, which during the dry season isn't up to much. It's probably still worth a visit if you're here many days. Oh,beware of the stores near the entrance. The first store on the left sold us a bad coconut and then refused to change it.

It is one of the older temples , and is one of the only ones not constructed by the king. Because it is old the sandstone used in its construction is of better quality, and so it has kept the fantastically intricate carvings phenomenally well-preserved. The level of workmanship is truly astounding, and most of the carvings looks like they are only 100 years old not 1000! If your plans don't include a vista here while you're in Siem Reap, change them immediately"

This was definitely the most beautiful temple amongst the ones we vistied. It is the oldest temple in the area, built around 960. The beauty of this 10th century temple is stunning with the red/pink sandstone so well preserved. The sunlight casts different hues against the pink stone giving it a youthful glow. This must be the most durable stone of all because the intricate artwork on the walls of this 1000 year old temple are so beautifully preserved. The entry way to the temple and the intricate carvings above all the doorways tell many stories about the different Gods. The carvings are so detailed that I wish I had days instead of hours to study them. The soft tones of the temple and the reflection from the pond in front definitely made this one of the most beautiful architectural ruins that we have ever seen.  The temple is dedicated to the Hindu God Shiva, also known as the \"Great God\" or \"Supreme God\". But the temple is also known as the citadel for women. The true greatness lies in the architectural femininity of the temple. It truly is pretty in pink and masterfully preserved.  We got to the temple at around 10:30. This was a great time before the afternoon sun and while most of the large tourist buses were still hanging around Angkor Thom and Angkor Wat temples. It would be a beautiful place for a picnic lunch because the setting is just so stunning. Mid day was lovely but I could imagine the color hues on the temple at sunrise of sunset would be magical. It doesn't matter what time of day you go to this place... just make sure you GO!"

The site might be small but allow at least an hour. The temple is located over 30kms from the centre so you are best hiring a guide/driver or renting a car. The site understandably attracts tour buses so is best visited at dawn (or sunset) when you might be lucky enough to have the place to yourself \u2013 a really calming, serene almost spiritual experience; plus the rising/setting sun transforms the colours of the temple.

It would be been better to go through this area before going to the temple area. Just to clarify, there is an small interpretive area at the front entrance and a second at the end of the visit near the parking lot and shops. Go to this second interpretive area BEFORE you tour, especially if you are touring without a guide."

One of the few Angkor temples that doesn't involve many steps, Banteay Srei makes up for the lack of the height with an amazing colour palette of reddish orange stone that looks a bit like basic brick, but with much more detail and scale. It's nowhere the size of some of the other temples, but Banteay Srei offers a deluge of intricate details, featuring reliefs of gods and demons, with plenty of murals, all nestle in the middle of a tropical meadow.It is definitely worth a visit, but prepare to make an effort. It is one of the farthest sites from the main city of Siem Reap - about 45 minutes even inside a car. Also, because of its relatively low scale, there isn't much shade, so come prepare with covering."

Even though the Banteay Srei Temple was at least a thirty minute drive from the other temples we had explored (all of the other temples were exceedingly close together), but it was worth the drive, especially when we had a driver and were able to nap and get a break from the intense and morbidly uncomfortable outside heat. While the Banteay Srei Temple is seemingly miniature in comparison to all the other temples we had visited, it is considered by many to be the jewel of Khmer Art as the intricate carvings have remained well intact and preserved. It was built in pink sandstone and the intricate surviving detail was astounding. The pink sandstone stood up over the years far better than the gray stone so the carvings were more pronounced at the Banteay Srei temple. Due to the well-defined and ornate engravings at the Banteay Srei Temple, the Banteay Srei provided a flavor of how the other temples may have appeared before they were caught in a battle with mother nature over time.Just remember that while it is hottttt, proper temple attire is required. Ladies shoulders, as well as, at least their knees must be covered. I wore lightweight pants to be safe. Hats or umbrellas to protect you from the sun might provide some comfort.Each temple is beautiful and has a fascinating history. We recommend getting a private guide as we felt having a private maximized our experience at each temple visited, including the Banteay Srei. Also, having a private guide allowed us to tour the temples at our own pace, as if you go with a large group, you are stuck by the whims and pace of others. Our guide was Dy with ICS Travel and he phenomenal. He was extremely knowledgeable, personable, and had a passion for history. We loved every minute."

Visiting Siem Reap encompasses a wide range of experiences when it come to Temples. from the amplitude of Angkor Wat to the other features presented by each Temple, you should be opened to appreciate variety. This is a small Temple - much smaller then Angkor Wat. The distinctiveness of that Temple is the very refined carving, unbelievable details carved in stone. So you won't find big towers or extensive panels - but the columns seem to be embroidered. The Apsaras are beautiful, and the refined work in the inner walls is very impressive. The external walls are not ornate - but it will only enhance the beauty of the work Inside.It's a little bit far to Siem Reap's distance rate (everything here is very close one to another), but to my point of view, it's worthy. It bring you also an unexpected bonus - due to the distance, big tour groups won't go there - so it will be less crowded.Some remarks that might be useful - there is no shade at all in the site, so be protected against the sun. The pavement is very, very irregular, and that night be a problem to one who has any kind of moving limitation."

It is a pleasure to see intricate carvings in such close proximity because the temple is really 'human sized'. It was built by a counselor to the king. Some of the best pictures that I took was at this temple, the red sandstone glows in the afternoon sun and the pictures looks divine."

It is not a long trip and through beautiful countryside with better showing of typical Cambodian daily life. Interesting homes along road. Nice walk from parking area among trees. Spoiled a bit by children selling souvenirs too aggressively. If you buy anything, be prepared for a swarm of more kids.The temple is small but a treasure. It has been restored/preserved well. It is older than the larger temples nearer town but intricate beautiful ornamental carvings more beautiful. We visited in later afternoon and light of setting sun made temple even more beautiful. It is an excellent to seeing the larger temples. Very memorable. Somehow try to see when hoarders of bus tourists overwhelm you and the temple."

The drive there through the countryside is beautiful. The temple is made out of red sandstone, small, really well restored and with the best carvings in the whole Angkor region. This is really the jewel of Khmer art and with a size that you can fathom.The temple is quite often crowded. There are fewer tourists in the early morning or immediately after lunch, when it is really hot. It is advisable to have a guide explaining the temple and the carvings to you.You need to wear long pants and have your shoulders covered to visit the temple.The temple site is really well organized with excellent parking, restrooms, cafeteria with drinks and food, souvenir shop but most impressively a great Information Centre with a really good, modern and informative exhibition about Khmer building techniques, different styles and then in detail about the Banteay Srei. This is the only temple in the Angkor region with an Information Centre."

It cost us $40 for a car and we had a guide which I would recommend.I liked this temple. Not my favorite but if you want to make sure your see the full picture of the Angkor Wat area, Banteay Srei should be part of your visit. The key difference in this temple is that it is made from a completely different material, a pink sand stone. Whether the pink sand stone is dirty or not, it is completely different looking than the rest. The best part of visiting each temples is each one is in a different state of preservation. The Cambodian government is now trying some renovation but these are the temples in their true form.Like others have mentioned, driving through the countryside was an added bonus. Good for photos.

Temple is more Hindu in style than others without heavy Buddhist changes and is very beautiful stone in a lovely forest setting - without the crowds as well.However highlight was the journey!After a few days of Siem reap city and Angkor park it was lovely to take our tuk tuk ( or more properly Remort) out into the countryside to the rice paddies and rural life for a 30 minute blast. Great, smooth roads with lots to see and places to stop and look at palm sugar candies being made and see an explanation of how it is all done. Palm wood plates etc are cheaper here than central market and feels nice buying close to where it is harvested (in theory).Highly recommend but DO NOT do it in a car you will miss half of what is going on so much fun in the open air. It was 28 degrees and we were a little cold in the open at speed - pack a scarf or long sleeves."

Unfortunately, my driver, didnt want to do this place first. I had wanted to see a couple of sites and this wound up being last on the route. It started pouring rain the moment I got in. There are children running around selling rain covers. The covers are $1 and tear very easily. I was asked repeatedly to buy another one. When I was able to look at the pics on my computer, I was surprised how beautiful the rain made them look. I was very pleased. On the way back, I went to the butterfly museum. That was a great highlight for me. The flowers were amazing and the guides English was wonderful."

The temple was not the pink sandstone colour we were told of but instead a deeper red. The carvings in the stone were, as usual, amazing but I dont think it was worth the 1 hour bumpy bus ride. Also, the police were even trying to sell us things here and the markets seemed considerably more expensive."

The colours are different and the crowds are less.We spent the time wandering around the path at the back of the temple back to the main entrance which was worth the 10-15 minute detour.The ride in the tuk tuk to the temple was one of the memorable parts of the day as well.

And they also call it The Womans Temple.Normally locals in Cambodia are nice, but during our visit here we experienced that they still feel that they are in conflict with Thailand. We used ricehatt that we had bought in Thailand. A guard at Banteay Srai was angry because we used this in Cambodia. So, be careful"

The Temple is amongst a lovely backdrop of trees and if you're lucky the crowds won't be too bad.The condition of the temple is amazing with many of the original carvings intact."

The countryside was interesting with rice fields, palm trees, locals on bicycles, road side stalls, firewood bundles...similar to Myanmar. The temple site is small and like Angkor Wat surrounded by a moat. A site heritage protection police officer (what\u2019s on his badge) patrolled the temple and I slipped him US$5 which took me inside the roped part of Banteay Srei (you won\u2019t get in otherwise) and he briskly walked me around and showed me the best photo spots and offered to take photos of me. He was all secretive and hush hush about it as if it were a big deal which made me laugh afterwards as I later saw him act it out with the next photographer! First thing in the morning is a good time to go. You would be a petrologist or a researcher of some kind to spend more than one hour here and that includes the nature walk after the temple and exit. The guy at the ticket control said it would take 20mins...it's that small. The striking thing about this temple is the guardian monkeys. The carvings are also intricate and the red sandstone prominent. The nature trail has 6 viewing platforms looking out over fields with their water lilies and is quite pretty. It ends at a main Street, double back and take the path to the restaurant and onto the car park. Best time: definitely early in the morning. I did Banteay Srei first, landmine museum second and the very underrated Pre Rup temple third and back in time for breakfast at the Hotel which for me finished at 10am. What I find amazing is Banteay Srei is the smallest temple out of the big names but has the best facilities; a visitors center, ATM, info on restoration, souvenir shop, cafe and restaurant\u2026until you realize it\u2019s a big money spinner for the locals."

When I arrived at this temple which was quite busy but left these people and I explored the jungle and magnificent trees as well as boat rides and wetlands around this site which benefits the local villagers in financial work and after walked through the temple areas and was much impressed with the red volcanic rock and figures carved into the doorway lentils and the reflection pools are quite impressive.

However, we travelled there by tuk tuk which went at just slow enough speed for us to take in life in the villages and paddy fields along the way. We also stopped at the Landmine museum which is also on the way - so it made a worthwhile half day trip.The temple is unusual in the colour of its stone (pink) but also in the intricacies and details of its deep carvings. Only the central part of the temple is restored but somehow the remaining \"ruin\" also reminded us of the passage of time and it's fight with the jungle. Altogether it makes for a beautiful site. There is also a good exhibition on the history and restoration of the temple with good descriptions and old photographs.Perhaps the tile \"Lady temple' is a good description for this does remind someone of a delicate and refined lady, and not a big and muscular gesture like Ankor Wat."

The ticket is $20 for a day, $40 for 3 days, or $60 for a week. The ticket will have your photo on it and is therefore non transferable. This temple is far from the other temples and if you get here without a ticket you could end up going all the way back! You cannot buy tickets here.If you don't have a driver negotiate a 'daily' price with a tuk tuk driver and tell them what temples you wish to see. $20 is a reasonable amount for the day.This temple has the best site information from any of the temples. There is a small visitor centre with toilets available. There is plenty of the temple still to see and some great photos to be taken.As you walk out the back of the temple there are a couple of signs to a viewpoint, and to boats. We followed both of these. The view point will take you to the right as you walk out the back, then round to the side. There is an elevated wooden platform where you can get great photos of the whole temple.We also went to the boats. They wanted $7 to take 2 people through the lilly/lotus lake, back to the car park. We negotiated $5. It took about 20 minutes and we had a lovely time going though the lake, well worth the $5 for two of us.If you only have a day then this probably is not worth the visit given the travelling time required. But if you have longer then its definitely worth a visit."

More than any of the other temples, this one has carvings that are very detailed. There are many carvings on door frames that tell many stories of the Hindu gods.

We took a tuktuk so the pace was breezy and we got to see water buffalo swallowing in rice paddies, under blue skies and coconut tres. It was so lovely. This was definitely worth the trip.

The artistic ability is so evident and it is a gift to all who are fortunate enough to visit it. It is a smaller temple but the carving are so detailed and well preserved along with great natural colors in the stone. It was not crowded and I am happy that I made the effort to take a slight detour from the established tour for that day. Don't miss this temple when you visit Siem Reap!"

Although one of the oldest temples in the Angkor region it utilised the best stone, hence the well preserved nature of it. So much to look out for in the detail. Easy to get around, with no climbing. This temple complex is a little bit further out than others, but gives you a great chance to see some of the countryside, especially if your Cambodia experience is restricted to Siem Reap (like ours). We really liked this one...but the leaf blowing instrument of the musicians in the grounds is an acquired taste ;-). The people in the shops area outside are a bit persistent."

I asked our tour guide Tep Nat (you can contact him at tep_nat_2007@yahoo.com) of the reason why. He said it was built that way to show respect/reverence even inside the temple. It's really better to go with a tour guide so you'll know more about the story behind the temples. The tour guides are lisenced and can speak English and other languages.

The carvings are beautiful, depicting narratives/stories from Hindu mythology and if you are familiar with the stories, the concentration of so many carvings and their intricacy will just blow you away!The best time to visit will be early-to-mid-morning and middle-to-late afternoon to catch the best light as the stone glows when the sun is low.

I was amazed that so much was preserved in the sandstone that it is carved out of and was so pleased to see how vigilant the wardens were in making sure people did not touch or sit on the walls (disappointingly there were quite a few people who tried). I really hope this approach continues as this is a stunning temple which I felt very honored to see and it would be a shame if it lost some of its delicacy because of thoughtless and selfish people who were more concerned about posing on a wall."

I would recommend this to anyone since the temple is small and once you've got a busload or two going through them you will not be able to enjoy the peaceful serenity of this beautiful structure.The moat around the temple is filled with water which makes it perfect for reflection photos. The statues and carvings are very delicate and they make excellent detail shots.Also, if you like dragonflies and water lilies, there is plenty of both around the temple.Also, toilet facilities are relatively new and there is shops and little restaurants attached where one can enjoy a coconut or other refreshing beverages as well as a quick meal."

There are several reasons to be include this temple in a tour of Angkor sites - smaller crowds (due to its distance from Siem Reap), small and easily manageable size, and the use of both pink and yellow sandstone which give it a unique look. But the most important reason has to be that it contains the most intricate carvings of any temple. Here, the sophistication of the carvings are taken to a whole new level, and embellished in areas with a certain rich delicacy.Interestingly, Banteay Srei was never part of the original Ankgor temple complex. Instead, it seems that it was privately commissioned by a prominent member of the Brahmin sect. Inscriptions at the site describe the meaning of Banteay Srei to mean 'Citadel of Shiva'; however, in recent times, it's been changed to 'Citadel of the Women'. Regardless of the true meaning, carvings of women (dancers?) and animal-headed characters are everywhere, many of which are stunning in their detail."

If you can get here when there aren't many people, I'd bet it would be one of the best temple experiences of Angkor architecture, so if this is a priority, talk to someone about when to go to miss the crowds!"

One of the smaller complexes of Angkor, there is something about it that calms the soul; the ambience, for me, was surreal. Although incomparable in many ways, certainly in size, Banteay Srei, is equal in beauty and majesty to Angkor Wat itself.The approximate 20 miles to get there is so full of lush green paddy fields and little villages that the tuk tuk ride itself was part of the amazing experience."

I recommend combining a visit here with stops at Eastern Mebon and Pre Rup, which I enjoyed more than this temple, primarily because they have stairs to climb and panoramic views."

The carvings are very well preserved though of a very different aesthetic - these look more similar to Balinese/Indonesian carvings for some reason? The pink sandstone is beautiful - that combined with the moss growing on the stone leads to the entire temple looking multicolored. We went to the temple very early - at about 8-9am? The entire temple was empty save for us and maybe 5 other tourists. Very serene. It may be further away from Siem Reap but I found it worth the drive."

You will pass the landmine Museum on the way. It is a small temple built largely from red sandstone. It is also of just one story, so there is no climbing involved. It was originally a Shiva temple, but both Shiva and Vishnu were worshipped. Apart from the beauty, the temple is also famous as Andre Malreux tried to steal four statues from here and got caught. From the parking spot, you have to walk nearly a kilometre to reach the temple proper. There are three enclosures, each decorated with carvings. The innermost enclosure contains 3 buildings - two libraries and the temple proper. For fear of vandalism, the area is roped off. So you can enter the inner enclosure but cannot enter the buildings. But even then it is well worth it as this is perhaps the most richly decorated structure in Angkor. Every inch of the buildings are richly decorated with either nature motifs or from Hindu religion and myths. There are six stairways leading up to the platform of the main temple; each is guarded by two kneeling statues of human figures with animal heads; most of those now in place are replicas, the originals were stolen stolen or removed to museums."

            "review": "Beautiful wood carvings. Banteay Srei is known as \"Lady Temple\" amongst some of the locals. In Khmer, it's \"citadel of women/beauty\". This place is quite a bit a ways from Angkor Wat and because I had an extra day, I decided to go see this as well. You are able to use your temple pass that you bought back in Siem Reap. I had a driver take me there via car and I would say that it was a good 40-50 minute drive to the northern parts of Siem Reap. The temple itself was beautiful. The wood carvings are etched so delicately and intricately and the amount of detail baffled me. There is a small market area at the end of your trip where they have a variety of \"souvenirs\" for sale - that are very similar to the souvenirs at night market. It is considerably smaller than Angkor Wat so it will only be a short walk. But a few things to keep in mind (which you'll probably already know after visiting Angkor Wat): 1) Bring water One of the things I love about Cambodia is its humidity but that means that all that walking will require you to bring some water. Banteay Srei is more \"out in the open\" so there was a lot more sun exposure than say Bayon Temple or Angkor Wat. 2) Children are not tourist attractions...You have probably encountered many children trying to sell you postcards or keychains or copies of books. Please act responsibly & do not snap photos of these kids nor give them money. While this may sound cruel, the sad reality is that tourists have caused an uprise of \"orphanages\" within Cambodia (and many other parts of developing Asia). For more information: <<www.thinkchildsafe.org>>. 3) Make sure you already have a \"Temple Pass\". Can be purchased in Siem Reap and grants you access to all the other temples (including Angkor Wat, Bayon, Ta Prohm, etc.) I believe that you can't purchase a temple pass at Banteay Srei."

The staff explained, through an interpreter, they haven\u2019t got the sophisticated equipment at their site and hinted that the managing company, Sokha Hotel Co. Ltd., do not wish their staff to handle cash.We were very disappointed, also not prepared to go back and get a ticket, so continued on our journey east. Fortunately as compensation, we stopped at the Beng Mealea temple site, managed by Kham Someth Co. Ltd., who were only too pleased to sell tickets at five dollars each near the site. The site is so different from Angkor Wat. The ruined temple has trees and vegetation growing through it, and has a certain beauty all of its own. Certainly worth a visit.So independent travellers beware \u2013 buy your tickets in Siem Reap before going to Banteay Srie!"

It's a reasonable distance and a car would have been more comfortable on this trip. We also went a little further to Kbal Spien where there was an animal sanctuary. It was well worth the visit to see endangered species being looked after and rehabilitated after being found injured or being traded illegally.There was a small selection of simple restaurants here and good bathroom facilities so a good place to grab a break and a bite. The Animal sanctuary is right next door and does a guided tour at 1pm sharp, it takes around 1.5 hours. All in all, a really good day out and a break from the bigger crowds in and around Angkor."

This is the most spectacularly beautiful of all the temples here and it's also in a nice compact setting which makes for a pleasant walk (if it's not too hot out there).Tourist numbers are lower here than elsewhere. I suspect that's because of the insane advice that you can \"tick off\" all of Siem Reap and the temples in less than 3 days. You can't. You shouldn't but guidebooks keep selling the lie anyway. Don't run round this site like a gazelle being chased by lions. Take your time to really look at the carvings and stonework. Your patience will be well rewarded.

You can go to an overlook after you exit the temple, to look at muddy water, or take a boat ride through muddy water, or go to a botanical garden, and then wander though a bazaar. Rice paddies and dilapidated structures fighting back the inexorable Cambodian jungle.

Some memorable examples would include the two monkey brothers fighting (central tower), Ravanna shaking Mount Kailasa, Kama shooting arrow at Shiva (both South Library).Another interesting thing about Banteay Srei is that the main entrance is well organized with visitor facilities.

It was the pre-monsoon season, the hottest of the year, I think. The art work is intricate and lovely. To my eyes it had a more Indian style, though I'm no expert. The Hindu gods and stories are subjects of statues and friezes, with high relief on decorative swirls. The pink sandstone is nice, though pretty dirty; the whole place is not in the best of condition. The buildings are tiny - there were doorways I would have had to duck to get through- I'm 5'5\" - and the whole compound is relatively small. It's a long and bumpy drive, but it gives you a chance to see thatched huts on stilts, cows being tended by kids, roadside stands for melons, woven goods, etc. Photos taken at the temple are really striking; looks better than I remembered!"

Very good photo opportunities. The statues of the monkey and lion guards are not original but hopefully in time they will start to blend in a bit more. You can't go into the main temple as they're protecting the carvings but you can see so much from the outside.Well worth the visit."

Early morning it is quiter and the surrounding area is well wirth a look too as there are beautiful wetlands with viewing decks, where you can watch rice paddy's being plowed by water buffalo or even have a canoe ride through the lily pads and grasses looking at the miriad of butterflies and insects.

We were able to explore it pretty much unencumbered, but as we were leaving there were many busloads more people arriving. The small temple was absolutely packed. So glad we were able to view it without the masses.There are some walks signposted after the temple, but they weren't amazing. The \"lookout points\" were all of empty swampland, which I guess was scenic, but not terribly so. One sign pointed to the \"Botanical Gardens\", but we couldn't find it at all, and when we told someone what we were looking for (after he queried where we were going) he seemed confused, and said there wasn't anything like that.But the temple itself was excellent, despite the long ride out there (I actually really enjoy the long tuk-tuk rides. It was a great way to see a lot of the area, and the locals' day-to-day lives)."

It's a waterfall that requires you to hike about 25 minutes up where you'll find some old ruins. The hike up is beautiful, and the butterflies will amaze you.

Just how desperate are you to get a perfect shot?But don't just spend all your time at the temple. Surrounding it is a natural park and if you go early enough and capture photos of the temple, then head out to the wetlands by 8am. Here, when it's still early, you'll find birds in the lakes.

Carved in 967 AD out of pink sandstone, this is the finest example of Khmer art you will see in Cambodia. The name means \"Temple of Women\", but this is also a reference to the degree of beauty in the sculptures. Once inside you can't fail to be amazed by the level of detail in every little doorway and lintel. A sacred moat surrounds the site and you will find the usual kiosks selling drinks and artefacts just outside the entrance."

Situated far from Angkor Wat, but justifiably famous thus still attracting crowds, Banteay Srei is a couple of hours' drive from Siem Reap. Everybody knows that its stone carvings are the finest in the world, but it's better seen for real than read or looked at on a computer screen. Upon arriving at the site, one immediately sees that the temple is small. Unlike Angkor Wat, it's human in scale, kind of like a house. The plaza before the temple is earth, the deep red superfine dust of Cambodia that stains shoes and never really leaves. The color of the ground is reflected in the reddish-pink of the structure itself. Upon entering scattered gateways, one immediately sees the intricacy of the carvings - and we haven't gotten to the main temple yet!The stone was carved with high relief sculptures that have to be seen to be believed. Even humble door jambs are intricately carved. The pinnacle of stone carving is reached in the stone lintels. Among mythological creatures, heroes, and gods lie (almost) paper-thin petals and curlicues that miraculously have survived centuries later into our time. Beyond is a short causeway over an extant moat. Beyond it still lies the main temple. From a distance it's easy to see the intricacy of the carvings and the statues of Hanuman (?) but unfortunately, the inner sanctum was cordoned off. Sad. All over the place were those very intricate stone carvings. Yes, stone, not wood, stone.Towards the back was a Cambodian orchestra composed of landmine victims - a sad reminder of the recent traumatic events in Cambodian history. Nevertheless the music had this lilting character that seemed to complement the temple. I gave a donation, looked back, and thanked the gods I was able to see this temple.Highly recommended!"

The carvings are much more intricate with several scenes from Ramayana and Krishna's avatar found on the temple here. This temple is in a slightly better state than some of the ruins in Siem Reap.

I have nothing to add to the previous reviews of the temple, the carving are as fine as everyone says and it is definitely worth the visit, but God forbid you should stay for lunch in their restaurant. This was by far the worst Khmer food we had in Siem Reap: the yellow curry was a bowl full of yellowish water with a few large chucks of vegetables, one (yes, one!) shred of chicken and one human hair. When I complained, they fished out the hair, added three more pieces of chicken and brought it back. I refused to pay for it and walked out. Avoid!"

It was only discovered quite recently and is in a beautiful setting. Our tour guide was very professional and warned us that the police will ask for money (ie. a bribe) to go into the cordoned off sections, which leads to destruction and erosion of the some of the more susceptible parts of the temple. Tourists should understand that it's cordoned off for a reason and we shouldn't be risking damaging the temple further just because we want 'that perfect photo'. We did not pay the bribe and were disappointed to see others (including tour guides) doing so. Otherwise a beautiful experience - definitely recommended."

The carvings are intricate and the pink stone is different however for the price to drive out with a car to see this I did not think that it was worth it. Also, because the grounds are smaller it feels a lot more cramped (we went in the peak season) There were bus loads of tourists trying to take pictures and making a noise so the whole effect of the temple was lost on us. Most tour companies/hotels charge $40 to hire a car to get there. Sure the drive along the countryside is interesting but not amazing and a tuk-tuk ride will be horrible."

This temple is about 45 minutes away from Siem Reap area and although the pink sandstone makes the carvings more interesting and different from the others it's worth it to go only if you have the time to spare. Else just concentrate on the Angkor wat and Angkor thom. It's a small temple attraction and if there's a couple of tourist groups it becomes too crowded. Also middle section closed now for viewing to keep it intact I guess. Also there's a lot of sand and dust around this temple."

I went there at 7:15 and it was already quite full, it only takes about 30 people for that. I can't imagine how it looks like when the parking lot is full of buses.If you are a photography buff, consider being there earlier.

It is extremely decorative and well preserved- you can easily see the decorations and figurines as if they were only afew years old.Her the lingga was not overtaken so you see a Hindu original as the temples were prior to the influence of Buddhism. I learned that when they had the Hindu-Buddhist wars the hindus would desecrate images of the buddhas from the walls and frescoes, that is why when you enter some of the other temples you will see headless buddha statues which were placed on the lingga plinths- reminded me of the Egyptians who tried to erase the memory of one of the sun kings in the pyramids.The grounds of the temple hold a few rosewood trees.

Lots of information, a small museum and of course no end of stalls where you can purchase everything from a fresh pineapple, a cappuccino and even an academic book not to mention then beautiful clothes, bags, and llamas.."

If you're spending more than 1 day in this area (and have hit the temples I already listed, as well as the Phare circus), definitely make the trip here.On the way back to Siem Reap, consider stopping at the Cambodian Land Mine Museum, so you don't have to make a separate special trip just for that.I listed \"fee for this attraction - yes\" due to the $20 (for a one-day pass) charge for ANY temple in Angkor Archaeological Park."

Small, but contains probably the best carvings in Angkor. It worth a visist.It takes about 1 hour to get there by tuk tuk. We chose to mix the visit with the Grand Tour, and it worked out pretty well.Even standing a bit far from Siem Reap, this is not a remote place. All the basic infrastrcture can be found there: parking, food, clean toillets, the omnipresent souvenir shops.If you have more than 1 day in Siem Reap, you must visit Banteay Srei. It is one of the finest temples you will visit, but it will take some time.P.S. Very crowded."

I must repeat the, details are incredible and complex! The Hindu story that are carved in stone are fascinating. Getting here is easy with a Tuk Tuk or a standard taxi. We took a Tuk Tuk so we could enjoy the sights on the way and the fresh air. The driver waited for us the whole day ( we were so fascinated with Banteay Srei that we did not want to leave).

Its location is not far from Kbal Spean, a place I also highly recommend visiting; the two combined make an excellent day trip in Siem Reap.The main temple structure is very well preserved and its carvings are lovely and quite intricate. It's a relatively small temple and there are no stairs to climb, which can be a plus if you've need of a bit of a break. If you go during the rainy season the moat will be filled in and can make for some very eye-catching photographs."

You will probably need to take a car as opposed to using your tuk tuk, but a visit here can be combined with a visit to the Landmine Museum, which is on the way, or in a \"long\" loop to visit some of the other outlying temples such as Beng Melea, or Tonle Sap lake (bear in mind, if you plan such an itinerary, you will need to be up VERY early, and it will take all day). It is a lovely, fairly quiet temple, made of a gorgeous pink/red sandstone. Since it was buried until fairly recently, many of the carvings are remarkably preserved in all their detail. The best time to visit is apparently early morning and late afternoon, but the temple retains its lovely delicate, fairyland feel at all times. It is a fair bit smaller than most temples, and flat, so you won't need to dedicate too much time, although once you see it you may want too! There is a very nice, clean toilet on the park grounds as well."

Many are so overwhelming in their interest, architecture, and artistry that you must see them at least twice to begin to appreciate them.

This temple is quite different from others - the colour of the sandstone alone, is very different - much softer pink and red tones, not greys nor browns like other temples. Banteay Srei consists of low walls surrounding \"peaked, carved structures\" (thought to be libraries). Banteay Srei means \"Citadel of Women,\" and it is said that the carvings in this temple are so delicate that they could only have been done by women. They are extremley well preserved and many of the pictures depict scenes from ancient Hindu tales."

A favorite of travellers and we could quickly see why - smaller and more compact than the sprawling and spectacular Angkor Wat - Banteay Srei is worth the trip. We benefitted greatly from the company of our guide, Chong Sang, of Indochina Odyssey Tours. His knowledge of the temple and the history surrounding it brought it to life in front of our eyes. A photographers dream the architecture and details so close you can touch them - this is a must visit on any trip in Cambodia. Just amazing."

We arrived late in the morning on a sunny day and this is one of the complexes where you really feel the heat. There were a few tour buses visiting and it seemed more crowded than anywhere else we had been to because of the restricted walkways around the temples. The entrance to the site is more highly commercialized than the other temples around Siem Reap, and very well maintained, slick even. Seems like a place that\u2019s used to receiving the more affluent tour buses (reflected in the prices of the stalls). As there were 5 of us we had hired a mini-van to visit further away places.

Far less crowded than anywhere else we visited so some really good time for thinking, reflection and letting your imagination run a little bit wild. It took about an hour in a tuk tuk to reach but it definitely worth it. The area in which this temple lies could take up half a day at least as there are various paths trailing off to the surrounding areas but due to monsoon rains sweeping in we legged it past most of these back to the \"visitor's centre\" area! Go to the Landmine Museum if you're coming this way out as that too is a must visit location."

Small temple built using pink stones keeps you engaged. We spent close to two hours here. There are so many interesting temples and places like 1) Rolous group - Preah Ko (Sacred Bull), Bakong, Lolei; Bakong is beautiful especially 2) Bantey Samre with towers resembling the popular ones in South India (Dravidian architecture - Pallava style) 3) Pre Rup We spent half a day for the above three 1) Srah Srang - a lake built by J7. It was to the brim and we visited it in the midst of rain. It was used for Naval exercise to prepare well to fight Chams who were adept in Naval warfare 2) Prasat Kravan - Temple with Mahalakshmi and Vishnu 3) Ta Promh - awe inspiring sight of silk cotton trees and temples intertwined with each other.

The area leading to the temple was slightly over developed and commercial for my taste which was a detraction for me. Another downside is that it wasn't possible to walk through the central shrine area as foot traffic was confined to the outer enclosure.Despite the negatives, the unusual character of this temple, the compact scale and the extensive inscriptions mean a visit to this temple is worth while if only as a counterpoint to the scale and splender of the main temples around the Angkor Wat area."

Our wonderful Tuktuk driver Piseth took us out here early one morning. It is one of the first temples to get fully restored and made into a tourist attraction, with a proper parking lot, restrooms, and even a gift shop. It's very well done, but not obtrusive about it. There is a tremendous amount of detail on the carvings of this temple. The stone was brought from a different place than most of the temples in the area, so the stone is more of a pink hue than the rest, which adds to it's beauty.Called the temple of the women because it was said that the carving was too fine and delicate to have been done by a man's hands, so it must have been done by women.Many of the center temple pieces are reproductions, but the temple looks closer to what it must have looked like in it's heyday with the level of care that was done to the restoration process.Definitely worth the ride out there through the countryside, and be sure to check out the Butterfly Museum when you're out that way. There is also a landmine museum nearby, but I didn't decide to check that one out."

This temple is the Women's Temple and dedicated to the Hindu deity Shiva. It is three concentric rectangular buildings with the inner one being the sanctuary. The carvings here are smaller and much more detailed - they are carved in red sandstone which has allowed them to persist and makes for some amazing photos. The site is smaller than most others so you'll want to visit other temples near this site. Along the way we stopped to see a girl cooking a rice and bean dish in bamboo by the side of the road.

Interesting to know that this temple was actually dedicated for the Hindu god Shiva. What caught my attention is the wall carvings, its very elaborate up to the smallest details. The smooth curves on each carvings are still very evident until now and its just amazing! It also has less tourists so its peaceful- you can really take time to roam around, reflect and just take in all these amazing history and culture of Khmer people. Heads up, there are many children selling stuff at the gate and they are really persistent.My two cents: Don't buy from children selling bracelets, magnets and other stuff. Its for their own good. Once people start buying from them (out of pity or generosity) and they get more income from it, they are more likely to just stay in the temples and miss school. We may be able to help them get by for a day but we might also take away their education which could be their only chance for a better future."

Because these carvings are so detailed and beautiful, it was originally thought to have been done by women. Our guide told us that this turned out to be not true. The temple is quite small in comparison to the others in the Angkor area because it was actually built by the monks themselves. Wonderful temple and peaceful--only three or four other visitors at the time--but it was overwhelmingly hot when we went. Try to avoid noon to 3:00 pm."

However unless you get there in the very early morning or late afternoon the crowds in such a small temple are overwhelming. The endless line of tuk tuk's going to and from will give you a great idea of what I meanIm guessing given the well developed tourist facilities at Banteay Srey there is an element of self promotion. If you have limited time would suggest your time would be better spent exploring more of the main park or perhaps visiting the Roulos Group."

There is also more information available on site than at other temples (i.e. The Interpretation Centre has a room of display boards that describe the archaelogical history of the site) Just note that:- Visitors can go almost anywhere, and there are very few stairs. However some areas may be slippery or muddy in the wet season, 'roped off' or unsafe - our toddler was carried in a backpack for most of our visit here.- Tuk Tuk was the best transport for us - took us just over an hour to get here from Siem Reap - and gave us flexibility to go anywhere and anytime. Most tuk tuks have a legal maximum of 3 passengers.- We got a 7 day pass, and spent an early morning here (6am - 8.30am) to avoid crowds. Tour buses started arriving at 8am."

Because in the Khmer they believed that the women work will have the best result and the carvings at Banteay Srei are exquisite that made them assume that the women are making the carvings, but this is not really true. Banteay Srei is also known because of it's pink color stone which comes from the local stone available there, just as you can see the road path has the same color as the stones to build the temple.The carvings here are exquisite, it's like every inch where they intended to carve no area is bare. There are also inscription carved in the pillars in Sanskrit (letter used in Hindu time here before Pali being used as a sign of Buddhist time) here and there are warnings not to touch the carvings to preserve it.At the time when Cambodia was still in turmoil and the Khmer Rouge still exist, Banteay Srei was filled with landmines and there were crossfire happened here, you can still see some of the bullet holes causing some damage on the ruins and the carvings. But rest assured said our guide that they have cleared the landmines here now and I do believe him (but personally I won't stray away from the usual path).Still being in the APP complex, we don't have to pay extra fee to enter this temple, just make sure you have your AAP pass with you to show the ticket checker."

Consider tuk-tuk. Most visitors come by cars or vans because of the distance. We did it by tuk-tuk and that gave us a much better feel of the countryside.2. Do not miss the Landmine museum.

So that's one way to avoid the crowds, if you can take the heat. I don't see anyone writing about the lovely ride through the countryside.and it is a long ride. Make the time to stop and watch the villagers making Toddy Palm syrup. OMG, I love this stuff sooo much. The Toddy Palm syrup is made much the way maple syrup is made, the tree is tapped, then they cook it down, in a wok over an open fire while it gets thicker and thicker, to a thick honey consistency. The last stage is pouring it into little tiny bamboo circles where it firms up and becomes a candy, just like maple sugar candy. The syrup is heavy to pack and bring back,and although I bought 3kilos, I now wish I'd emptied my suitcase of clothes and filed it with this syrup. Some places even sell the toddy fruit, refreshing and interesting. There are also some villages devoted to Rattan. And the temple is wonderful."

If possible, combine it with a visit to Kbal Spean, which is a little bit further in the same direction.The temple is distinguished by its small, intimate scale and exquisite carvings - and also by its beautiful location. You should walk around the outside, away from the crowds, to enjoy views of the temple against the background of trees.The temple can be overwhelmed by tour groups, which tend to arrive by the busload. But there are also long stretches of time (between buses) when it is almost deserted. So don't be deterred if you meet a crowd - withdraw to the pleasant cafe* and bide your time till the crowds disappear.Tip* There is a poorly-signposted but very good cafe with an excellent exhibition about temple construction. To get there: Walk from the parking area in the direction of the temple (ignoring the mass of gift stalls, the toilets, and the food places on the way). You come to a junction in the path, which goes left towards the temple. From here you can see the cafe/exhibition area a couple of hundred metres away on the right. The cafe is a little haven of peace. The coffee is magnificent. The exhibition is very well presented. And when the crowds are gone you can have Banteay Srei temple all to yourself."

Although large parts of the temple are roped off to prevent visitors climbing over everything, there are many examples of the beautiful craftsmanship on almost every surface. Some of the statues are copies (you can see the originals in the National Museum in Phnom Penh). We were there at about 2pm, so it was (relatively) quiet - but very hot! There are a few stalls to buy food and drinks but visitors are regarded as a lucrative source of income and the prices are extortionate. Due to the sheer heat of the day and the amount of water we got through (which, thankfully, we brought with us), something containing plenty of salt was also required. Not the finest by any means, but certainly the most expensive 2 packets of crisps I have ever purchased!"

The temple is made of red stones, so it's a bit different from the other temples and there are probably beautiful colours when the sun light it in the early morning and late afternoon (it was cloudy when we went there unfortunately). It's quite small and if you want to be able to observe quietly the carvings, you'd better be there before 8 am. We arrived at 7.50am; at 8.15am there was a first group, by 9am when we left, the car park was packed with buses.It takes 1 hour to go there by tuk tuk and $25. The temple is nice and if you have time, why not go there. You can probably combine it with other remote temples, waterfalls or local village visits or include it in your tuk tuk day trip, which is what we did. If you don't have much time, it's not a big deal if you miss it."

But, as I am very musically oriented, the most charming part was viewing this while hearing the strains of traditional Cambodian music, so gentle and danceable. Upon exiting the temple, I discovered where the music was coming from: a band of land-mine victims playing beautifully despite their deformities (not all visible, and not so disturbing as to detract from the pleasure of their music.) I had to be dragged away from their area by my trip leader, but not before spending $10 for a CD of their music - one of my favorite souvenirs from my trip."

There were not many people around while we were there and the morning light made the temple carvings more beautiful.

Architecturally, it is very different from Angkor Wat or Ta Prohm or any of the other temples closer to Siem Reap town.A ruin just like all other temples in the area, Banteay Srei is exquisitely carved and is very ornate. The red stone looks fabulous in the setting sun, with the light gleaming of its intricate carvings. It remains crowded most of the time, what with tour buses having this place as a fixture on their itineraries. However, don't let the crowds or the distance dissuade you. And on the way stop at the road-side shops to taste some wonderful palm-sugar jaggery - maybe buy some.Another must see place on the Siem Reap trail."

I first was here with my parents in 2002 and you could walk all around the temple because there were no ropes or walkways to guide you. It's different now but still holds a special place in my heart. They said that only the hand of a woman can make such ornate, intricate carvings. I am especially attached to the stone guards in the center. Its blocked off now but i have a picture standing next to it from years ago. I would say, GO NOW. before it gets to become a destination of dissapointments because of other people. It's hard to appreciate what's around you when all you smell is body odor. So go with the assumption of bumping into a few people. I promise this temple, because of the carvings, is one not to miss. Get a tour guide because its not fun seeing such beautiful temples without any sort of explanation of what you're looking at. On the road to and from there are vendors that look almost alike, one by one and very colorful. They sell Palm sugar and Palm Sugar candy. You can smell them making it as you pass by. Stop by and buy some cambodian candy. They will even show you how they make it. What's a dollar or two?"

You can't access the very inside (central shrine) but it makes it easier to photograph as there isn't someone constantly walking into your photos. There are other things to do nearby such as the Animal Conservation Centre (well worth a visit- see reviews) , Kbal Spean (we didn't go there), the Landmine Museum (well worth the visit - see reviews) and the Butterfly Centre (we didn't make it there as it closes at 4pm). We combined our visit with a trip to Phnom Kulen which was great fun (see reviews) and highly recommended. A car is required as tuk tuks can't access it.

The temple is different from those of the complex of Angkor, for the color, a pink hues vary depending on time of day, and it is the only temple not built by the will of a king, but on the initiative of a rich philanthropist. It was later worshiped Shiva, and, hovering within its walls you can admire sculptures, reliefs and friezes perfectly preserved, that jaw-dropping visitors. Around a pond where water lilies create a wonderful frame to the temple. In my opinion one of the best temples in Siem Reap, where they are still present in all their glory, to protect the sculptures of the temple guards with the face of a monkey or crocodile. Very interesting and well maintained (although a bit too touristy) is the structure built near the entrance to the site, where there is a record of the restoration and a brief history of the temples of Angkor."

The text is only in Khmer and English but even if you don't read either, the photographs displaying the history and differences between Angkor styles are still worth the trip.My fellow travelers had been there many years ago and pointed out that as part of preservation (they had driven right up to the temple), the entrance had been moved and the interpretative center and all the local restaurants, etc. had been added as a way of preserving the site and keeping vehicles further away.The temple area is well worth the trip but the interpretative center makes it a must for anyone who is interested in the history and background of the various sites.

Then when you have made the trip, it's hard to tell yourself that it wasn't worth it, but the temple itself is nothing special. Don't get me wrong, it is beautiful, with wonderful carvings, but it is so far out of the way, that your time will be better spent elsewhere.

Our guide pointed out how different scenes from the Ramayana were carved into the temple. I'd seen a video on it before going, which was helpful. I'm sure if I knew it in even better detail, I would've benefitted. It was kind of weird how the heads of Garuda were pillaged from both sides of one of the temple gables, but that was the only disappointment.As an aside, there are kids around the temple selling anything from postcards (10 for $1) to books which are marked with a retail price of $20+. I was informed that they get the books from a distributor for around $4 and try to sell them for $15, and particularly like to approach Americans (incessantly) because we are apparently an easy mark. One person followed me for two blocks, constantly trying to get me to buy a book, even offering it to me for $1. Afterward, it was suggested to me to say \"ok\" to the next person who offered me the book for $1, and see what happens. Sure enough, leaving the temple, the same guy who followed me in the beginning found me and started hawking me again, offering the book to me for $1, at which point I said ok for $1. He quickly said no, and that I could buy the book for $5 or postcards for $1.I used to feel very bad for these kids (the teenage boys are selling books, the younger girls and boys sell postcards and crafts) until I found out that these kids do very well by Cambodian standards by their selling techniques - very, very well - and well-intentioned tourist dollars only encourage them to quit school and make a living of doing it more.If you really want to help them, donate to the school or hospital in a local community. Or, if you'd like to compliment the kids, it was recommended that we ask them if they can pose for a photo and then, if they agree, show them the photo that you have taken. If you want to go one step further, share a digital copy of the photo with someone who is local (your guide, perhaps?) who could give it to the kids upon their next visit."

This temple is truly beautiful and different than the others. Its unbelievable that people have actually hand carved out this beautiful temple. Though our 7yr old daughter was templed out already, it was fun to have her see the carvings and relate them to the stories from Ramyana. The carvings of fight between Bali and Sugrava and the stories of Indra, the rain god left us speechless. Though there are certain spots which are now not accessible to the tourists and I completely agree to this step. The temple is too precious for our future generations. This was the most favourite of our temples. For two hours we kept going round and round the temple soaking in every curve every carving and almost every stone. it was just not enough !

The only thing is for those who get travel sick and do this by tuk-tuk- I did wonder if that would be an issue for someone not used to it, because the speed limit on a tuk-tuk means the journey takes a really long time and your open to the elements, so it does get a bit tiring and nauseating (as wimpy westerner as that sounds) from the constant wind rush. Just a thought!Also going here can be coupled with a trip to Kbal spean- this is more for those interested in the history of the temples, not just the big 'wow temples' side of it.

Banteay Srei is one of the oldest temples in the Angkor archeological park, and one of the most elegant and sublimely beautiful. This red sandstone temple was created at a much more human scale than the masterpieces of Angkor Thom and Angkor Wat, and feels more intimate. The carvings are magnificent, especially above the entryways. Also worth noting; Banteay Srei has facilities not found at some of the other sites like a small visitor center, restaurant and clean modern restrooms. if you have the time include this beautiful little temple in your visit to Siem Reap.

I don't often write tips on the very first paragraph of my reviews, but if I did, it is worth a try and, if you're lucky, you'll really be glad to have done it. TIP: Go to Banteay Srei very early. This means leaving your hotel as early as 5:00 or 6:00 (if you can't wake up so early) in the morning to go to Banteay Srei. It is an hour or so ride away from Siem Reap by tuktuk. When you get there, you will see an eerily quiet temple with very, very few people (you, some guards, and a couple or so of tourists). What is great is that you may be allowed, for a price ($2.00 for me), but with supervision by the guards (if they like you as they liked me), to view the finest of fine carvings at its central sanctuary (which is basically what you came for to see at Banteay Srei). In Banteay Srei, like other temples, there is sightseeing route markers to guide you in your visit. Follow these as they are the best way to see the temple. Now, the temple's central sanctuary (where the most intricate carvings still in its original state and in best condition in all of Angkor is located) is cordoned off. So, the best of the best carvings might be too far to reach to take photos if your camera has low zooming capabilities.There are guards there watching to apprehend violators (unless they themselves allow you, of course). When you exit the main temple, follow the route once more until it forks. Take the right route. When you take this route, it will lead you to a raised platform. Go up this raised platform and you can see a panoramic view of the whole temple from the causeway to the central sanctuary. This view is worthy of a shot, of course. Before you go, there are some rocks outside the second enclosure which you can take a photo of the whole front of the temple with the causeway and with the two ponds surrounding this causeway. This temple is quite far. Added to this, the temple is quite small. However, the temple is popular to tour groups. So if you go there, say 9:00 in the morning, a tour group would be there already and you might not be able to do my tip because there are many other visitors wanting to do the same and the guards might not like it. Also, small temple plus lots of tourists is not a nice place to be at. If you would love to see THE Angkor carvings, go here, but go early in the morning (I was there by 7:30 in the morning). Otherwise, if you find carvings boring, better for you not to go."

It took about 40 minutes drive from Siem Reap, through beautiful rural Cambodia - across rice fields, past small shops, past roadside stalls, past small villages.Locals call Banteay Srey as the 'temple of the ladies', the 'pink stone temple' and as the \u2018citadel of the women.\u2019 Call what they may, we were awed by the delicate beauty of its intricate carvings, the soft resplendent color of the stone, and how beautiful this small temple is.The temple is perhaps the finest example of classical Khmer art and generations of able artists that blessed Cambodia some 1000+ years ago. The walls are densely covered with deep and intricate carvings, more beautiful and better preserved than all Angkorian temples we visited. The walls display Hindu stories from Vedas, and from epics such as Ramayana, Mahabharatha, etc. Buddhist influences were also visible, since this temple too along with Khmer people witnessed the tug of change between the cycles of Buddhism and Hinduism, over the centuries. Banteay Srei is evidence of Khmer respect for the arts - because, despite significant turmoil, change in its religious beliefs and wars, the temples and the carvings remain preserved for folks of our generation to be inspired by. Banteay Srei is also evidence of the extraordinary accomplishment of southeast Asian arts, one that matches the beauty in stone carvings in Italy, Turkey or Central Asia. Banteay Srei is just a few centuries older, on stone that is more difficult to carve than marble.Banteay Srei is a must see."

Suvuth took us to a couple of other temples first and then we insisted that we go to Banteay Srei. We are glad we did. It is a long journey to this temple so an early start would have been good. Nevertheless, we enjoyed the road there watching how people lived and noticing that there was a dearth of ducks and pigs as in other Asian countries. The villages are small and one can see that life is generally a struggle.Banteay Srei (aka Citadel of Women or Lady Temple) is one of the smallest temples and it is built of red sandstone so it has a beautiful welcoming hue to it. Built in the 10thC is was dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva. The entrance is through beautifully carved doors. Don't forget to admire the excuisite Khmer writing on the pillars. Part of the temple is also dedicated to Vishnu. Again you have to climb over doorways. Be particularly careful here as you can step out of a door way (as I did) expecting to place your food on the ground, but instead you could catch your foot on a small unseen step and over you go - much to the delight of the Chinese tourists who will not even make an effort to assist you.This is a beautiful temple and you should be prepared to spend quite a bit of time here. There are small temples/rooms everywhere - you can guage that they were small people. The doorways in the central tower (you can get to it) are only 18 inches high. Some of the best dancer carvings are on this central tower. This temple is on one level so you do not have to climb stairs at all - there are a few small steps around but nothing too difficult.Watch your step and your head if you are tall. You could easily knock yourself out. Hats, sunglasses, sunscreen, good walking shoes and plenty of water are a must.When you exit the temple, take a walk around the outer walls - listening to the sounds of children in a nearby school and then enjoying the reflections in the moat. Watch out for small frogs and the lovely coloured dragon flies.At the right time, the moat will be full of beautiful water lilies.Be sure to stop at the Angkor Butterfly Centre on your way back. Have lunch at the Angkor Kitchen."

The sand stone carvings are delicate yet have withstood the sands of time, tourists, weather and just about everything else. This temple is much smaller than Angkor Wat but because of the size it is not overwhelming. Beautiful artwork done in sandstone, this Hindu temple is amazing. Do not miss the display that has the photographs of the temple as restoration was underway. Temple will not take long to see, but take your time as it was not as crowded as Angkor Wat was."

This was the first temple I visited on a 4 day 'temple tour' and it remains in my mind as one of the best for several reasons.The carvings are beautiful and generally in very good condition and many of them are at a level where they are easy to see and photograph. It's not very big, so by the time you've seen it all it is still exciting - unlike some of the larger temples when I felt glad to get out of them.The pink sandstone does make it quite different to most of the others that you will see, especially if you visit early (I mean just after sun up) when the stone seems to glow. This also means that you should have the place pretty much to yourself - and it will be cooler !. As everyone comments it is out of the way, but I think this is a bonus as the trip out through the villages is very interesting and you'll certainly see sights you won't see if you stick to the main temple circuit."

A bit further away from Siem Reap that the main temple complexes but this small temple is well worth a visit and the carvings are better preserved than in most of the main temples. Combine with a visit to Kbal Spean (linga river) or Kulen Mountains National Park. The latter is said to be the origin on the Kymer Empires. The latter part of the trip to Kulen is over muddy rutted roads. At the end is a temple with a reclining Buddha, one linga carving in the river and waterfalls with restaurants to have lunch and a pleasant dip in the river. At Kbal Spean there are more linga carvings although a longer walk from the road. My recommendation is Kbal Spean over Kulen but in any case stop at Banteay Srei"

The temple differs from others in that it is made of pink sandstone which gives it a different look than many of the other temples. The pink sandstone also seems to have stood the wear of time better than the grey sandstone, in that the carvings are without much sign of wear. Hard to believe they were done more than 1000 years ago!Banteay Srei is a compact temple compared to many of the others, but you could spend hours there - especially if taking photographs.

We enjoyed it, but might be rough on someone older or with back trouble to ride in a tuk-tuk that long. This was our favorite temple site because (probably due to its remote location) it was really peaceful & less crowded. Yes, you still have people pestering you to sell things, but fewer (& only at entrance/exit points). It was very quiet in the ruins. We could hear enchanting music, played by a local band at the edge of the park - they weren't asking for money, & you wouldn't even have seen them unless you walked in a fairly remote area.One unique aspect of this complex is that it's carved from pink sandstone. The carvings seemed more intricate, maybe even feminine. There's also an interesting exhibit chronicling the excavation of the ruins.At the exit are several vendors selling food & drinks, in a covered area with seats."

I used to go there in the afternoon, but, I am advised that its also very good in the morning.Interesting ride there by tuk tuk, as you pass through some small villages as well. Immaculate pink sandstone carvings. One of the \" must sees\" of a visit to Angkor Wat.There is no fee to go in, as this is covered in the cost of the pass to the Angkor area."

I love this long drive with our tuktuk. Plenty to see along the way. I noticed how each Cambodian home is usually in stilts, the space below always with a hammock. Locals love hammocks; we do to in the Philippines. Along the way, we passed by the Angkor Butterfly Garden and Landmine Museum though we gave these places a miss. It\u2019s a monastic complex, therefore it\u2019s flat. Nonetheless, the exquisite carvings make it stand out among the temples in Angkor. Every surface is so detailed. Its pink sandstone and the monkey statues giving an Indian scent make it so unique. The music played by a local group sets a magical mood while strolling around the temple. An hour is enough to explore the exquisite Banteay Srei so we were able to get back to Siem Reap before 3pm."

It is made of pink stone while most of the other temples are grey. Take a guide book as there is very little info at the site itself. There are food stalls and other traders by the parking area."

It is well up north (I believe like 30km) from Angkor Wat and the other main temples, but it is absolutely worth the ride. The level of detail in the carvings is unparalleled and not seen at any other temple in Angkor. The color of the sandstone is pinkish and specially later in the day the light gives the place a very warm exposure. It is not big, but this is more than compensated by the abundance of detail....."

The pink sandstone carvings on the walls and arch ways are exquisite! The intricate and finely-detailed carvings make Banteay Srei one of the more beautiful temples there is... And there are a lot of them in Siem Reap. Found out this is older than Angkor Wat and Angkor Thom. Long drive to get to this remote temple -- a little over half an hour by tutktuk -- but you get to see the country side and observe everyday life in Siem Reap along the way. The distance is a disincentive to some, so it won't have the coach load of tourists that flock to the larger, more popular spots like Angkor Wat and Bayon, which for me was the bonus as you get to appreciate it more without the large crowds."

I was lucky and arrived at a time when only a handful of people were at the site and could admire the carvings at a nice slow pace sitting in a corner of the complex in the shade.

(Famous french poet who stole some statues from Banteay srei in 1923 and got caught. Thanks to him, the temple became known and got a restoration budget a few years later.) Him and his friend Louis Chevasson got prison sentences in 1924. He had his fiancee with him, Clara, but she was found \"not guilty.\" as a foot note: Clara returns to France, asks for favors. Poets and writers including Aragon et Gide write a petition and save Malraux. I wish I had seen this temple first. The road to go there is long but really nice. I took a tuktuk which cost me 18 usd for the day. On the way to return, I visited Ta Som and Neak Pean. (you can visit more but i prefer to see few places taking my time. otherwise they all look similar fater some point) NP. is in my opinion one of the really different temples. Small but interesting. Now back to Banteay Srei. This is a Shiva temple. (Angkor and most others are dedicated to Vishnu). At the entrance there is a lot of interesting information (They explain which ones are devatas, which ones are apsaras etc...) It is said that this is a \"2 god temple\" since the south is dedicated to Shiva, but at the north you see dedications to Vishnu as well. And Brahma has not been forgotten, i was told. But official guides say that this is a Shiva temple in essence."

The stone used here is distinctively reddish pink and apparently softer than that used at temples like Angkor Wat, thereby allowing the artisans to carve the reliefs in much greater detail and delicacy. Much of the carvings are in very good condition and as with the other temples, are Hindu myths and stories told in stone.

The detail is finer than most of the other temples. Beautiful reflection of the temples in the moat. Try to get there when the busloads of tourists aren't if possible, as it is small, and can seem a little overun when too many tourists are there. Don't miss if possible. I would include it in the top 4 (Angkor Wat, Bayon, Ta Phrom, Banteay Srei)."

Unlike many other great temples it wasn't built by a king, but rather a courtier. It's a bit further from town but if you have the time and means this is a place you must visit other than the obvious Angkor Wat.Here you would find that the carvings are incredibly detailed and fine. Very different from the scale compared to Angkor Wat. Angkor Wat was all about being BIG while Banteay Srei was not huge but fine and tiny. Outside the temple there is a place to buy tourist products and some restaurants runned by locals serving food at tourist price. The rolling/roast beef with pepper was particularly good. As well as the curry in the coconut."

At the insistence of a friend, we made our way in the morning of our last day in Siem Reap, and it was well worth the trip. Banteay Srei is approximately 38km out of Siem Reap, which means a really, really long trip by tuktuk. Our tuktuk driver highly recommended a stop by Ta Prohm on the way to Banteay Srei, which we took in, but the direct trip back to the city took us almost 1.5 hours by tuktuk. For a return trip, our driver asked for USD22, which I thought was more than fair. On top of that, we gave him a decent tip for being such a stellar fellow (and for having to ride through sun & a short drizzle for 2 x 38km journey without a single complaint.)Banteay Srei is a very, very small complex, but unlike the other temple complexes, Banteay Srei's carvings have withstood the tests of time wonderfully well. The intricacy and delicacy of the carvings are breathtaking. And yes, after three solid days of temple-gawking, temple-fatigue had long ago set in, but Banteay Srei still blew our minds away. All in all, because Banteay Srei was so small, we spent maybe only an hour touring it and taking a stroll around its compound. There were also birdwatching options and a few stalls to have lunch at on the compound, but we opted to escape the sticky noon heat and head back into town for lunch instead.And, to be honest, the long ride out there and back was completely refreshing as well. It was a welcomed difference to see the Khmer countryside and quaint little villages instead of the typical town-and-temples scene. A little extra info:There are lots and lots of basket-weave products available as well as traditional Khmer scarves on sale intermittently along the road to Banteay Srei, which are significantly cheaper than what you'll find in town itself. The Landmine Museum is also on this road, so if you've the time (we didn't) it would be worth it to plan another hour or two into your schedule to stop by for a visit as well.We left for Banteay Srei at 8am and made it back into town for lunch by 2pm (including the time it took us to go to & tour Ta Prohm). Given the hellish heat of the afternoons we had had to put up with the previous days visiting Angkor Wat & Angkor Thom, this timing was excellent for enjoying the temples in the coolness of the morning, having lunch back in town, then heading back to the hotel to cool off over the worst of the Siem Reap heat."

We went during the hottest time of the day, and still there were too many people. In fact, there were so many, that I did not enjoy my time at all. Of course, I cannot take away too many points from the attraction itself on account of bad people traffic management. Banteay Srei is also known as the citadel of the women or of beauty. It is considered among the finest because of the very delicate stonework that is evident in the carvings. Famous for its pink/red sandstone, this temple is on a miniature scale when compared to all the other temples in the Angkor complex. I personally was disappointed that they roped off the middle section of the temple, so that combined with the mob, it was basically impossible to observe the fine stone work."

Although quite small compared to the other temples, Banteay Srei is as picturesque as it can get. There's also a \"nature\" walk surrounding the temple so you can enjoy the breeze and feel of the countryside."

I'm not surprised, given the size of the temples and structures in and around Angkor Wat. However, what Banteay Srei lacks in size it makes up in complexity and beauty. Banteay Srei is one of the earliest temples being constructed in the early 9th century. Of particular interest for me were the architectural differences and similarities between this temple and future generations. Some things seemed to work and were repeated in larger scale elsewhere, where other structures appeared altered in later temples. The relief work was often very well restored and featured some unique pieces I had not seen elsewhere. I was very impressed by the quality of the restoration of the inner temple, which even had replica statues which allowed us to gain a better image of what it looked like over 1000 years ago. If you go, don't forget to visit the Exhibition Centre. It offers some great pictures on the restoration as well as some history on the Bas reliefs and columns and other architectural structures as they varied between Buddhist sects and as they spanned over years. The whole temple area is surrounded by well landscaped grounds, though the 'nature trails' and botanical garden, are really nothing more than dirt paths that take you back to the exit. From there you have to run the unfortunate gauntlet of souvenir shops and drink stands in order to leave the complex.Its a real trek to get out to Banteay Srei and I would highly recommend a motorized option but however you choose to get their I think you'll appreciate the beauty of Banteay Srei."

The intricate carvings are beautiful and I felt my visit was worthwhile, but I'd already seen most of the other temples by the time I made it out here. The site is quite small. I generally take a lot more time to explore than most people and I spent no more than 45 minutes here. Compare that to the hour it takes each way to travel out here. The countryside is lovely to see, although a trip on a tuk tuk can be a little harrowing given Cambodian traffic."

I had visions of all those National parks I had seen in the USA when I saw that, and it right away destroyed my feeling of seeing something akin to Ta Phrom. On entering the site proper, at the end of a dirt path, I was greeted with crowds of tourists from the buses I had seen in the parking lot. Trying to get a decent picture that was not filled with heads was impossible. The center of the site was roped off completely blocking any access to it. I enjoyed what I could of the stonework, and tried to imagine the replacement statues as being real ones. The stonework WAS pretty, and I am glad I saw it, but I suggest that unless you REALLY want to see this place, go someplace else."

Instead, you will be swept into a world of detail, as almost every surface has been covered with stunningly exquisite carvings of amazing artistic beauty. This is a temple to be savoured rather then gawked at. With a knowledgeable guide, you will find that there is a story behind this smaller temple, and its artistic beauty. It was the only major temple in Angkor not built by a monarch, but instead by a king's counsellor. Well worth the 25 miles it takes to travel to this wonderful gem."

Our guide explained that much of it is because of the type of stone that was used for the various temples. If you have the time, this temple is very unique and must be seen.

You get to see the countryside and how the people live. That was particularly interesting to me since this was my first trip to Asia. Once you arrive at the temple, you see that it is very different from the ones closer to Siem Reap. The carvings in the temple are really ornate and the sandstone used in this temple is red in color, instead of the gray stone used in other temples. You can walk around a small lake near the temple. There was a small band of disabled musicians. Several of the temples in the Siem Reap area have bands like this. The musicians were injured from mines laid during the Khmer Rouge rule from 1975 to 1979. It is said that several million land mines were laid during this time and many are still there. The tourist areas have been cleared, so it is safe to visit them. Take the time to visit Banteay Srei and you will enjoy your visit there."

It's a pretty magical place and also pretty romantic; I'd suggest this as a prime proposal place for a woman who can appreciate this kind of thing ;) you might just have a lot of onlookers.We went when it was raining to avoid crowds. Do it, it's even more colourful!I suggest you go when it's not busy (super early or late). Like all touristy spots, they get overly crowded with rude and photo-opp greedy people; it's just not the same getting lost in the artwork when you have some \"....\". nudging you or basically yelling at you in some crazy language. When you walk in, you'll see lots of stand alone doorframes, those actually have some of the best artwork and some nice Sanskrit... Go to your right to avoid the crowds and check out the lone doorframe amongst some sparse rubble, it'll be worth it.

Some intricate carvings that you can get up close and personal with and some great views of the temple's major structures as you're leaving the temple itself, and preparing to walk back to the parking lot/food/souvenir area. I went fairly early (mid-morning), and it was only a little bit crowded, not bad at all. Also, as you leave, the food price is negotiable; as I was leaving I said no thank you to a girl showing me a menu for her family's food area, and the price of the pancakes immediately dropped from $4 to $2, which I couldn't say no to. Also, in the souvenir stores, even after negotiating the price of my handful of scarves down, I was sad to learn that the scarves could be bought for less money at the Landmine Museum (which is on the way back to Siem Reap)...and though I like to shop a little bit from many different people when I travel, I would have much rather the money have gone to the Museum, which not only helps with demining Cambodia, it also takes in orphans. On my way back from Banteay Srei, I stopped first at the Landmine Museum and then the Butterfly Museum, both are quite small (could run through them in 15minutes, could spend an hour at each), but I feel a great use of time, and it breaks up some of the monotony of the somewhat long (though beautiful) trip."

Still a lovely temple though - called the women's temple as the carving is so delicate and so intricate that it is difficult to believe a man could have fashioned it. It is beautiful in the sunlight - made of pink standstone. The crowds make it difficult to walk directly to the entrace but there are places to view and take photos to the right of the main temple which are not so crowded. Fortunately, the heart of the temple is roped off so it is possible to stand and take photos without interruption. well worth the trip out of Siew Reap."

Back to Banteay Srei, you cannot enter the temple but you can go around the outside and as it is small it is definitely worthwhile. The carvings are very ornate and quite beautiful. Make sure when you leave don't go the way you came exit to the right and you get nice views of the temple with a reflection in the water (obviously if the weather permits). It had signs up saying your shoulders should be covered but people had singlets and sleeveless tops and it didn't seem a problem.

I wasn't sure I was going to be impressed. The temple did not let me down - carving was so detailed & because it was a single story structure you can actually see it all. Tons of Hindu stories carved into this temple - make sure you go with a legitimate certified Cambodian tour guide so they can explain all the carvings, so worth the extra $. Also going in a tuk-tuk would be a very dusty experience :( guide w car is awesome!"

My trip started with a visit to Kulen Mountain and the River of a Thousand Lingas with a stop at Banteay Srei on the way back to Siem Riep city. Bantey Srei is known by different names such as, the Lady Temple, and the Citadel of Women. The temple is dedicated to the god Shiva and is located about 20 to 25 km from Angkor Wat area. Roads to the temple are in great condition. The temple complex itself is small in comparison to others but the intricate carvings in pink sandstone are absolutely exquisite!!! Don't rush through this temple, take the time to enjoy the beautiful carvings. The oxidation of the sandstone from the rain and mildew gives the temple an amazing color variation. Remember these artisans must have put in many, many hours into this lost art. When taking pictures take some wide angle pics as well as close ups of the carvings you may notice many details you didn't pay attention to before. Best wishes to all on your journeys wherever they may be. As always, I recommend my guide Narin ( angkornarin@yahoo.com )."

Your tuk-tuk driver might ask for a little extra but when you haggle/bargain, make sure that you'd want to go to this place and settle for a fixed price.Banteay Srei is a temple in Cambodia built in honor of female deities, representing strength, unity, and safety. Bantaey Srei happens to the one of the smallest of all the temples but it is indeed the most beautiful, technically and easily my favorite of all the temples that I have visited. The intricate carvings and the story that surrounds the place is just overwhelmingly beautiful. It's the only temple that is happens to be colored in comparison with all the other temples as the structure itself was made from red sandstone which enabled its builders a great medium for the elaborate and decorative wall carvings that will just leave you in awe of the place!"

The difference was that you have to travel 37km to see the carvings here, which made it a little off-putting for me. I think though that if you can tell the difference between the carvings and shapes and stuff, and if you want to see one of the oldest temples in Angkor, this is a good place to visit."

Don't miss the great interpretation centre here (sign-posted simply as 'Exhibition' before the main path to the temple).

The red sandstone and moss combine to make the miniaturized temple a pink and green beauty begging for photographs. The detail is well preserved and closer to you (as opposed to tipping your head way back looking up at some of Angkor Wat).It was well worth the trip, even for our temple-fatigued eyes!"

The gorgeous temples of Banteay Srei were easily the highlight of our visit to the region. The beauty and delicacy of the carvings is breathtaking! And the effort it must have taken to create this finely detailed work, which is over 1000 years old, is simply mind-boggling. Our trip was superbly organised by Wide Eyed Tours (www.wideeyedtours.com) who put us in the hands of a friendly guide named Keo Somchhin, with an airconditioned car and driver at our disposal. Usually known as Chhin, our guide proved to be wonderfully well-informed, fluent in English, and arranged a flexible itinerary for us. He can also be contacted directly at chhinangkor@yahoo.com and we would recommend him without hesitation."

            "review": "A Haunting Beauty All Of Its' Own. Located 37km from Siem Reap & nestled amidst lush green jungle, sits the hauntingly beautiful ruins of Banteay Srey. From the moment you step foot in this temple, you cannot help but be overwhelmed by the extraordinary atmosphere of peace & tranquility which envelops you. Fortunately Banteay Srey remains relatively unspoilt by hoards of tourists, possibly due to its' more remote location. Unpretentious guides offer their services for a personalised tour of the ruins; you find yourself following in anticipation, climbing over sandstone blocks covered with moss, ducking through crumbling doorways to enter shadowed hallways, peering through foliage to find beautiful bas relief images - and the greatest reward of all, seeing the look of sheer happiness on the face of the guide, who has been able to share his culture & history with you.Banteay Srei is spell binding & mystic; transport yourself back in time to imagine how this temple was constructed, envisage temple dancers & an ancient cilvilisation going about their daily chores. Truly an awe inspiring experience not to be missed."

            "review": "well preserved. Most of the decorative structures were original and very little eroded by the elements. Our guide told us this temple was remarkably preserved as the whole complex was covered by an ant hill when discovered.It's a small by comparison but the quality of the carvings preserved the epic tales very well and allows for as much time if not more time as you would at Bayon or Angkor Wat to figure out all the tales on each wall.Try to go earlier before the day gets hot and when the sunlight is more forgiving for pictures. Try to make this almost your last temple to visit, so that you've heard all the Ramayana mythological tales from the other temples and try to spot them on your own...where's wally (or Sita or Kama or Kala or Siva)?"

The temple also seems to be in minature it is about 38km from Siem Reap. But the journey by Tuk-Tuk although dusty was an excellent way to see all sorts of Cambodian life close up and we enjoyed the trip immensley.We visited several other temples on the way back"

Routinely described in gushing terms as the \"Jewel of Khmer Art\", Banteay Srei is nevertheless a temple of great beauty, and compres with little else in Angkor. Is miniature scale almost always surprise visitors, and the near-total decoration of its surfaces is exceptional. So visit Siem Reap visit Banteay Srei."

            "review": "a little out of the way but worth the effort..... This is another beautifully preserved temple dating to around 967AD The Citadel of Women has intricate carvings that will take your breath away. The ruins are minature compared to Angkor Wat, but this little gem hidden in the jungle about 20 miles from Angkor, is worth the visit.Go first thing in the morning before it is too hot and over run with other tourists. Take some water too. Good footware is helpful but there is minimal climbing here...so mobility constrained individuals will have an easier time of it.And, make a donation to the musicians who play on the edge of the ruins -- they are mine victims who survived the Killing Fields"

It is totally managable as an afternoon excursion because of its intimate size. It has tons of delicate cravings of women sitting on lotus and stories from Ramayana, The lavishly decorated libraries are must-sees. I went in the late afternoon and stayed till about sunset. The sun gave all the cravings a very pleasing glow for picture-taking. Definitely worth the one- hour trip from Siem Reap."
