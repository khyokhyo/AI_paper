Many of the buildings and temples were destroyed or seriously damaged by the earthquake of April 25, 2015, and it will be a while before rebuilding is completed. Nonetheless visitors should still go see what is left, and get a sense of the whole area. The Kumari Temple is a beautiful example of classical Newar art and hasn't been damaged significantly. Neither the magnificent Black Bhairab nor the screened in White Bhairab were damaged and are still quite literally awesome. Plus, it is just the general atmosphere of the place that has always been, and still is, magical. If you don''t have time for anything else in Kathmandu, definitely visit Hanuman Dhoka. Mush better than Thamel!"

The area has definitely been heavily damaged by the earthquake, but that does not stop one gaining an appreciation of what it was at the peak of its grandeur. There is still a significant amount that is undamaged, about the same that has sustained minor damage and clearly more that has been severely damaged. Restoration is slow and perhaps not as \"tourists\" would want, but \"travellers\" understand the difficulties such huge \"force majeure\" brings. The area is still magnificent and taking in the substantive architecture that remains provides amazing snapshot of the past."

The detailing in the architecture is superb and you could spend ages walking round examining every inch and still be in awe. The only down side for me though was the street peddlers who don't seem to give you a minute chasing after you selling their wares. Hanuman Dhoka durbar is in Kathmandu durbar square. There used to be several ancient buildings in Kathmandu Durbar square. Hanuman Dhoka got its name from the statue of monkey god Hanuman at the entrance of the palace. Alas all this is now a thing of past. Just within few paces from the Hanuman\u2019s idol near entrance, used to be a stone inscription of king Pratap Malla which was written in 14 languages including Urdu, English and French. There used to be another temple of Shwet Bhairav that remains closed except during Indra Jatra. All that is left now is ruins. Nature has its own way of turning things up and down and I feel sorry for the localities that lost their lives in the massive earthquake."

Kathmandu's royal palace, known as the Hanuman Dhoka, was originally founded during the Licchavi period (4th to 8th centuries AD) but the compound was expanded considerably by King Pratap Malla in the 17th century. Sadly, the sprawling palace was hit hard by the 2015 earthquake and damage was extensive. At the time of research, the palace was closed for reconstruction, but once this work is complete, visitors should again be able to access the beautiful royal courtyards and royal museum.Even from the outside, the palace is impressive. Hanuman\u2019s assistance to the noble Rama during the exciting events of the Ramayana has led to the monkey god\u2019s appearance guarding many important entrances. Here, cloaked in red and sheltered by an umbrella, a Hanuman statue marks the dhoka (entrance) to the Hanuman Dhoka and has even given the palace its name. The statue dates from 1672; the god\u2019s face has long disappeared under a coating of orange vermillion paste applied by generations of devotees."

The Hanuman Dhoka and the Kathmandu Durbar Square that houses Hanuman Dhoka provides a fascinating and interesting glimpse insights into the history of Kathmandu. Note that Kathmandu used to a kingdom by itself centuries back and thus had its own unique culture and tradition, some of which is visible here through the temples, shrines, architecture and historical structures and monuments. The Durbar Square houses palaces and structures belonging to rules of multiple dynasties that ruled Kathmandu. This place is also popular for all kinds of and all price ranges of Nepali souvenirs - depends on how good of a bargainer you are!There is entrance fee to the region for tourists like USD 10, and personal guides cost around 15-20 USD (again depends on how good of a bargainer you are), but totally worth it and definitely recommended! Make sure the guides are licensed by the government and speak good English - most are and most do. They will be able to provide you with history and hidden significance of each palace, shrine, architecture, or ritual performed there. The guide tour usually lasts an hour and half to two hours or longer if you wish. After the tour is over, just take a stroll exploring the fascinating bazaars and interesting culture, get lost in the crowded alleys and discover more of Kathmandu! Most important thing, it is absolutely safe there, especially for tourists, Kathmandu being the city of people actually practicing good hospitality!"

Hanuman Dhoka is a complex of structures with the Royal Palace of the Malla and Shah dynasty in the Durbar Square. It is spread over five acres. The Hanuman Dhoka Palace gets its name from the stone image of Hanuman, the Hindu monkey god, that sits near the main entryway.

Th \"Hanuman-Dhoka Durbar Square\", at the very heart of the ancient city of Kathmandu, is known also as \"Durbar Square\" or \"Basantapur Durbar Square\". It was named after Hanuman, the Hindu God depicted in the form of a monkey (an incarnation of God Shiva) and a helper of God Rama (an incarnation of God Vishny). It includes palaces and beautiful temples and shrines, both Hindu and Buddhist. The April 25, 2015 earthquake has severely damaged \"Hanuman-Dhoka Durbar Square\", where many temples and monuments - as \"Kasthamandap\", \"Maju Dega\", \"Chyasin Dega\", \"Trilokya Mohan Narayan\" and others - were completely destroyed. But fortunately, many others like \"Kumari Chowk\", \"Shiva Parvati\", \"Taleju\", \"Jagannath\", \"Basantapur Durbar\", \"Hanuman-Dhoka Palace\" (housing the \"Tribhuvan, Mahendra and Birendra Museums) and the \"Gaddi Baithak Palace\" were partially or slightly damaged. Before the earthquake, the \"Hanuman-Dhoka Durbar Square\" was always full of visitors, souvenir sellers, fake saddhus, pigeons and cows. The square has re-opened for visitors and a fee of Rs.750,00 is charged per person upon entry. If visiting Nepal was on your plans, don't give it up! Support Nepal and its lovely people in their efforts towards the country's reconstruction. Enjoy!"

After the tragic earthquake, I hope that Kathmandu and the Nepalese can rebuild this landmark that represents Nepal's rich cultural history. I look forward to visiting Durbar square again sometime soon."

We visited during the Dasain festival and there was a local market in the morning selling all things from vegetables to live animals for the sacrifice. It was a lively atmosphere but a bit chaotic too.As you enter, there is a large open space where makeshift souvenir shops are setup and then you see the Kumari Ghar on the left. As you move towards right, you get the Royal Palace complex which is guarded by a pair of lions at the entrance. There is a Hanuman statue near the entrance and this place derives its name from this. The palace complex has a 9-storey building. You see the royal guards in uniform.Once you are out, you can enjoy several temples. We saw a few but didnt explore all of them. The place will be much better if general public is kept out to maintain cleanliness.There is an entrance fee and the ticket counter insisted on local currency only. There is no strict checking of tickets as this place kind of blends with local market and other public areas around it. You will get a map along with the ticket which is quite useful.Worth a visit!"

Other negatives are the extortionate foreigner fees that are strictly adhered to in order to enter it, which boils down to nothing more than discrimination. If you don't have a good guide book then go buy one and avoid the bogus tour guides who are more interested in taking you to a healing bowl shop and trying to get you to part with 150 euros. the palace isn't up to much but if you need the exercise climbing up through empty room upon room then go for it, other than that it's really not worth it.

However, after the museum, you come to the Hanuman Dhoka and that is marvelous. The square is dominated by the nine-storied palace. You can climb to the very top and check out the scenery through the windows. A word of caution - the stairs are quite narrow and dark, so be careful while climbing.

The nine story structure above the museum is a climb to remember with all forms of stairs and details and the view from the top is brilliant. The museum itself offers a wonderful insight into the recent kings of Nepal although I did feel it went on too long and could have been just as impressive if it were cut in half ( time it takes to see it all ). Also watch out for the pigeons in this are as they can be a bit disturbing when they all fly off at once. Great memories of a great place."

The hustle and bustle is gone and it is now getting sanitisedI wonder what Captain Haddock would say if he was to return to Kathmandu!"

Popular legend has it that during King Laxmi Narsingh's time Kalpa Briksha came to see the chariot festival of Machchhendranath, where he was recognized by one of the priest of Machchhendranath, The priest seized him and refused to release him until he promised to give a tree from whose wood a rest house could be built. Kalpa Briksha made the promise, and so he was released. Four days later, a huge sal tree was delivered. With the King's permission, the Kastha Mandap was built from the wood of this single tree; Kathmandu has derived its name from Kastha Mandap.A three-storyed building, Kastha Mandap has an open ground floor, underlining its original purpose as a public building. The decorations and carvings added over the years have greatly enhanced the original design, bringing it closer to the appearance of a shrine. The central image in Kastha Mandap is of Gorakhnath. At each of the four corners is an image of Ganesh, the elephant-headed god.Kumari:The Living Goddess sometimes appears in one of the first-floor windows, especially if her handlers are paid well enough, and is said to answer devotees' questions with the expressions on her face. She is most likely to appear in the morning or late afternoon.Festivals and EventsThe most important festival for the Kumari is Indra Jaatra,a celebration of the harvest held in late August or early September. On the third day of the festival, the Kumari Devi is carried around Durbar Square in a chariot. The chariot is kept next door to the Kumari Ghar and the great wooden yokes from past years are laid out nearby.In a tradition established by King Jaya Prakash Malla(builder of the temple), the Kumari also bestows a tika(mark of blessing) on the forehead of the king who would reign in the coming year. This tradition was used against the king within a year: he was driven into exile on the even of Indra Jaatra in 1768,allowing the conqueror to take the tika and become the rightful king."

The square itself is unfortunately chopped up by the large expansion of the formerly royal palace, which makes the square kind of weirdly laid out. However, the principal problem is that the square is filled with guys who want to be your guide, people who want to sell you stuff, and beggars. So many that it's hard to stand still to look at things. Bhaktapur and Patan Durbar squares are both less busy in this sense (not free of these things, but much less all-intrusive), and both squares are architecturally better. Frankly, I would not visit Kathmandu Durbar square again, but I would visit the others again."

Hanuman Dhaka Square is usually known as Kathmandu Durbar Square, which used to be street vendor and hassler and vehicle free area. But now there are too many street vendors, street hasslers and vehicles are allowed drive in the square area; all of the above makes the Durbar Square experience an unpleasant experience. The streets are narrow and there are no footpaths; so the vehicles drive within few inches to people's feet, a very dangerous situation. We were group of 17 and 18 with city tour guide and were very bothered by all of the above.Our future groups will not visit Kathmandu Durbar Square unless the Kathmandu City administration works to take care of the unwanted issues and activities to keep its Cultural World Heritage status given by the UNESCO."

Hanuman Dhoka got its name from the statue of monkey god Hanuman at the entrance of the palace (hanuman means the monkey god + dhoka means door in Nepali). The building was a former palace of Malla kings of Kathmandu. Now it is converted as a museum that has huge collections of things related to shah kings Tribhuwan, Mahendra and Birendra. It is divided into three sections, first section is of Tribhuwan second of Mahendra and the third section is of Birendra who was assassinated with his family in 2001. There are so many things of these kings their personal goods, beds, important pics, weapons and even the medals and awards they were honored by other nations. There are two gold royal thrones. One of them was used by the shah kings for their coronation purpose. The coronation of shah kings was held in the inner courtyard of hanuman dhoka palace. Though the palace was built during Malla period but one of the buildings is made by shah king Prithivi Narayan Shah. This palace is known as nine storyed palace of Basantapur. One can go to the top floor of this palace from where you can see beautiful views of Kathmandu valley. No camera is allowed to take along and take pictures, you have to submit your belongings in a locker, however mobiles with camera are allowed but suggested to switch off (most people do not off their mobiles and also take pictures at the top floor of nine storyed palaces.)Army in traditional attire of then capital of Shah Kings still can be seen at hanuman dhoka. These armies are called GURUJU KO PALTAN and these are mostly marched in processions during festivals. There are few other significant temples in the surrounding like Kumari Ghar, Kasthamandap, and Taleju etc. The wooden supports of the roofs of the temples around the Hanuman dhoka are nicely carved with various sexual postures. It was believed that such carvings would protect the temples from thunder and lightening. Such postures are also one of the important aspects of Tantrism.Just within few paces from the Hanuman\u2019s idol near entrance, there is a stone inscription of king Pratap Malla which is written in 14 languages. These languages include Urdu, English and French also. Use of these languages before five hundred years ago is really interesting and amazing.There is another temple of Shwet bhairab that usually remains closed except during Indra Jatra. You can peep in through the doors carvings and see the grand image of Shwet Bhairab.Kumari house is full of beautiful carvings in wood. Kumari can be seen during Indra Jatra festival only when she is taken out of the house on a chariot. However you can get glimpse of her when you are in the courtyard of Kumari house at 4 p.m. everyday. Kumari is the living goddess of Nepal. A girl from Newar community is chosen for Kumari. She undergoes various tests to be the goddess. She is worshiped by all Nepalese as the living goddess. The kings used to go to see kumari to get her blessings. She remained as the goddess till she gets her first menstruation. I highly recommend to visit hanuman Dhoka while in Nepal"
