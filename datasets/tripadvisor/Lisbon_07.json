The modern material (not part of Gulbenkian's collection) was typical modern art with no real feeling behind it. I realize that this is subjective and my viewpoint, but that's my opinion. I recommend that anyone visit this unique collection, but the kids might get a bit bored early on as our daughter and friends did."

It had an interesting assortment of treasures, but I feel there is something for everyone in it. I particularly liked some Japanese boxes. The cafe was a little odd, but we were able to find something to eat for lunch despite being rather late. It's not large or fancy, but I was grateful it was there."

We very much enjoyed our afternoon at the Gulbenkian, there are two separate museum buildings set in the most wonderfully tranquil and beautifully designed gardens.The collections have something for all tastes; from ancient art right up to the present day, the modern art building was showing three very interesting temporary exhibitions. The quality of the founder's collection is of the highest order, the painting collections and Islamic and Oriental decorative art such as carpets and ceramics were fantastic. A wonderful collection with some real masterpieces."

A couple of Rembrandts and a superb Turner were memorable, but Mr G went for Guardi rather than Canaletto in his Venice views but little else struck me among the paintings. The most stunning things were from the pre-Egyptian period, a couple of small portrait busts that might have been made yesterday by one of the best portrait sculptors ever. Also lots of excellent ceramics, inc a pristine Greek Krater, nearly 3ft high. Breathtaking."

The Gulbenkian Museum is a unique sort of art collection that began as the private collection of a wealthy Armenian who was raised in Great Britain, then moved to Portugal in his later years. It is very eclectic, including many painting, antiquities, and decorative art item. But the beauty of the collection for visitors is that there is not too much - something for every taste, but not overwhelming to sample. The collection includes what are indisputably great masterpieces by painters such as Rubens and Rembrandt that are rarely reproduced and a much greater variety of artistic treasures than could ever be described briefly. For lovers of modern art, there are special building devoted to Portuguese art that were not a part of the original collection. The grounds are absolutely enchanting to visit, full of beautiful foliage arranged within quaint walkways and ponds. There are animals all over. In short, there's something for everyone, and it induces quite a feeling of peace and contentment to visit. Unless you're utterly indifferent to the restorative effects of art and nature, this is a must-see attraction in Lisbon."

This 'modern art' museum was such a waste of time and money. 20 euros to see an exhibition of how Portugal has developed it's cultural heritage (with no useful narrative to accompany the pieces) and a rag-tag collection of old and newer pieces assembled to suggest links across time and art-form. This exhibition was so tenuously curated as to be laughable and instead felt like you had wandered into a second hand shop or someone's private collection. When we discussed our displeasure with the desk clerk, he explained that as we had seen the exhibits, we could not then receive a refund...he also said to us \"why did you even come here if you don't like it?\" honestly, the mind boggles! Please take note of the likes of the great Astrup Fearnley museum in Oslo for how modern art museums should be.The only saving grace was the beautifully landscaped gardens that the museum building sat in. The park is free to explore, lush and interesting...it was the only part i would recommend."

Good thing we did not pay for it because this is a rather subjective taste of arts. A very rich man called Gulbenkian collected these art pieces, totally based on his own taste, a very random collection of this and that. We could not get the fuss about it. It has a nice garden, and we listened to a nice orchestra and saw some ducklings and they were all better than what we saw in the collection. So unimpressive and totally not the must-see in Lisbon, unlike how it is reflected here in TA."

All the exhibits were collected by Gulbenkian himself for his own pleasure. He describes considering his works art (feminine in the Portuguese language) as his 'daughters'.The collection starts with Egyptian ceramics, funerary masks and statuettes,Roman and Greek glassware and bronzes dating back several centuries BC. It then moves on to Persian tapestries and carpets, woven with silk thread on velvet, predominantly from the 12th century AD. Turkish ceramics and panels of tiles in a variety of designs and colour leave you marvelling at Gulbenkian's taste and wealth. Eighteenth-century Chinese ornamental jars, plates and figurines - many in rose pink, as well as the more well-known blues and greens - complete this part of the exhibition.Gulbenkian's collection of art forms the second part of the collection - the 16th and 17th century Dutch schools. We left the eighteenth-century works - both paintings and a collection of clocks for our next visit."

There is a modern section which is more focused on particular artists. We spent a whole day there with a delightful and reasonable cafeteria for lunch in the middle."

The range of artworks in display is absolutely world class and extends from antiquites to french impressionists to art deco. Gubenkian died in 1955 and each item in the purpose built museum up to his death was personally sought out by him. The garden restaurant provides excellent meals and its worth having a break there."

Some of them are not about this collection but from the \"Centro de Arte Moderna Azeredo Perdig\u00e3o\" located in the far end of the garden. This part of the Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Calouste Gulbenkian has temporary modern art exhibitions, some of them of dubious taste, others very good (its a matter of luck on the time you visit).About the Founder\u00b4s Collection, the visitor must keep in mind that it reflects the personal taste of Mr. Calouste Gulbenkian (1869-1955).The collection spans from ancient egyptian artifacts to roman and greek coins and pottery, from chinese porcelain and japanese jade sculptures to persian tiles and rugs, decorative arts from silver wear to furniture, and painting from classics (some Rembrandt and Rubens) to early and late 1800\u00b4s (William Turner, Monet, Manet, Degas, Renoir and many others).The last room of the exhibition houses the worlds largest collection of Ren\u00e9 Lalique jewels and drawings. This one\u00b4s definitely worth a visit.Take some time to walk in the wonderful gardens.An issue the management should take in consideration is the staff training, they are quite unfriendly and unhelpful."

It's one of the better known art museums in Lisbon but has a sensibility all its own. One building houses old masters, ancient Egyptian, Greek and Roman artifacts all well lit and presented, much of the pieces are in stunningly pristine condition. The second building houses exhibits and modern artwork and is equally respectfully presented. But the real shock was the garden that lies between the two buildings. It's quiet, has a stream, many varieties of birds and fauna and is an oasis in the midst of a museum. Make sure you get there because it's a Lisbon must-see."

It's 1960's architecture at it's best: Clean modern lines, low and wide, dramatic proportions; textures of concrete and wood contrasting with lush planted gardens. The collection however says more about the wealth of its creator than his taste. There's loads of everything, covering a huge range of eras, from ancient Egypt to Modern Portugal. The sheer quantity of opulent gilded furniture and carpets makes some sections look like an upmarket furniture store. Yes there are Rembrandts, Renoirs, Monets, Manets and others, just not very good ones. I did enjoy the cool of the gardens and the subtle artworks there. And tucked in a corner of the Modern Gallery was a genuinely moving photographic piece featuring prisoners in Lisbon Jail in 1915, who were forced to wear hoods whenever in communal spaces.

There are said to be approximately 1,000 items on permanent display with the collection comprising Greek, Egyptian, Roman, Islamic, Asian and European art works and relics that include paintings, sculptures, mummy masks, Greek coins and medallions, Roman glass and ceramics, Persian carpets, ornate tiles, mosque lamps, Qing porcelain, beautifully illustrated bibles and manuscipts, furniture, including exquisite desks, chairs and lounges plus magnificent clocks, silver work and jewellery.There are paintings or sculptures from the likes of Ghirlandaio, Rubens (Flight into Egypt), Rembrandt (Portrait of an Old Man), Rodin (Eternal Spring), Renoir, Van Dyck, Degas, Manet, Monet, Gainsborough and Turner plus many more. Rather than many paintings or sculptures from one artist there appears to be one from some of the best. It is reported that Gulbenkian purchased many artworks from the Hermitage during a period when they had a sale.We spent a pleasurable 3 hours exploring this museum on a Sunday afternoon being wowed at just about every turn. The artwork is extremely well laid out.There is a cafe in the museum but unfortunately the meals that we had were pretty ordinary."

In total we spent about 5 hours exploring the grounds and the museums. Also, I am not a big fan of Lalique glassware, but the museum has a room that houses the good stuff--one of a kind jewelry and glassware. Don't skip it.The outdoor space was about to start a summer jazz series, unfortunately we were a week to early, but Marc Ribot and Tim Berne were performing, so the facility programs top notch music."

There is a lovely collection of Italian scenes by Guardi. A range of Louis XV and XVI furniture and dining artefacts come next and lastly an amazing collection of jewellery by Rene Lalique. Even if you don't like Museums or Art galleries this is worth a visit if only to get a real feel of how the mega rich of the early C20 lived and what they spent their money on before football teams, super yachts and Jets!"

There is a little of everything in Gulbekian collection and the temporary exhibitions are always good as well. Check if there is some cultural event on the museum premises on the agenda.The canteen is ok for a coffee and is perfect for a short pause but the food is mediocre and overpriced.Better enjoy a picnic in the adjacent park grounds."

Depending on how you arrive, I got the Metro to Sao Sebastiao as I wanted to explore the gardens first. These are also recommended and a beautiful way to start your day before moving onto the museum itself. A mixture of architecture of features there are numerous small ponds and streams to explore and navigate around and a genuinely beautiful area in the middle of this district of Lisbon. Without a map or direction I did get a little lost trying to find the museum entrance itself if you decide to wander down a path using intuition however they would led to a different area of the gardens to see or explore and the building itself was usually within sight. You can of course get off the metro closer or take a bus however in my opinion a visit to the museum requires a visit to these free gardens as well.The museum or gallery itself great value for money, it is an assortment of art, tile work and rugs and tapestries from a personal collection. At first I was concerned there would be little content however once inside you follow a set path around and see a lot of rooms and collective pieces. There are temporary paid for exhibits on top of the entry price you pay which did feel a bit off putting however this is In no way different from other galleries and museums around the world. I enjoyed seeing the main permanent exhibits on display, there were some beautiful pieces on show and you can spend an hour or two just walking and admiring the art on display before you reach the end.Facilities wise there is a small restaurant on the lower ground floor which opens out into the garden. Food is what you usually find in a museum caf\u00e9 however it was nice to sit with a drink overlooking the gardens and pond that it faces out onto. Toilets are located on the lower ground level but again clearly sign posted. My only real critique was a sign saying the entrance to the modern art facility was free close by which seemed to be a connected museum. On arrival this was not the case and required purchase of separate ticket to gain entry. Overall I was happy with the original permanent collection itself, its surrounding gardens were a nice experience in itself and the museum was home to some beautiful pieces. It was relatively cheap and good value for money."

This museum is incredible on so many levels, the first and foremost being the man himself, businessman and philanthropist Calouste Gulbenkian, who collected good art...lots of it. Instead of hording his art and sharing it only with those closest to him, he decided to share it with the world. Thank goodness for people like this. The collection is so extensive it is almost incomprehensible. I believe his earliest piece dates back to 1860BCE - an Egyptian antiquity and his most recent acquisition dates from the 1940's/50's. Aside from the vast collection of furnishings and furniture there is an entire wing dedicated to the European masters. Several of the artists represented here include Rembrandt, Rubens, La Tour, Boucher, Pigale, Rousseau, Corot, Boudin, Manet, Monet, Degas, Renoir, etc. Not only is this museum eye candy for those who appreciate good art/collectibles, but it also serves as a history lesson.This time I visited, there was a special exhibit on carpets and tapestries. The numerous carpets from Iran, India, Turkey and India were absolutely magnificient. A separate and equally fascinating exhibit focused on Hagop Kapoudjian, one of the most famous master carpet weavers who also worked for Gulbenkian repairing many of his priceless carpets.Prepare to spend several hours and that doesn't even include a visit to the sprawling gardens that surround the museum. Note, the museum is free on Sunday AFTER 2PM."

We saw this museum late in the day after seeing others, so perhaps we were too tired to appreciate it, but we are not knowledgeable about ancient art and we found that there was not a great deal of high-quality European art, especially in comparison to the top museums of the world. Probably it has the best European art collection in Lisbon, but I would rank it low on places to see. For us, its top feature is its gardens."

The people of Portugal were so lucky to have been given this amazing (that word again) gift. He had his preferences. Lots of carpets and textiles, Egyptian finds, ceramics from the Middle East and China, French furniture  (this not to my taste but the workmanship was top-drawer.) and more and more. Every room led to an other filled with exquisite offerings. To be honest, there is too much to take in at one visit.

It took approx. one and a half hours to get around and is full of treasures. This is a private collection. I took a few friends there and they were blown away by this Little Gem. Highly recommended."

Because is smaller and not stuffed with lower quality fillers can really spend time enjoying the items without the pressure to move on because in larger museums there is so much to get through.This museum reminded me of the Getty in LA. It runs from Egyptian to carpets, pottery and painting. Each section is quite small but each item is fantastic. Some staggeringly beautiful pieces to enjoy. Set out in a modern easy to navigate building. Really enjoyed my visit. Good food for the soul.Had lunch in the cafeteria which was fine."

No wonder you can't find the price on their website- 16 euros for the whole collection. Yet somehow the Berardo Collection is bigger, better, and free. I elected to pay for the modern section, and was rewarded with a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach. I felt like a sucker. The disappointment on the faces of the people leaving should have been a clue. It seems they can throw any old crap in a museum and people will leave good reviews. If I went on a free Sunday I may have gotten my moneys worth, but not my time's. The garden was nice (and free) though."

Since we are seniors (over 65) the entrance fee was very low, I seem to remember EUR 2.50 per person.The grounds were gorgeous, with flower gardens and water fowl, and we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food in the small restaurant on the grounds.The museum shop has items by local artists, and for a very reasonable price, one can find nice presents to take home.The museum is located where two tourist bus routes intersect. We were there on a very rainy day. We took the bus through the North part of the city, got off at the museum and then took the other bus to Belen. In spite of the rain, we had a great time!"

The number of different pieces from east to west, old to relatively new has something which will interest everyone.There are a couple of paintings by Turner which were highlights for me but there are many other items to go and see.We went on a Sunday (when the museum has free entry). We didn't have lots of time so decided against an audio guide. We also didn't have the chance to look round the gift shop or caf\u00e9 so I can't comment on those aspects.One thing that did strike me about the museum though is that the building itself is a little dated. Perhaps we are fortunate that museums now such as the Tate in London or MOMA in New York have loads of natural light. The Gulbenkian museum is all ground floor and surrounded by a lovely garden. This however means there is not much natural light so it seems a bit dark. Only a minor comment.If you are into museums and enjoy a broad spectrum, I would recommend a visit here."

Opened in 1969 in the Parque de Santa Gertrudes, following an international design competition won by a team that included architects Alberto J. Pessoa, Pedro Cid and Ruy Jervis d'Athouguia (1917-2006) with the landscaping architects Ant\u00f3nio Viana Barreto and Gon\u00e7alo Ribeiro Telles, the building is very much of its era, slightly brutalist in character. The Calouste Gulbenkian Collection is very comprehensive including ancient works from Greece, Egypt, Assyria and the Middle East with quite a large focus on ceramics including from China and a good display of early illustrated books, followed by European art and a strong collection of French 18th century furniture and decorative arts including a room dedicated to the glasswork of Lalique and other displays of silver and ivories. The art collection is world-class and certainly worth visiting; the lighting and the heavy 1960\u2019s emphasis on concrete and timber creates a slightly monotonous interior which does the artwork no favours and it is a relief to see the outside park through some of the windows, when conservation considerations allow."

Also, not that you go to a museum for the food, but the cafeteria here was above average for a museum which was a bonus.

The Museum is based on the private collection of Calouste Gulbenkian and is housed in a complex that includes the headquarters of the foundation, a concert hall, a modern art museum and a garden. It is a short walk from the Sao Sebastiao Metro but with a surprising lack of signage to direct you. The first part of the complex you arrive at from the Metro is the Modern Art Gallery and there is no indication that this is not the main Museum - we bought tickets after indicating we wanted the main Gulbenkian gallery and were then directed out of that building and through the gardens. We ended up in the concert hall building and were then directed through that to the art gallery. Having eventually arrived, the museum was very nicely laid out leading from Egyptian artifacts, through Greek and Islamic art to decorative tiles, 19th Century art and Louis XV and XVI furniture to a small Lalique collection which together with the tiles was the highlight for me. All in all it was a varied and intersting collection which I thought was very well displayed. There is a cafe downstairs although we did not stop there having had a hearty breakfast before visiting the gallery. However, the prices seemed very reasonable with plenty on offer. All in all a very pleasant couple of hours."

The seats are among the most comfortable I've experienced in any concert hall, and the audience for the Sunday concert (only 10\u20ac) included dozens of children, including babies and toddlers -- and there was not a single breakdown or meltdown. Whatever Portuguese parents are doing should be patented... But back to the Gulbekian. After the concert I visited the museum, which is free on Sundays. A magnificent collection of middle eastern and Asian art is perfectly displayed, with signs in Portuguese and English.

The Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation is a major cultural institution including many varied activities.It\u00b4s located in a beautiful park just in the centre of the city. There\u00b4s also an independent building boasting modern art works. Although the collections are outstanding, as contemporary art leaves me cold in most cases, unless you are really into it, I would recommend go straight and visit the building devoted to antique art, especially if you are short of time.I\u00b4m sure you will love this unique private collection. There are lots of pieces on display, some of them very old, others up to the nineteenth century, including Oriental and European art. The Oriental art was what I liked most, but everything is outstanding and varied.No only the contents, the building itself deserves a comment. It was built in the 60s I think in the brutalist style so common then, concrete walls and wooden floors abound. But is perfectly adapted to the contents, it has a somehow winding labyrinthic layout, spotted with small garden patios, as different rooms are connected not in a linear way. Nice atmosphere: quiet and relaxing place, soft lights. It makes a big difference to other major european museums which are a bit overwhelming with so many huge rooms covered with so many works on display and with so many people everywhere. Gulbenkian offers a slow paced and relaxing experience, considering the collection is big but not huge, and most of all, varied.One advantage is the ticket price, just 5 euros, and there is a shop, a library and a decent cafeter\u00eda that is not the rip-off you would expect in this kind of place.It definitely is one cultural strong point of this incredible city."

We had two coffees and cakes for about \u00a33.50 then later we had an excellent canteen style lunch with deserts for about \u00a313 for both of us - best value for money anywhere. I digress - the collection is housed in a different building to the one where we entered - the Modern Art section - so we made our way through the beautifully designed gardens to the main building. We loved the architecture of the place - mid century and a bit brutalist but really interestingly done. The gardens knocked spots off the Lisbon Botanical gardens in terms of being well cared for and a pleasant place to hang out. There were loads of walkways and seating areas - I expect it would be perfect for escaping the summer heat. The exhibits were just beautiful - I spent a lot of time sketching designs from ceramic pots and looking in awe at the skills of the artists and artisans. The exhibits were well laid out and annotated in English and Portuguese. I think we spent about 2 and a half hours there then went back to the modern art collection. We didn't enjoy the exhibition at all - one or two interesting pieces maybe, but to us phillistines there was quite a bit of stuff we really didn't understand at all. The exhibition space was great and interesting to walk around. Also, I can't remember ever being in such well appointed lavatories - huge and with bidets! Really worth a visit and allow extra time for the gardens and cafes."

In Madrid everyone has heard of the Prado, so you go. And it is a great museum. Well Rick and Frommers are professionals and by golly, this is a really fine museum for two reasons. 1. Contents and 2. The building itself.Don't go for the Impressionists. Very limited painting selection. Go for, and this is something I am not really interested in, the Egyptian, Greco-Roman, and Mesopotamia/Islam section of the building. Wow. Really fine and beautiful specimens. Best quality and beauty I have seen all in an exquisite setting. The Two Rembrandt's are awfully nice too. But this earlier era of art is astounding. Then at the end of this wing of the museum is the best exhibit of art nouveau jewelry I have seen. Twenty or more pieces, each a masterpiece.It is a simple Metro ride out to Sao Sebastian station on the blue line. Exit Aguiera Avenue and walk down hill keeping an eye out to your right. Tucked in you will see the Museum's signage.wayne iNLIsboa"

We visited both, enjoyed both very much. Favorites were the gold coins, Persian ceramics and rugs, the Rene Lalique collection (don't forget to seek it out), and the special exhibition of Sonia and Robert Delauney paintings (now closed). There is much more to see though and you can look at some of the pieces online. They also host music events. We spent two half-days at the museum. We had lunch at the cafe. Careful of the pigeons. Don't walk away from your lunch if you eat outside or they will take over. I wish we had been verbally warned when we paid, it would have been most helpful. Overall, I highly recommend it and would recommend investigating the website first for special exhibitions and music events so that you can plan your visit. You'll want to make note that the museum is closed on Tuesdays."

But the sheer range of Gulbenkian's collection means there should be something to please most visitors' tastesThe temporary exhibition on British taste in art was fascinating.A decent cafe and toilets means a long visit is enjoyable"

It's easy to walk in the museum and imagine that is an amazing source of learning for those who live in the city. I missed more information in the rooms to help me explore better the artwork and unfortunately one of the sections of the museum was being rebuilt.

The exhibits are well displayed, often in individual cases, so often museums display loads of items in one cabinet and it can be difficult to work out what is what. Not so here. Some lovely things, how nice to be able to collect what you please from around the world! Don't miss the Lalique exhibition, it wasn't well signed and we almost missed it, at the opposite end to the entrance to the main collection.Reminded us of the Burrell collection in Glasgow, both are well worth a visit!"

I had a last morning to spend in Lisbon and that musuem had good reviews and was not far from my hotel.Upon arrival, they had an ad about their Monday morning visits in English for 3 extra Euros (the simple entrance was 5) so I registered.The Monday's visit lasted about 1.5h. The guide we had that day was really great, knowledgable and spoke excellent English. She took us around the collections (which are organized in chronological order).On the museum's website you can even have a preview of what's inside with a virtual visit.It's really a visit I do not regret doing due to the presence and choice and quality of all the pieces of art coming from many places and many epochs. The big plus was the guide we had too. "

Every single artifact is of huge value, one can feel it. The span is very large, everyone who's reasonably interested in art and history will find a section that resonates with him/her. Much space between exhibits, it's relaxing and makes the visit enjoyable though a bit austere in some parts."

It reflects his interests so in the main building there is more pottery, carpets, and manuscripts than paintings, but they are of the highest quality. I don't normally spend much time looking at these crafts rather than paintings, but they demand attention. There is exquisite Persian, Turkish, and Chinese pottery, and carpets, and the miniature illustrated manuscripts are remarkable.We didn't visit the special exhibition, or the seperate contemporary art museum, so could have seen more 'art' if we had wanted to. We only had three hours and there was more than enough to keep us interested, including the very good cafe which had excellent coffee and savoury snacks.The building and gardens are attractive, and it is easy to reach by metro. Well worth a visit."

While the \"English\" audio tour equipment had all been rented out - we found this was not a problem as most of the exhibits have signs in multiple languages. Recommend before going that you do at least a little advance research so you can choose what you would especially like to see. The collection is so large that it's just not possible to see everything in only a few hours or even a single visit.Seeing the art nouveau Lalique collection of jewellery, glassware and ivory that fills an entire room at the end of the suggested tour route is a great finale."

It spans 4,000 years of art history - starting with Ancient Egyptian ware, and finishing with glassware by his good friend, Rene Lalique. The museum is spaciously and logically set out, with each room covering a different era and topic. There is something to appeal to everyone. You do not have to be an art connoisseur to enjoy it.The museum is open from 10am - 6pm every day except Mondays.

All of the pieces are of significant quality. The building is a modern 1969, one story structure and separate 3 story research facility set in a park. The museum is a bit out of the center of town. Getting to the site was real easy on the Metro and a wonderful experience. If you have a Lisboa Card, admission is free as is the Metro. Since my wife and I like all forms of art, we spent 2 hours here.

The building itself is custom-designed with great exhibition spaces and with the added feature of the occasional view out into the garden that surrounds the building. The pieces themselves are exceptionally well-displayed and lit. This is not a cluttered museum with an overabundance of exhibits. The relatively small number of pieces allows one to admire and inspect them on an individual basis without distraction. But the overwhelming and overarching impression, showing that Mr Gulbenkian kept his word to himself, is the quality of the pieces displayed. Without exception they are all in quite wonderful condition- ceramics, carpets, paintings, furniture, and coins. A quite superb range of art works in quite superb condition. The one quibble I would have is that many of the explanatory panels were unusually low for an average-sized person and therefore difficult to read. But this is a minor quibble. If you interested in art, history, museum design, or philanthropy this museum is a must see during any visit to Lisbon."

I work at a museum myself, and this is one of my favorites."

The collection is separated by historical periods and types such Egyptian period, Graeco Roman period, then tapestry, furnitures etc. the information sheet says there are 6,000 items in the collection. It is quite an interesting collection...ancient greek coins ( silver and gold) medals, paintings including Gainsborough, Manet etc, Lalique collection, chinese, Turkish and Japanese porcelainware, and extensive silverware and furniture collection. We spent more than 2 hours exploring it. I think itis a worthwhile visit if you are interested in these items.

The layout was perfect. Each room had a different theme and we found it very easy to move about. I think this is because the museum spaces the pieces apart so well. Although it is free on Sundays, another bonus, it was not crowded at all. (We are so used to museums in NYC, which an be crowded and hot. ) This museum was such a nice treat. We spent about 30 minutes walking through the lovely gardens. (The museum also features a separate building for temporary exhibits, which we didn't have time to visit).

Having heard very little about this museum before arriving in Lisbon, I was pleasantly surprised, no, amazed at the breadth of the art which was collected by one man. There is a very interesting story about how he amassed enough money to collect this treasure trove but I suggest you find the story on your own. The collection ranges from some spectacular pieces of ancient art from Egypt and Greece including a krater (vase) from ancient Greece which does not show a crack or a chip. Apparently Mr. Gulbenkian dedicated himself to collecting perfect pieces when he could. Some of the Egyptian objects were stunning. Then, there are the paintings from a collection of the greatest artists the world has known. I wandered into one room and my gaze was drawn to a portrait of an old man which was riveting - In two seconds, I realized that only Rembrandt could have painted that - and it was indeed a Rembrandt. This is a relatively small museum (think of the Frick in Manhattan) but do not leave Lisbon without going."

The Gulbenkian collection is certainly limited to one art lover's interests. But his interests and tastes covered a lot of territory and he built a wonderful collection. The building is set in a beautiful park and was thankfully free of crowds."

Calouste Gulbenkian was a phenomenally rich man able to indulge his interests in the arts - and the collection here shows that in spades. Stretching as it does from ancient Egyptian artefacts up to 20th century glass by Rene Lalique, it could never hope to be complete, nor yet of an even quality - his collection of Impressionists is not terribly impressive, for example. But the highlights of the collection - in particular the carpets and the Turkish and Persian ceramics - blew me away: the collection is simply stunning.The main museum is one part of the complex: there is a second exhibition space at the side and the Centro de Arte Moderne is on the other side of the park. I paid just to visit the main museum collection.The gallery is housed in a building that is the embodiment of 1960s brutalism: but it has been fitted into a public park area that makes it genuinely beautiful. If you didn't fancy the art inside, the park is a good place to sit and contemplate the world going by (and the museum cafe, which serves decent food at reasonable prices, is accessible from outside too)"

            "review": "Antonio Charrua retrospective in modern art building. The retrospective of Antonio Charrua in Gulbenkian Museum ( Modern Art Building) seems to be a major event. First it is a very comprehensive presentation of work of an artist who chose to be a provincial painter in Evora, Alentejo. Second it shows the almost complete oeuvre of the artist practically unknown to most experts, art historian and to the public at large attending modern art shows. It is, indeed, a breath taking event. Organized on two floors of spacious exhibition hall it allows to see and contemplate his work with necessary perspective to compare miniature sketches of the artist\u2019s notebooks (numerous of those presented in small glass-boxes) with some monumental size triptychs and canvas displayed on the white walls. An overall impression is one of an artist in a constant search of identity. It starts with Modigliani-like faces in cubistic perspective and moves on to very original constructive paysages of boats,, places ant things done with an excellent sense of proportion and very tame in using colors. Those pictures were created in 1950, the artist being in his twenties and are absolutely original and promising. What happened next was the gradual abandoning of constructivism and acceptance of colors as the major form of expression. Here he seems pleasant but somewhat repetitive and lacks originality. He seem to be aware of losing his painting voice and, to compensate for it, he adapts symbolism of simple signs or letters and transforms them through kaleidoscopic use of colors. Under impression of or the imitation of major abstract American painters, at least according to the written explanation of curators, he seems to be desperate to be en vogue in grasping major themes of contemporary dramas. Here he fails admirably and his paintings of tribute to Hiroshima victims seem the weakest of the whole exhibit. Next comes incorporation of letter symbols into color fields with mixed results. Miniature sketches are moving, large canvases partially destroy intention for sake of grandiosity. There is, however, a very interesting, new trend in later pictures. Instead of adopting masters and luminaries of modern art, particularly Americans, he starts looking at his own work as the source of inspiration. He transforms his own pictures endlessly. Surrounded by his own paintings (he almost never parted with them) he paints them better and better as if in search of ultimate self-expression. And here he succeeds again being a provincial painter in a small Alentejo town who had overcome the fruitless efforts to be inspired by famous masters and found the originality in his own paintings."

As with most of my reviews for this trip, because my partner is on crutches I am commenting first on access for people with mobility problems. For a new building in lovely landscaped grounds this one was particularly poor. Aesthetics have won out over function so paths with a slight incline have been laid out in many shallow steps rather than a gentle slope. An accessible ramped path that runs parallel to a couple of flights of steps ends in more steps! The museums themselves were well laid out; we went primarily to see the modern art museum which I have reviewed separately.The main museum was an eclectic collection with not too much of anything so it managed to hold one's attention pretty well. In particular there were some interesting paintings, with works by Manet and Degas and a couple of fine Gainsboroughs; for me there was insufficient explanation of their context."

Ceramics, fabrics (especially rugs), gold objects, and glassware are shown off to great advantage. As expected from a \"private collection\", there are also smaller (and in my mind, weaker) assortments of Chinese articles, European furniture, and mostly late 18th and 19th century Western wall art including works by Gainsborough, Turner, Manet, Renoir, Degas, and Monet to name a few of the more fashionable artists. An added bonus is a wonderful room filled with jewelry creations by Rene Lalique. Unusual for a museum, the cafeteria offers a fine menu of hot and cold foods at very reasonable prices. The associated bookstore is quite good and offers some fine Gulbenkian Foundation Art books, including a large 215 page collection highlight summary for a bargain \u20ac18. If you need some fresh air, the museum is set in a large stroll-through park. The only downside -- searching for on-street parking."

The only piece of advice is beware that in front of some of the paintings are lines on the floor beyond which one is not allowed to step but we had not noticed them until one of the attendants pointed them out very quietly, so caught up in the beauty of the artistry we had not realised we had moved too close. Some of the labels are rather small for those who need to read them at close quarters but their positioning is set at a hight for those in wheelchairs.

It's a magpie collection so it lacks a bit of coherence and the information was fairly minimalist and could have been more informative. Also, it's hard to find. However, there were some really excellent pieces. We particularly liked the portrait of a clearly fed up Mme Monet."

It's a really interesting collection and worth visiting if you like arty things. Also worth noting is it's brilliantly air conditioned so a great place to hide from the scorching Lisbon sun. There is a cafeteria in the basement which has a terrace overlooking the gardens - I can't vouch for it as it was so busy I couldn't get in! Also, the gardens were also very pleasant to walk around."

I have been around the museum a couple of times, most recently with my 30 year old (how did that happen) daughter - not previously known to be a museum buff. We had a great hour or so. The collection starts with Egyptian antiquities then ranges far and wide with French furnishings, lots of splendid Persian carpets, some very good pre-Raphaelite English paintings, equisite porcelains etc. etc.I easily run out of concentration in a Louvre/Uffizzi size gallery but you could, if you wished, get around most of the Gulbenkian in forty minutes. So I like that. And every piece displayed is absolutely top class. If you find a class of items which you particularly like you are in for a rare treat.Each time I have been there has always been groups of very young and extraordinarily well behaved children sitting on the floor listening to their teachers and that, too, has great charm.Finally, the gardens around the museum are well worth a short wander, with a lot of water features and a lovely calming influence.A memorable place to visit."

The Lalique jewellery collection (the last room) will quicken your heart as well.It isn't a huge museum and you can easily see most of the permanent exhibits in about 4 hours. If you feel tired, you can pop over to their cafe which has good food and some outside tables overlooking the lovely gardens.

So it gets you to queue up with a tray and then have someone put your salad on a plate for you. I forgive them though, because the food was good, pretty cheap, and the coffee was brilliant.

This museum alone is a reason to visit Portugal; but, note that, unlike other museums that close on Mondays, the Gulbenkian closes on TUESDAYS!...None of the guides (published this year) mentioned it, which forced us to reorganize our limited time in Lisbon. Three things I loved about the museum: a stunning collection that ranges from antique Persian ceramics, to Renaissance painting and modern works of art. You will necessarily find something to love and to discover. Second, the museum is just the right size. You can wonder around, taking your time, going back, and leaving, knowing that you have not missed anything. We were there on a Sunday (it was free too), but there were few visitors; the space is wonderful and peaceful. We had lunch in the cafeteria which is very nice.

The museum is modern, air conditioned (lovely as so much in Lisbon isn't and it has been very warm for our stay), and it has a very calm and spacious feel. We paid for audio guides and it helped our understanding especially of the Eastern Islamic art. The audio guide is not for every exhibit and it is easy to understand - not too detailed and wordy.

A far ranging collection ranging from Egyptian, Greco-Roman and Far Eastern works to European art and furnishings of the 19th Century including some spectacular pieces by Lalique. Very modern surroundings set in gardens contribute to a peaceful non-crowded experience. If you find yourself in Lisbon, don't miss The Gulbenkian!"

During World War II, he sought sanctuary in neutral Portugal to escape the antagonism of the Allied powers.As a sign of his gratitude for the protection he was given by the Portuguese, he created the Gulbenkian Foundation which today, sixty years after his death, continues to provide the majority of funding for the arts in Portugal.His foundation established several museums and galleries and the museum that bears his name in Avenida de Berna in Lisbon is perhaps the most impressive. Housed in a relatively modern building in a lush, landscaped park, the museum's priceless collections include Eastern and European paintings, tapestries, Lalique crystal and precious metal artefacts.Perhaps what makes this collection so special is the sheer scope of the exhibits. Here you'll find ancient gold and silver Greek coins, Chinese porcelain, paintings by Rubens, Rembrandt and the Impressionists, colourful Islamic art, Japanese prints and so much more, all under the same roof.This is an unmissable treat for art and history lovers. One of the richest private collections in the world left in Calouste Gulbenkian's will to the Portuguese people. What a gift!"

Unfortunately we left this fabulous museu until our last day and did not have enough time to appreciate it fully but I would highly recommend anyone to have a look at this fabulous private collection. Calouste Gulbenkian had a very fine aesthetic sense and this is evident in his masterful collection which was formerly housed in Paris. The building was tailor made for this and is situated about 4km away from lisbon centro. It is set in splendid and tranquil gardens. I found that each area in the museu led quietly into the next and was connected in some way. From ancient Egyptian art, through roman, Persian fabrics, French furniture, amazing old clocks, small marble sculptures, small area of paintings and Lalique works. Gulbenkian's eye for exquisite art shows in the unusual and strangely compelling pieces displayed. It's not all art and not all furniture, hard to describe but wonderful to view. The final section of Lalique pieces are alone worth viewing. We spent a long time looking at the beauty and workmanship in this one room. Altogether diverting and worth the trek. We taxied it there and walked back into town. Only a few hours but wish we had longer there. Take a picnic lunch to eat in the gardens. You will not be disappointed and you can photograph the pieces there. Loved it!"

But not many people have heard of Calouste Gulbenkian Museum in the US. If you ever go to Lisbon, it's a must stop. This museum is basically a personal collection for Calouste. This museum is divided into eight different concentrations: Egypt, Greek, Coin, Middle East, Far East, 18th Century French Furniture, Western paintings range from quattrocento to impressionist, and Rene Lalique. The best part of the museum is probably the 18th century French furniture. The collection here is as good as any large American museum. There is a huge collection of French silver which is very rare as most French silver were melted down during wars in 18th century. I would say their French silver collection is better than Metropolitan Museum in NYC or Waddesdon Manor in London.Another highlight may be the large jewelry collection by Rene Lalique. Most people when they hear Lalique they think of crystal vases. But during Art Nouveau period, Rene Lalique was arguably the best jeweler during that time. Two of the best examples of Rene Lalique jewelry is actually housed at this museum: Dragonfly Broach and Serpents Pectoral. The pieces are actually quite large in person and they are absolutely exquisitely made. Like all artwork, you have to see them in person to appreciate them; photos do not do them justice."

A museum where everything is interesting and excellently displayed. Entrance is inexpensive and English language headsets can be rented for a small fee which give background information on the Museum and exhibits. You can get around all the exhibits in less than 2 hours then retire to the pleasant on-site restaurant and watch the ducks and geese. Highlights for me were the Eastern costumes and carpets, the French and Russian silver tableware and the splendid Rene Lalique room."

In a modern building; well laid out; from very ancient carpets and glass right through to Lalique with paintings, sculpture, furniture, clothing, jewellery .... Superb, uncluttered, not crowded. The gardens are a lovely oasis and the caf\u00e9 at the interpretative centre lets you sit outside in the shade with a very inexpensive coffee and free Wi-Fi. I also visited the modern art collection this time and proved to myself yet again that I don't get it - or at least I don't get this collection, apart from the rather science fantasy insect drawings and the deer sculpture. So I'm a Philistine.Don't miss it!"

The collection is arranged by region and by century, and includes Egyptian, Greek, Roman, Ottoman Empire, Chinese pieces from various dynasties, French, Italian, English, and a few German pieces. There are paintings from famous masters, tapestries and rugs, porcelain, glass, tiles, sculptures, tableware, manuscripts, etc. A little bit of something for everyone. Well worth the 5 Euro admission. I believe there are other areas to see, such as special collections/exhibits, for a higher price, but I only had time for the museum today. Every item is displayed under glass and in dim lighting where needed, and the items are spaced far enough apart they can be appreciated clearly. The captions near each piece are in both Portuguese and English. Also, no cell phones are allowed, which I didn't notice when I walked in, but the result is that the place is quiet and peaceful, and one gentleman was even taking a nap on a bench in the middle of a display area. I have to apologize to the staff for my phone ringing during my visit. I am sorry! I turned it off as soon as I was notified to do so."

The Egyptian pieces (cat with kittens) are lovely. The Persian textiles and ceramics are a marvel. Even the European paintings include some real gems: Manet; Renoir. Getting into the building via a walled park was initially difficult. We thought that walking from Av Liberdade via the Edward VII Park would be a good access, but that was not the case; the Gulbenkian is over past a contemporary shopping center, and it's important to enter on the correct street. Interesting shop choice: no postcards. The same was true in the Museum of Modern Art, where we purchased Fernando Pessoa's Tourist Guide to Lisbon (he is a well respected poet of early 20th century)."

Attracted by the intrinsic beauty of objects, he spent a lifetime negotiating with the best experts and specialized dealers--all strictly authenticated-- dating from antiquity to the early 20th century. His good taste is evident as you pass by the collections. I have never seen pieces in such good condition in any other museum. Take a look at the silver collection--dinnerware.

This is a small museum that houses one of the most interesting collections in Europe. It was a private collection of a person involved in the oil industry and he made this vast collection available to the public after his death. It is hard to believe that one man could amass so many valuable, beautiful things in his lifetime. The collections range from Egyptian, Greek, Persian, Asian, French and other European furniture and art. The paintings range up to, and including, Impressionist works by Manet, Degas and Monet, among others.This is truly a gem and one of the less visited museums in Europe. It is a \"not to miss\" venue.

Not only a superb collection of art, but an architectural and landscape delight. The main administrative building is an imposing 125m of linear concrete, granite and bronze glass designed in the early 60s. It includes conference facilities and two auditoria. The museum itself is a separate structure, again linear modern movement in design, which sits elegantly in its landscape and contains an excellent cafe where one can sit outside and enjoy the views over the park. The Landscape design is quite remarkable. Undulating lawns and a lake with an open air auditorium give way to secondary paths of stepping stones which lead through dense planting of Bamboo, tall grasses and Eucalyptus to secret ponds. Children clearly love the hidden paths and water features, unexpected sculpture in secret openings, and the different ground levels. Water plays an important part in the design, and in hot summers this must be an oasis of shade and quiet. A third building houses the Modern Art Centre, designed by Sir Leslie Martin, with stepped sections providing planting and shade for the gallery space, and again incorporating a linear rill of water along the front of the building much loved by promenading ducks. A small but good bookshop too."

This is truly a great place with wonderful exhibits. Don't miss the stunning Iznik pottery and Lalique jewellery. The building itself is a masterpiece of 1960s Brutalism, softened by plants and set in a beautiful garden. We have not visited the (separate) modern art section."

We visited in February, and still people were sitting on the lawns and outside enjoying the environment.The museum contains classical sculptures (statues) from Rome and Greece, European paintings from the Renaissance period, decorative arts -- specifically French furniture, and some beautiful pieces of jewels and glasses.I was quite surprised to see work by Rubens, Rembrandt, Rodin, Renoir, Degas, \u00c9douard Manet, Claude Monet, and several other well-recognized artists.This museum takes only a few hours to walk through.

The museum hold a very wide variety of art. None of them are large but they are of quality. They include artifacts from ancient Egypt, Greece and Roman. There are fine Islamic, Renaissance and Medieval decorative pieces. For me the highlight was the fine collection of 15th to 19th century European paintings. There very good works by Rubens, Rembrandt, Monet and Renoir on display here. On a historical point, a lot of what you see here was purchased by Calouste Gulbenkian from St. Petersburg's The Hermitage back in the 1920's. The museum many strong traveling exhibitions that pass through Lisbon. If I had a beef about the place, it would be that I disliked the exterior of the building which was I thought was very unwelcoming and sterile."

Calouste Gulbenkian is possibly one of the most important people of the 20th Century for having played a crucial role in negotiating Western access to Middle Eastern Oil reserves. Visit the museum and see for yourself, the money accumulated from his business ingenuity was put into good use. The building style of the complex is simple and clear-cut, the straightness of the cubical and rectangular forms softened by the surrounding gardens (bring some bread or seeds to feed the ducks!). The interior design is simple and elegant; there is nothing to distract the attention from the displayed objects and each artefact is given its own space to stand out without being clustered by its neighbours. Between the exhibit halls, there are corridors with window walls facing interior gardens and armchairs to rest. The exhibition is astonishing and much like a superb meal must be enjoyed patiently, one bite at a time. We took our time and stayed inside for a good 3-4 hours, absorbing the details of the workmanship manifest in each and every exhibit. The section with the heavy and kitsch rococo furniture seemed to contrast the elegance of the Chinese vases and Islamic miniatures, but that surely is a question of subjective taste. Be sure not to miss the gallery room of Rene Lalique's work on your left in the corridor that leads towards the exit of the exhibition!"

They are housed in well lit cabinets which allows their real beauty to shine.

This museum has lots of that - and some of it is really funny.. but there is some really good stuff here too that wouldn't look stupid above the fireplace.I especially liked the surrealist paintings in vivid colours that looked like they were painted by small children.The building itself is a wonderful light space with polished floors and lots of smaller gallery spaces.The grounds are wonderful. Lots of tropical planting, streams and fantastic sculpture, populated by ducks, pigeons etc.. and some parakeets that seem to have gone wild and flap about terrorising the native birds..A really good day out. Take the camera as photography is permitted and unless you can produce photographic evidence your friends won't believe what passes for art..(The garden shed in the lobby made from rotten planks of old wood is one not to miss!)"

They are varied: European paintings starting with the 13th century, up to the impressionists of the 19th century, then sculptures including several by Auguste Rodin, a collection of Greek and Roman sculptures, glass and coins and another one of Mesopotamian Art. There is a large collection of Islamic Art from the times of the Mamluks and the Ottoman Empire and also one of ceramics from China and Japan from the past few centuries. Finally, there is a collection of works by Lalique, with outstanding exhibits. It is also worth paying attention to the temporary exhibitions: when I visited, there was one with outstanding works of art from major Spanish museums. The Gulbenkian museum is worth also attention for itself, as it was built specifically for this purpose and it has a very good layout. It is certainly one of the top museums in Portugal and it is highly recommended."

It's an individual man's taste which he was able to indulge with his purchases and this is reflected in what you can see; you make your own choice as to which to study and admire. A very good art shop, and at lunchtime a very crowded restaurant with such a huge slow queue we to abandon our idea of eating there (and couldn't find anything else in the immediate area.)"

You could tell that it was a lifetime's collection. The paintings covered Dutch, French impressionists, one Turner (I never liked Turner until now) , lots of Portuguese painters I've never heard of (sorry) and about 20 Cannallettos which were all together in one small ante room. .It took us about 2 hours to go round and we enjoyed every minute of it.---and it was about 20 minutes brisk walk back to the ship."

The first building is a must for architects and it offers: the museum with the Calouste Gulbenkian\u2019s collection (top art pieces of all times and a small precious Lalique room), the auditoriums (classic and erudite music programmes are generally very good), several temporary exhibitions, a self-service cafeteria/restaurant with esplanade in the garden, an art history library, a bookshop...The second building presents a couple of very good art galleries, a bookshop, a great food self-service restaurant/cafeteria. The top contemporary Portuguese artists have, sometime in their lives, a retrospective exhibition here.Take your time to enjoy the gardens which are extremely rich in hidden corners and ponds and utmost beauty. If you\u2019re around, don\u2019t miss the August jazz festival, concerts at night in the garden amphitheatre by the lake: each year, it features the state-of-the-art performers from all around the world (book in advance).

My partner and I visited this little treasure of a museum today and took the audio tour which, if you stop at most of the highlighted works, takes about 2.5 hours. Calouste Gulbenkian amassed a wonderful collection of art, often it seems by buying works from governments (the Soviets in Russia in the 1930s, the Nazis in Germany also in the 1930s) that were attempting to either \"purify\" their national museum holdings (the Soviets sold him a number of works that had belonged to the Czars and were in the Hermitage) or raise some cash. He also traveled extensively collecting from around the world many small gems, some by great masters (there are Rembrandts, Rubenses, Monets, Manets, Renoirs here as well as a number of Renaissance masters from Italy and Holland), but others equally interesting by lesser known lights. Many of the works here share cousins in the National Gallery in London or the Metropolitan in New York. The building itself is gorgeous and architecturally interesting, and reminded us in some ways of the new Barnes Foundation building in Philadelphia. Definitely worth a visit! There is also a modern art center, but we were museumed out so saved that for our next visit to Lisbon!"

Easily reached across Praca De Espagna the foundation has 3 main exhibits The permanent exhibit, a separate very good Spanish exhibition from the Spanish Royal palace In a separate building there is a modern gallery as well Don't expect a huge gallery but the quality is very good and it is well worth the visit Ask the reception they will be more than glad to give you the details After a peasant walk in the garden you can find the Modern part of the gallery which is very interesting as well Price is 5 euros each very reasonable I wrote this review because the foundation and Museum are listed as 2 separate entities in fact they are one located in different proximate buildings regards Bobby"

On arrival, given the options to pay for all the additional displays but due to time restraints, went for the main display only.Bought our ticket and went to enjoy the display to met by two security officials who insisted my back pack be removed and handed in and was directed to the cloakroom. The female at the counter was most official and took offence that I was unhappy that many others were taking larger bags in, as mine contained passport, cash etc? Once inside several of the exhibits were obscured by school groups and visiting parties, who were not going to move!The staff were most intrusive making you feel like you were like a criminal if you went too close or go too near. I have never felt so ill at ease in a museum.I appreciate the value of the exhibits but surely you should be able to enjoy and appreciate them without having to watch over your shoulder.Would never recommend the Gulbenkian as there are far better museums."

It's accessible by metro and definitely worth visiting. Unusual groups of items - furniture, rugs, tapestries, silver, many Egyptian items, fabrics, and jewelry as well as paintings. We didn't have time to see the visiting collections which was too bad based on the quality of what we did see. The only reason I can't give this museum five stars is that I compare it to others we have seen around the world and it's smaller and doesn't have the quantity of the Met in NYC or the Lourve in Paris, etc."

The collection is interesting too, and is displayed by subject matter (e.g. Egyptian Art, European Art, Eastern Islamic Art), with each subject having a physical section all to itself. Mr Gulbenkian, who collected all of these objects had good taste and a good eye, and so the visitor is given a quality tour.Previous reviewers mention that this is a good place to visit on a rainy day, but if you do not have any rainy days during your visit to Lisbon you should visit the museum on a sunny day.

The selection of carpets, tapestries and silks was very good and the pottery from both China and the Arabic world was most impressive. There was an interesting art collection and finally the exquisite Lalique collection. All very well chosen and just the right amount in each section to sustain interest without becoming bored. There is one big negative for this museum and that is finding it. When you come out of the Metro there is no signage for it at all and even in the gardens where it is situated there is no indication of it's location. Despite having a map we had great difficulty in locating it, however we were thankful that we persevered!"

Part of the collection includes furniture which are a bit over the top. However the art is amazing ranging from gold coin/pieces from the time of Alexander to Manet and contemporaries. The Boy blowing bubbles by Manet is fantastic. We learned a lot about Giovanni Boldini, a painter of the stars so to speak who figures in the Marthe de Florian apartment which lay untouched for 70 years in Paris. Boldini painted de Florian and one of these paintings was found in the apartment which is a whole other story. There is a wonderful Boldini portrait of Painter Brown ( a contemporary artist in France) and his family. It is a warm and vibrant painting of Brown, his wife and daughter, caught as if being photographed entering a show. There are multiple examples of Persian, Chinese, Japanese, Mideast art and design such as carpets and pottery. France, England and the USA fought (figuratively) over obtaining this collection. Lisbon won as Portugal had sheltered Gulbenkian during WWII. The museum design is well laid out. There is a beautiful garden and walkway to the modern museum on the other side of the park. There are concerts and an outdoor amphitheatre. They have a nice gift shop and a cafeteria. It was one of the highlights of our trip along with the Berardo."

The challenge of large art galleries for short-term tourists is hitting that balance between a great and eclectic collection and just plain wearing us out. The Louvre is, famously, the worst offender in this regard. Great collection but one has to sprint between masterpieces in order to take in all the key exhibits. The joy is just leached right out. The Gulbenkian, however, hits that sweet spot. Some of the best is the fine 20th C jewelry toward the end of the galleries, which provides a nice lift on the way out the door. The range is enormous and the galleries are large enough to facilitate a 360 survey before settling on the piece you most want to enjoy. Another reason to go back to Lisboa."

There is the museum and often different kind of exhibitions and a outdoor walk in the garden is a worthile thing to do as well and maybe to visit the cafeterria as well. And while here in Lisbon anotherpossibility is to visit Palacio Nacional da Ajuda or Mosteiro dos Jeronimos or Palacio de Belem. There are so many places to visit but then you must have more time maybe even overenight in Lisbon and visit Sintra - a day or two there and on the way visit Palazio de Queluz, Monserrate or Palacio de Mafra.

I've never seen old Greek and Roman coins looking so good. Old pottery was whole, famous greek vases were almost pristine. Moorish rugs looks somewhat worn but still good. The next thing I would say is that everything was accessible. By that I mean that most things were close enough to touch. There were no barriers keeping you away from it. If my kids had been there I would have worried that they would start running and run right over the rugs on display for example. The gardens are also a nice respite from the urban landscape outside the museum block."

Unless you are a particular fan of going to museums, or have a particular purpose to see something specific, or have come from a town that does not have a good museum of its own, then you should go here. There is a beautiful park, with many places to sit and relax and feel at one with nature. Also, this is a nice place to stop by if you are visiting Lisbon for an extended period of time. If you come from a large town, with a good museum of your own and you have a short amount of time in Lisbon, your time could be better spent elsewhere. This is not a \"must see\" attraction. Its nice when you have nothing else left to see. We are from NYC, we have been to our museums a whole bunch of times, so to be brutally honest, we were not impressed and regretted having gone. There are train stations nearby, so it is easy to get to the old city. Or you could walk. It would be a 40 minute walk down (maybe less, depending on your speed and its a walk down the slope, so its easier). Either walking down Parque Eduardo VII or Av. Sidonio Pais, going around the Marques Pombal traffic circle and continuing down AV. da Liberdade, which is a beautiful street."

We were a little disappointed by this museum, though it may have been because it was so hyped - Rick Steves' guidebook calls it the only \"must-see\" museum in Lisbon. It's a little bit of a hike from any metro, so be prepared for that. The collection itself is quite small, but impactful. Each piece displayed is beautiful, and the collection spans thousands of years. We went through the entire thing in about 30 minutes - it's really not very big. I would suggest going on a Sunday morning when entrance is free. I think I would have felt ripped off if I'd paid 5 euros per person since we spent so little time there and it's kind of a pain to get to. I don't think I would have made a special trip out to see it if I'd known how small it is, nice as the collection was.ALSO - don't get this museum confused with the Centro de Arte Moderna, which is located in the same park and also part of the Fundacao Calouste Gulbenkian. The signage is extremely misleading, and we first visited that museum, thinking we were in the Gulbenkian Museum. If you walk through the park, the signs are also very deceptive and just kind of...stop at one point. We noticed poor signage tended to be a trend in Portugal, especially Lisbon. Better to walk back out to the main road and find the entrance. Make sure you have a map with you!* If you like my review, I appreciate you clicking the 'helpful' button; those of us who take the time to write reviews live for those and it motivates us to do more :) *"

Note - the Gulbenkian's hours are 10 am - 6 pm and it is closed on Mondays.The Gulbenkian features masterpieces of many famous artists and ages, including Rembrandt, Monet, Manet, Turner, etc, etc. Yet the collection is not as good as that of the real top museums such as the Rijksmuseum, the Louvre, the Metropolitan, or for that matter the Museum of Islamic Art in Doha. Hence although very good, we consider it slightly overrated. Perhaps we are spoilt. The buildings musthave been very contemporary in the seventies and now look a bit dated with all the naked concrete and the wood panelling. The museum is set in a lovely garden though with sculptures. The restaurant in the Gulbenkian serves a decent hot lunch menu."

Particularly strong on Islamic and East Asian decorative objects, including Persian carpets, textiles, Turkish tiles, Japanese lacquer ware and Chinese porcelains. The European section contains a varied selection of furniture, tapestries, paintings and sculpture by many well-known artists, and what is reportedly the world's best collection of Lalique items. Everything is presented masterfully in a way that enhances the overall experience. The caf\u00e9 serves excellent food, with a dining room and a deck overlooking the museum's surrounding gardens.

Set in its own parkland just five minutes' walk from the top of Parque Eduardo VII, it is one of the best thought-out and displayed museums I have ever seen. It is not huge - but it is fascinating. Starting with Egyptian and Mesopotamian art, moving through Islamic and near-eastern sections, then far-eastern before a European section containing Monets, van Dycks and more, and finally a room displaying some gems of Lalique production, the layout is spacious and the lighting and presentation very effective. This is no dimly-lit rows of random crap in glass boxes (and we've all been to those!) but is a very well planned and enjoyable visit with some absolute gems. While I was in the Lalique room at the end I saw countless people walking past the door and leaving the museum without seeing it - don't! It is an absolute highlight of the whole experience! There are also other, temporary exhibitions in the neighbouring buildings, but we didn't visit those. The main museum, however, I cannot recommend highly enough."

The collection of Persian and Isnik ceramics is quite beautiful these are displayed alongside illuminated manuscripts worthy of the British Library. There are also some choices that will not be to every taste such as the Rocco Furniture. In the paintings the jewel is probably the Rembrandt although there is a fine range of paintings from this period of Netherlands painting.The caf\u00e9 is really interesting and the food looked very good and was very keenly priced. The modern collection is much smaller with a range of Portuguese painters from the 1030s through to contemporary artists. While we were there it had a very interesting exhibition of contemporary sculpture/installations from artists from all over Europe. There is a small collection of work by Arshile Gorky who was an American Armenian which might have something to do with their acquisition as they are (or those on display) were mainly works on paper and not hugely interesting of more interest was the work of a painter called Amadeo de Sousa Cardoso who studied in Paris and work reflects Cubist and Fauvist influences he died in 1918 from Spanish Flu at the age of 30."

We couldn't believe there wasn't a sign. The main museum, 5 euro per adult, was money well spent. The pieces cover a huge period in history and are remarkably well preserved with an amazing variety. The ancient artifacts were particularly well preserved with incredible detail visible. Although I didn't like all the pieces there is definitely something for every taste. The walk through the gardens to the modern art museum is delightful with sculptures dotting the grass on ether side of the path, the duck filled lakes offer some zen like tranquility. The modern art museum was very intriguing with interactive installations that drew you in, especially some of the sound boxes with film sequences - a very atmospheric experience! Due to an exhibition some of the normal pieces weren't on show but it didn't spoil the visit. Amazing disabled access with lifts and ramps throughout the complex also making it ideal for families with buggies. It is good to find an attraction that caters for all ages and abilities close to the city centre."

I seemingly covered every recognized major art period spanning thousands of years, beginning with the ancient Greek, Roman and Asian periods, and continuing through to the Impressionists. The museum could almost be seem as a \"sampler\" with just enough of each period and style, as if it was trying to have at least some representation from every artistic era. Easy to see it all, without spending hours doing so. Perhaps that is what makes this modest sized museum so enjoyable. Recommended."

His collection is a tour of art history with over 6000 pieces housed in an airy and relaxing building in Lisbon. I particularly enjoyed the glass and ceramics - especially the various styles in use throughout the East. European art puts in a good showing too with some wonderful paintings, seascapes by Turner, various of the impressionists and sculpture by greats including Rodin. Lovely collection of Art Nouveau items too. Not too large so that you feel over-awed but not so small that you feel hard done by. We rounded off our trip with a good value and tasty lunch in the museum self-service cafeteria. There's an outside eating area somewhat plagued with birds after every scrap. The museum is set within tranquil gardens and it is a pleasure to walk through this before arriving to experience the art. Tickets were \u20ac5 apiece and we both felt we'd had our money's worth.

The modern art section is fun to visit as well and the buildings are set in shady gardens which soften the modernist architecture and make the whole thing feel like a cool oasis. We ate at the cafeteria in the modern art section which had a good selection of salads and desserts along with toasted sandwiches and burgers. This made for a very pleasant trip on a hot day in Lisbon - recommended. My only criticism is that there is not very much explanatory material, maps or signage - maybe we should have paid for the recorded explanation or signed up for the app."

It's quite impressive to see the quantity, the diversity and the quality of all the artifacts that Calouste Gulbenkian accumulated throughout his life. Some Egyptian artifacts are around 4,000 years old while some Lalique pieces date from the 1940's. There are probably a dozen large Turkish rugs, hundreds of Chinese pottery items, loads of ancient coins, some ancient books and bibles (late 15th, early 16th century), many different pieces of furniture, hundreds of paintings (some Monet, Rembrandt, etc), a few Rodin statue, and the list goes on and on.

It consists of several types of art that the donor liked and we thought his taste was outstanding. We were particularly interested in the Islamic section as we have so little knowledge of that type of art. Even the French furniture selection which covered an era that was my wife's least favorite was well done. We walked through the surrounding gardens and enjoyed them as well. We missed this on a previous trip to Lisbon and this was our number one priority. It exceeded our expectations.We had lunch at their cafe and the soup and salads we ordered were quite good. All in all, we spent over three hours at this museum."

Housing over 6000 items from the personal collection of Calouste Sarkis Gulbenkian, this museum offers and amazing array of items; pottery, textiles, furniture, carpets, Lalique glass, paintings.There is pottery from Ming and Qing dynasties, paintings by Turner, Gainsborough, Monet,, Manet, Rubens and Rembrandt to name but a few. I can honestly say I think this museum has the best array of historical artefacts I have ever seen in one place. We spent easily 2-3 hours here.There is also a decent restaurant offering full meals or snacks - the prices were relatively cheap and the quality was fantastic!It is a bit of a way out of the city centre - we decided to walk from our hotel on Avenida De Liberdade and it took us about 50 minutes. I would recommend getting the bus, however, as it is cheap and efficient and there are several services that stop near the museum. Although it took us a while to walk there in the pouring rain, it was definitely well worth the effort. Entrance price was only 4 Euros per person, a bargain for what the museum has to offer."

I really cannot add much more than has already been said about the private collection, but I will say that Calouste Gulbenkian was a visionary. One of the paintings on display was purchased by him from the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg in the 1930s. There are paintings, sculptures, jewelry, coins, porcelain - objects of art that were breathtaking. There is an audio in several languages which was very good. Do some browsing in the gift shop.

The Gulbenkian museum houses the private collection of Calouste Gulbenkian.The museum is a 5 minute cab ride from the town center(5 euros).Open 10-6 Tuesday thru Sunday.Non flash photography is allowed.Lovely garden area surrounds the museum.Restrooms and caf\u00e9 on site.museum takes about 90 minutes to visit. The museum costs 5euros with an extra 4 euros for the audio guide(recommended).The first room you enter is a bit dull with some middle eastern exhibits and history.Next you enter the china exhibit ,which has many vases and exhibits from China. The main room has many exhibits of French furniture ,sculptures ,tapestries,jewelry and some priceless decorative silver.Some smaller rooms showcase some small exhibits. The art gallery is the center piece(non flash photos are allowed)Rubens,Manet,Renoir,Monet,Rembrandt are just a few of the many masterpieces ,that can be viewed in the gallery.One can only guess at the value of this museum."

The Egyptian and Greek rooms were really good with high quality artifacts. However as you see these first, as the museum is arranged fairly chronologically, it was a bit downhill after that. I know that reflects my interests so others will probably enjoy all the French furniture more! There are 2 Turners and 2 Monets on display which were good, clearly there are better collections elsewhere. In summary the museum is fine to visit on a wet morning but I wouldnt make a special trip.We had lunch in the cafe, the food was good so I would recommend it. We had vegetarian pasta, a soft drink each and one pastel de Nata for 20 Euros.My complaint about the museum is that you have to view the whole collection in one go, you can't stop for a drink or toilet break half way round, on the standard 5 Euro ticket."

My husband interested in Egyptology and ancient coins, had the same reaction. He was really disappointed. It really is a smattering of this and that and certainly not for anyone interested in anything specialized, i.e. tiles or tapestries or whatever. There are just a few examples in each category though the quality is good...the collections are very limited in scope. So I would recommend it for people with lots of time in Lisbon to spare..not for a one day visitor as we were. It eats up too much time for too little reward."

It was providence and the above reasons that co-ordinated our decision to spend afull day to absorb and appreciate the huge cache of treasures that this collector had amassed. It is without a doubt one of Europe's finest collection of art. The displayes are in spacious,well-lit galleries,many overlooking the garden's courtyards. The museum itself is quite small,however,each individual work of art,from the magnificent pieces that make up the rich display of Oriental and Islamic art,to the selection of European paintings and furniture requires from us a lot of adoration and amazement. The Armenian section is superb not only for its fine collection of Persian and Turkish carpets,textiles and costumes,but also extends to ceramics, as well. The Syrian mosque lamps,i wanted to exhibit in my bedrooms,and the bottle collection is pure whimsy,and delight. There are numerous manuscripts from the 16th-18th centuries,produced by Armenian refugees. My femme opted for a closer look at European art dominated by the French painters including Fragonard,Boucher and Watteau. One whole room is devoted to Venice with the output provided by the painter Guardi. Its a wonderful treat and had us lingering for a long time savouring the colours and the idyll spots that we recognised from our visits to the wonderful city. there is a small but exclusive British section devoted to the art of Gainsborough and Turner. More loitering ensued and discussions flowed. If you remember your mother's glass- cased sideboard in the parlour, full of hokey Lalique figurines,well,you have arrived in Lalique heaven,for here is a whole room devoted to the originals . I am old enough now to appreciate what my mother and everybody's mom loved about their little collections.  We had lunch at a nearby restaurant,only to hurry back to this wonderful treasure- palace"

We took an apartment within walking distance to assure ourselves that we would not miss it for any excuse. It is truly an amazing collection of beauty and genius. Reading the reviews one senses something special, even for a \"seasoned\" museum visitor. It will not disappoint. The design and layout of the galleries were stunning in the display of the treasures. Never have I seen oriental rugs, for one example displayed in so many ways and laid out in all their magnificence on chestnut floors. Who knew that Lalique was a master jewelery designer? How could one person amass such a collection and succeed in having his wish of keeping it all together for posterity be achieved? The US had a chance at it, and so did the French, but in the end it was Portugal that won the honor. The Foundation is to be complimented on preserving the nature surrounding the museum as well as the cultural wealth within. The cafe lunch was delightful sitting out on the patio watching ducks, birds and small children playing nearby on a beautiful sunny day in May. It is a little hard to find on foot tucked away off busy streets in a less travelled neighborhood but asking for help from locals at a streetside cafe worked wonders. We spent over four hours there including a visit to a temporary exhibit of gifts to the Czars from Turkey and Iran in the Moscow Kremlin. Have never seen anything like these objects anywhere else in our experience."

When I visited it was great and the near-by Museum of Modern Art has a fantastic park with sculptures and water pools, great on a sunny day. The visit to Gulbenkian Museum was one of the highlights of Lisbon for me with a carefully selected objects on display and a great architectural space."

I've been to museums all over the world, but never have I experienced such an encapsulated journey through history from the ancient Mesopotamians all the way through to the modern Impressionists all in one museum, yet no piece of art or artifact feels cramped or out-of-place. Lovely gardens interlude with the rooms as you walk through time. The cafeteria is also lovely with an excellent selection of hot and cold foods, plus an outdoor patio on which to enjoy them. Only downside: slightly difficult to find while walking from the metro stop. I stopped to ask for directions several times!"

I don't usually like museums but this one is special. It has something for everyone. And the gardens cover a city block.

The museum does have specialties in its spectacular collection of Lalique jewelry and glass, a large collection of Islamic ceramics and rugs, and a single gallery devoted to Guardi's dreamy paintings of Venice. The museum building is modern, spacious and well lit with interior views of an outdoor fountain and garden; the exhibits are nicely labeled; and there is a very pleasant cafe with outdoor seating surrounded by a garden."

It is always a pleasure to attend a venue at the Gulbenkian!The temporary exhibitions are also a must !"

Because I am a philistine, I thought that quite a few of the exhibits were displayed because they appealed to Mr Gulbenkian, rather than being there for any cultural reason. He had great taste in art, but some of the more \"mundane\" antiquities were made to look even more ordinary by comparison . If you want to see carpets go to The Hermitage or one of the Islamic city museums ! Still, I've been here twice. Sunday (when it is free) is a popular day for local families wanting a bit of culture and a decent meal. There is also free music downstairs sometimes. During the week it felt a bit dead even if you had unlimited time and space."

It is easy to meander through each gallery progressing chronologically through the history of art. Highlights include a striking Manet and a fabulous collection of Islamic tiles and carpets. While the museum is very impressive, the cafeteria is a bit mediocre."

It is of manageable size and has some stunning pieces like the Egyptian cat sarcophagus and a Ghirlandaio portrait which alone are worth the price of the entrance ticket. At present there is a fascinating exhibition not included in the entry ticket called 'The Route of the Tile' until 26 Jan which if you are in Lisbon should not miss. The gardens of the Gulbenkian complex are exquisite and the Modern Art Centre has some interesting pieces. All in all a marvellous afternoon."

The museum is without charge on Sunday and very reasonable otherwise. Don't miss the cafeteria - a serene terrace overlooking the park-like grounds - and the gift shop!"

The collection was brought to safety from Paris to Lisbon at the onset of WWII, and put on public display in 1969. It is candidly acknowledged that the collection represents Gulbenkian's personal tastes. It's arranged geographically and chronologically, but I'm not sure how else it could be done. It just seems a bit rigid. The works are simply overwhelming, worthy of any large public museum. The staff seemed distracted and diffident; if their behavior is typical of the security standards, this is a major heist waiting to happen. Senior tix are 2 euro each-best bargain in town. A must-see in Lisbon."

This has to be one of the greats of the world, housing the collection (or a mere fifth of it) amassed by the Armenian billionaire Calouste Gulbenkian and willed to Portugal (and the world) on his death. The notable thing is the perfect condition of the exhibits, from Greek vases to Persian rugs and old master paintings. Give yourself three hours to see and enjoy it all and then proceed to the coffee shop. Ticket to the museum costs, in September 2013, only 4 euros or 2 euros for seniors. The best 2 euros I have ever spent !!!!"

I mean to say that viewing a few vases, dito carpets, silver bowls, ore whatever, will do to get the impression on the subject. This is not so in paintings, coins and sculptures; they are very different. I found the Gulbenkian museum really worth visiting, but especially for the very special objects, like the extremely beautiful sculpture of Diana by Houdon, and the various paintings by several artists. The museum has collections of surprising subjects, and is thus rather varied, but many objects are, to my opinion, not too interesting. Nice to see, but I found it hard to see the real beauty in eg. the chinese lions. The collection is very large, and in my opinion, some items could be set aside as they are more of the same. Not another dish, I recall having thougt. But just bare in mind, that this collection is worth seeing, and for 4 euro's you have a couple of hours of real artistic experience, and if you are over 65 years old, you get a 50% reduction, so come on you vital old art-lovers ! ps I'm not a real museum fanatic... but I wanted to be surprised, and I was."

Overall, however, this is an outstanding attraction with a well-stocked bookshop and an excellent and reasonably-priced self-service restaurant. But a word of warning, we were wise to take lunch relatively early. As we were leaving the queue was extremely long.

I only had an hour or so there before it closed, but it was easily worth the 2 Euro entry fee! [Over-65. Full price is only 4] The museum stands in a leafy park, and the inside space is large and stylish and makes the best of the exhibits. I personally loved the European art section, with Monets, Manets, Millets, Gainsboroughs and lots more, but the oriental tapestries silks and porcelain are amazing as well. If you like furniture or clocks there'll be enough to keep you interested, and there's a stunning Lalique collection as well. Just a short stroll from Sao Sebastiao Blue Line Metro station [and El Corte Ingles]. Not to be missed."

Did not get audio guide,but would have been a good idea as very little description of each item other than the title and date. Rest of the museum was good too, Egyptian, Chinese, paintings. Got around in 1 hour, as I was on a schedule. Go! Even if you have less time. Not to be missed. Better than the National Tile Museum in my view, but I like the more intricate tiles, and less of the pictorial style. Taxis are also very easy to get, not like back from the Tile Museum."

The exhibition mixes artifacts and paintings of all ages and cultures. What makes it exceptional is the selection. The ancient artifacts are preserved in outstanding ways. There's a large number of ancient Greek and Roman coins that seemed to come out of my wallet, like new. I was also really struck by ancient jewellery in almost perfect shape. Chinese pots are also breathtaking. The second part of the exhibition is about medieval and modern art, again a beautiful collection. I was really impressed by the Breton Women at a Pardon painting, it looks like a photo.Overall, I gave myself a back pat for deciding to come here. Don't miss it, it's a cornerstone in Lisbon. Only minor issue, slightly expensive. Not too much less than 10 euros if I remember correctly."

A highlight is the marble original of Houdon's famous Diana, Collections of Egyptian, Greco-Roman, Mesopotanian, Islamic and Armenian Art are exhibited beautifully. Decorative arts with a stunning collection of Lalique jewellery and objets are also on display. It is free on Sunday mornings so worth waiting for this opportunity.

Admission is eu4 (students eu2), and you can see a lot for your money.The museum is not central or particularly close to other attractions or metro, also not paricularly well signposted. We found it with a sat nav, but a taxi ride wouldn't be expensive from central Lisbon."

However, if you find a good guide book with a map, bring it. There are no useful maps available at the place. We do not usually have trouble finding our way around, but this was an unusual challenge with different buildings, outdoor spaces, a lake, etc. They require you to take a preset route through the permanent art exhibit, which seemed unnecessarily rigid to me. I was much more interested in the more recent art and did not know if I had time to see everything. Yet I HAD to start in the ancient art area and go from there. I hope they make accommodation for the handicapped who might have trouble getting to the parts they are most interested in, if they are required to take the preset route."

I personally am not a huge fan of either so was a bit disappointed but it certainly wasn't the fault of the museum. There were also some great paintings and a few early pieces that I very much enjoyed.The cafeteria was very nice, with both indoor and outdoor tables, and both a meat and vegetarian based \"daily menu,\" along with a good selection of a la carte options.

There are also some European art collections, but it's not very attractive to me. More surprisingly they have Chinese vase and ceramic pieces which are also beautiful and interesting. There are some pieces that are very ancient which is worth looking. It's nice to spend about 1 and a half-2 hours time there. Although the disappointing thing is that the shop of the museum does not feature a lot of stuff, bought some folders but lack of choice, when there are so many beautiful pieces, the inspiration of different products should be limitless, it's disappointing to see there's not at many things as I would expect to buy.

The photos literally punches one in the face to wake up and take action.

This private collection belonging to Calouste Gulbenkian was originally housed in his private home in Paris. He was drawn five specific areas of collecting 1.Oriental and Classical Antiquary. 2.Eastern Islamic Art. 3.Armenian Art. 4.Far Eastern Art. 5.European Art, including a spectacular collection of works by Rene Lalique .The museum was built specifically to house the entire collection and although it is already 60 years old , the building complex has a timeless understated elegance about it. Internally, the relatively low ceilings cause the viewer to have a more intimate relationship with each of the objects. On the day I visitedthere were not many people in the museum and the one disappointment I had was that no English auto guides were available as they were sold out!Every object in each of the fields of the collection are superb quality. My own favourites were the the Lalique collection, the Alabaster low-relief from Assyria and the Mirror of Venus by Sir Edward Burne-Jones.Good quality food in the self service restaurant/ bar."

Every piece is the best example of its genre, whether that genre be Iznik tile or 18th century sculpture or whatever your favorite genre from the world of art and textiles might be.And it's not as if he focused on a few areas of art - he really covered everything. Just a stunning collection. And such a wonderful setting for this collection - not just the peaceful museum building, but the grounds of the entire Gulbenkian Foundation surrounding the museum.The one drawback is the location of the museum is a bit remote. Not knowing the neighborhood, when we exited the closest Metro stop, we turned in the wrong direction. The result: it took us an hour to get there from downtown Lisbon, when it should have only taken a half hour. Oh well - my bad. But this does deserve to be at the center of Lisbon cultural institutions, rather than on the periphery."

This is a museum collected over a fairly short time so there is no 'padding' as often happens with museums that just seem to put everything out. He seems to have missed out a bit on the impressionists, but everything else is superb. The museum has something of the personal atmosphere of the Wallace or the Frick museums but not the charm of their buildings because the Gulbenkian is housed in a rather austere purpose-built building.Moreover all the support systems work. The cafe is of the standard one appreciates after a morning admiring artefacts, the gift shop has imaginative 'stuff' and there is an enticing programme of free concerts."

We know that oilman Gulbenkian was immensely wealthy - but did he personally choose the artefacts, or did he employ others to 'have taste' on his behalf? Whatever - we can be grateful for the opportunity to see a mini New York Met, British Museum or Louvre - with many ancient Egyptian pieces (including some statues in which we can devine the characters of some leaders); a wonderful Greek urn; silks and tapestries from Syria, India and elsewhere; some beautiful illuminated manuscripts; and paintings from the middle ages up to the impressionist period.The question of taste arises since Gulbenkian not only bought so many beautiful pieces, but also shelled out for some hideous Chinese pottery - the dragons are especially awful, and contrast with the subtlety of the japanese pieces nearby - and a large collection of grotesque French (Louis XIV?) furniture - nice marquetry spoiled by OTT gold fittings - \"just because you can do something doesn't mean you ought to do it\".For me, the highlights were two paintings - one a portrait of an old man by Rembrandt, and the other a glorious late Turner (there's also an earlier one, more 'traditional' and much more muted in its colour palette). But who knows - maybe some of you will rave over the Chinese dragons, and diss these paintings.Whatever - go see."

It is not to be missed. The Gulbenkian is situated inside a splendid (free) park, where we made a fast picnic before venturing indoors. Every piece, from a bust of Moliere to a magnificent Jean-Francois Ebe mechanical table, dated 1762 and carved of the finest oak, poplar, lime wood and other exotics, has its own proper place with ample space to view and digest. The collection of works is beautifully curated, and so is the decor. Floors are mahogany-rich, inviting the viewer to linger for hours. Especially striking is the Lalique group as well a tapestry trio from Mantua, Italy, dated 1540, called, \"Children Playing.\" Not only do the children dance, but so do the silver and gold threads woven into the hangings. My one quibble is that the audio player is too superficial for a museum of this quality. Many pieces aren't covered at all, and those that are do not offer sufficient depth or breadth. But this is a minor complaint in what was a paradise of an afternoon."

I've been once with a friend. However this time we took the museum guide. Which enriched our experience with history and questions answered. You can learn more about the man himself with the guide, as well as about the items displayed. There are combinations of furniture, painting, tapestry, china, ornaments, jewellery and so much more, just in the main museum. There are temporary exhibitions and galleries too. However to appreciate all the contents I believe you need a couple of trips. Maybe taking in the the galleries seperate.The coffee shop/restaurant had good lunches and cakes. With stairs and a lift going down. Reasonable prices, with beautiful outside setting set in the gardens. These gardens are well worth a wonder too if you have the time. The gift shop is ok. The staff are pleasant. I would defiantly return for a third visit."

If, in the Hereafter wherever I may be, I am permitted a day\u2019s return to Planet Earth to visit one natural and one cultural wonder, at this late point in my life the choice would be the Iguassu Falls and the Gulbenkian. The reason for the latter choice includes its moderate size, allowing the whole collection to be seen in 3 hours. The range of art displayed is universal in origin and comprehensive in subject. The Asian collection, headed by Turkey and Persia, is the most abundantly impressive ---- including carpets, pottery, calligraphy, and paintings ---- and the pinnacle of quality. China, Japan, and former Asian-Russian Republics are also well represented. The European collection begins with the most exquisite miniature wood and ivory carvings, glowingly colourful illuminated manuscripts, silver and gold reliquaries, moving on to paintings from the Italian, Dutch, Flemish and English schools of which every one is a masterpiece, especially works by Hals, Rembrandt, Rubens and Van Dycke, that must be included among the 3 greatest canvasses of each of these giants. The French paintings are the most numerous, and the most spotty with regards to quality. Some fine Impressionist canvasses from the likes of Degas, Manet and Monet are on display, but there are whole walls of Daubigny, Corot, and Theodore Rousseau that ----while charming and well crafted ---- cannot match the caliber of the Non-French exhibits. But France does emerge triumphant with a stunning array of sculptures ( most of them marbles, rather than bronzes that however good are found in dozens of museums as copies) from Carpeaux, Houdon, and of course the great Rodin ----- easily the best of his work that I have seen outside of the eponymous museums in Paris and Philadelphia. The collection of furniture, clocks, and tapestries around which the paintings circle, is 90% French and utterly overwhelming in the artistry and majesty of each item. And to crown it all, at the very end, a large room displaying the greatest jewelry and ornaments I have seen ------- a collection of 80 items by Lalique that blew me away so utterly that I risked a late divorce by purchasing a book illustrating all 80 items, thereby breaking the most adamant prohibition with which my wife (who was not so impressed) has ever bound me.I crept back the next day to spend my last 90 minutes before catching my plane out of Lisbon with these newly acquired friends. For the rest of my days, I will not forget them. Nearby is a Museum of Contemporary Art, also under the aegis of the Gulbenkian Foundation that I cannot recommend. The Permanent Collection is trivial, and most of the space is taken up with Temporary Exhibitions confirming that Adolph Hitler may have been right in his assessment of Contemporary Art, for which he was able to find a Final Solution."

Easiest way to get to it is metro (parca di espania)"

The collection is partly awesome and partly a bit boring. It depends on your personal preferences of course, but for me the vast collection of carpets took too much space and time.

So I went to this museum on a saturday morning. the gulbenkian collection apparently was gathered by a very wealthy guy who owned some oil in the middle east so it was a bit like going into his house and looking at some fabulous stuff he collected all over the world. im not particularly into antiques so i wandered around this bit quickly and went into the modern art building for lunch. lunch at the museum cafe is very affordable but usually you get a long queue if you go there after 1pm. I prefer this part of the museum because it's spacious and you don't get into people's way (or the other way round) when appreciating art. The main exhibition is on J\u00falio dos Reis Pereira's paintings and they are lovely. The temporary section now is on Afghanistan and it features an interesting short film in the theatre. Most of the books they sell in the museum shop are Portuguese though. Outside the museum it is a small park where you see young families running around with their kids or couples cuddling looking at the duck pond. Nice place to chill if you are not in a hurry. If you could, try to go there on a Sunday because it's free admission."

For a small fee, you are able to see a varied collection, from Ancient Egypt to Modern pictures. It should also be noted that the Museum is surrounded by beautiful gardens, which are lovely for a sunny afternoon - and the children will love them, because there are usually ducks to be found! Very romantic, as well!"

This is a great museum which exhibits the collection of Calouste Gulbenkian enhanced with additional items bought by the museum afterwards. Rich collection of oriental art as well as paintings! Paintings are remarkably beautiful (pieces from Rembrandt, Peter Paul Rubens, Gainsborough, Corot, Monet, Renoir etc).Although I am not a fan of Chinese art, I was FASCINATED by the pieces exhibited (beautiful vases and other objects). It is amazing the fact that museum exhibits a variety of ojects and is not focused only on one kind of art. There are from textiles to tiles, from domestic objects to statues, clothes, coins etc! Very important and unique collection by Rene Lalique (mainly jewellery) is also exhibited in a separate room. If you get an audio guide is very useful (at least the one in English language that I used provided short, to the point and not tiring long descriptions on the objects). After the visit you can rest and have coffee and sweets outside at the beautiful veranda of the museum cafeteria! The only thing I would maybe suggest is to enhance the objects for sale at the bookshop. There are mainly books and very few other little things. By selling more things would also bring more money to the foundation.I wouldn't hesitate to visit the museum for a second time! A must when in Lisbon in my opinion."

The collection itself is all in one or two big rooms, the only smaller room being for the jewellery at the end. The artefacts themselves range from old Greek coins, to a few things from an Egyptian tomb or two, a few large Persian rugs, Chinese vases, etc. There are a few examples of each but nothing on the scale of e.g. the British Museum in London. The link between the displays is rather tenuous. I expect this proves that the Portuguese plundering from other cultures was quite subdued compared to the other colonialists. The most interesting bits for me were the 18-19th century serving vessels made from silver and the jewellery at the end. There is English information which is better than museums in some other countries so at least you don't have to be a native to read some of the interesting facts .A plus was there is an art gallery near adjoining so you can do both. The restaurant downstairs is great though for salads and hot meals at a reasonable price. It was full around 2pm on a Sunday. All in all made a good Afternoon."

We'd probably have stayed for an hour longer if the children were not with us. I've mentioned what we saw as the highlights based on personal taste, but there are other collections too. The cafe was not so good. We were encouraged by my Rough Guide which suggested that it had good vegetarian options and also by the very long queue. The menu boasted a range of different cuisines but the food was not good. There were under-cooked roast potatoes and our three boys had various different pasta dishes, none of which were enjoyed, so the half hour of queuing was not worth it! We should have gone elsewhere to eat - there are several restaurants and cafes in the surrounding streets, or a quick metro ride takes you straight back into town."

It is the collection Caloutse Gulbenkian who spent 4 decades collecting according to his own tastes so it covers a wide range but only the best. Items span the classical, oriental European art and twentieth century. The pieces from Egypt all though small is size are wonderful (and frankly rivaling what we saw in the Cairo museum as far as quality!).If you go, be sure to notice that there are large black and white posters of Gulbenkian's Parisian home that show the pieces as he had them displayed. We were with a tour and many people failed to even look at the posters. A real mistake as they provide an extra depth and contest to his collection and should not be missed."

I have a small notebook and write down the name of the art, the name of the artist, and the year it was created.I enjoyed the Chinese porcelain and the porcelain and tile from Iznik, Turkey.

The place is a bit hard to find: apparently they believe that \"everyone knows where they are.\" A better-organized pointer could have saved us an unnecessary half-mile trip round the rear fence.However, the weather was good, so we did not really suffer the extra walk too much. And what we found inside was a fair compensation. The collector - \"Mr 5 per cent\" as he was nicknamed - had both the money and the good taste for art. Well worth the symbolic 4-euro ticket price. Highly recommended. Photos permitted, just turn the flash off."

The modern building also takes advantage of the park like setting with occasional windows looking out onto the grounds. The permanent displays are interspersed with placards showing how the items were originally displayed in Gulbenkian\u2019s home in Paris before he exiled to Lisbon. The museum reflects Gulbenkian\u2019s collecting tastes, rather than professional curators, such as rooms of French furniture & table silver that could have been at Versaillles and a room of paintings of Venice by Guiladi. You can quickly walk through the museum in a hour, or take your time to linger over the perfect treasures."

My favorite sections are the first ones, taking in Egyptian, Mesopotamian, Armenian art, etc. The Middle Eastern collections are followed by a Far Eastern collection, then European art. I would call the museum compact rather than small. The collections are first-rate. There are very nice gardens for strolling as well. Best of all, Sundays are free."

This is a real must-see, especially the paintings (Rembrandts, Renoirs, Monets etc) which just hang there, with what appeared to be minimum security. The museum is also free admission on Sundays, which came as a pleasant surprise although the entrance fee is definitely worth it. Compared to queing for hours to get a small glimpse of the Mona Lisa or similar, this is a really accessible way to get close to some fantastic art pieces."

There's also a pleasant garden where to have lunch or just a coff\u00e9e.In any case, worth a visit if you're staying in Lisbon more than 3 days."

His collection of French Impressionists is not large but of excellent quality. And of course you do not want to miss the Lalique collection, nor the statue of Diana which he bought and brought over from the Heritage Museum.

More highlights include Houdon's Diana sculpture, Fran\u00e7ois-Thomas Germain silver once used by Catherine the Great, and a unique collection of Ren\u00e9 Lalique jewelry. Next to the museum is the Modern Art Centre with a collection of Portuguese and international art, including works by Paula Rego, Antony Gormley, and David Hockney. Closed on mondays free on sundays."

We went to the Calouste Gulbenkianmuseum on a Sunday afternoon and enjoyed the collection greatly (even more so because admission is free on Sunday :-) It was amazing to see all the treasures amassed by one individual (albeit one who owned 5% of some oil companies and was very wealthy because of that -- says that they called him the \"5% man\"). The collection seems to include everything from ancient coins, statues, furniture, paintings galore, ceramics, ancient books, and so on. You can see the essentials in an afternoon. To get to the museum, take the Blue line metro from Restauradores (near Rossio) to Sao Sebastiao station, then walk straight ahead to the next big road and turn left for a short walk to the museum."

Even if you don't care much about art, you should probably still visit this museum. It represents a very broad spectrum of oriental, as well as European art and doesn't overwhelm you with the size of its collection. Every single item, be it a vase, a coin, or a painting is a marvel to look at."

What one must appreciate is this is one man's personal art collection which was bequeathed to Lisbon on his death.(Portugal had given him a home and nationality)Bearing this in mind it is a pleasant way to spend half a day ....soak up the pleasure the collection must have given him, and envy his taste and culture compared with that of more modern multi-millionaires."

As such, the collection is eclectic and visitors will no doubt identify items they prefer. Nevertheless, it is one of the world's finest private art collections. The Persian items were of particular interest to me, plus some magnificent paintings. If you don't like fine art, don't bother visiting. If you do, it is absolutely unmissable. Easy to reach by Metro.The building was constructed in the 1960s and is starting to be historic in its own right. Architecturally, I think it's one of the finest buildings of its era (although not everyone will share this view!) The gardens are magnificent and well worth a visit."

What impressed us is that he managed to find some of the best examples of each type of artifact or art piece. The museum houses Egyptian, Greco-Roman, Eastern Islamic artifacts along with paintings and furnishings. We also liked how the collection was displayed. Great use of space and light. Unlike most museums this one can be enjoyed because everything (for the most part) is on one level. You don't have museum feet when you are done touring it! The entrance fee is more than reasonable. I can't wait to see it again. (P.S. I also liked that the museum included graphic images from the collector's former home - these allowed you to see how he had showcased the items in his home before donating them to the museum after his death)."

There was a Gainsborough, a few Monets, Manet, John Sargent Singer and Renoir. If you have been to museums in Paris, Madrid, New York, Minneapolis and other large cities in the U.S. you will be very disappointed.

There are Flemish panels, Italian Old Masters, a magnificent Rembrandt, a great Rubens, some Impressionist paintings, a sculpture by Rodin... Mr. Gulbenkian certainly had exquisite taste, and his collection of Art Nouveau designer Rene Lalique's vases and jewelry is unique, and worth going to the Museum just to see this room, at the end of the gallery just before the exit door.

You have to see it and then be amazed, because almost every item is a gem.It is also impressive that the collection does not only contain paintings or tapestries or gold watches, but all kinds of art objects: paintings, vases, sculptures, furniture - you name it.What I remember the best were the Chinese vases, because normally I am not too fond of Chinese art, but these vases were simply beautiful, I could not help admire them - I would really like to go see them once again next time."

(which it is every Sunday)Since the contents of the museum are all from a single, private collection, I feel like you really get a unique assortment of paintings, furniture and artifacts. This wasn't a hand-picked selection for a particular exhibit or theme, it was the collected works of a man so rich he probably could have up and simply bought Portugal back in the day.To me, the early rooms are a miss - Egyptian artifacts and Persian rugs - but the later rooms with the furniture are simply outstanding. Specifically the clocks - the design and variety of ancient timepieces was at times stunning. To visualize them in their original setting, doubly so. The collection also boasts a few Monets, a Renoir and Degas. All excellent.If you're peckish, the downstairs cafeteria is actually quite good, and the prices are very cheap. Two people can eat a full lunch for 10-15 euros."

The variety and quality of rare objects showed what an obsessive collector Gulbenkian was. He had the resources to collect museum quality pieces from so many countries including China . ( foo dogs) We spent 2 -3 hours visiting all of the rooms including the temporary exhibit of early 1900's artists. Their timeline of fashion world events and art was illuminating. One of the best museums in the world."

Also a large collection of Louis XIV furniture. Everything is very well-presented. However, it understandably pales in comparison to the Louvre, Prado or Met.This museum does not have much of a Portuguese flavour, and if that is what you seek and you don't have much time (< 3 days), skip this in favour of the old neighbourhoods (Alfama, Bairro Alto, Chiado, Baixa), Belem, and Sintra. A good rainy-day option, though."

I went into the normal museum part (not the modern art or temporary exhibits etc) and loved everything from the Egyptian mummy masks right up to the Persian mats!Nowhere near as big as the MoMA in NYC, but still a little gem worth checking out. I think I was in there for a couple of hours (at a slow pace). Do visit the onsite caf\u00e9, it's not badly priced and the portions are big.The only thing that annoyed me was the security. They were literally in every CORNER of the room. I can understand the need for security in a place like this, but it was just annoying to have them constantly follow you about and watch you like hawks. There's a small 'open plan' shop downstairs (probably a few square metres) and the guy was practically following me around there too! It annoyed me, so I left without buying anything (it was pricey anyway).I never saw this much security even in the MoMA. They're even scattered all over the gardens and in the entrances, watching you as you leave! As I say, I understand their need, but I don't like to be intimidated by them."

First you have the Museum with Oriental and Classical Art, galleries of Egyptian Art, Greco-Roman, Mesopotamian, Eastern Islamic, Armenian, Far East and Renaissance. An amazing collection!After that you have the Modern Art Center, with more than 9000 artworks from XX and XXI center.You can also visit, for free, the garden of the Foundation. Beautiful, with a lake and very peaceful. Can't miss."

Besides we also took tickets for 2 contemporain exhibitions that also told us something about what is going on in Potugiese culture right now, which where right down my ally. All in all fantastic.

The relatively small scale of the museum is also one thing I like about it. In larger musea, like the British Museum or the Louvre, you feel a bit overwhelmed by all the art, and because of the large quantity over there, you're not able to appreciate the collection as much as you can in the Gulbenkian.There are works from the greatest painters in the world, as well as a very interesting historic collection ranging from ancient egypt to japan.Especially on hot summer days (but of course also in colder seasons), this museum offers a magnificent retreat from the heat."

So it happened.Calouste Gulbenkian is an excelent top art museum, in small package. Renoir, Corot, Rubens, Monet, Manet, Degas... This in regart to paintings.Then comes other form of art as ancient books, fabrics, coins, jewels, far east, greece, rome, egypt, persia... Even the most \"I don't care\" teen will like something here. Not to mention those art lovers.Personnel is very kind and helpful as it is usual in Lisbon, and the surroundings are beautiful. We were on vacation so it was a tuesday and there was very few people, so we could enjoy each piece we wanted.Not remotely as big as the NYC Metropolitan or Louvre, It's a small jewel you will not regret to visit."

One modern w/ permanent and temporary exhibits that can be challenging to appreciate. The other building has classic very fine antiquities, vases, jewelry, from Old Kingdom Egypt, Mesopotamian, Armenian, India, some Japan and China vases, several fabulous Asian carpets (on the floor), and mostly French paintings (and furniture) up to Monet and Manet. Gainsborough's Little boy blue is there. A wall of Corots. The collection is spotty or focused but the quality is excellent. Cafeteria is OK but has a great glass wall to an outdoor patio. we spent a rewarding 3 hours there to see everything."

            "review": "Surprises at the Gulbenkian. Whoever has written up the standard description of the Gulbenkian Museum in most tourism guides, has omitted to mention two of the most stunning components of its collection. All guidebooks mention the basic collection: a non-European collection that features Egyptian, Middle Eastern and Asian pieces, which vary considerably in interest and quality, and a Western collection that is surprisingly good as it includes such artists as Turner, Manet, Monet, Degas, Frans Hals, and Gainsborough. However, to most visitors' surprise, because none of the guidebooks mention it -- this collection also contains two Preraphaelite paintings by the genius Burne-Jones: \"The Mirror of Venus\" (1875) and \"The Bath of Venus\". \"The Mirror of Venus\" is riveting, and drew more spell-bound viewers than almost any other painting the day I visited. The second show-topper that is only at times included in the museum's write-ups is the Lalique Gallery, which again, draws crowds. This is the finest collection of Lalique I have seen anywhere and the full-length mirror entwined by two serpents is a show-stopper.If you have been to the British Museum and the Louvre, I think you could comfortably miss visiting the Gulbenkian, unless you have a special fondness for Preraphaelite art (as I do), or such masters as Turner and Gainsborough, or Lalique, in which case you must not miss this museum. The museum building itself is first-rate, very modern with very nice clean lines and large windows overlooking a perfect green, park setting.Visit on a Sunday, when the museum, like most museums in Lisbon, plus any special exhibitions they might be showcasing, are free to all visitors."

We started out in the park, then went to the museum.The park is very pretty and relaxing, great for taking a load off after a lot of walking. There's a small amphitheatre, a small pond with ducks, and some funny and interesting scuplture. The Corte Ingles department store is just down the street, which includes a full grocery store, so pick up some picnic supplies there and have a pleasant lunch in the park.The museum itself is just lovely--it runs the gamut from painting to tapestries to furniture to clocks, and it has contributions from many parts of the world, both ancient and modern. They're not uptight about letting visitors take photos, either (though of course it's polite not to use flash). It was smallish--better described as a large gallery than a museum, so very doable in a few hours."

Some attendants ask for identification, others just give you a free ticket if you say 'teacher' or 'student'.
