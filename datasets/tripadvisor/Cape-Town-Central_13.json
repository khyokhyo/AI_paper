My only advice here is to avoid public holidays or Sundays as it gets crowded, and to be careful when crossing the traffic if you are approaching from the Capetown CBD as the turnoff is awkward with traffic coming up a semi-blind rise. If you enjoy walking, there are many footpaths leading from here. As always, never leave anything interesting looking in your vehicle."

The indigenous fynbos grows along the road and this biome is endemic to South Africa and has spectacular flowers.Halfway up, you can pull over and have an awesome view over Cape Town city and off course, the one and only Table mountain. At the top of the hill, you can have a picnic under a tree, or walk around to see the fynbos close up. From here you can see Table bay, Robben island and spectacular sunsets.Paragliding is also done from Signal hill. For a tandem glide with video and photos included cost R1400 Oct 2016. You end the glide at Seapoint on the beach."

It is a relaxing way of spending time with family and friends. An added benefit is you could watch the paragliders take off or join in this adrenaline inducing sport."

Trailhead is a little difficult to find (starts directly opposite from Lion's Head) but absolutely recommend."

Table Mountain is over 1000m elevation, Signal Hill is probably about 300m so its a poor facsimile. But you can drive up there (parking may be a problem) have a look at the view, and then drive down again.Dont go there late evening or at night, it is a popular mugging spot!"

            "review": "Organised chaos?. Signal Hill is immediately adjacent to Table Mountain, and from afar is rounded with a few tall trees. It is a favourite place with the locals , especially at the weekend, to picnic and view the sunset. Parking is VERY limited, so a lot of drivers park at the edge of the hillside, alongside the sheer drop, and walk the rest of the way. This means that the narrow road, which can just about take two coaches coming in opposite direction on a good day, totally struggle when there is parking all along one side. So we whizz up the hill in the coach, see the sun beginning to come down, then come to a halt. Stalemate! We completed the journey on foot, and the jam took some considerable time to sort out.The views were fantastic, and the sunset whilst not the best ever that evening, was worth the trip.Tip: Sunday evening is manic. Go early with a picnic. Chill. Wait for the mad rush to go back down to the city, or maybe use the hop on hop off bus service, so you don't even have to worry about parking."

The start of the trail is a bit hard to find but once you get going it is well marked and maintained. The walk to the top winds along way towards Lion Head and then snaps back the other way to the top of Signal Hill. You get great views of Bantry and Camps Bay. We walked down to the small park where the noon gun goes off and and then continued down to Bo Kaap. The walk to the top takes about 90 minutes. We didn't see many people on the trail so take normal precautions but had no issues.Easy walk .. not too demanding."

The Signal Hill is a perfect place to picnic. Non-hikers can come up to the main parking lot with one of the trail-heads via taxi or rental car and still enjoy the views and nature. Any able-body person should hike at least the length of the Signal Hill so called \"Lion's Flank\"; the views of the city and surroundings and the opportunity to see the unique flora - the endangered Peninsula Shale Renosterveld vegetation - are very,very rewarding. Signal Hill has a few kramats which are graves of Muslim missionaries and religious leaders. Some tourists and Captonians alike come here at dawn to see reportedly legendary sunrises and sunsets.At the parking lot on Signal Hill there was a park ranger from Table Mountain National Park -friendly and ready to help if needed. The parking lot also features bathrooms and what looked like little booth but the latter was closed."

Take along a picnic basket and enjoy the clean and natural surroundings. Blissful to watch the sunset, The view of Cape Town is awesome. Only to be wary of your safety at all times.

Have not been up for a while as traffic can be a bit of a nightmare but it is surely one of the best free excursions you can do around Cape Town. The view on a clear day is magnificent both of Table Mountain and Table Bay. Views over Robben Island and on to the Hottentots Mountains in the distance. If you are a first time visitor to the Cape do not miss it. The view is great at night also so try an come as the sun goes down. Best of all it is free.For the energetic there are also many hikes but that is another story."

I love sunsets and watching the sun fade and the city lights emerging was just amazing. The views of Cape Town, Robben Island and Table Mountain were spectacular. It was quite busy when I visited but there was plenty of space for everybody so it didn't feel too crowded. I wasn't sure how long I'd be up there so I took some food I'd bought when visiting the Old Biscuit Mill during the morning.This was a lovely, well-organised trip and I have some amazing photographs."

One evening after dinner we grabbed a cab and had him drive us up to Signal Hill. It was a clear night and there were quite a few people up at the top enjoying the city lights and stars. It was the first time I had ever seen the Southern Cross! It felt quite safe in the little park at the top and there seemed to be just enough people around with out feeling crowded or alone. The whole trip was about 100R ($30CDN) and took about 45 minutes. Well worth the time and money."

When the weather is good there are spectacular 360 degree views, including Cape Town city, the harbour, Table mountain, Robbin Island and Lion's Head. There is a particular photo point to allow a great shot of the Table Mountain as a back drop. These views are amazing and give a great experience if you can't manage to get up Table Mountain (also it's free!). Winding your way through the free roaming Guinea fowl, you will find yourself on a precipice watching people hook up to their chute and run off the edge 'Go-proing' their way to the coast below with must be an incredible and exhilarating ride.This is definitely an experience for all the family.

This is NOT advisable around Cape Town and walkers are strongly recommended to join a group of at least six people. It is possible for most of the time to walk alone and not be attacked by muggers, but it does happen so why take the chance. Local newspapers often report attacks in the hills and forests and on lonely beaches with pangas, knives, handguns and rocks, causing very serious injury and even deaths, quite apart from loss of valuables. Be warned. So I walked one afternoon and evening with Iain's group, starting at the foot of Table Mountain, going around Signal Hill and Lion's Head, watching the sun set over the ocean and giving the legs a good stretch. It was not a difficult walk - for those, go with a group like the Meridian Club. But do wear good footwear, as some of the paths are uneven. It took about five hours. Try not to tread on any snakes, but there is less risk with this in large groups, as the snakes tend to get out of the way fairly smartish. Let the one of the guides go first! In our group of about 15, there was one guide at the front and one at the back. We arrived back at the car park at bit later than I expected - but only ten minutes or so - and it was quite dark by then, so take a torch; One with a red filter or infrared option is best. Have some warm clothing - hills are chilly at night - and take some grub. Water of course is always essential and the South African climate can be very deceptive if you are not used to it. Take sun block SPF 30 as a minimum - this is a must. Listen to the guide's advice and ask if unsure. Iain is very informative, the walk was immensely enjoyable and an excellent introduction to the sights and beauty of Cape Town. A bit far for small children, even if you carry them, but fine for all other age groups with a reasonable level of fitness."

It was sunny and warm, and conditions were perfect for tandem paragliding. Unfortunately, our schedule didn't allow time for the adventurous amongst us to have a go!"

Then walk across to view the full moon rising over Cape Town as the City's lights appear. This is also the starting point for a couple of hiking trails.

And we had an experience and a half, as our tour bus tried to get down from the mountain when there were people and cars everywhere...which made what should have been a short trip very slow to get started.

This is always a good bet when the Table Mountain cableway is not running or the queues are too long (or you don't want to pay to get a view!).An easy drive up, free parking and superb views. It is well worth walking a few hundred metres out the back of the parking area, through the trees towards the mast, for the best views back over the city and TM."

As we was hoping to have hiked up and arrive in time for the sunset.It is a very popular spot for sunsets and would be a lot better for the sunrise as there would be less people. Got to the hill around 3.30pm and just wondered around the area, the views was amazing and it was just relaxing just chilling up there.There was a wedding at the hill- which was nice to have witnessed. It is definitely a romantic spot, where people have picnics, champagne, dinner up there.Would love to have hiked up this hill, the views are fantastic and the sunset wasn't that great unfortunately due to the clouds being in the way- but still good."

Take the tourist bus to avoid parking and traffic troubles or walk (for the adventurous - remember, it's a hill). Take a couple of blankets, a bottle of wine, your favourite snacks and make your way up.

If you enjoy the outdoors and wonderful views, then Signal Hill should be on your bucket list.There is a trail that starts on the right side of the house at the base of the trail to Lion's Head. You can follow that trail through beautiful fynbos and other Captonian flora. During this time of the year there are flowers blooming as far as the eye can see! It is a magnificent sight and such a surprise as you reach the top of the hill - you are then greeted by the friendly faces of the hill's ecosystem.It is important to take along water, a hat and sunscreen. The South African sun can be harsh on our skin - even in winter. For additional safety I would suggest that you also take a flashlight and a warm top/jersey.Enjoy the astounding views from the different angles of Signal Hill!"

This review is a little biased because I'm of the fortunate citizens of Cape Town \u263a Signal Hill is spectacularly beautiful on a warm evening with clear skies. Bring your picnic basket, lie on the grass and watch the sun go down, hiding itself behind an ocean of blue. There are nice walks (hiking) and the paths are also used for trail running. Younger kids should be cautious as they could get hurt. It can get busy so you'll need to find parking. But of course, car guards are everywhere (even up on the hill).A visit to the Cape is not complete without a sunset on the Hill."

As it turned out, it was cold, overcast and windy. There was a setting sun, but it was so shrouded in cloud that most of us sat inside the bus. So it's not recommended on such days. That said, the views of Cape Town as you drive up/down the windy road to Signal Hill are fantastic -- I probably got better photos here than from the top of Table Mountain. And, on a clear day, I'm sure you'd get amazing views from the top of Signal Hill too."

It just didn't feel so romantic up on a mountain with winding roads, no side barriers and a head filled with a whole lot of stories of those who drove off or fell off this hill.

Make sure you book in advance with one of the tandem paragliding companies.This hill is used as a takeoff point for para-gliders. All you need to do is be prepared for a couple of hours before you start flying over the city and ultimately over the ocean.Also ideal for sunset views. A drive down the signal hill towards camps bay and beach road has some amazing sea front restaurants. WORTH IT"

As you leave the Battery and look across to the other side of the \u2018hill\u2019 you can see the iconic Lions Head, which is very striking and worth viewing!If you do get a chance to visit Signal Hill then aim to visit around 13:00 so you can hear the cannon being fired at extraterrestrial invaders! Only joking! The Battery was introduced for protection during old wars and also as a weather warning station, provide mooring instructions to ships and to warn the people of Cape Town of ship\u2019s that are in a spot of bother and of those that may well crash into the harbour area.In any case, a chance to get a good vantage point for seeing most of Cape Town makes it a worthwhile venture!"

What's great about Signal Hill is that you can drive there in 5 minutes from downtown, drive to the very top, and for free, enjoy your sundowners or just enjoys the views. It's incredible when the sun is going down over the ocean, and from different points along the drive up there you can see the entire city of cape town, and across to table mountain. I like looking down on Sea Point and the beach below, at Robben Island in the distance, at the big tankers waiting for clearance to come into the sea port. You can also watch the paraglider take off, or go paragliding yourself with one of the many companies that take off from here. Great, short, free visit."

We have been a taken pictures of us in front of Table Mountain and pictures of the 12 Apostles and Robben Island and the city of Cape Town.My girlfriend is much braver than me and also went for a tandem paragliding ride off of Signal Hill and down into Sea Point. This is not a cheap experience (approx R1100) but for the adventurous it is a tick in the box and great fun.This is another place to chill out relax with a food, or a nice cream or just coffee.

It however should not be used for drifting and drag racing -- especially in areas where there are no guardrails.A haven for bikers and joggers, the ascent (and/or descent) from signal hill is a good exercise for many and will be one pleasant and memorable experience."

It might not look like much if you are down but once you are up the view is so much better than you expected.

We have been here many times and in some ways, it is better if the sea mist/fog has come in. When we drove up this time, there was extensive but shallow sea mist that did not really extend beyond the ocean making for some spectacular views. Well worth the very short and easy drive from the city."

Half way up the slope I knew that this hill is not for those of us who find a more than 5 km stroll a bi taxing.

Parking is however a problem especially during summer where you may be forced to park then walk a few metres to the top.From there you have a view of the Table Mountain, Lion's Head, City Centre and the atlantic ocean. The sun sets into the ocean so it makes for spectacular sunsets as well.I'd recommend this place if you like taking photos because you can photograph all key features of cape Town from here. There is no entry fee or closing time so you can hang out here all day and night."

If you walk around and definitely on the drive up and down, it will give you a full 360 degrees views. This is especially true if the Table Mountain is fog covered or inaccessible because of strong winds, and if the weather or your physical fitness do not allow you to climb to the Lion's Head. Signal Hill is accessible to everyone and at any time during the day. Obviously visit it when it's not covered by mist and fog as well. We arrived on a much expected rainy day, after some terribly hot days which brought serious fires in the area. So Signal Hill was also with zero visuality and literally empty. No one was there. But then we continues to beautiful Hout Bay and returned towards the sunset. By that time the weather has changed dramatically, and dozens of people (mostly couples) were there to await another fantastic sunset, with amazing views."

We also enjoyed the views of Table Mountain, Downtown and the V&A Waterfront on the drive to the top. Just a few tips if you plan on going to Signal hill at sunset; it gets very crowded and there isn\u2019t much parking so get there early so you don\u2019t miss the sunset trying to figure out where to park. Many people ended up parking on the side of the narrow road and had to walk a long way to the top so if you get there late you may not be able to get to the viewpoint before the sunset. Also be patient when you are ready to leave because the road will only have one lane open due to the cars parked on the side of the road. Traffic was pretty much at a stand still until the cars could zig zag around each other. But even with the traffic jam it was worth all trouble to view the sunset."

In January we took our daughter and son in law on the wonderful night tour, akk around the Peninsula and finally arrived at the top of signal hill. The views were stunning and, we enjoyed a wonderful picnic. If you want the tour company to provide a picnic hamper for you, it also looked nice and was ready and waiting for them when they arrived at the top. we stayed for about an hour to watch the sun set, and the best surprise of all was that there was lovely hot coffee available, as it does get quite chilly once the sun has set. Overall a wonderful evening, and really very reasonable - only R100 a head is really worth it, the entire trip lasts just under 3 hours so its money well worth it."

If you prefer to hike to the summit in the comfort of their car, this is an ideal sunset drive. Take a picnic basket and make sure to reach the top well before sunset. I will recommend an arrival time on the top of approximately 7:15PM as it gets really busy. You might get stuck in traffic to the top and miss the sunset completely. Don't forget your camera / iPhone as you would want to capture that breath-taking sunset. Stay a while after the sun set completely behind the horizon and watch the sky turn to beautifull pastel blue and pink. How to get there: Drive up Buitengracht road towards the mountain, which becomes Kloof Nek Road. On the top of the hill turn right into Signal Hill road. Drive further up the hill. There are many lookout points with the main Signal Hill lookout point. What you will see: The hill offers great views across the City Table Bay. It\u2019s a truly magnificent spot to sit peacefully and take it all in. Please note to leave sufficient time to drive down as traffic is always at a stand still. Find something fun to do while being stuck in the traffic down hill."

The climbers then really appreciated the view of the 12 disciples caught in the afternoon sunlight.

Signal Hill Road is quite a scenic drive and there is a large car park at the end with toilet facilities. Stop along the road to photograph Table Mountain; this is a perfect view of the mountain itself. At the car park there were cold drink and ice cream vendors [December] plus para-gliders launching from this vantage point.After your visit drive from Signal Hill Road along Kloof Road toward Clifton Beach; the narrow road takes you through the thick tree vegetation at the base of Table Mountain and Lion's Head."

There is nothing really special enough including its outlook to warrant a visit in that table Mountain is right next and offer many things which are just unavailable on Signal Hill. As I was there as part of the itinerary of a packaged tour group, I found that the tour leader's saying looked correct. His saying is that if the weather is so poor that taking the cable car to go up Table Mountain is impossible for suspension of service, a Signal Hill tour will be offered. If you do happn to be on Table Mountain for the things it offers, there will be little point of visiting the neighbouring Signal Hill. Table Mountain offers much better views from the height as a matter of obvious fact."

The narrow road up was packed with cars, so come early, or come later. The traffic jam was dead stop, in my opinion, because some drivers wanted to park precariously on the edge of the road.

This is a great option if you don\u2019t have the patience to fight the thousands of people waiting to take the cable car to Table Mountain. Signal Hill offers an amazing view of Cape Town, the waterfront and the mountains. Parking is limited so you may have to be creative, but coming here on a nice day will give you some of the best pictures of the city available.

Go early, be prepared to park a distance away and walk the rest of the way up as trying to find a spot in the parking area is a nightmare. Pack a blanket, some drinks and snacks, and find a spot to watch the sun set and after that take a walk to the other side and wait for the Sun Star to switch on.

People usually take panoramic pictures of Cape Town from Table Mountain, but it is even better from Signal Hill (you get Table Mountain IN your shot). No entry fee, just drive up the road leading there and park in the parking lot. I would recommend going there during the day - the sun is in the right place to illuminate the whole town and the mountain.Lots of people come there in the evening to watch the sunset. I did not find that particularly exciting - just another sunset over the ocean like anywhere else. And parking is VERY hard in the evening - we had to leave the car down the road and walk up to the parking.Make sure to stroll around the place, there are guinea fowls living there and you can usually find these fun pretty birds."

I have rarely seen sunsets such as those over the sea as viewed from the peninsula at the end of Signal Hill.I have a friend Braahm Malherbe who lives in the only house on the ridge of Signal Hill, leased to him by Cape Town City Council.He is the head of the Volunteer Fire Fighters amongst other things, and some years' back completed a run along the Great Wall of China with his chum David Grier, a well-known Cape Town chef.I mention all this because when one goes to the house, the view over the edge from the garden is incredible and vertiginious.Braahm leases the house to film companies for shoots and he is extremely lucky to have the chance to live in such an extraordinary place.tAnother extraordinary building is the tiny shrine a little down the hill from Braahm's house, which may be Muslim, and it is looked after by a resident caretaker. Painted in vivid primary colours it is quite arresting.The view from Signal Hill over the City is stupendous, with Table Mountain to one's right, and Lion's Head to the right of the mountain whilst the port is visible way down past City Bowl."

Note that many people during peak season come to see the sunset so it preferable to leave hour or two before sunset or else you will get caught in traffic. Once you reach the top you can sit back and relax, have some meals with friends and family as there is facilities that cater for this. If it's too windy and you got a car that's light rather avoid as it can be treacherous. When hiring car try to get auto as it will make it easier on the steep inclines. All in all well worth a visit.

In the summer the sunsets are fantastic and occur after 8pm. Even the drive there will take your breath away as you view Cape Town from above, with Table Mountain and the bay to complete the picture. For the budget conscious tourist there is an alternative way to have the views as well. The hop on hop off bus does the route to Table Mountain and passes the entry road to signal hill. By strolling up the hill from the left side it is a totally different perspective and the views are just as good over Campsbay. Well worth a visit for that memorable photos that would make your friends wishing they were there."

While in Cape Town in late June, our guide drove us to Signal Hill where a cannon is fired at exactly 12:00 noon every day - hence the name \"Noon Gun\". Two cannon are used (one as a back-up) with the \"active\" cannon being fired by electronic signal directly from the South African Astronomical Observatory. The Navy staffs the site with a representative traveling from garrison to the Hill each day to prepare the cannon, etc. On the day we visited, the Navy man in charge was in an automobile accident and didn't get to the Hill. However, he was able to call for a replacement who rushed to the site and frantically prepared the cannon to receive the signal from the observatory. The crowd watched with anticipation as the time slipped away. Fortunately the tradition was upheld when the gun was made ready with what turned out to be 12 seconds to spare. What could have been an interesting, albeit routine, event turned out to be really exciting for all those in attendance. So...take a chance and pay a visit to Signal Hill just before noon. Perhaps your visit will be as exciting as ours. Signal Hill provides a very pleasant view over much of the city center and is a close-in and free alternative to going to the top of Table Mountain. Parking at the top is somewhat limited so allow sufficient time to park along the road and walk the final yards to the top."

It can become very chilly in the evenings, and one is quite high up. It is a most breathtaking and lovely experience, and if you are an international visitor, one that you should not miss.

Do pack a picnic - there's lots of space at the top to enjoy a meal while checking out the panoramic view over the ocean, Green Point Stadium, Sea Point Promenade and the new park.

If you would like to go for a picnic, then head to the parking area, find a nicely located spot over-looking the Atlantic Ocean with Robben Island perched below and enjoy the breathtaking vistas. If you find the parking area too full then just before you reach there are a number of smaller stops where you can pull into and enjoy a crowdless picnic. A nice spot is actually by the Kramat which sits hidden away about half-way towards the parking-area.If you are a fitness enthusiast then Signal Hill has no shortage of trails. A favourite is the trail which runs long the ridge of the lion towards Lions Head. A good tip is to go early and not to park your car in the parking lot - it gets very crowded - and makes getting off the hill a time-intensive exercise. Rather park your car just outside the parking area in the direction you will be leaving so that when the sun sets you can just get in and go.Enjoy!!"

The sunset view across the bay, over the city, and toward Table Mountain is stunning. An even better deal is the 2-day bus package for 250Rand which gives you this evening trip plus unlimited use of the hop-a-bus to tour all around the city and the beaches during the day, go to the wineries for tastings, and takes you to the Table Mountain cable car station.

Several hundred meters lower, the Signal Hill is very easy to access, and apparently far less covered by fog and clouds. On weekends, come rather earlier than later, when hundreds of cars block the single road that takes you up there. The views are simply fantastic and most versatile, and it seems that many local residents join the tourists and simply come to look at their city's beautiful beaches, shore suburbs, the harbor and also the inner city. They bring folded chairs and simply set them by the road and enjoy watching the views. In addition you can also join or watch the many parachute gliders who take off from the top of the hill. Beautiful atmosphere, great views, awesome place. And by the way, at some point in the late evening/night, the road closes. Tried to go the there with the car, one last time before heading to the airport, but the road was simply blocked by a police car."

I also believe this is a possible location to paraglide from."

To walk from the city center to the top of the hill is really easy and very pleasant at the same time. I strongly suggest to combine this visit with the one to Lion's Head (it takes about 30-50min from Signal Hill to reach the edge of Lion's Head), so that the hiking would last about 3 hours in total and one can enjoy all best panoramic points over Cape Town in the same day. It would be a great combination!"

The Noon Guns at Signal Hill have been booming out for over two hundred years now, sometimes just announcing the time so that ships in the harbor could synchronize their time pieces, sometimes, in war, or shortly after, the honor the fallen.In the present day, they fire to honor the tradition, and help Cape Towners see how good their Atomic clocks are. A Naval officer makes an excellent prefiring talk, shows how the cannons are loaded the old fashioned way, with a bag of gun powder, tamped down with a wooden rod. Then he steps back, advises people where to stand, and counts down until the cannon fires. He does not pull a cord or press a button to fire the cannon. Interestingly, the cannon receives an electronic signal to fire from the South African Naval Observatory which uses their Atomic Clock to send a signal for the cannon to fire at precisely the right moment. And it does! It is all great fun. Plus the views of Cape Town from Signal Hill are quite striking."

Signal Hill is that little hill about 310m high right next to Cape Town city centre and almost above Bo-Kaap, De Waterkant, Green Point, and Sea Point. It provides excellent views of Table Mountain, the Cape Town city Centre and harbour, the stadium, Robben Island, and the surrounding suburbs and ocean.It is part of the Table Mountain National Park, and as such is protected environmentally. The natural vegetation is good, except that there are a few exotic trees there that really should be removed. There's a stunning indigenous Acacia karroo there with thousands of beautiful yellow flowers on it in season.There are hiking trails that start there up to Lion's Head and beyond, and it's also very close to one of the oldest mosques in Cape Town that provide insight into our less-than-pleasant history.There are only two negatives that I find there. One is the lack of parking, you really need to arrive early or take your chance or go with a tour bus such as our red tourist buses. The other is that the toilets were not well maintained when I used them. This might have improved, or maybe I arrived on a \"bad\" day, but don't expect much in terms of cleanliness.Having said that, if you can \"can it\" for a while or \"go\" before you go, as it were, Signal Hill is a really lovely vantage point to gain perspective of the layout of Cape Town city and surrounds while relaxing in a tranquil natural environment."

The place was quite busy but we did get some parking enjoyed our packed lunch at the tables that are provided. Despite the number of people the area was clean and well kept. After lunch we walked along the footpaths with our kids and they enjoyed the warm air and skipping over the wooden poles on the path. There was also tandem paragliding on offer and an ice cream vendor for refreshments. Beautiful views of Robben Island, the Waterfront, Table mountain and the Atlantic seaboard from Signal Hill"

We worried that the view would be of nothing but thick fog. As we ascended Signal hill we edged ahead of the fog and and had a view of endless grey. Suddenly the fog opened up in places and we had pockets of view! And what a view it was! The city, Robben Island, ships way out at sea! Mother nature really showed off!"

There's also a glorious view of the World Cup stadium and Waterfront. Definitely well worth it though you do need a car as the sightseeing bus doesn't go there. Expect to pay the normal nominal amount to the parking attendant. There are toilets at the main car park. My hotels advised not to go there at night and whilst I'm sure the views would have been stunning I decided they probably knew best."

Walking around the top of Signal Hill affords you many interesting angles for picture taking. There is a small parking lot and rest rooms.

On a Monday, after taking a drive around the cape and up Chapman's peak, nearing sunset, my wife and I decided to pull off and try out the views from Signal Hill. We were able to easily drive all the way to the top. It was popular with lots of people joining us, including a police presence (but on the inverse you probably would not want to be up there on your own for safety reasons).The sunset views on the ocean were beautiful, city views were great as well. I would recommend bringing up a blanket and a bottle of champagne to spice up the romance."

The trail begins at a gravel parking lot located under a patch of bluegum trees near the beginning of Signal Hill Rd.This is also a take off point for the para gliders ."

After some back-and-forth decision making, we decided to make the most of the day and fly with Stef and \"Iceman\". It was the most awesome thing to do in Cape Town yet - the view was spectacular and serene! We then watched the glowing red sun disappear behind the sea over some beers in Camps Bay.

Adequate parking at the top unless you go at a very busy time. I could easily have spent a couple of hours or more admiring the wonderful views.From the main viewing point you look down to Sea Point and Robben Island in the distance. You also get a great view of the new football stadium and to the right the V &A (Waterfront). Also good views of Table Mountain and the beaches sweeping away to the right. It is well worth walking down the road (from where you came up) to get better views of Cape Town city centre and the suburbs out that way.Have a good walk round at the top - lovely views all round and if you have time you can take a path down in the direction of Sea Point - not sure how far it goes. There was an artist painting in oils - quite reasonably priced at c R350 if you want a souvenir. The car guards were a bit of a pain - they do definitely serve a purpose in certain areas of Cape Town but I don't think they are appropriate up here. The hawkers are a bit annoying and I didn't really want my windscreen covered in 'flyers'.However, definitely well worth a visit for an hour or so. My main recommendation would be to walk 100 metres down the road for other views and take some binoculars."

At the top of the neck, instead of turning left to go to the cable station, rather turn right, towards Signal Hill.On this drive you have an awesome view of the City Bowl. Going around the bend, you see the breathtaking atlantic seaboard. There you can picnic with a bottle of wine etc while watching the sun set.it costs you nothing, one of the really special free things to do in Cape Town.Tip: go about half an hour before sunset, and just experience the magnificent view and ambience. One can also have a great view on Robben Island.This is Africa, so be safe and wary of dodge types, and never go alone, always at least two people.Enjoy it, we love it, we go there all the time!"
