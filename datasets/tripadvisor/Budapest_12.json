You get a great spectator's spot to see Pest across the Danube River, and the architecture is pretty. Definitely try to go on a sunny day, though; even slightly rainy, the scenery can look a bit drab."

Built to commemorate the millennium celebrations, the Bastion appears to spring from a Disney film or a fairy tale. The Bastion itself is a very peaceful and idyllic setting. The only things that visitors need to beware of is the obvious tourist traps such as paying to climb up to the higher parts of the Bastion when the same views can be seen from below. Fisherman's Bastion is a fantastic viewpoint and photographic opportunity for visitors to Budapest."

We were stunned looking amazingly at the great architecture which seemed very similar to fairy tale buildings. Prepare your camera for the most beautiful shots you can take from the top of the Fisherman's Bastions. Breath taking views of the Pest city-House of Parliament, the Chain Bridge,etc... These bastions are a wonderful gem and not to be missed while in Buda city. A nice walk takes you to the unforgettable and well decorated Matthias Church, the Holy Trinity column and St. Stephen's large statue. Besides these if you continue walking you will admire all the surroundings with nice buildings, restaurants, cafe and souvenir shops. You can reach Buda by public transport and using the Buda Hill funicular (to avoid walking uphill) A MUST-SEE!!!"

The views are also really nice, except the fact that the place is really crowdy all the time and it's hard to find a moment to take a photo. Higher level is paid during the day, which I think is not worth its price at all - better go to the lower level instead. The staircase below is a nice photo spot itself as well."

As Budapest rookies we took the advice of Tripadvisor reviewers and visited the impressively-titled Fisherman's Bastion - love the name: #2 attraction in Budapest, can't go wrong we thought. The FB is accesible by a cute-looking funincular railway. This had a large queue and so we decided to walk. The route was not signposted until the first direction indicators appeared at the top of the hill. The walking surfaces were steep and uneven. We went on an afternoon where sun gave way to rain that came in quickly over the Buda hills. Paths turned to mush. The FB is a viewpoint with an 800 HUF entry fee. You walk up a flight of stairs, round a corner, and find a construction site. Rain gutters finish over paths thus depositing water over passers by. The place is heaving with large groups of people scrambling for the best photopoints of Parliament, etc. The problem is that the best photos of Parliament are to be taken from the river, not from FB. Views from the castle are comparable and are free. We simply didn't get the attraction of this place and it seemed like a waste of time that could have been better spent in a city with many wonderful features."

Basically, it is a walkway high above the Danube, between the cathedral and the cliff.Granted, some (half?) of the Bastion was under construction and blocked off during our visit, but I wasn't terribly impressed. Yes, you can take some great photos from the walkway with the Parliament and the Pest side in the background down below. But, it's difficult to get good pictures because of the mass of people, and the 'attraction' itself doesn't really offer anything to see in and of itself. The concrete conical lookout points are sort of neat to look at, but of course you can see those without paying to 'enter' the attraction.Overall, I'd say if you're at the castle, you might as well check this part of it out as well."

Gleaming white, it looks like straight out of a fairy tale. In my opinion, it's the best place to take pictures of the whole city from above and of the Parliament building across the river. During the day, part of the bastion is blocked off and only accessible after paying a small fee. However, if you keep walking past the fee area, you can access another part of the bastion and the stairs for free. Also, if you return in the evening, the whole bastion is accessible to the public for free. We came twice, once in the morning, once at night. There were plenty of tourists both times but the views were even more spectacular at night. There were a few street musicians also. You can sit on any part of the bastion, enjoy the views and just take soak up the atmosphere."

It felt like Hogwarts, we were asked to buy a ticket to go up onto a particular part of the building (800ft each) but we found if you walked down a bit further you can go to the top of the spire and see the magnificent parliament building from there. Glad we didn't waste our money.There was a fantastic pianist who was playing near an outdoor bar with fairy lights ,beer and food. Make sure you take cash as you have to pay for the toilets and you may want a cheeky Beer too!"

Perhaps because we'd walked up the hill next to Buda Castle and had enjoyed the view of the city from the bridges, but Fisherman's Bastion seems rather underwhelming. Perhaps the biggest problem was that rather than being able to actually look out, you instead had to look past people posing for pictures, many of whom wanted several shots and seems rather agitated if fellow posers got in the way of their picture (although that was quite funny to witness!). There were some turnstiles to head up to a slightly higher part of the structure, but without a clear price (I understand it to be 800 HUF from other reviews) we weren't that interested. It was a shame that part of the structure was being renovated at the time as well, as it would have been good to have seen a little more of the building. If around Buda Castle, it's only a small walk away though so worth heading over to."

We had just finished a walking tour which ended by Matthias Church and we decided to carry on exploring. We paid to get to the top (worked out at \u00a31.35 each, or slightly cheaper if you're a student). I'm glad we did this as it was so much quieter at the top and we managed to get some beautiful photos. We did think the top area spanned further than it did so we were disappointed when we thought it continued to find that it in fact didn't. There was a wedding on the day we visited and they were using part of the Fisherman's Bastion so I'm not sure if this would normally have been accessible or if it really is just a short bit on top. Nevertheless, I would recommend doing this whilst in Budapest, whether you decide to pay to see the viewing platform on top or not.We got some great shots including some panoramas of the city. The Fisherman's Bastion itself is very pretty and you can definitely see why it's been used as inspiration for Disney Castles!"

There is a lot you can do in this area and it is worth budgeting several hours or possible several trips depending on how long you are staying in Budapest, so you can take in the view at different times of the day and night. During part of the day they charge you to climb the short flight of stairs to the viewing platform - which we did. The views are great, but walk along the turreted wall is quite short and it did not make much sense to have to pay to do this, as there are other nearby vantage points which give you nearly the same view for free. When we came back to the area a few hours later, because we had dinner nearby - the access had opened and it was free. Very picturesque part of the city. You can walk up, take the funicular, or take a bus - in any event it is well worth a visit!"

It's also neighbours Mathias church. There are a good number of local shops and caf\u00e9s to serve your appetite and offer some relaxation. And on the way there is also a small Hungarian market where you can find many local art and craft products including their regional dresses. Overall a very rewarding experience. "

Group it together with the Castle Hill and the Matthias Church and you have a perfect self guided tour!"

The place is easy to get to with busses stopping right outside there (public transport in general is pretty great in Budapest). In the daytime it is busy with visitors and cafe goers. The place charges to get up some steps on to a higher battlement wall for the premium higher views. My tip is to go after dark. The place is quieter, you no longer have to pay for the higher views and mainly the photo opportunity for this place/Parliament/Chain bridge illuminated is not to be missed."

So get your camera (no tripod required as you can lean on the wall ) up there. You will need a good camera to capture the lights of the parliement. It is accesible by car/bus/bcycle for who cannot go up on the steps. Be careful when you are there with the little ones as it isn't completely safe. I saw a cafe shop with the view but was closed when we were there. Unfortunately I don't have photos taken by my phone for this location.

It is a quite a touristy area with many, many people around but it is a lot of fun to check out the different fortification walls and the views from different perspectives ... And the lighting was perfect for photos!   This amazing castle of glistening white stone brought back our imagination of all those Disney fairy tales from our childhood. Its round turrets, crenellated parapets, and spiral columns made us imagine a palace of which Walt Disney himself derived his imagination from. We kept expecting a princess to emerge with a flourish of trumpets (Look at us being childish, haha). The views were unique and you can fully appreciate the beauty and splendour of Budapest (Buda and Pest) stretched out before you along the Danube river, either day or night, but best time to go there is when it\u2019s twilight, just before night.~Feed The Couple"

However a number 16 bus will take you there if you take if from Deak Ferenc Ter to Disz Ter - if you have a Prague card or bus pass then this will be the cheapest and most comfy option.

We started across the river at the Parliament and walked across Chain Bridge, stopped at the funicular area for gelato and continued our uphill walk. Along the way there are many steps to get the plaza area. Once there, you can buy tickets to walk on the catwalk. For 2 adults/2 kids it was $8USD. The catwalk itself is maybe 100-150m total but it wasn't crowded and provided a nice view back towards the parliament building and the Pest side of the river. Not sure how long the funicular cost but there was quite a line to use it. Easier to keep walking."

We came across this by accident whilst wandering the streets around Buda Castle, I'd seen that Fisherman's Bastion was one of the top attractions in Budapest but had no idea what to expect. We bought a combination ticket that allowed entry to Fisherman's Bastion and St.Matthias Church, swerving the other ticket for the bell tower on account of the concern that climbing 200 steps in 30' heat might finish me off! The church was beautiful - both the painted walls and stained glass on the inside and the gloriously shimmering tiles of the exterior. Fisherman's Bastion was something else, on a warm late summers day with a blue sky behind, the fairytale turrets were a joy to behold. Both areas reminded me of Gaudi's wonderful architecture in Barcelona. There are some beautiful views across the Danube towards Pest including the Basilica and Parliament. One of the highlights of our trip to Budapest."

In the vicinity you find a couple of churches (like St. Matthias) and, built on the base wall of an old monastery in the 1970s, the Hilton Hotel.

I love this place, I came here 3 times during my stay in Budapest.The first time I went, it was during the day, it was hot and uncomfortable and full of tourists trying to get a good picture of the view (which was a beautiful view, but it's hard to take pictures when everyone else is). Also, it cost money to go to the very top of the Fisherman's Bastion for an even better view (so I didn't go).The next two times, I went at around 7pm. It was significantly less crowded, and I was able to see Budapest in the day, at sunset and at night. It's absolutely gorgeous. Seeing the city light up, and seeing the shiny Parliament house from the Fishermans Bastion at night was really cool. Since there were a lot less people, I was able to get much better pictures. It was also a lot quieter, which was nice. The cherry on top was that it didnt cost me any money to go to the top of the Fisherman's Bastion this time (for the best view), nobody was checking tickets at night time so everyone just walked right through the barrier.After the sun set, there was a man both nights playing the most beautiful violin music. Admiring the view with the violin music in the background was really lovely.I'd definitely recommend this place but don't go in the afternoon when everyone else is there. Wait for the hour before sunset, so you can get the most out of your trip (less people, quieter, no need to pay for a ticket to the top level, more epic views etc)"

The Fisherman\u2019s Bastion is probably the best place to go to if you want to see the nicest UNESCO World Heritage site in Hungary, namely the river Danube with its promenade, views, the (Szechenyi) Chain Bridge, the Hungarian Parliament, the Castle Hill, the Gresham Palace, etc. all in one fascinating panoramic view.The breathtaking beauty makes you realize why Budapest is often mentioned as the \u2018Pearl of the Danube\u2019.We even found some amazing little stores at the top selling beautiful artefacts and crochet merchandise."

Takes a moment a listen to the many languages you hear. How many can you identify? The views are magnificent. You d not have to pay for the slightly higher vantage point to have a spectacular view. There is good shopping, and good eating in the nearby shops. The famous Holy Trinity, plague column is in the syare with the Fisherman's Bastion.

This overhyped tourist attraction is actually a reproduction of the original, and is populated by multiple restaurants along with hordes of tourists. There is an admission price to allow access to all parts of the bastion, but the best advice we got was to avoid paying it, as you can simply walk along the inside until reaching the far end to the left (about 100 feet) to access a stairway that leads you to a perfect and impressive viewing area of the Pest side of the city. We walked over from the Buda side, then up well constructed stairways to the top of this hilly area to see other sights first, but those uninterested in the climb can simply access the area by the tram."

The problem is you have to pay to get to the upper level of the wall, which I think is not necessary. I would've like to go there, but decided not to pay the 850 ft. fee. The whole area is really nice too, so you have to go even if you are visiting only one day!"

Firstly the Fisherman's Bastion itself is a stunning construction, where you can imagine how soldiers in the past guarded the city behind the walls and from the lookouts. Also, and what actually mesmerises more tourists is the view to the Danube. From here, you can have see most of the icons of the Hungarian capital, ranging from the Parliament to the Chain Bridge. In fact, the view from here is much more magnificent than that from Buda Castle as the latter's proximity to the Chain Bridge limits the view it offers. One transport tip: If you don't want to queue for the funicular or walk uphill to the castle area, take bus no.16 from De\u00e1k Ferenc t\u00e9r, which takes you across the river and uphill."

Great view of the Danube, Parliament, Szechenyi Bridge, etc. Every tour group in the world stops here, so you will enjoy the people watching. Highly recommend just stopping in for a glass of wine or beer and just taking it all in. There is a Starbucks nearby but it doesn't have the spectacular views.

A real fairytale looking series of minarets and walls next to the newly cleaned church and surrounded by a square, the Fisherman's Bastion is a great place to view the city from high above. For those wishing the scale the steps direct to the summit from the river, it is about a 15 minute climb, first through streets and alleys and then the dramatic steps leading to the Bastion itself. It is not for those who struggle with hill climbs. A gentler way to ascend is to either walk up the gentler slopes to either side of the Bastion via the palaces, but these could still present a problem for some, or to get a bus or the funicular railway to the top of the hill and walk along. An early morning visit is not devoid of crowds, but by lunchtime it is filled with tourists taking snaps or using the many local bars and restaurants for lunch. There is a good selection of both, but be aware that prices will be higher than in the city given the location, but not by an excessive amount. The food at the nearby Piknik Pavilion is good, and the seats under a shady tree are a welcome respite on a hot day."

Originally in the Middle Ages there was a fortification here that was part of the city castle walls manned by city fishermen responsible for keeping watch in the event of the return of Mongolian raiders (hence the name \"Fisherman's Bastion\"). The sliver/white coloured structure has a Medieval appearance but is actually Neo-Gothic (dating only from the end of the 19th century). The impression it conveys is that of a fairytale castle, like something improbable you'd find in Disneyland. Some interesting old wall relief-sculptures on the staircase worth a look. There is a charge if you want to go up to the turrets for higher views. A cafe is located downstairs on the terrace level."

Our hotel was at the Bastion so we saw all the sites and wonderful views over to the city on the other side of the city!There is a good bus service or taxis going to this area and plenty of people will tell you which ones to take.You can walk from the city on the Pest side of the river but you will have to climb up steep paths and steps to reach the Bastion on foot,quite a hike for the over 70's but if your fit it is quite possible!Their are plenty of places to eat and drink on the bastion and a number of museums and churches that are a must to visit whilst up here.Toilets are in all the restaurants and hotels.This is a must see area in Budapest, please don't miss it !"

Tour buses are restricted due to the poor state of the foundations. It appears the tunnels under the site were blown up by the retreating occupiers and the city is concerned about them suffering damage from road traffic. You can walk up from the river side and I suggest you take plenty of water and keep a gentle pace on the ascent. On the opposite side there is a road which climbs up from Vermezo park. We stayed at the Mercure and you can see the bastion from there. It might be worthwhile to join a guided tour, as there are lots of hidden gems. We learned that all the modern buildings had been on sites of ancient ones destroyed during WW2. Get there early it gets really busy."

In Hungarian, Fisherman\u2019s Bastion is Hal\u00e1szb\u00e1stya. The neo-Gothic/Romanesque towers and terraces are situated on the Buda bank of the Danube on Castle Hill, and surrounds Mathias Church, having been built between 1895 and 1902. It was virtually destroyed during WWII. The seven towers represent the seven Magyar tribes that settled the Carpathian Basin (modern-day Hungary) in 896AD. A bronze statue of Stephen I mounted on a horse, erected in 1906, can be seen between the Bastion and Matthias Church.But all that\u2019s history. Views of the Pest side of the Danube and superb. Although there is a charge for entering the section that offers the best views, there are many areas that are free. The fairy tale castles rival those of Disney World, and photo ops abound.

There are two parts of the Bastion - one is paid entry and offers a walk along half the Bastion - there is a turnstile gate at the exit and we saw a number of people vault over the exit gate to get in without paying. The other part of the Bastion (and the higher, nicer part) is free entry and has a small, expensive cafe in the upper \"tower\". Personally I would not bother with the paying part and simply go to the free part - same if not better views and just as attractive. The main reason to walk along the Bastion is for the views of Pest and particularly the Parliament building. We went to the Bastion during the day and I can imagine the view is very pretty at night when everything is lit up. In fact I think at night the paying part is closed (except to those who vault over the exit gate!!). Well worth a visit and particularly when combining it with other parts of Buda for a day out in the Castle area."

You also see the Danube and its bridges. Has to be worth a visit."

Honestly, i hate my visit to budapest during the summer because i don't really get the beauty i think but somehow, when i went to visit it during the winter, i get the aura of the beautiful budapest. During my summer visit, i went to the bastion and takes a lot of pictures from up there. It gives me a lot of good pictures. So, i went back during the winter and yes i still get the best pictures from here. That is why i like the fisherman's bastion to be my top list during my visit to budapest"

It's very high and I'm not one for heights! Anyway day three and I plucked up the courage, although I didn't really know what was there to be honest. However luck was on my side and the ski lift thing was closed for maintenance, and just as we were leaving, a tuk tuk appeared out of nowhere with a bargain price for a trip to the top. Hurrah!! It took about five minutes and we drank in the hillside sights that you would normally not see in the lift thing. Reaching the bastion, I can honestly say, it was the best part of my whole holiday. The architecture is phenomenal. It's so clean and pretty and looks like it's on the film set of a Hans Christian Anderson 1950s film. Absolutely stunning and a must do. Also, if lucky, you might get to see and hold Nadia, the golden eagle who sits up there with her owner. She is just as beautiful as the rest of the bastion. There is also a little gift market up there too, and the walk down is really easy. Just go. Go now."

And take care about parking place when enter the Buda historical center by your car. Read carefully the signs otherwise you can have your wheel blocked. Validate your parking ticket at the restaurant or caffeteria so parking is aprox.150 HUF not 560 HUF. We parked in the first parking place.It is an automatic parking mashine there and when wanted to pay we couldn't and called. The man at the phone directed us to exit and we was pleased to see that we have to pay nothing more. We validated at Ruszwurm.

It is definitely a must see in Budapest. A bit overcrowded but that's to be expected. There is also a nice terrace bar to get a glass of wine an enjoy beautiful views of Danube and the parliament building."

There are very nice views of the city, but we have enjoyed htose views from the Budapest castle. There is a caf\u00e9 in the arched terrace, expensive and not much to offer. Part of the Bastion can be visited for free, but if you want to walk along all the terraces, you must pay a ticket, which seemed expensive to me."

Could not think of a better backdrop for a fairy tale like wedding. It sits a top of Buda Castle hill and it was magical. As the bride walked out from below the turrets all the tourists above stopped to take pictures as it truly looked like a princess walking down the aisle. You can get fantastic pictures of the Parliament building and the city across the Danube. 7 turrets represent the 7 tribes who founded Hungary in 895. The Fisherman's Bastion was built in 1895 to serve as a lookout tower over Budapest. There used to be real castle walls there that were once protected by a guild a fisherman in the middle ages and that is how it got its name. It sits next door to the beautiful Matthias church which has the most beautiful colorful tile work on the roof. Its open year round, day and night. It is worth spending an afternoon on Buda Castle Hill. There are restaurants,shops, Starbucks and the Hilton Hotel too. I would recommend going at sunset because once the sun goes down all the buildings light up for spectacular pictures!!!"

Certainly that worked well for my hotel, looking over the Danube to the castle. And yet one of the most popular, if not the most popular, viewpoint in Budapest looks over Pest. And it's worthwhile. Despite being very business with tourists, hawkers and all sorts of humanity, the views from here are great, particularly of the parliament building. The Bastion itself is also quite interesting and with the Mathas church right by it, it's definitely worth a visit. I just hope your phone battery doesn't die before you're done taking photos, like mine did :("

Fisherman's Bastion and Matthias Church were the two drawing points for us to go to Buda Castle hill. Rather than take public transportation or the funicular at Clark Adam ter, we walked up from a ramped path just past the Clark Adam round about. This path was free and easy to find as it has a lovely arched patio and planted flower beds at its entry. The path led to an escalator and elevator which opened at the gardens of the Castle. We could see the lovely fountains and courtyard of the castle as we passed through it. From the castle grounds, it was a 15 minute walk to Fisherman's Bastion. The white stone Bastion was placed at the edge of Buda hill along the backside of Matthias Church. Very convenient for tourists to see 2 attractions minutes apart! The Bastion had 2 viewing areas - one was from a free balustraded balcony on the square; the other required a payment and a walk through a turnstile to walk up a few steps to the turrets and the terrace viewing areas. No difference in the views, IMO, of Margaret's Island, the Parliament, St. Stephen's spire, the bridges on the Danube, and even a glimpse of Gellert Hill. From the square, the 7 turrets/towers added interest to Fisherman's Bastion so called because fishermen in the medieval ages were responsible for guarding/defending this part of Buda hill. These white turrets had an interesting appearance - long conical roof tops placed on a round base with many arched glass-free openings for viewing the panorama in the distance. The 7 turrets were to represent the 7 Magyar tribes who had settled in Hungary after following a black raven out of Eastern Europe in the Dark Ages. While the Bastion, built in the early 1900s for decorative purposes, had been heavily bombed in WWII, its present appearance belied that fact - all restored and a beautiful sight in itself now.On the square, between the Bastion and Matthias Church, stood a large bronze statue of Stephan I, the first Hungarian king, sitting on his horse. The good sized pedestal on top of which the statue was placed contained carved scenes illustrating his life. After our visit we walked down the hill - about 10 minutes - to the town below where there was a transportation hub. We used a wide staircase located on the square at the back of Matthias church and just kept using stairs all the way down. Later that evening our river cruise ship sailed along the Danube from which we were able to see the Fisherman Bastion and Matthias Church all lit up - a glorious sight. One of our memorable visits to Buda."

Without much doubt, this place is one of the best and most ideal, if not the best, for a view on the Budapest city. Take note of the narrow walkway though but people here were orderly and took turns to take photograph.From the top, you will get an unblocked view overseeing both the new and old towns being linked by the Chain bridge, the Danube River and gorgeous Parliament buildings etc.The views here at stunning and awesome, so beautiful and this is a must visit place when you visit Budapest and you will regret only if not coming here!Highly Recommended."

One of the highlights of the visit to Budapest is visiting the old city on top of the Buda hills called the V\u00e1r, which means castle. The best way to get there is to take a 4 or 6 tram to the terminus at what used to be called MOSZKVA TER now Sz\u00e9ll K\u00e1lm\u00e1n t\u00e9r and then use the escalator to catch a 16 bus (also at the terminus) to Szentharomsag ter where the beautiful coronation church of St Matthew stands with its colourful roof. There is a statue of St Stephen sitting on a horse in front of the church and the Fishermen's Bastion.I recommend you take a seat inside the Fishermen's Bastion and order a drink so that you can enjoy the beautiful views through the arches. I had an espresso but you might like a lemonade which is much more expensive. Sometimes there is Hungarian gipsy music being played which adds to the special atmosphere of the place."

The Bastion area is a walkway along the hillside providing stunning views across the Danube into Pest & at night, an illuminated Parliament building. There are nooks, stairwells & statues a plenty and we were never charged to access any area though this may be as we went very early or very late. Great photo opps & fairytale romantic. The surrounding area of Castle hill is also worth a visit."

You actually can get the same climb and the same lovely views by skipping the entry point to the right as you face the river and climb by way of the stairs on the left which lead to the bar and restaurant area. Same climb, same view, free. There is no need to buy a drink and the outdoor restaurant itself was actually closed and being reconfigured for a wedding when I was there."

During the afternoon, one of the higher points of the area requires a fee however at night, the fee isn't required. The best time to visit Fisherman's Bastion is at sunset. There are plenty of seats to relax, have a picnic dinner/wine and enjoy a beautiful sunset. There are also wonderful spots to take pictures throughout the area."

We took the metro to where 16 and 16a is found. Sorry but I lost my metro map so you will have to check which one it is--Det Freid???? The one thing we got lost and looked across the street instead of walking up the steps to the TOP of the metro/bus/tram stop. IT is a huge stop with easily 10 buses so it was easy to get lost so do go up the steps and cross the street to get the bus in the right direction We even took the bus back to the other side of town to see the Buda castle.. Drover right through and loved the views"

They have an area that can be visited with tickets. Ok. Strange but if there is no other way we will buy the tickets. It was the 3 of us. One of the kids had to use the restroom therefore we have to leave, assuming we just return but no such a thing is allowed. Once you leave for whatever reason you are not allowed back. I have gone to the ticketing agents and come across with no compassion at all. I was informed that I will have to buy all 3 tickets again. Also they claimed that it is the district decision but it is a private company who issues the tickets and an other who checks it. There are no signs anywhere about the one time entry at all!!!! I wouldn't go back again to these money hungry sharks again. No compassion at all and no useful information."

The tribes are represented by seven stone towers located on the hill of Buda Castle, near the Church of Mathias (beautiful). The monument name was chosen in honor of the fishermen for defending the city walls during the Middles Ages. After World War II, the bastion was completely destroyed and its reconstruction was coordinated by the son of the original architect, Frigyes Schulek. In the square between the Bastion and the Mathias Church there is the statue of Istv\u00e1n I, the first king of Hungary, who reigned from 1000 to 1038.

I'm sure there's an easier way to get up than the one I took but all those stairs were worth it when you emerge from the final staircase and into an area of beauty and magic. Matthias Church stands in front of you and Fisherman's Bastion rings the platform. The views from under the arches looking out across the river are breathtaking. The area itself is really interesting to walk around although it would have been nice to do the walking tour to find out the history of it (didn't have time). Definitely worth a visit while in Budapest."

It is also just 10 minutes walk from the Castle.Attention if you are travelling on a budget: Do not take the funicular, it is the most expensive way up. Take the bus n. 16 across the street from the funicular. Leave at the third stop and you will be facing the amazing St. Matthias Church."

The fisherman's Bastion (Halaszbastya) is a decorative platform on Castle Hill, with seven towers symbolizing the founding seven tribes. It is of relatively recent vintage, having completed construction in 1902. From its various openings there are wonderful views of the City, particularly the Pest side. The terrace itself is frequently the site for ambulant salespeople offering Hungarian and regional folk art. This area is like a square and being next door to Matthias' Church, it is an deal meeting place. Before or after mass, the terrace fills up with people, mostly locals; at other times, visitors constitute the majority. In the middle of the terrace there is a magnificent equestrian statue of King Stephen, Hungary's first king, who led the conversion to Christianity."

Plus a street musician who played violin added extra to the place. It is a bit pity that we didn't find a great place to view the Bastion from afar, because it is in midst of other buildings, but being in there was also great, yet when we climbed to the top, I felt that, if we would have payed, we would be disappointed because there wasn't much difference.And by the way, the church is amazing as well!"

Not as high as Gellert but you can see different things of Budapest from here. If you want a iconic photo from Budapest, you should take Parliament behind you at Bastion, and shoot ! :)"

I got off at the Fisherman's Bastion and the Cathedral.The Bastion was built between 1895 and 1902 on the site of a 13th century Dominican church. The style is neo-Gothic and neo-Romaneque. It was nearly destroyed during WW2 and so has been undergoing periods of restoration and repair since. Bits of its were being patched together when I was there. It is an amazing structure with its seven towers representing the Magyar (Hungarian) tribes and the statue of Stephen 1 of Hungary.

There is many many tourists on Saturday morning, more better to go some other day. Also walk over bridge and by steps through wood is very very nice. Great atmosphere. Beatiful streets around makes you feeling like you are travelling through time. Good organisation of public transport makes your retourn easier. Bus station is in the center of this lovely hill. Next to it is Buda Castle so you make it double visit. Very very nice"

You can buy a Ticket to go to the top during the opening hours, they are sold at the same ticket office that sells tickets for the Matthias church.

I recommend you to take the bus, which is a lot cheaper than the funicular and I strongly recommend you to buy a 24 hour free public transportation cards and take buses or tram lines everywhere. It is less time consuming and tiring instead of climbing a hill. The view is amazing here and there are a few spots to sit and watch the city.

Whether exploring the Fisherman's Bastion on foot, accessing it by bus or by the famous cog railway, the views across Buda and Pest, the magnificent Parliament and the beautiful Danube are simply stunning and breathtaking. A particular gem is the Church of St. Matthews - however, it's a bit of a tourist trap as anyone entering needs to pay, no matter if you want a quiet moment in prayer or if you want to see the sight. Take special note of the beautifully coloured ceramic tiles of the roof. Early morning is a good time to enjoy the Bastion before the onslaught of the daily tourists. Just take a gentle stroll along the old and tranquil streets and paths, or enjoy the changing of the guards at the fortress palace. You will be rewarded by stunning views across that lovely city and the surrounding hills."

It was a beautiful day when we went and we just spent hours gawping at the build... cafe looks like a ripoff so didnt go in there either! Beautiful views from the turrets (if you can call them that?). No idea about its history, going to look it up!"

Besides boasting the best views of Pest on the Danube as the Fisherman's Bastion is part of the Royal Palace Complex on the hills of Buda, it had been built for the Fishermen responsible for the protection of the royal court. In modern times it boast most probably one of Budapest's grandest and best restaurants! The whole experience is of historical romance in an unbeleivable setting backed up by great service and first class food. It must be said that one eats well in Budapest, be it street food, cafes or restaurants, one is never let down and at relatively reasonable prices every time. This place needs a reservation and then it is smooth sailing towards an unforgettable evening of old world charm all enhanced by a two man orchestra playing classics and movie themes to enhance the mood. A pleasure!"

You can purchase to visit the area 2 metres above the other view. i dont think many people will bother if i am honest as you still get to soak it all up from below and experience the views even without purchasing a ticket. you can purchase a ticket now for the matthias church, the tower of the matthias church and the fishermans bastion viewing platforms. It worked out around 7 pounds each. If you are doing the matthias attractions i dont see why you wouldnt go for the bastion aswell. Enjoy this beautiful area and the beautiful Budapest!

Built as a tourist attraction, it works like one really well, given the commanding views from the ramparts of the Danube and the Pest side, including the Parliament house (a rather more elaborate late-Gothic folly itself). Near-constant crowds of the location make it ripe for pickpockets and the ripoff merchants of the authorities that, on and off, have been collecting a fee for getting up to the bastion."

It is right next to the Matthias church or M\u00e0ty\u00e0s templom\" a medieval church all renovated and offering beautiful organ concerts. There are many attractions around and seasonal street fairs and markets such as Christmas and Easter are normally placed right in front."

Beep used to be a fishermonster and has never owned a Bastion, so we were suitably impressed that a single Fisherman appears to own this very grand structure.We've never even come across a Bastion before, but we're recommend one be built in York, as it seems to be a very helpful building which keeps almost all the tourists in a city retained in one area - rather than having all the selfie stick wielding types wander freely, spoiling the rest of the city. Beep nearly had to perform a colonoscopy on one particular owner of the wretched contraptions when they waved it across his face once too often.The views across the city are wonderful and the building itself very picturesque in an almost sickeningly Disney way. It was free to walk up and along the battlements when we visited but a turnstile was being installed at one end so either fees or queues or both look likely in future.Try going early morning or later at night."

We meandered rather aimlessly but had we been looking for things we might have been disappointed because although there are signposts and map boards everywhere you can't actually find anything. Little delights we found were: copper signatures in the pavement, old torch sconces on a wall of a hotel, an apothecary museum, beautiful old wooden doors, a window full of padlocks in one of the white walls near the Matyas church, and a copper sculpture of a coronation robe outside a church that looked like 4 different buildings had been built on top of each other.

It is fantastic if you are a history and architecture freak, don't miss this one. They used to have the Crown of King Steven but it was moved to the House of Parliament - another must see."

In medieval times, the fish market was nearby and The Fishermen's Bastion was built about 100 years ago to commemorate the fishermen who protected this part of the city. Today its a popular tourist destination due to the beutiful view and the surrounding old buildings, church, and small colourful streets with coffees, restaurants. There is a fee to enter to the top level , but you can enter the lower level lookout for free and the view is similar, or come back by night when the top level is also free, and the panorama is magnificent."

We encountered an out-of-commission turnstile at the entrance which leads me to believe there has been or will be an attempt to charge for visiting. However, the views over Pest could not be any more spectacular -- Parliament, Chain Bridge, St. Stephens, as well as looking south to the Liberty Statue or Freedom Statue on the Gell\u00e9rt Hill. Of course, one does wish for a crystal clear day -- but even on an overcast afternoon the views were breathtaking."

We didn't go to the any of the cafes as we were warned they would be pricey, so walked 10 mins further into the Buda side and found a pub that was full of locals."

With temprature much below zero (-15) it's hard to enjoy any outdoor activity, but the castle area was one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen in my life. After climbing many stairs (can also use the funicular) the view seen from up is breathtaking and so are Matthias church and the picturesque narrow streets with their small houses and statues. Finally we ended up at the small famous cafe Ruszwurmwhere where cakes are so good that Empress Elizabeth of Austria (Sisi) wife of famous Francz Jozeph, used to get her favorites cakes from. Beauty, colors, breathtaking view, good coffee and cakes - a perfect place for a few hours break from the daily routine. One of my most beloved places in Budapest even after 20 years of living in the city. a must see!!"

I climbed up the short series of steps to the Bastion's top tower area to be awe-struck by one of the most beautiful views of the Danube, Parliament and the City.

Thus the name of the bastion. An old fish market also sat at this location during medieval times."

There were three original parts of Budapest: Buda, Ou Buda (old Buda) and Pest (pronounced Pesht). One you get to the bottom of the hill after crossing the Danube, if you come from Pest, the walk is not to far and although up Hill, not too strenuous. One you get to the base of the stairs up to the top of the bastion you will notice how clean the stone work is. That's probably because the fortification has been rebuilt. You will never the less be forgiven for thinking that you are in a fairy tale. The architecture had all the makings of a fairytale. The top is basically a large viewing terrace. Don't be too eager to rush off to the Castle and St Matthew church, because at the top of the bastion is a coffee shop that serves traditional Hungarian cake and is well worth it. On a clear day whilst making the short walk to the castle you will be treated with the best view of Pest which really is stunning, including the magnificent houses of Parliament. Whilst enjoying your view take note that no building in Budapest (measured from ground level) is higher than the parliament buildings. That is by design to emphasise the supremecy of the time of law. The fisherman's bastion is a worthwhile sight. Don't get caught out by the higher prices at the top of Buda. Youre better off buying your sourvineous at the market in pest."

But to experience it at night is a lot more impressive. Magical!Lovely views. But with the castle and church lit up at night, it's a sight worth visiting. I read somewhere part of Lord of the rings was filmed here. There you go!!Worth a visit. Get the funicular up. Walk to the church and steps. And then walk down to the river via the steps is my tip!"

The layout is so picturesque. Taking photos is a must. There is so much to see as you go up the stairs and the view is 360 deg. Also, do pay a visit to St Matthew's Church which is right in the middle of the top square. There is also a place for mulled wine at the top. Nearby there are a number of restaurants and souvenir shops."

Inside Fisherman's Bastion, there are a few restaurants/cafes for differing price ranges, and if you walk a little further, you are close to some Wine Cellars as well. This is a beautiful spot to get some cityscape shots, and just to enjoy an afternoon. My husband and I were here multiple times in our short stay in Budapest, and it was probably our favourite location in the city."

The staircases leading up to this tower in particular have amazingly detailed dragons on the foot and top of the staircase. Really seemed like this structure came straight out of a Fantasy epic.

You should definitely go there.If you stay only a few days in Budapest, you might want to leverage the day by starting with the Parliament in the morning, then st matthias, fisherman's bastion, hospital in the rock, lunch in the area in a deli store in the area at reasonable prices and finish with the Buda castle when it's already dark (about 4 pm in winter). That way you will get the view of the city during the day from the bastion and at night from the castle. Regardless of your time in Budapest, all this is a must!"

We had read that you had to pay to visit the top pathway for the best views but the turnstile seems to have been removed and everywhere outside was free. Not sure if this is just because we visited out of season but it was appreciated. The views are spectacular. You can get a photo of the Parliament building, the Chain Bridge and St Stephens Basilica all together from here. A great place to visit and we managed to spend about 3 hours here just walking around taking photos. Head as far as you can to the largest turret and you will find it hosts a small cafe where you can get tea, coffee or mulled wine. Its not expensive and standing out on its terrace, overlooking the Danube with a cup of hot mulled wine is an experience you will appreciate. The only downside is that you can not just pay to climb the tower. You have to pay and take part in a complete tour of the place. That's a shame as this put us off and we ended up giving that a miss. Otherwise, a stunning building with views to match."

Free access to the Bastion itself. There are plenty of cafe's, restaurants and souvenir shops nearby, heck even a marzipan museum!! :)"

Our last visit to Budapest we thought we had planned it out so well and went all out on the sight seeing; the castle of course being high up on our to do list! I have absolutely no idea how we missed this....really don't! Oh well, well made it this time albeit a lot colder than nice and warm June of last year! A real must see! Lovely design and enjoyable to walk around the area. The view across the Danube to the Parliament was brilliant so have your cameras at the ready! If you're planning a day out to the castle then DON'T make the mistake we made last year and miss out this place! It's not far away and it makes such a highlight to the day out!"

You can see perfectly across the Danuba to view Parliament. A really wonderful experience. While they sell tickets to walk the fisherman's bastion (and they aren't expensive), there is a bar/restaurant you can walk through that has the same views and doesn't cost anything. We were surprised when we walked through the restaurant to find dozens of tourists taking advantage of the free part of the view, so if you're strapped for cash, this is an option for taking in the views without having to pay the entrance price. However, this is a really wonderful attraction and if you have the means, I would encourage you to pay the nominal fee to access bastion so that they can maintain it properly."

The stair fence seems too short to me though and it's always packed with people. I guess the only exception can be wintertime. Restaurants with a view of the Danube are quite pricey, but there are some other, simpler cafes right across the bastion. We took lots of pictures and had a coffee while enjoying the view. Best to go there on a sunny day!"

We saw the changing of the guard at the presidential Palace which was intriguing to watch.

There are lots of cafes and places to eat up here, and we enjoyed a nice mulled wine with the church as our backdrop. Beautiful."

Be sure and catch the interior of the Mattyas Templom when you are there (There is a small entrance fee, but we found it worth it.)

A super picturesque table sitting for 4, view of Danube at night & Parliament building, and a step out small balcony. . . what more could you ask for. Strolling musicians? You got it. The Chef prepared 4 excellent meals of pork and beef dishes, extra delicious dessert and coffee/tea. Great wine list and staff that knows how to serve. Make a reservation for this great restaurant if you can, try the Turret tower seating especially. It is fine dining on the Hill after 6 pm."

The guide took us into Matthias Church and pointed out the Fishermen Bastion. It was very crowded and I barely was able to take a photo from afar before we had to walk off to follow the guide. In October 2015 I again went to Budapest but this time our tour ended at Matthias Church which is next to the Fisherman Bastion. The day was sunny and to my delight there were hardly any visitors. My friends and I went to all the towers, lookouts, spots on the Bastion. The view overlooking the Pest side are wonderful. There were two brides having there photos taken at the stairways. To get there you can take the Hop on off Bus , Red line and get off on stop 13. From the base of Castle hill the Fishermen Bastion is accessible through some impressive stairs . Too many steps for me. The view from the base is amazing. It looks like the steps up to a magic castle. I am so happy I took the time to fully enjoy it on my second visit."

This, without doubt, is the place to go to enjoy a magnificent view of the Danube and Pest.It was constructed at the turn of the 19th century as a decorative environment of the historic Matthias Church that was reconstructed under the direction of the same architect. The towers of the bastion represent the tents of the 7 Magyar tribes. The largest of them represent the tent of the leader \u00c1rp\u00e1d. Supposedly, there was a bastion at the site for which the fishermen's guild bore the responsibility of maintaining and defending it.The views from this sight are magnificent and I would recommend anyone to go there, especially after dark, and enjoy the view. The site, probably, has the best view of yet another mock Gothic construction, the Hungarian parliament. It is, however, not this monstrosity but the site that makes the view. A simple parapet without the silly frames would have allowed a clearer view.As a sight on its own, I think it is a mockery of a historic town wall and nothing but a monument to an architect. I was in Buda for just an evening. Since my hotel was only 100 metres from the site, I visited it. At that time it, already, had gone dark. The flood lights gave it a certain charm. There were only few people around at that time.A section of the wall that you can walk on is blocked by turnstiles. These turnstiles suggesting that you need a ticket to pass were open, so you could get up on the wall for free."

The first time we walked up through the royal palace gardens, past the palace and presidential residence to the fishermens bastion, the second time we took the funicular railway which was faster. The area around the fishermens bastion has a lot of very old buildings and souvenir shops in it and they make this attraction worth seeing. Shame about the Very modern Hilton hotel just behind the bastion as that doesn't fit in at all but overall I enjoyed my walk around the bastion and area."

The bastion was built between 1895 and 1902 to celebrate the 1000th birthday of Hungary, and to provide locals with a panoramic terrace. The architect\u2019s intent was to recapture the romanticism of olden times. The structure consists of seven towers; each tower symbolizing one of the seven chiefs of the Magyar tribes who conquered the land for the Hungarians. The Bastion achieved the architect\u2019s purpose in that the structure looks like a fairy tale castle. Why the name Fishermen\u2019s Bastion? There are several theories. One saying the walls were protected by the fishermen who lived below the walls and who protected the original castle when under siege. Other theories say it was named for the fishermen who lived in the town underneath called Watertown or it received its name from the hilltop fish market near St. Matthias Church. The name of the structure is not as important as the fantastic views. St. Matthias Church is located in the same complex and the architecture of the Bastion complements that of the Church. A statute of the first Christian king St. Stephen is located in front of the bastion. Have your camera ready to get some of the best pictures of Pest and the Danube River."

The Fisherman's Bastion boasts a magnificent view of the city (including the Danube River, Parliament Building, and several bridges) along with an impressive architectural structure in and of itself. It's located right behind Matthias Church, which is a two minute walk from the Buda Castle. The Bastion is free and easily accessible, and you can even walk along the upper rampart. There is also a restaurant built into one side of the Bastion with great food, coffee, and even live music in the evenings. Not to mention there are plenty of souvenir shops, tours, cafes, restaurants, and monuments nearby."

Payment of the admission fee allows you to climb slightly higher onto a rampart. There is no need to do this, as similar views are available nearby. There is a cafe under the rampart with the same views. If you want to spend money, you are better off ordering some food from the cafe and sitting there. There is often a small band playing in the cafe.By the way, the structure is built entirely for scenic views and tourism, it has nothing to do with fishermen."

When you get your ticket for the Matthius Church - which is well worth a visit - you can get a joint ticket covering the Fisherman's Bastion tower for an extra \u20ac4/5 a couple. There is no doubt the views are very good from this raised walkway (that's all you get for the ticket) but if you walk an extra 50 metres behind the church - still in Fisherman's Bastion, the views are just as good and free (especially from the tower that houses the cafe). In simple terms, save the money for your lunch!"

There is a small cafe to purchase beer, wine, cold beverages and then a few high top tables to sit at and enjoy the view. There was a ticket booth close by that we purchased tickets to the Matthias Church next door and thought they also sold tickets to enter the Fishermans bastion, but no one was there to collect money or tickets to enter the Fishermans Bastion the day we were there. So maybe it's free?"

You need to pay to visit a small part of the Bastion (top level). We did that, but failed to see what exactly this part had to offer extra - don't do it.You can have dinner in a restaurant inside the Bastion (enjoying the view), but we didn't do that. Before visiting the Matthias Church and climbing its tower, have a coffee break at the nearby Cafe Mir\u00f3 (down Szenth\u00e1roms\u00e1g utca).Count some more than half an hour for the Bastion alone."

The Fisherman`s Bastion was defiantly one of the most picturesque locations in Budapest, with breathtaking views of the Danube and Pest, including the house of Parliament, St Stephens Basilica and numerous other iconic landmarks. The Bastion itself is relatively small and can be tackled in around an hour. However there are numerous restaurants in the surround area including a couple in the Bastion itself for those with more time on there hands. Just a stone throw away is St Matthias church which is also a must. I do suggest going early in the morning before 9am or later in the afternoon after 5pm as the area can get very busy with tourists which will spoil the feel of such a beautiful place."

If you only want to capture nice pictures of the House of Parliament, other Pest embankment buildings or Danube, you do not have to pay the entry, you can just enter the free outlook in the left corner of the place, where the local Cafe is located."

The Church alongside the Bastion is beautiful, too.You just want to sit and revel in the beauty of the scene.

You can purchase tickets for the church , tower & access to the turrets & walls but some sections can be closed at certain times.

Be warned though, in hot weather it is a HOT walk up there, but you can always catch a bus, or use the city centre Hop on Hop off tourist busses, which are quite good value with all the extra add ons.You'll find the Cafe Panaramia here also, with the same stunning view though stone arches, with the advantage of enjoying a snack or just a drink whilst sat enjoying the view. There was a live Hungarian Trio playing while we were there - wonderful! Yes, the drinks were a little more expensive, but how do you value such a lovely experience."

There are a number of hidden gems that you should make the effort to find and explore. One is the Faust Wine Cellar under the Hilton Hotel. Yes, UNDER the Hilton Hotel. This part of Buda is comprised of limestone caverns and labyrinths and there is a wonderful and highly unique experience to have here. Call ahead and make sure they are open. Also, St. Matthias' Cathedral has symphonies at various times. Unlike most other parts of the world, European churches are activated for more than just worship. My wife and I caught Mozart's Requiem here and it was AMAZING! The acoustics are unbelievable and it was VERY inexpensive to attend. Enjoy!"

There are a great number of seriously amazing Buda attractions nearby. We happened to be there as a medieval lute band were playing in the courtyard area (which just multiplied the atmosphere). The view to Pest across the Danube is stunning. I have to admit ignorance regarding the historical reason for such beautiful turrets, but I imagine it cost some regent(s) a pretty penny to build these faerie-folk inspired structures.However, for me, one sullying feature is that the Hilton chain have managed to jack-hammer an eyesore of an edifice right next to the Western part of Fisherman's Bastion."

The entrance is free everywhere except a higher layer of the bastion (we did not go there, there's not much point to anyway in my opinion) I could spend all of my time there, if only we weren't in the whole \"sightseeing rush\". Try going there at sunset (which i did not manage to do) for stunning pictures.I would definitely visit the bastion when I'm in Budapest again. Do not miss it!"

The ticket to the Bastion is NOT NECESSARY at all, even though it's as low as 350 HUF (about 1 EUR). Only a very small portion of the structure is only accessible with a ticket. You can go to the restaurants in the structure and get a better view than in the ticket-only area. The restaurants may limit access to some areas, but it doesn't hurt! They do not stop you from getting to the top, and the top is substantially higher than the ticket-only area. After all, the tower is much higher than the Bastion."

Its main feature is the astonishing panorama of the city - the Parliament building in front, the Chain Bridge, the Castle and the Gell\u00e9rt Hill on the right and the Margaret Bridge and Island on the left. The Bastion also includes a nice restaurant and caf\u00e9."

There is no fee but if you want to go up through the towers you will require a ticket. I am not sure if it is allowed but we went to the barrier and the person collecting the tickets asked us for some money and let us through. It was about 1000TF which is about \u00a32.40 for two of us. There is a restaurant with great views - apparently you need to book way in advance. We tried to book a dinner there but no availability - so probably a great idea for couples/romantic trips!"

Perched at the top of one of the hills on the Buda side overlooking much of the city, including a long stretch of the Danube, this is a very interesting place. The are several spires, the tallest of which has a very small snack bar inside at the top with a few outdoor tables. The views of the city from all areas of this place, which is probably 100 yards or so wide are spectacular, especially if there is not a lot of haze. At night you can see many of the bridges, the parliament building and many other buildings lit up all over the city. It is quite spectacular. There is no admission cost and it is adjacent to St. Matthais church, another good attraction. It is also a popular place for weddings and when they are being prepped for or occurring, some or all of the area appears to be off limits to the public. We saw 3 brides over the course of an afternoon and evening on a Saturday. Lucky for us we were staying at the Budapest Hilton Hotel which is adjacent to both the bastion and the church."

The view from the Bastion is amazing, you can see from up there the entire Parliament and the Danube with the bridges. If you are coming here with your car, you need to know that you can park close to the Bastion, they have a paid parking lot. If you don't have time to visit other atraction try and visit at least this one, it s opened until 11 pm, you won't regreat it."

It's gorgeous and definitely worth seeing I liked this place so much that I went back several times. The first time by foot (many stairs) in the second by bicycle (huff and puff) and then I found the a16 bus. It was fun but the bus is easiest. It is very close to the ruins of the old castle and Buda Castle. Lots to see in this area if you don't mind walking a little, or have a bus pass. Beautiful in daylight, but it is magical at night.

Just about everything you want to see can be seen from the Bastion. And because it gives you the positional relationship of most everything in the city, this is a stop you might want to do early in your trip.And after this stop there are some nice little shops and cafesin the area"

Most people come by coach, or if the crowds aren't too bad, by Siklo which is the Funicular Railway, near the Bastion side of the Szechenyi (Chain) BridgeWalking along the high ground, and around the streets, there are a number of added sights to see and places to go (including some decent places to eat, museums, shops, and of course Matthias Church)When its time to go down, you can head back toward the Chain Bridge, or try the route on the reverse side of the hill which takes you down the inclines toward the Hospital In The Rock, and then further down to Deli Palyaudvar (Metro) Station. By the way, this station has routes toward both sides of Lake Balaton if you feel like a trip to the waters (tickets fairly cheap too)"

It is part of a UNESCO WORLD HERITAGE site.You can get there via the funicular from chain bridge, the public bus service serving Castle Hill or numerous footpaths. The complex includes Matthias Church, A bronze statue of Stephen I mounted on a horse (erected in 1902), the first King of Hungary, and Fisherman's Bastion Terrace.

Views of the Danube, St/ Stephen's Basilica, the Chain & Margaret bridges, Parliament and the Academy of Sciences can all be had at the lower turret levels as well.

Fishermans Bastion or Halaszbastya was built between 1895 and 1902 as a part of the millennium celebrations of Hungary. The architect, Frigyes Schulek, designed these towers keeping several things in mind. Firstly, they should not clash the buildings surrounding them like the Matthias Church. Secondly, the style should be early medieval so as to remind everyone of the thousand year old times when the first king ruled Hungary, hence Neo-Romanesque style was used. Thirdly, the number of towers should be seven to signify the seven Hungarian tribes and their chieftains. Moreover, he connected the bastion with the Fish-town beneath it because this was the point where the fisherman brought fresh catch from Danube for the castle. Last but not the least he was very careful that the bastion did not look ugly like other fortifications. In Fact it should add to the beauty of the city and be a panorama terrace. Thus he added romance, charm and class to these towers. There is a ticket for a specific section of the bastion."

We arrived and it was very busy, we opted out of not getting a ticket for any of the attractions as there was still so much to see and walk round and the views were amazing, it was raining, so we found a shop selling Pac a macs, so we carried on walking around as there were plenty of places to shelter and stop to eat & drink, all except Faust Wine Cellar as it was closed, it being a Tuesday and it's only open Thursday til Mondays!! Gutted!! I would definitely recommend visiting here as you can see all of Budapest."

The richest guild was the Fishermen's Guild (from the valuable Danube fishing) so they build a magnificent structure, more for decoration than defence. The views across the city from here, and the general surroundings are wonderful. You can see this and walk around for free, but there is a charge for going up on the highest level where the views are best (free in winter and when quiet). This is a very touristy area, so all drinks and food near here are 2 or 3 times the price of the rest of the city. The gardens in the area are nice for walking around, the castle district has many very interesting buildings inside and out. Nearby, the brass statue of a horse has shiny testicles because it is \"good luck\" to climb up and touch them (the legal university students historically did this before exams)."

The best way to see this building is to go first to the palace by Budapest Castle Hill Funicular ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest_Castle_Hill_Funicular ) so you don't have to walk the hil up and then walk to the dirrection of the fishermans bastion. It is also verry nice to vissit when dark. In summer you see manny bads flying arround when it is dark."

This fairly tale beauty was built more than 100 years ago, this marvel was built on the site where fishermen valiantly defended the hill (circa Middle Ages) from \"enemies.\" This is the site of a medieval fish market.Gargoyles and spires and gleaming white beauty make it so special but it is actually prettier to see from a distance than it is when you are climbing up various staircases with about a million other people at the same time. And, too, the views down from this elevated location are actually worth the effort and wait. Crowds are like that.There is a little elevated park area where a band was performing and people were picknicking. Not everyone is in line to ascend the stairs (although it seems like they are).To me, it's a \"been-there, done-that\", tick-this-off-the-list type of activity. Given that it is not a historic building in the truest sense of the meaning, I looked forward to some quality museum time (and it was really hot weather, too).A ticket is needed to go up the stairs to the bastion."

A walk at fisherman's bastion is like going through a time portal (which is a must for history enthusiasts)What a amazing location overlooking the danube river with a rich history which you can read around as you explore.The tour will definately be incomplete if you don't visit the matthias church which was originally built in 1015 AD.Inside you can visit different portion of the church each explaining the history of the place including a museum on the upper level. Its seven towers represent the seven magyar tribes that settled in the region in 896 whereas it was named after a historical incident when a guild of fishermen defended it in the middle ages"

But for me, going up on the Fisherman's Bastion was worth it, for the extra views, and for the beautiful building itself, which is a wonderful addition to an already beautiful area. The stunning white walls and columns add to the castle and church area, and the light at certain times of the day, especially at sunset, makes the white walls even more stunning. And while there might not be actually anything to do on Fisherman's Bastion, apart from look over the city at the views from even higher up, and apart from an overpriced restaurant, for me anyway, it was worth it. It's up to each person to decide whether it's worth it for them or not, but if you're in the area anyway, I feel it's good to see and do everything- especially in such a beautiful, popular area anyway!"

It\u2019s an impressive piece of work offering spectacular views of Budapest and the Danube and plenty of photo opportunities; there Is an entry charge for the main (and most popular) section of the battlements though the others offer views that I think are just as good.This is a must-visit site for visitors to Budapest, not just for itself and the views it offers but for the adjacent and colourful Matthias Church and nearby old but well-presented buildings such as the former Buda Town Hall."

(Budapest is really a combination of two former independent cities \u2013 Buda and Pest.) It is on Castle Hill, a very high hill, which affords incredible panoramic views of the river, the spectacular Parliament Building, and other aspects of Budapest.The name Fisherman\u2019s Bastion, a 7-towered fortress, comes from honoring a group of fishermen whose job it was to defend this part of the city in medieval times. However, the building itself is only about 100 years old. Nearby the beautiful Matthias church is over 700 years old and has quite a history. The coronation of the last Hapsburg king, Charles IV, took place here. The church\u2019s most impressive feature to us was the colorful mosaic tiles that cover its roof. The inside is highly decorated with much gilding and many paintings.This area is well worth a visit. The sights on Castle Hill are wonderful, and the views from the hill are not to be missed."

On closer examination, however, its whimsical fairy tale-like design means that the structure could never have survived serious warfare for long. Indeed, it's more of a series of decorative galleries and towers to provide visitors with various lookout points, or a rather useful set for an epic or fantasy movie. Certainly, the panoramic views of the city of Pest across the Danube River are rather stunning.Although most of the lower ramparts are free of charge, there is a small fee (approx. USD2.50) to enter the upper levels and/or towers. Nevertheless, the views from the free section are already pretty good. And there's always other areas of Castle Hill to get your fix of the Danube and city views of Budapest."

If You spend a 2-3 EUR You can go up to the second floor of the Bastion, the vew is better from there. Together with the Matthias Church, the Hilton hotel and the statue ot king St. Stephen the place could be amaying touristic sight. But it isnt. Why? As we say, like dishes which is not enought salty. The last 2/3 years always something at the sight is under construction. It looks like hungarians want to do it better for the tourists, but in the same time push the tourists off.... I really cant understand it. Anyway, the place is one of those You just must see at least once in a lifetime."

Artists and other vendors are in the area selling their wares, as they are all along the Castle area walkways. You can get back and forth from the Metro (M2 at Kalman Ter) via a shuttle bus. Matthias Templom, with its colorful beehive-looking Zolnay tiled roof is adjacent to the open plaza. Some of the best restaurants and cafes are in the Castle area near Fisherman's Bastion.

From the towers and the terrace a panoramic view exists of Danube, Margaret Island, Pest to the east and the Gell\u00e9rt Hill.Its seven towers represent the seven Magyar tribes that settled in the Carpathian Basin in 896.The Bastion takes its name from the guild of fishermen that was responsible for defending this stretch of the city walls in the Middle Ages. It is a viewing terrace, with many stairs and walking paths.A bronze statue of Stephen I of Hungary mounted on a horse, erected in 1906, can be seen between the Bastion and the Matthias Church. The pedestal was made by Alajos Str\u00f3bl, based on the plans of Frigyes Schulek, in Neo-Romanesque style, with episodes illustrating the King's life."

There is plenty of seating for you to sit back and admire the view, even a free WiFi area if you are getting withdrawal symptoms from social media and lots of bars and restaurants in the vicinity.I didn't pay to climb to the higher level as the view was perfectly clear from the bottom.

There is a small cafe in the area, but the prices were quite high and the whole establishment not very attractive, so we avoided it.There is no need to purchase any entry ticket, most of the facilities you can enjoy for free anyway. Also, the beautiful nearby Matthias Church is worth checking out, but only from the outside. You will need to purchase a ticket to get inside, which is not particularly interesting."

This bus crosses the chain bridge and then meanders up the hill to St Mathias church where you get a good view of pest from the Bastion. There were a couple taking wedding photos here and it does make a fantastic backdrop. Was a beautiful sunny day. Unless you particularly want to ride the funicular to the top of the hill either walk up to be rewarded the views or take the bus. The former had long queues and is not operated by public transport so there is an extra fare."

We arrived by local Metro train service at the foothills of Halaszbastya and walked up the hill for a good 20 minutes to reach the hill top (Fisherman's Bastion). I had no idea that it would take us a good 6 hours to see the entire area including lunch. This is not just a viewing spot (fantastic views), it is a cluster of other historical attractions within a walled area including a castle and many medievial buildings, St Mathias Church, palace and other buildings that I cannot recall what they were. There are many eateries, restaurants, traditional handicraft shops, to keep you busy. The moment you enter the walled area, the place transforms you back in time and there are moments you feel as if living in the past. If you are in Budapest for a few days, I would definitely suggest spliting your stay between Pest and Buda and staying at one of the hill top hotels (possibly Hilton) to enjoy the evenings and nights in the area. All signs are modernity have been carefully conceiled behind this otherwise medieval neighborhood that I am ready to bet is not as noisy and at times very roudy as Pest gets. This is not a place to be rushed. Take it easy and spend a few hours here. Feel like going back again soon"

Fishermen's Bastion is a beautiful spot - on the old Buda side - to visit and from which to view the Danube, Parliament, and newer city of Pest. The view is incredible, especially at night. The stories as to why the Bastion was built vary, and probably don't really matter. It is a very unusual structure, with turrets and arches and little domes, but on a historic square so there is a lot to see close by. There are also a number of lovely restaurants, cafes, and shops within walking distance. A funicular can take you up/down (or both) the hill, also great for viewing and photos. St. Mathias Church is very beautiful, right behind the Bastion, and also well worth a visit. This is a traffic-restricted area so you need to arrive by bus, taxi, or funicular - unless you're staying at the Hilton or another hotel up on Hill which will allow car entry. A visit to this beautiful area is definitely a must-do if in Budapest!"

It is surrounded by the Fisherman\u2019s bastion, opposite towering the Matthias church and in the middle of the bastion yard standing the equestrian sculpture of Saint Stephen The whole set up is beautifully planned by Frigyes Schulek. My belated congratulation to him. The neo-Gothic Fisherman\u2019s Bastion with its seven towers \u2013 representing the conquering seven Hungarian tribes -is one of the most visited attractions of Budapest.From the tower and the terraces breathtaking view is waiting to the visitors. One stairs you can go up to the upper terrace free of charge, but the other terrace above the restaurants has a fee. Be prepared, that you have to pay it in Hungarian forints. No euro or other currencies are accepted.In front of that stairs leading up to the terrace, there is big sign,\u201d WC\u201d, with an arrow pointing to the right direction. Just in case, if you need another kind of visit as well.If you\u2019re hungry, your choices aren\u2019t too wide and not too promising. The Panorama coffee and bar is selling different kind of sandwiches, all of them are 4, 5 \u20ac and none of them are freshly made.There is another restaurant upstairs on the free of charge terrace, calling itself lunch bar, but food was only on the black board at the entrance, advertising, that \u201cMenu of the day: Goulash soup, baked leg of chicken, + Soft drink, + Coffee 2990 HUF. (cca 10.- \u20ac) Not too bad, not too good, especially if you can order it. Two girls in front of me were asking for it, but the waiter told them, that there is no food, only drinks. When I asked him, what about this advertisement, he answered, that was for a big group, and all the food is gone. So, why is the sign is still here, misleading the tourists?-I asked. He said he didn\u2019t have time to take it in. There were no guests in this bar.If you don\u2019t want to enjoy this fantastic panoramic view dry, there is no problem at all. You name it, and you can drink it at several bars, restaurants, coffee shops sitting on the lower and the upper terraces as well.To make your entertainments complete, on the lower terrace they serve you with music as well with the view and with your drink.If you have enough of the sight, and already also have seen the Matthias church, let\u2019s go for a stroll in between the castle district century\u2019s old houses. There are plenty of restaurants, where you can have a decent and mostly expensive food.Despite my complains, this place is so charming, that I always feel the urge to visit it every year."

We spent about an hour walking around the site, taking pictures of the Pest side and the structure itself. We did not go in the church or pay to walk around the top of the structure. We got there around 8:30/9:00 in the morning and around 10:00 the bus tours started to arrive, which made the area crowded and noisy, so I would try to get there early if at all possible. It's free and very cool and the views alone are worth the trip over there."

The bastion itself is a modern pastiche of medieval battlements (and as such, is a little it 'Disney'). Together with the church it's worth an hour of your time (although I wouldn't recommend much longer- most of Buda is pretty unremarkable). Worth it for the view."

As has been stated by many, the views from here are fabulous - probably one of the best views you will get of the lovely Parliament Buildings, along with the Danube and the rest of Pest. The whole area was extremely interesting and it is worth spending an hour or two walking the area, just be prepared for lots and lots and lots of people. I understand there is a fee for climbing to the upper part of the Bastion but the free views from below are probably just as good. Certainly worth a visit"

Located on the Buda side of the Danube, Hal\u00e1szb\u00e1stya (Fisherman's Bastion) is a marvel in how an historic European city can build something so rich in its history yet so scaleable for the future that it connects this grand European city's past to its present. The views are breathtaking but turn around and enjoy everything this little community has to offer. Worth at least several hours to fully appreciate the sprawling grounds, my college-aged daughter and I enjoyed everything Hal\u00e1szb\u00e1stya had to offer but we also noticed smiles on the faces of everyone from age 8 to 80. Enjoy the walk from the Danube to the top - it's quite manageable - or find a ride to the convenient turnaround at the base of the Bastion. Stunning, simply stunning!"

Unfortunately when the second guide pushed in front of us our patience was wearing thin. When a third did the same we complained but to no avail. We gave up at that point and left in disgust.

The view shows the Hungarian Parliament in a beautiful angle with the Danube completing the picture. The Bastion holds a cafe and usually several events are held nearby ( a folk fair with hawks and owls etc). In the summer the Bastion is an excellent place for a drink and shade from the hot Hungarian sun. Especially if you have walked up to the Bastion. It is also close to the Castle and sits a top castle hill near the finicular. It is a very soothing tourist attraction and even contains a tour if needed."

From the moment we arrived we felt it was being managed to be a special experience for us. The warm greeting as we arrived, the spacious table in our own alcove with views over the river and Pest were fabulous, the service was efficient yet unobtrusive, the quality of the food was of a high standard as was the the wine (choices aided by the Sommelier), music during the evening and the operatic rendition of happy birthday by almost the entire waiting staff was brilliant (and fitting), and the overall value was a pleasant surprise. I have no complaint and wouldn't want to change anything. In summary, there will clearly be other establishments that can compete in one or two aspects of their offering but I would certainly recommend this restaurant to anyone wishing to have a high quality balance of choice, quality of food and service all in a unique setting."

In the event the evening was too cool to be outside and we were glad to have the inside option.The position of the restaurant is spectacular. Our table for four was in one of the several alcoves around the gallery with panoramic views of the Danube and Parliament opposite, plus good views of the main restaurant floor below, where some excellent traditional musicians played thoughout the evening - and even came up the spiral stairs to play at tables around our gallery at top of the tower with violin and double bass! The food was excellent but a slight negative is that service was somewhat slow and inattentive and, for our tastes at least, could have been a little more informal."

But I don't understand the hype. As other reviewers have noted this site is very commercialised and extremely crowded. You have to buy a ticket to get to the top of the bastion and most of the viewing area is roped off for restaurants. There are equally great views from both Gellert Hill and Castle Hill which are more accessible and less crowded. It's definitely worth a visit - especially because it's right next to the magnificent Matthias Church. But not Budapest's top attraction."

The Bastion was built in Neo-Romanesque style in 1895-1902 by the talented architect Frigues Schulek, who restored Matthias Church at its best. It was created for the Millenium Anniversary celebrating 1000 years after 7 chieftains settled down in the Carpathian Basin in 896. That's how the Hungarian State was formed. The Bastion owes its name to the guild of fishermen who defended the city walls during the Middle Ages In war periods. They lived under the walls in what was called Fishtown or Watertown. There are 7 lookout towers for the first 7 tribes. During WWII it suffered a lot of damage but the son of Schulek, J\u00e0nos, managed to restore it according to his father's designs. By 1980 the Bastion had turned to grey colour due to heavy pollution. Now, after expensive restoration, it's a wonderful point for uninterrupted views over the Danube River and the Castle District as well. You may visit the lower parts free but if you want to go to the top of the turrets climbing a lot of steps, you pay a fee. The restaurant has outside sitting for good weather and the views are absolutely fantastic, wherever you manage to sit. The St.Michael Chapel may be visited for a small fee. It was revealed during excavations in the area."

You can enjoy the spectacular view while sipping on your favorite drink in the cozy coffee shop at the high point. Be sure to visit the St. Mathis Church and the Trinity Square in the adjacent distance. Make sure to visit the infamous Ruszwurm family run bakery that was establish in 1827, only a short walk away.

As it was a very clear day, the view across the Danube of Pest was so amazing. If you're into history and museum, you may spend longer time at some exhibitions there but the Fisherman's Bastion in itself to us was more of a viewing platform on a clear day over Pest. There was a queue to climb up the steps to the viewing area though. Not sure if you'd have to pay to get in or perhaps it was reserved only for tour groups? Even if you do not step your foot into the viewing area, there are some spots just outside the viewing are where it's still worthy of quality panoramic photography. They are located just before flights of stairs downhill from the Fisherman's Bastion. The walk down the bastion was easy as the steps were gentle, not as steep as we had previously anticipated. You may catch a taxi or a bus as you get off those steps if you do not like the idea of walking back to Adam's Square where the funicular awaits unadventurous visitors. We had no choice but to walk up the Castle Hill that day as the funicular was out of service but we didn't regret it at all as it was an easy walk though we had a 7 and a 5 years old on tow. Glad that the kids actually enjoyed the climb. Taking up the funicular up and down would have cost us 5800 Forints for a family of 2 adults and 2 children which was about 20 Euros so instead we spent that money having some refreshing coffee & pastries a few steps away from the funicular station. For a mere 5 minutes descent to the top of the hill, we thought the funicular was a pricey tourist trap as it only took us about 15 minutes to walk up the not-so-steep hill to appreciate the view from the top although we had two small kids tailing behind us. It was a good day for a visit mainly because the weather was on our side. Can't say much in terms of attractions for kiddos though."

The view from the towers is amazing and when you are walking on the walls, you really feel like a king from the medieval times. THough it looks much older, the bastion was constructed around 1896 to commemorate 1000 years from the Magyars settling in this area. Each of the 7 towers symbolizes one of their tribal chieftains. The statue of St. Stephen, the king who converted the Magyars to christianity is located in the courtyard, next to St. Matthias church. Also the view of the bastion from the Pest side, from the Danube promenade is amazing. Sitting on one of the benches next to the Danube on a summer night and enjoying the view of the Buda castle and the Fisherman's bastion is an apsolute must do while in Budapest."

Fisherman's Bastion offers photographers an excellent opportunity to take pictures of Pest, and of parts of Buda located below the bastion and between the bastion and the Danube. Another attraction is the restaurant that is a part of the bastion. It serves good food and drink, and its staff is a great group! Ask for the young woman, who is a hostess, who lived several years in Pennsylvania. She's a delight, and helped us find a seat. Above all, do not be afraid to walk about and poke into the back alleys and streets. You'll be surprised at the interesting shops and nice people.

A view to the river and to the beautiful building on the other side which is the Parliament. We had a guided tour in the old town around this area. Our guide said that the properties in this area are the most expensive in the city of Budapest. This bastion has its own restaurant which I believe caters to the tourists than the locals. The first time I went to Budapest 2 years ago, our tour guide booked a dinner in the restaurant here. And now, we ate in the restaurant again, presumably suggested by our tour guide in this trip. I can't blame them. It really has a beautiful evening more so in the evening."

Its multi-level walkways and staircases can be explored offering yet more incredible views. There are a number of cafes and restaurants and a small museum too.

We were lucky to have a guide who showed us everything worth seeing and told us the stories behind every single place. You have to hike the hills a little in order to get here but you won't regret it. The view over the Danube is great, also over the Parliament. 5/5 stars for this."

The funicular up the hill wasn't working the day we were there, but if it is, it allows ascent up the hill to the castle and museum, then a walk along the flat for about 1/2 mile to the BastionThere is a charge for the Bastion itself, but the views without going up onto the walls are free The view over the Danube toward the parliament buildings in the foreground and to the outskirts behind, is superb. The whiteness of the church and bastion is lovely and the church roof very pretty.Avoid the terrace caf\u00e9 south of the church, cant remember the name, but food and service poor.Combined with Matthias church, the castle and museum, in their elevated position in Buda, there's a good day's worth to see."

Visiting allows you to get higher than the other parts of this area and gives you fantastic views over the Danube. On the same evening we were able to go up again as there is no ticket requirement. I assume this is because the hoards of tourists have left buda and headed to pest where most of the hotels and restaurants are. The views at night are spectacular! Lots of the buildings are lit up and it really shows off the beauty of Budapest. This area is very busy in the day as it is top of the tourist itineraries but worth the hussle. At night it's much more relaxed, quiet and romantic."

We had been up to the area the previous day and had had a drink in the bar right next door overlooking the river so we knew the views where going to be spectacular but we couldn't wait to see them at night. We were given a table by the window overlooking the Parliament Buildings all lit up and to the right of it was one of the bridges - it was stunning. Out of all the restaurants we have been to this was definitely the one with the wow factor! Perfect lighting, beautiful interior with huge chandaliers, gypsy music, in fact they came to our table and played two beatles songs on our request. For the entire night we where treated like loyalty - the service is superb! The meal was very good and well presented and by the time you finish three courses and the bread you are satisfied because the food is very rich. Don't get me wrong, I have had better food but the overall experience of this restarant is not something you come across everyday, I mean how often do you get to dine in a fairytale castle with views like that! Thank you to the staff at Fisherman's Bastion for making my husbands night so special!"

It is rather a touristy area, with many tour groups at midday when I visited, but it is just begging to be photographed. As it turns out, it was built just for the 1896 centennial, but it has a great flavor and architecture. Numerous lookouts with panorama picture opportunities looking back over the Danube and Pest side. The arches frame the view nicely, and it is a nice place to sit on a short wall on a sunny day and plan your next stop"

It is a little bit hard to walk to it, as you shall step up the stairs, but it worths it, as from it you can see half of the Budapest and the view is magnificent. You will see the Danub river, the bridge and mane other things. Don't miss a chance to make beautifull photos for your memory album."

This is a stonework and concrete construction on the precipice of Buda Hill just next to the Cathedral and the Hilton Hotel. It is self-explanatory. Simply go there and take in the sights.

The price of the meal for two including wine , water & two glasses of Hungarian 40c proof brandy \u00a3140 which for the quality & setting in a capital city is very reasonable .

There is a short funicular railway which starts just across from Chain Bridge, although there is often a queue for it. You can also get a bus up which stops near the top of Castle Hill. There is also a set of steps. We got the bus up and walked down which worked perfectly. I would recommend walking across Chain Bridge on the way there or back or both ways, as the views from the bridge are amazing. As are the views from Fisherman's Bastion. It really is a photographer's delight, both the actual bastion itself and the views over Budapest. Plus there are all sorts of other things to see and do once you get to Castle Hill. Probably worth spending at least half a day there."

Our Big Bus tour stopped at the bottom of the hill so we enjoyed a walk up Castle Hill and to the Fisherman's Bastion at the top. I think there are also accessible bus routes that visit this location if you're of a local transport traveler, and a small train. However, I enjoyed looking around area - there are so cute shops and a lovely fountain on the hill up the Fisherman's Bastion. I suggest you allow a bit of time for visiting here. Take your time and go slow as it's likely to be filled to the brim with tourists and there is no point in rushing. Make sure that you take in the surroundings and admire other nearby buildings such as Matthias Church, which is a landmark in it's own right and possibly one of the prettiest, over the top churches I've ever seen. If you want to get in side I think the ticket office is on the other side of the street, not actually by the church - but anyway. Once you're at the Fisherman's Bastion be sure to take some obligatory tourist snaps, and get climbing! The top offers stunning views over Budapest, featuring some of the main landmarks. You can get stunning photos and it's the place to go for a view, for sure. There's also a small cafe, and various ice cream shops just across the road if you're there for a snack. Plenty of shade if you want to sit down and rest your legs, but there isn't much else to do. Also, it's not actually a castle - It makes for a stunning view when viewed close up, below, or from a distance. Looks like a real 'Disney' castle."

There is no real purpose for the buildings, in fact, never has been. They are just there to look pretty, and they do a good job of that. If you've got the energy, be sure to climb to the top at the north end. No need to pay to go to the top level (like you see at the south end). There is a little restaurant tucked into the bastions, but it was closed while we were there (late afternoon). Just as well. The view of the Parliament Buildings is excellent. It is humbling to think the amount of work that went into creating these stone structures back in 1896 before cranes and backhoes.It is definitely worth mentioning that the Fisherman's Bastion has the best bathrooms! And they are free. Go towards the north end (furthest away from Matthias Church) and look for a stairwell leading down. One floor down and you'll get to use the nicest, free public restrooms you've ever seen."

The site of the highest part of the old city's walls, Fisherman's Bastion, on Castle Hill, provides the best postcard view of the Blue Danube River flowing through Budapest. The bastion is large enough so that it requires care and maintenance (in the Middle Ages this area of the wall was defended by the Fisherman's guild). The architecture with seven Cinderella towers, one for each tribe in the Magyar Confederation of 830 AD that participated in the \"land taking,\" is beautiful and majestic, like the grounds of a castle. The bastion is right next to the Mathias Church whose steeple can be seen from the Pest side. The view and the convenience of the bastion are well worth the entrance fee which includes maintenance of the building and regulation of the flow of people who are admiring the view at any one time. In more ways than one, Fisherman's Bastion is a high point of any visit to Budapest."

We like to go up there at least once on a visit to Budapest to sit and sip either a glass of beer if the weather is warm or a hot mulled wine if not. When it's cold there are heaters turned on so it is usually comfortable to sit there.

We chose to buy a 48 hour ticket in advance on the 'hop on, hop off' bus, which proved to be excellent value because it included a river tour and a night bus tour and although local public transport seemed excellent and apparently cheap, I found the currency with its very large numbers a little difficult to gets to grips with for a short stay."

That side of the river has great history & if you didn't visit you would never know. If you enjoy walking its a good hike up"

Many of the ads for Budapest are photographed from this bastion. Worth the long hike up from the river, or take the bus. (We took the bus up but walked down; a nice walk if not too hot.)It's right next to an incredible church, Saint Matthias which is well worth a visit. And it's walking distance to many other places worth touring. There are restaurants up here and they sell fast foo too so plenty to eat. The Pest side is fine but the Buda hill around the bastion is much nicer ... not a typical crowded city scene."

Due to a family member being in a wheelchair we entered from the gated entry of Buda Castle as the Hungarian Royal Palace is located there. Only cars with permits can enter unless you have a physical disability. Your taxi or guide car will have to pay a fee. You can take public transportation (bus) to the lower entrance of Fisherman's Bastion (1895-1902) where there are many many steps to climb but you can also take the funicular which is wheelchair accessible but that will take you to the Royal Palace. There is also an entry fee for the lower part of the bastion where there is a chapel and cafe. The top of Fisherman's Bastion, the balcony area or upper area, which is street level is free and it is wheelchair accessible. There are cobblestones but they are manageable. The view is breathtaking of the Danube where you can watch the cruise ships and see the famous Chain Bridge. You can also see Pest (especially the Hungarian Parliament Building) and Gellert Hill. In the middle of the Bastion you can see the all seven lookout towers each representing a Hungarian tribe that settled the Carpathian Basin. This is great place for taking photos and to relax by sitting on the stoned arched walls and admire all the stone work (figures, walls, and towers). The Bastion is close to Matthias Church (which has a ramp on the side closest to the Bastion) with its great architectural design, impressive bell tower, and colorful diamond patterned roof tiles. Free for those in wheelchairs. Close to the church and in front of part of the Bastion is the large bronze statue of King Stephen I mounted on a horse (1906). We were also told we were almost directly across (closer to the Parliament Building) from the very moving \"Shoes on the Danube\" Holocaust memorial site (2005). From Fisherman's Bastion it was a short walk to the Hungarian Royal Palace....with more cobblestones. There are many shops on the main street (most are not wheelchair accessible) but some cafes had outdoor seating between the two attractions.The sidewalks were paved and easy to navigate. There is much to see in this 2-3 block area and well worth a visit."

It is has a romantic charm which looks down upon the parliament building and the stunning buildings along the river.

A good place for views across the city.Bastion itself will only be a short stop and look, but allow at least a couple of hours for walking around and seeing the church and craft shops and galleries.

After a very long walk around the Pest side of the city we crossed over the stunning Liberty Bridge to the Buda side to visit the castle & Fishermans Bastion. Unfortunately the vernacular railway was not in operation so we climbed to the top and made our way, via the castle, to the Bastion. The views of the Danube and the other side of the river are breathtaking and well worth the visit. It was quite cold but we snuggled under blankets provided by a cafe in one of the turrets and sat drinking hot mulled wine looking out at the view. It was one of those moments in life that you know you will never forget :-)"

Here is the prime spot to adjust your direction of view and see them all. During quiet periods you have the additional advantage of being able to gaze at the flood-lit Parliament building in all its gothick splendour on the far side of the Danube. Peckish - then have a sausage or snack from the kiosk too.For the well-healed you could do all this in style from the interior of local Hilton that shares the view. But if you want an authentic Hungarian occasion then join the masses on the Bastion and the sweeping staircases below to celebrate yet another year. You might even learn some Hungarian, even if its only 'cheers'!"

It's easy to see why, the view from up there of the city is absolutely phenomenal and allows for amazing photo opps. We took the tram to the bottom of the hill and walked up to it through the palace grounds, in which you can also see the changing of the guards. TIP: Bus no16 and 16A goes to the Fisherman's Bastion and you can use your BKK travel tickets on that if you don't fancy the walk. TIP: Take a croissant or something nice from a Pekseg (bakery) in the town before you venture up here, there are plenty of eateries, but they all have incredibly over inflated prices for basic food. Do yourself a favour and get something lovely from an independent in the VII district before you get into the horror of tourist-ville."

The Fisherman\u2019s Bastion is located on the Buda hill, just behind the Matthias Church.It has been built, according to neo-Gothic and neo-Romanesque styles, at the end of XIX century, following the design of Hungarian architect Frigyes Schulek, same designer of adjacent Matthias Church.The purpose of the Bastion is to constitute a viewing panoramic terrace on the town; it\u2019s connecting seven turrets, representing the seven tribe\u2019s chieftains who settled-down Hungary at the end of 1st century.It seems that its name origins from the fishermen who lived just under the old town medieval walls, in the so called Fishtown, between the Danube and Buda Castle. Such people were spending their life by fishing and selling their fish in the old town; in case of any potential attack, once climbed to the old town walls, they were acting as a first defense against muggers.The panoramas from the Fisherman\u2019s Bastion are breath-taking, especially on a sunny day, when the view is extending by kilometers.A stair, departing from the Bastion, allows to climb-down to the Danube bank in just 10 min; simply follow the direction to the river through alleys and narrow stairs."

Perhaps I'm a little bias, but visiting here was the highlight of my trip to Budapest as this was the spot I asked my girlfriend to marry me!I couldn't have picked a more perfect spot though. We arrived around 8pm when it was all lit up and looking like something out of a Disney movie. There were still some people around though and we wandered around the ramparts taking in the breath taking views towards Pest. I would recommend anyone to visit here at night as the buildings over the river look amazing all lit up and you can see all the main sites from here.Then, in a quiet turret, facing the parliament building, when we were all alone, i went down on one knee and asked my girlfriend if she would marry me. I am pleased to say that she said yes, and even though i would like to think that she would have said yes no matter where we were, being surrounded by such beautiful scenery certainly helped!"

The turrets are pure fairy tale and there is a nice little restaurant up there with wonderful views day or night. It is also where you can enter St. Mattias church with it's multi-colored tile roof. There are additional restaurants and shops on the back side of the church (actually the front) and a currency exchange window with VERY beneficial rates."

Every dish is served with a silver lid that gets ceromoniously removed after the plate is served. The views are looking at the Parliament buildings. There is some live classical music in the restaurant and a violinist will stop by your table to ask to play. We found it a little loud and difficult to have a quiet conversation, so you can easily just say \"no thanks\" and they will understand."

We are not sure if it has been recently renovated, because everything looked very well-kept. Also, do visit the Fisherman's Bastion during the day and the night time, both views are spectacular. One thing that makes Budapest amazing is that the city is very well-lit in the important places. Strong beams of lights are focused on the Fisherman's Bastion and other important landmarks at night, making them extra photo-worthy.The bastion used to charge for entry, but not anymore!"

The Fisherman's Bastion is situated on the right side of Danube, in Buda. It was not very difficult to find it due to a well-planned map and nice people who gave me some tips. :) The Bastion has seven towers which are vey much-alike with those from the fairy tales, the architecture is stunning and the view of the Danube and the entire city was breathtaking. I strongly recommend to visit this place when in Budapest, not only for its special and romantic view, but also for the surroudings -near-by there is the Roman-Catholic church(Matthias Church) which is quite impressive also. So, yes, you shoul visit the Bastion and simply enjoy the view from there! Have fun!"

Although I was only In Budapest briefly, as I had a flight leaving from Vienna the next day, I was still taken by the city in the brief time I was there. To get to the bastion it requires a little bit of walking up steep stairs, if you are in decent physical health it should be fine. The bastion itself is divided into two sections. The lower level, which is free, and the upper level that requires pay, and I did not go up it as I was low on forints (Hungarian currency) at the time. There is also a restaurant on the upper level as well. Regardless, the bastion is a must see just for the vantage point you get of the Danube with many of the cities most well known sights, such as the Parliament House, Chain Bridge, St. Stephen's Basilica. For me the views here were far more impressive than that of Vienna and I highly recommend a visit."

Hence, we did not go up.Also, there are multiple souvenir shops on the way from the hop-on hop-off stop to the Bastion. If you are looking to buy magnet souvenirs, we found that this section has the most reasonable priced ones. Even 1 euro / 300 ft ones available.There are also some restaurants along the way. We had a hearty meal overlooking the beautiful location. However, as all touristy locations, the price for food here is comparatively 20%-30% more than a restaurant in the city."

Again, I was taking pictures frantically in the tower whilst we had it to ourselves, and then my partner of 5 years got down on one knee to propose!! I was completely surprised.

I love spending my evening here and enjoy some drinks while sitting at the cafe overlook the Danube and the city of Budapest. Is a must visit place in Budapest! You may want to take a stroll/walk to this place from the city and it takes about 15 - 20 minutes and later take a bus back to the town."

It has now been restored and sits in gleaming white stone on Castle Hill. It is a spectacular spot, but in reality is is now just a good spot to look down over Budapest. It is however not \"Free\" as you can only get to the lower levels for free, the really good views require a ticket. It is a great spot to take pictures of the city and since it is close to the Cathedral certainly worth a visit. Just be aware that there is not actually a lot here."

It's only about a century old and is a neo-gothic structure that's never been part of the city's defenses. It was pretty crowded when we were there but the open terrace is free and offers good views over the river and looking towards the Pest side. We were told the food in the restaurant there is pretty good but the time of day wasn't right for dining so can't give a personal comment. It's more of a point of interest than something historic, but is right next to the beautiful Matthias church which is also well worth a visit."

However, from what remained and the potential that I saw from the building I would thoroughly recommend it. The walls are among the most beautiful and exquisite walls I have ever seen on a castle, and from them you can see all the way across Pest to the horizon. I hope one day to return again and finish my exploration once the renovations have finished.The cafe/restaurant built into it did seem quite nice from the outside, but expensively priced - as did a lot of the area around castle hill in Buda. Save your money and stock up on drinks whilst in Pest before making the trip, would be my advice. Drinks one will certainly need if they attempt it, as I did, in the middle of the day. The hill isn't too large, but it is an exhausting climb with how hot it can get."

A glass of fresh fruit juice was a shocking 2000 Forint, and souvenirs were obscenely priced too. Suggestion: don't make the Bastion the only reason to visit this part of town. Combine it with a leisurely walk around the Castle District. Do it on your own, not as part of a group with a fixed itinerary. Soak in the history, the views. Just be careful with your wallet.

There is a section that you have to pay to go higher up nearer the beginning but further in there are sections even higher again (& the same height) that were free so I don't see why you would pay for the earlier part!"

Fisherman's Bastion is a terrace in neo-Gothic and neo-Romanesque style situated on the Buda bank of the Danube, on the Castle hill in Budapest, around Matthias Church. It was designed and built between 1895 and 1902 on the plans of Frigyes Schulek. Between 1947\u201348, the son of Frigyes Schulek, J\u00e1nos Schulek, conducted the other restoration project after its near destruction during World War II.From the towers and the terrace a panoramic view exists of Danube, Margaret Island, Pest to the east and the Gell\u00e9rt Hill.Its seven towers represent the seven Magyar tribes that settled in the Carpathian Basin in 896.The Bastion takes its name from the guild of fishermen that was responsible for defending this stretch of the city walls in the Middle Ages. It is a viewing terrace, with many stairs and walking paths.A bronze statue of Stephen I of Hungary mounted on a horse, erected in 1906, can be seen between the Bastion and the Matthias Church. Adjacent stands the very modern Hilton Hotel which really challenges building regulations!!"

But if you go to the castle district and keep walking to where all the tourist are going, you'll find St Matthias church and the Bastion, for both of which you'll have to pay to enter. I'd say the Bastion is not worth to pay for. You get the same astonishing views from other sides of the Castle district. Plus at the end of the Bastion there's a small bar-caf\u00e9, to which you can climb for free."

This doesn't go down well with me. If it's free, it should be free; if there's a price to pay for the visit, I'd be willing to do so - but this particular mixture of \"free\" versus \"kind-of-free-but-you-must-consume-something-which-will-likely-be-overpriced\" doesn't apply to me.

Fabulous views and within easy walking distance of the Palace as well.

In the morning you get the sun in the face, which makes it difficult to get clear photographs without a lot messing around with exposure settings. Late afternoon you tend to get richer results and the area tens to be a little quieter. Not sure the extra payment for a part of the upper section is really worth it, but it does help pay for the upkeep of the area and has helped pay for the restoration and clean up.Well worth a visit. Come up on the 16 bus. Better option than queuing for the lift up."

Now, it's just a fanciful structure that affords a great view of the Pest side of the Danube, including the parliament building. There is also a cafe if you want to sip a beer or coffee while you take in the view. Of course, all the other tourists in Budapest will be sharing the view with you.

I saw people paying for entry to one part of the turrets-why do this when you can get to the same height and view from the other end without a cost. Yes, it is wortwhile seeing for the view and the history of the Bastion itself, but that is really where the story ends."

Along with the nearby Matthias Church, they make up an example of stunning architecture you wouldn't expect in a European city. The views of the city are great as well.There are a couple of ways to get there but I recommend the (longer but way less steep) path leading to the Buda Castle which you're probably going to visit anyway and then the nice, flat, shady pathway to the church and the Bastion. I made the mistake of choosing one of the random narrow streets where I felt as if I were going against a 45-degree slope with tens of similarly steep steps waiting for me at the end. Surely a lot faster but not a good choice if you're not in good shape/like such challenges."

I have to say as beautiful as the rest of the Castle was; Halaszbastya really struck me. It looks like something out of Grimm's fairy tales and mostly is free to view. You do have to pay to go right to the top walkway, however the free parts are just as stunning. A must for a group photograph. You can see a great panorama of the Pest side of Budapest, and you can spend hours just finding new details within the masonry. The Bastion offers a fabulous view of the Parliament building and all of the bridges. We walked back down the steps and found an amazing sculpture at the bottom of the steps. Worth the walk to see this, and I genuinely cannot remember anything comparable in other places I have visited."

Granted the sandwich was packaged but it was sizable and tasty. The view was worth it for the chance to sit and admire the Parliament building on the other side of the Danube. Overall cost was reasonable. It looked like there was an area to pay to go to the top of level of the bastion which we didn't do. This is the area on the right. We went up the stairs on the left side where there is a little bar but no one was at the tables and we took our unobstructed pictures over there. Go later in the afternoon if you are looking for it to be less crowded. The busloads of tourists looked to descend on the castle area first thing.

For views, there are lots of opportunities from the restaurant by Hilton so after we walked back and paid to take the stairs up to here (no strollers allowed up the stairs, leave it with the ticket attendants), we had already seen the view from the restaurant that has the same stone structure as here. And, we had little help from the counter when we asked what the tickets are for, they sell tickets for this which is just for a flight of stairs over a section with views, and they sell tickets for the chapel. We didn't do the chapel. There were hardly any people at the Bastion, compared to the restaurant. But, still I could not justify the tickets price when views are all over and free.Don't be misled by my ratings.

You'll find staircases that lead up side streets cars can't travel up, and when you clear the last staircase at the foot of the Bastion there is a lovely little grassy trail, leading into a brick and stone tunnel untouched by time. Stepping out of that tunnel to the site of the cathedral and Bastion is a much better reveal than stepping off of a bus or walking through the crowded touristy spots. If you can time it right, go at sunset, the light and shadow dancing around the curves and points of the building make for great photos and you can stop and have a drink at the top and watch the sun set over the Danube and all the lights start to twinkle on over on the Pest side.

Easily the best views of Pest can be found here since you get an unobstructed look.Do NOT pay for the 700 entrance \"fee\" to the bastion as it only gives you one area extra to view from which makes no sense since the public area gives you the same view.Views are stunning so definitely a must if in Budapest"

My views of Pest were not as great as they would have been on a much clearer, sunnier day, but were still high and unobstructed.The Bastion itself is very interesting, and the architecture is lovely. A lot of people have described it as 'Disney-esque' and I would agree with this. Overall, a great place to visit for a while if you are in the Castle Hill district and want to get some great views."

We watched while a curtain of rain clouds crossed a clear blue sky, submerged the city then passed over. Breathtaking!"

Many wonderful photo opportunities and panoramic views all over the place. There is a small supermarket on the street about 100metres towards the Castle, we bought some fresh baked goodies and sat in the park to eat our cheap lunch. You can buy food and beers at the top of the Bastion, but of course it is quite pricey and the tourists taking photos would be a pain to deal with if you were after a quiet drink."

I also regret that I botched a camera shot that should have been a real keeper. It was a clear day, and the panoramic view of the city and the Danube waterfront from these heights made me glad that I brought my best camera. Unfortunately, while framing what should have been a masterful photo of the Hungarian Parliament Building, one of the most strikingly beautiful public buildings in all of Europe, I failed to notice a solar array in the near foreground. I could have avoided the problem by a small shift of position, but that\u2019s just 20-20 hindsight. Watch out for that solar array!"

The table was large for the four of us giving us plenty of room for cutlery, glasses etc. There was a very full menu but we chose to follow the chefs recommendations and followed the four course menu. Service throughout was impeccable and very friendly and we must single out the sommelier for particular attention. His recommendations for wines to accompany courses were faultless and, perhaps more importantly, he guided us to an excellent wine shop for later purchases.

Bring a picnic if you can!The view over Pest is stunning, and it is well worth the walk across the Danube and up the hill. (There is a walkway with steps all the way up to the Palace from where it is only a 5-10min walk to the Bastion.)As with most of Budapest's \"old\" tourist sites though, the Bastion was never a Bastion, has nothing to do with fishermen, and was built to be pretty for visitors... (Mission accomplished!)The area is *very* crowded on a nice day, full of tourists taking pictures, but don't let that spoil it for you! Also, try to avoid the overly touristy (and ridiculously overpriced) restaurants immediately off the church square."

The building itself is a thing of beauty, and the views are incredible. We enjoyed an overpriced sandwich at one of the small dining areas available, service was lovely and the waiter very attentive. It is a must do in Budapest!"

It was a stunner day when we were up there, musicians were playing, the views were unrivalled, and the atmosphere very relaxed. Whilst you're up Castle Hill, there's plenty to do. Look out for the men doing falconry - one of them has a massive bird, and only asks 1800 HUF to have a go (well worth the photos opportunities)."

Fisherman's Bastion is a decorative terrace and fortification which attractively sits upon Castle Hill, just past St. Matthias Church. The structure was built by Hungarian architect, Frigyes Schulek, between 1895 and 1902. Here you can see a beautiful series of neo-gothic and neo-Romaneque style lookout towers, which have a fairy-tale like quality about them. You almost expect this to be something from a Disney movie or story when you first see it. The terraces are in very good condition and make a nice place to visit, rest and to take beautiful panoramic photographs of the Danube River and the city below. There are walkways from below that lead up the Fisherman's Bastion. We much preferred approaching this attraction instead of from behind. This gives you a nice perspective of the attraction. Interestingly, the name, Fisherman's Bastion, seems to derive from the guild of fishermen that were believed to have been responsible for defending this stretch of the city walls during Medieval times. At this location you can also see the bronze equestrian statue of St. Stephen, the Holy Trinity Column before or after visiting the lovely St. Matthias Church.Overall, we very much enjoyed Fisherman's Bastion and found it one of the more memorable individual attractions in Budapest. It is perfectly situated upon Castle Hill next to an equally impressive St. Matthias Church. Both are very much worthy of visiting while in the city."

It shocked me - I expected Budapest to retain a tatterdemalion Cold War-era ambience and instead it is rapidly on its way to truly living up to its \"Paris on the Danube\" moniker. Arriving at night on the river with everything bathed in gold was amazing (my husband, not one easily impressed, said it was a \"fairy tale\") but in the day from Fisherman's Bastion it was as impressive. We were on our honeymoon and this was probably the most romantic setting we were in all the way from Passau to Budapest, including Salzburg, Vienna and the surprisingly quaint Bratislava. People rhapsodize about Prague but Budapest never seems to get a lot of play - I want to go back and spend more time there.This area of Budapest, while touristy (hey, there's a reason things are touristy - people like them!)has the usual local talent with their little boxes awaiting coins - the violin players, the falconers, the dancers - interesting shops and sights (such as the bullet-pockmarked building from the war, left with only 2 floors, once had 6), and cafes. There is an open-air crafts fair where the crafts are more inexpensive (albeit I think of a slightly lower quality) than in the shops facing, but you'll need to pull cash from the ATM (there's one across the street) first."

Best IMHO is to buy a tram ticket from your hotel or an appropriate shop. And from Pest take a 4 or 6 tram and get off at the second last stop, Szena Ter. From the stop, Immediately cross the tram tracks and road towards the hill and fork right up the slope towards the castle following the signs. About 300 yards up you will see barriers and a gate system under a medieval bridge leading to the enclosed Castle District area. Take either fork to the left and you will see the Matthias Church, which used to be the coronation church of Hungary, on your left. Go either side of it and the Bastion is round the back. The towers and wall are superb, built in the very late 19th century in neoclassical style.. Arrange to leave just around time of sunset if you can as the city is illuminated from behind you. The views are amazing.(Try to combine with a museum/castle visit and check opening times. The Castle is shut on the Mondays but the church and labyrinth are close by if you have no choice) Note the pock-marking of the buildings and the lion statues from WWII bullets and shrapnel. Food and drink are available nearby along with toilets for which there is a charge. There is Matthias church beside it which is not to be missed and the art gallery, Labytinth and Pharmacy nearby. A Funicular railway is available for those who wish but the walk down the Zigzag and over the chain bridge will work up a thirst and / or appetite!"

The Fisherman's Bastion on Castle Hill, Buda is an incredible fairy tale like construction which includes a combination of neo-Gothic and neo-Romanesque architecture and consists of turrets, projections, parapets, and climbing stairways. You may think that you are on the set of a movie like \"Sleeping Beauty\" or the like. In the bastion there are seven towers that represent each of the Magyar tribes that settled Hungary in the ninth century, but of course it is all fake, that is it was built in the twentieth century at the place where in mediaeval times the guild of fishermen had built ramparts to help defend the original castle. Sited as it is at the top of the hill near to St. Matthias Church not only does it afford fantastic views of the Danube and Pest but is a great place to explore the old town and all the surrounding area. It has to be the number one place to get acquainted with Budapest from."

On the contrary to what many people think, it was built not long ago, in the beginning of the 20th century, as a monument to the fishermen who protected this part of the city . The view of the Pest side is dominated by the Parliament and the St. Stephen Basilica, and it's certainly the best place to take pictures of the city! There's a fee to go to the top level, but it's completely unnecessary, since the views are equally beautiful from the lower levels."

The Bastion is a must see and free to visit also, the views over the city of Pest are simply amazing. My advice is to visit the bastion as the sun goes down for photographs as the city comes alive at night. You will get stunning pictures of the parliament building and bridges over the Danube. My previous visit I went up to the Bastion in the day which is also nice. Take the funicular railway up and walk back down is my advice and have a beer or coffee at the bottom in the square. The church at the top is also beautiful but I'm disappointed that Hilton have muscled thee way into building a hotel next to it since I visited 7 years ago this looks and is very out of place and ruins the ambiance. A Shame that huge corporations can wave there cash at a poorer nation for profit without a care for the impact it has on the city, people and environment."

This is a highly over-rated attraction as it is simply a promenade for which you can take paranoiac pictures of the Danube river and the Hungarian parliament building. There is a much nicer paranoid view of the pest side of the city which is near the statue prince Eugene of savoy which s next to the Tula bird statue after taking the cable car up to the presidential palace. Ths pace is more scenic, quieter and a lt less crowded. If you are not careful, they will charge you admission fees to see the same scenery as what you can see better at the other location i mentioned."

It is romantic place to be and offers terrific city views. it is part of the Buda Castle area, so if you're already there, take the short walk north to check it out. There is a bus line (16) that will take you up/down the hill if you don't feel like walking as much. It hits Deak Ferenc ter and Clark Adam ter, so you can pick up this bus from the Buda side of the chain bridge or via any of the metro lines that arrive at Deak ferenc ter on the Pest side.  The view is fantastic, especially if you buy the admission ticket that lets you go to the top part of the structure...or if you have a drink or snack at the cafe inside. You can easily not pay and just walk around the area, as there are still lookouts for those that don't cough up the 500 or so forint admission. There are also plenty of nice cafes around the area that don't charge quite as much (although they also don't have the gorgeous view either). The Gellert mountain's view is wider and more unobstructed, and also does not charge admission...so if you want the best views of the city and Danube, you will be all set if you go to both Fisherman's bastion AND Gellert mountain."

What is there is impressive, the views from the castle walls spectacular, as is the bottom entrance. It is possible for those who find stirs difficult to get to the top and enjoy some of the views. There is a coffee shop there too which was great protection from the very cold winds on Friday 27 September when we visited. We were on a tour and am sad to say did not have enough time.

The architecture looks like it came straight out of a fairy tale. You can't take a bad picture here. It's impossible! In fact, some of our best pictures were taken here and at Matthias Church.

The building has a fairytale quality, the views are fantastic but the scrum of people aggressively pushing to take their snap takes the shine off. Go 1st thing in the morning, we were thereat about 6:30pm and it was mobbed. The irony that this monument to normal working men is largely closed off unless you are dining at a restaurant that normal fishermen probably couldn't have afforded to eat in was not lost on me."

You will beed it in the middle of June. Especially, if you are going there by foot, like I did. The climb is not the easiest, even there is a good road all the way. And it's more expensive on-site, than from the local grocery store in the city. You, who want it easy, can take a blue hop-on hop-off bus. But, by foot you will see much more. Same goes with the Mountain Gellert."

That it is also near the huge church, the equestrian statue of Szent Istvan and many other sights didn't hurt. There are many vendors of \"genuine homemade Hungarian\" whatevers. The prices are a bit inflated and they are banking on the Florint being so different in value from the pound sterling, the euro and the dollar that they will be able to ask a price that has little or no relation to the actual value of the item. Not a dislike as I approve of free enterprise, but do keep your acquisitive spirit in check with a currency converter application on your phone.As you walk away from the Bastion to the left is the Coronation Church and the monument to the Holy Trinity. Make a left at the monument and you will walk toward the old Ministry of Defense Building. In between are some very interesting buildings still in commercial use."

You get good views of the Danube and the Pest side of the River from this monument, but it's annoying to pay for a ticket and find that on the other side of the building you can walk up to the same height and get similar views \"free, gratis and for nothing\" as they say in my country. The reason is probably because there's a restaurant at the free end, and so anyone is able to walk up whether or not you partake of food or drink up there. It's not clear if they are just being amenable, or if they have the right to restrict access due to their lease of the premises, but before you buy a ticket for the ticket office end of the Bastion, see if you can get up the other side for nothing."

The views are fantastic and the structure is pretty, but there is nothing else to do here except for a restaurant.

If you just move down along Fishermans bastion to the left you can go up even higher for the view without paying any fee, so i fail to see why anyone would pay the fee. There is a cafe with the exact same view as everyone else has so i'd only grab something there to eat if you really want to eat and find the choices and prices appealing, we didn't."

The Fisherman's Bastion tells one of those famous stories. Why I liked my visit is based on the fact that Budapest's architecture suffered greatly during the bombings of World War two and the Fisherman's Bastion is a great example of how modern construction can be made to blend with classic design of the past. Take the opportunity to visit."

There's even a cafe at the very top in case you need to warm up (which we did during March at minus six that day). The views of the Danube river and the Orszagh\u00e1z or the Parliament Building are absolutely stunning. Take a video shot with your cell phone, your relatives and friends will thank you for this. Tip: for a great coffee and treat, head to the Hotel Hilton across the street.

While the views from this location are very pleasant, there are may locations along the Castle district where a fantastic view can be appreciated.

Having paid to walk along the 50 metres or less of walkway and then gone to the nearby cafe which is free about 20 metres away and with a higher vantage point I was a little mythed as to what on earth I had paid for."

I nodded and put it on my To Do list. A view of a river with buildings illuminated at night? Been there, done that or so I thought.I diligently read the reviews on TA and looked over the photos. Pretty, but I've seen lots of majestic, time-weathered, historical and cultural structures. Places where empires thrived and declined. In comparison, this could only be a bit of stone eye-candy. And crowds? No thanks.Nevertheless, I planned the visit to include a few nights in a hotel nearby, the luxurious Buda Castle Fashion Hotel. I figured that if we were going to see the Hal\u00e1szb\u00e1stya, we should see it properly -- late at night and early in the morning. And I am so very glad that I figured right!The night we arrived, part of the structure was cordoned off. Film crew! The walls and towers were brightly illuminated by the spotlights. We climbed up to the cafe in the tower, chatted with the lone attendant and imagined how pleasant it must be to have a drink up there in the summer. Looking across to the glowing Parliament, I started to feel the enchantment.The next morning at 8 am, we rolled out of our comfy beds and went for an early morning stroll. The film crew was gone (good riddance!) and the Bastion was ours! What a view! With the place to ourselves, we wandered about for a good half hour. I admired the various lines, angles and curves of the structure as well as the statue of Szent Istv\u00e1n Kir\u00e1ly (Saint King Stephen).After a delicious breakfast at the hotel, we headed out again. The daytime crowds had descended on the plaza. Soon, the tacky souvenir vendors would arrive....See the Halaszbastya late at night or early in the morning."

I saw one man nearly slip over the edge (which would have killed him) but he caught himself just in time and an old man fell heavily on the water-soaked stones. Budapest in general seemed to have a dedicated workforce of snow-clearers so why they ignored such a treacherous tourist spot I have no idea.The view is beautiful, a great location for pictures of the palace, chain bridge, Danube and parliament.I do disagree with the comments others have left about cost to see the best view, it was free for us. All you need to do is walk through the coffee shop and outside."

On the day we wen there was two men dressed in old Hungarian costumes with hawks, that you could have your photo taken with.What I like about Budapest/Hungary is that nothing is a rip off as in the UK. 1000 Huf to go inside the bastion area, 1200Huf for the nearby Palace.During our stay we used the 'Giraffe' Hop on/Hop off bus service, and on the red route this is stop No 11(for both the bastion and Palace). We would highly recommend this bus service for 5000Hufs each you got two days travel and also a river cruise thrown in. There are two or thre others but they didn not look as good and I think the bus headphones have about 15-29 languages."

And it is the most eye catching, beautiful, romantic treasure we have ever found.....so much so we went twice. The views of it and looking out from it are just out of this world.....it's like a fairy tale dream world that if your in Budapest you just can't miss."

It was build at the end of the 19th- beginning 20th century, with neo-romanesque architecture in mind. It's placed near the Matthias church, which gives it the perfect entourage. There is a restaurant and a bar within the towers of the bastion and in the summer you can sit at the terrace of the bastion. Several stories are told about the name of the bastion...One of them is that in older times fishermen used to guard this part of the castle hill. The views are amazing and the building itself is best seen at night, descent from the stairs of the bastion and look up for some amazing pictures as well!"

It just seemed that you could get most of the same views from walking further down and entering the Bar/coffee place and taking pictures there. I will say that it did allow me a different angle on the Matthias church and another statue around there. I would obviously suggest visiting the area because it is quote pretty and even take pictures of the Fisherman's Bastion but at the end of the trip my dad and I agreed that this was probably the one place that wasn't really worth the cost of entry.

It's an beautiful view on the Danube and by night it's like a little fairytale, because the architecture seems to be inspired by the Cinderella story.

In there morning there are very few tourists and the light at that time really compliments the building. At night it is all wonderfully lit and I saw perhaps 5 other people. But during the day it is just another tourist nightmare. Hundreds visiting which really takes something away from the place"

You can also take the funicular (kind of like a cable car) up the hill, but it is difficult to take pics fm the car and also too short a ride to do so. I would suggest walking up, because the ride is not worth the wait or the price. I think it costs like $4 or $5 USD for a 30 second ride.Once you get to the top, there are vendors selling Hungarian souvenirs before you get to fishermans bastion. From the top you get great views of the city. I took most of my budapest photos from this vantage point. There are also spots where you can sit and have a drink overlooking the city. I would suggest going on a weekday, because it was so crowded with tourist on the weekend, that it was difficult to jockey for a spot to take pics.I do agree with one other reviewer who mentioned walt Disney must have gotten his inspiration from this structure. I was expecting Mickey mouse to pop up somewhere!"

I recommend just visiting the free side because it's closer to Parliament, and therefore, has better views than the non-free side.

The church has an amazing history that is on the grounds and the Hilton Hotel has some relics in the hotel that they didn't disturb. You can walk to the left of the square and get on a horse and carriage ride, visit several souviner shops and to experience the bread that is wrapped around a rolling pin. They cook the bread over coals and the bread is rotated. You can put vanilla, cinnamon, cocoa, coconut or nuts on it. Our favorite was cinnamon. This was on of the first things we did on our trip and it was lovely."

It's very nice to be able to see the bastion and Matthias Church next to it in daylight! We didn't go on the viewpoint, because it's not worth spending money on. You have great views on the entire hill and the viewpoint (Citadella) on Gell\u00e9rt Hill is free :) You can chose to climb the hill yourself, take a funicular or even take the bus."

I am not certain when the place is less crowded but I would love to spend some time there, just to enjoy the spectacular views and get lost in my thoughts. Prices of ice cream and drinks sold by outdoor vendors are sky high. But there's a kiosk just a few steps before approaching Matthias church/Fisherman's Bastion. After our visit to the bastion and the church, we had lunch at a self-service eatery just a few steps from the church (right side of the road). The food is inexpensive and surprisingly very good."

The Fisherman's Bastion in Budapest is a wall and tower complex built in the 1800's to recall the medieval architecture of the original walls of Buda. Using the medieval convention of naming the portion of the city wall after the guild who defended it, the Fisherman's Bastion takes its name from the Fisherman's Guild who were responsible for that portion of the city wall in Medieval Times. Located on Castle Hill, near the Matyas Templom, the Fisherman's Bastion is a perfect way to cap off a trip to the Castle District, with its fabulous views of Budapest and the Danube. There are several cafes and a WC nearby so it's also a great place to relax before continuing with sight seeing. There is a small cost for the ticket to climb the Bastion, but it's not expensive and is definitely with the expenditure."

You have to pay (OK, not very much, but it's the principle) to walk about 50 yards on this viewpoint. This after being charged to see the church, which is currently undergoing full restoration, so you are severely restricted in what you can see. I don't mind paying for things, but not being spectacularly overcharged. Stay on the outside of the church, and get your views elsewhere for nothing. Spend your money on the Opera House tour, which is excellent."

Unlike in most parts of Budapest where you can get away from the tour groups and crowds, this is not. The most interesting thing here was watching an old Hungarian man scam tourist after tourist. Using sleight of hand and a pea, it was enjoyable to watch as one tourist after another handed over tens and even hundreds of euros convinced they knew where the pea was. DON'T BE FOOLED. The guy has colleagues with radios looking out and others which he loses to, convincing the tourists that he can be beaten. Regardless, it was strangely enjoyable watching the crowd be taken in, and watching the faces of people who lost money.

The last time I was there, I took my wife and daughter up to the area and we were really impressed. The architecture of the bastion is extremely beautiful, and the view from there over the Danube and into Pest is not to be missed. We took some extra time there to gaze across the river and take photos among the interesting architecture. Once you get up to Buda Hill, it's an easy walk to the Bastion and well worth it."

From there we took the inclines to the top and walked from there to the Fisherman's Bastion. This walk covered at least five attractions of Budapest.The walk and scenery was above average. The shops and cafes smelled of local dishes, such as goulash soup and fresh baked bread. We found a marzipan museum and marzipan shop at the top as well. Some of the best marzipan I ever ate. The ice cream vendors were selling sweets and goodies as well.Many photo opportunities and friendly people were abounding.This is a nice place to visit and get some much needed exercise. If you do not like steep hills, then take the incline rail to the top. It reminded me of the inclines in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania that I rode on as a kid in the fourth grade, whilst on a school field trip.If you're going to Budapest, you won't be disappointed."

The entire area is charming with the architecture, hidden ruins, etc., but definitely on the edge of becoming a Disney site. There were 2 men in costume with birds of prey who would not move away from the fountain (they want you to pay for your picture with them and the birds). The shops are very touristy, and the usual artists, musicians, etc. are sprinkled around.If you explore a bit ruins of the original church can be found along with some quiet. We were not able to go into the church as it was closed for some sort of construction work for the week. Every tour stops here for a while, or it is easy enough to reach by bus (#16). Walking down to the chain bridge is relatively easy (you obviously could walk up also) over a set of stairs through a 'park'. It's one of the boxes on the Budapest list."

It is designed with neo-Gothic and neo-Romanesque with round pointed roof and climbing stairways, which reminds me of Disney castle. This area is once known as the Fisherman's Town, hence the name Fisherman's Bastion. Everywhere in the Fisherman's Bastion is a photo stop. We took the stairs up and were greeted with the most beautiful panoramic view of the Budapest. Next to the Fisherman's Bastion is the Matthias Church which is picturesque, together with the wintery snow, it paints a wonderful and charming picture."

I had seen the Fisherman's Bastion with it fanciful architecture and St. Matthias Church with its frilly spire from the Pest side across the Danube and it looked so beautiful. I walked across the impressive Chain Bridge with its pair of huge lions at either end and then along a street on the Buda side to some stairs that took me straight up to Fisherman's Bastion. One can take the funicular ride for a fee if you do not want to climb the stairs or take the bus to Holy Trinity Square. If you have a day pass it will cover the bus ride.I loved the architecture of Fishermen\u2019s\u2019 Bastion with its 7 Pointy Domes representing the 7 Magyar tribes and pretty ramparts with arched lookouts, turrets, walkway on the second level above, and the wonderful UNESCO heritage views of Pest from the Bastion. The Danube with its boats, stunning Parliament Building, and other landmarks take your breath away and have you taking many pictures.I viewed the Plague Column on Holy Trinity Square beside Fisherman's Bastion - much smaller version of the one in Vienna.I also visited St. Matthias Church on Holy Trinity Square - ancient and beautiful church."

Although rebuilt many times it has its origins in the 13th century. It's surprisingly small, but has a very nice genuine feeling.

The Fisherman's Bastion is a popular tourist spot on the Buda Hill and its unique architecture certainly is reason enough for the hordes to descend upon it. Photographers looking for a wholly unique subject will be delighted by the Fisherman's Bastion with its whimsical and mismatching columns and fairytale-like towers. As an added bonus, the St. Mattias Church stands adjacent to the Bastion and the views of the Danube River and Pest districts, including the Parliament building, are unparalleled from the Bastion. The only negative aspect of the Fisherman's Bastion are the hordes of tourists and the accompanying tourist guidebook hawkers. I would suggest a very late night or early morning visit to the Bastion to beat the crowds and to catch Budapest illuminated in all its glory."

Its round turrets, crenellated parapets, and spiral columns will make you imagine a palace of marble and ice; you'll keep expecting a princess to emerge with a flourish of trumpets. It extends along part of the eastern wall of Buda Castle, thereby giving tourists the best view of the Danube and Pest.It was built at the end of the 19th century on the portion of the castle's walls that, during times of emergency, was protected by the fishermen's guild during the Middle Ages. Its celestial beauty is all the more incongruous when you imagine the rough medieval fishermen for whom it is named. There is no fee to enter the bastion from November through February; the rest of the year, there is a modest entry fee. There is never a fee to enter Buda Castle and get a good view of the bastion from many angles; it's a fantastic photo opportunity, by day and at night.Some portions of the bastion are reachable only by stairs and therefore aren't wheelchair-accessible. Beware of the grifters who frequent its upper walkway, playing variations of three-card monte and the shell game, using stakes of counterfeit currency."

But after you've enjoyed the stunning views from there, and you come out the other end, you realise that you could have seen 90% of the same view from a little bit further along, without paying a penny! Still, it was a bit quieter there, but I wished I'd had the choice and not felt conned!"

Great views of the city from here, and equally good for people watching. It's certainly worth a visit, and St. Matthias is also there .Still, thoughts of Disneyland with turrets kept popping in to my mind .. I personally enjoyed the old town much more.."

It has a grand view of the panorama of the whole city, especially the Parliament on the Pest side and the Iron Bridge. Its outlook remind me of the wars in the old days. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, especially if you only have one day in Budapest."

Having visited the Castle Hill district for around an hour and a half I looked on my PC for other nearby attractions and found the Fisherman's Bastion - all the current reviews said that it was well worth a visit. So I used Tom Tom to direct me to a street which seemed to provide access (an Utca and by the way the c is soft, I always thought the c in Utca was hard until I heard it mentioned in a book!!) We walked up several flights of steps through an interesting park and arrived back where we had been two hours previously!! Yes the Fisherman's Bastion is on Castle Hill and we had already seen it. Fantastic architecture but do check the photos before you visit just in case! :-)"

You can walk in and around (and in some cases up) the turrets and view the Pest side of the city from the walls. There is a cafe - isn't there always - which would provide a wonderful break but we weren't ready to pause while we were there. With St. Matyas right there as well, plan on an hour or more and take your time. There is a shaded garden with benches as well if the weather is hot as it was for us. We walked then to the other end of the District, and found the only way down was via the funicular which cost a couple of euros but brings you down to street level quickly."

The fishermans bastion has just had something of a facelift and the stonework is all clean and shiney - in fact it almost looks like something Disney produced ! The bastion would appear to encompass a seriese of battlements and towers. From the battlements one can gain fantastic views of the Danube and the parlaiment buildings.It's all slightly confusing as most of the battlements have tables for serving coffee etc... and its really not obvious where one can go and where one can't. That said we just wandered onto various battlements without any trouble. Its very picturesque and a must see, costs nothing and does give some excellent views down to the river."

            "review": "Really Pretty Views over Danube and the city. The fishermans Bastion is to be found on the Buda side of the river up on the hill in the castle area; It is next to the Mathias Church and has magnificant views over the city below. Well worth a visit. There is a restaurant and ice cream place and the Hilton hotels restaurant all in the area for a nice lunch/meal or drink. Some of the area is being repaired and so is off limits but it does not spoil anything and the whole area is very photographable. The area is a little cobbly, so for wheelchair users - like myself, it can get a little uncomfy, and for some of the time it is better to be pushed on just back 2 wheels rather than on all 4; the road slopes a little downwards towards the walls of the bastion, so it is a little harder pushing up than down.Whilest there each day we saw a man with a hawk and a large eagle who were there to be posed for photos - approx 8 / 10 euros for 2 or 3 poses taken on your own camera, worth doing if you like that kind of thing. The birds looked well cared for but very fierce. I was afraid and dont really like birds so we didnt partake but saw a few people do so.Also, whilst there we went to mathias church, the ticket office is at the office at the right of the church as you look at it face on, with the bastion behind. For disabled people, enterance was free and access was by entering through the exit door. There was 1 kerb and the 2 small steps to negotiate but was quite easy. The normal entrance leads to approx 8 steep stairs.We had a lovely time in this area despite the cobbles."

We went up on the furnicular - which is a short ride, quite expensive (and they only take Forints) but quite fun. But we had a gentle walk down and then over the Chain Bridge back to Pest. The views are lovely here - both over the river to Pest and at the rear looking out to Buda. There are 2 museums here, and the History Museum is well worth a visit. Cafe Ruszwurm (reviewed separately) is a good coffee stop - if you can get a table. We visited in November, I guess it would be heavy with tourists earlier in the season."

Time it carefully though as some large tour groups did come up, but not until we had spent a peaceful 10 minutes by ourselves taking photos and enjoying the quiet views. Priceless!One thing that did dissappoint me was the man there with a very large bird of prey charging tourists to have their photo taken with it. Very unnecessary. Please please do not exploit the poor bird just so you can add a novelty photo to your album!!"
