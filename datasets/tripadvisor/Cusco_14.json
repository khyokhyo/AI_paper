Afterwards, just go to the road and flag down a bus to get back down to Cusco (or walk up to other attractions up the valley) - it's 1 Sole, then ask to get off at Recoleta to walk for 10 mins back into the centre. Alternatively ask to be dropped in the centre of Cusco and you'll be shown where to change bus and pay 2 Soles."

Anyway, once we were up at the ruins, we were amazed at the immense rocks the Incas had transported. A guide would have been helpful since so little of the fortification remains and there's almost no signage to help the visitors imagine the dramatic events that took place there. Still, I wouldn't miss Sacsayhuaman."

For those of you with Great legs, walking up and back can certainly be done. It's really worth the 2-3 hours it would take.

Perfect day in Cusco:Morning time used to visit museums in city center, lunch in nice restaurant and afternoon trip to visit places in the near.Very important thing: Do not mix city tour (churches and temple of the sun) with out of city sites in half day tour. Not enough time for visit all - just to run through.Try to find good guide, check on tourist comments.Had bad experience on amazing locations because of bad organization and poor knowledge guide.Just run through Inca temples and ruins without any relevant information. At the end of the tour, we spent more time in alpaca wool factory than on historical locations.Luckily, I prepared myself for tour, read about places and know more information than guide."

Pizzaro defeated Manco Inca Yupanqui (the 9th Sapa Inca) in the year 1536 at Sacsayhuaman . The incredible STONES vary in size from 20 to 122 tons all in solid granite that supposedly the bronze age INCA constructed with 20,000 men to fit with varying angles so perfectly so as not even a piece of paper could fit in between (uh, okay, I guess so). I still cannot figure how they (whomever) cut granite (hardness 8) with that much precision, with bronze tools (hardness level 2) and rock hammers. This is why I came to see it for myself. Anyway, in my humble view, Sacsayhuaman is in the top 3 places to see in and around this part of Peru. It is a must see, a 2nd tier wonder of the world."

A big thumbs up to our tour guide Percy, who not only was knowledgeable about the science and history of the ruins but wasn't afraid to have an opinion about what could have happened around the time of the Incas as well. The entry to sites are well organized and there is little delay in getting your ticket clipped. Situated on the mountain overlooking Cuzco, this ruin is amazing for the scale of its original construction and now the remains. The Inca empire was a strong military power, so many structures were built to protect the people in them, store water and food and situated high up mountains to view possible threats. What remains are massive stone blocks carved to precision and stacked against each other, no cement between. This site is beautiful for its flow and peacefulness. It also provides a spectacular view of Cuzco from the top. Cuzco is believed the centre of the Incan empire. If like me, you are still learning about the history, a guide and a group is a must. You get so much more information this way. This was a very good outing."

It's a large site the you can really explore. There are cave passages, llamas, beautiful stone work, and great views over Cusco.

Get there early as it opens at 07.00 so you miss the tour buses, or later in the day after they have gone. We got there just after 8 and it was still quiet but started to fill up by mid morning. This was originally an Inca temple and then later used as a fortress by the armies of Manco Inca and ultimately the of a site bloody battle with the Spanish. It's a huge site, but the most impressive aspect is its 360 Metre long Zigzag wall, consisting of some enormous stones which makes it even more incredible as to how the 15th century Inca were able to construct it without mortar and for it to still be standing. The size of some of the stones are so large (one apparently estimated at 360 tonnes) that legend has it that 3000 men died just moving one of them! You can also walk to the statue of Christ that you will see lit up in the evening from the Plaza de Armas.  In summary this is a must do site when in Cusco and easily ranks up with Ollantaytambo and Pisac. I highly recommend."

It is a huge location with tremendous views of the city. It's incorporation of civil engineering details is fascinating.

We went there first as part of the City Tour... a very disappointing whirlwind 7-sites-in-one-afternoon tour spent in intensely crowded conditions, long line-ups, and not much info imparted (especially about this site).

It is about a ten minute drive outside the city ($5 dollars US or an unremarkable forty minute uphill walk; I recommend taking a taxi up and doing the walk back down) and a really interesting set of ruins. The largest rocks were carted away up through the 1930s so what you have left is far different than the ruins in Pisac, etc. There is also a super cool natural rock \"slide\" that visitors are encouraged to climb up and slide down. It can be overlooked if you do a super quick trip of the site but is so worth the extra minutes to slide down. Two thumbs up!"

There is NO explanation and if you want to understand what you are seeing you have to hire a guide, who will tour you around (another 50 Soles).If you are visiting other sites, like Machu Picchu, and do not have Sacsayhuaman in your combi ticket, I would recommend not to visit it, as you will see better in the other sites (like the temple in Ollantaytambo)"

Our itinerary included Pisac ruins and marketplace, Q'enqo, Sacayhuaman and one other that I cannot remember but it was a hunting lodge. Sacayhuaman (pronounced \"Sexy woman\") was our favorite. I guess it is supposed to represent the head of the puma. Apparently all the sites represent some part of the puma's body. Anyways, it is impressive and the curvature of the walls makes one wonder how on earth did the Incas cut these huge stones. From here one can also see the White Christ statue and can also get a great view of the city. In front is a wide flat grassy area and across the way is more to see. What fascinated me was the rock formations on the left. The striations in the rock are impressive. There is also a \"rock slide\" that you can slide on. Our guide also showed us what they said was like a funeral area and beyond that was a dark cave you can walk through. I thought it was really a good introductions to large Inca architecture. This is included in the Boleto Turistico. Always bring water with you as you may get thirsty from all the exercise. As with everywhere in Peru, wear good shoes and sunblock."

So worth it for that.The next day we arrived at about 2 and the area was pretty quiet so we visited the viewpoints which were great. The ruins them selves were pretty basis, reminded me a bit of the Ronan Forum with no explanatory signs. Want more?

From there you pass a nice (if, like so many places in Peru ) chock full o litter waterfall and a parish church that was having a picnic (Cusqueno & roasted cuy galore!) and exuberant Saint's parade when I was there. Note to solo travelers: walking this way or from the Plaza de Armas, you will move through several sets of steps where you can easily become isolated. There were the usual, not particularly threatening creepers lurking around corners and being annoying. I made sure to keep me wits about me!Ok, so, the ruins at last. The views are great (though as a native of Scranton PA, USA, I had some de ja bye). You will wonder how they moved and arranged these enormous stones. I continued to wonder throughout my visit, in fact, because there was no print info available in any language, and for once, no one was trying to sell me guide services (or a massage, or a \"100% baby alpaca made by my grandmother\" or shaman services or whatever on the streets of Cusco. So I would recommend this site for some freaking peace and quiet.To me, the best parts were:1. Random brazen llama herd at top of site providing photo oops, tourist mayhem and hilarity2. A natural stone slide that seemingly local children were enjoying (did they make them pay 70 soles?)3. An abuela with photo-ready alpaca who came springing out of a cave. She was so cute, I gave her a pocketful of soles for a photo after steadfastly refusing to fall for that one for like 2 weeks.To sum up: research it before you go so you know what you are looking at, be open to enjoying current Peru at least as much can as ancient Peru"

We walked up to Sacsayhuaman (think: 'sexy woman' in terms of how to pronounce the name of this place) -- which was fine but nothing really to see on the way. So I'd recommend taking a cab. We were not going to hire a guide, but after about 5 minutes of starting to walk around, we realized that having a guide would make it so much more meaningful, and it did! Our guide was Guido - and I'd highly recommend him. He was very knowledgable & passionate about Sacsayhuaman and Incan history; he has worked in some of the archeology digs in the area. There are guides waiting to be hired, right inside the entrance, and that is where we found Guido.  Before you go to Cusco, read the book 'The Last Days of the Incas' by Kim MacQuarrie. It describes the spanish vs Incan wars and interactions, many of which occurred in Cusco. Sacsayhuaman was the location of a major battle described in the book. It was really neat to see the walls and location of this battle. Guido showed us part of the site that had been excavated in the last 6-9 months. Originally they thought Sacsayhuaman was a fortress, but now they believe it was a spiritual place for the Incas. The stone work here was every bit as good as at Machu Picchu. In some ways it was more impressive - the main 3 walls (quite long) at Sacsayhuaman were all the highest quality Incan cut stones which were only used for religious sites and places the royalty/emperors lived."

Finally, we explored magnificent architecture up-close and climbed to the top for a gorgeous view of Cusco. Though it is fun for the kids, knowing that each boulder was rolled from a far away hill, meticulously carved and perfectly put into place, and then so callously destroyed by the conquistadors, you cannot help but feel awe and anger at what humans can make possible."

Indeed, you could walk right up to it, if you have the endurance to climb the steep trail - the Christ statueon the mountainside that is visible from Cuzco is standing right next to Sacsayhuaman. We did not hike up, instead we had a guide and driver from Alpaca Expeditions drive us up to the site. Having a guide explain the significance of Sacsayhuaman to us was a wise decision, there are no signs at the site to explain what you are looking at. We learned that theSpanish forced the natives to bury the entire site under dirt, so that they would forget the glories of their former Inca empire. Our guide also told us that the zigzag shape of the walls was meant to represent a bolt of lightning, or else the zigzags represented the teeth of a Puma, an animal sacred to the Inca. The best reason to visit Sacsayhuaman (which apparently is a Quecha word for \"satisfied falcon\") is to see the enormous stones that were used to build the walls. Some of the stones weigh over 200 tons, and were transported here from quarries over 30 km away. The masonry really is amazing, especially for a stone age culture.It is well worth your time to walk through this site."

It cost us S/15 (about $5) and it's easy to get a ride back to town usually for less than the ride up. Ask the fare before getting into the taxi as there are no meters. Follow the arrows and visit all the 4 major ruins including stones weighing over 50 tons that lore says predates the Inkas and were built by giants. There are smooth hill of stones that you can slide down. Challenge yourself to enter the caves and pass all the way through in total darkness if you dare. See the huge circular plaza, or visit the throne of the Inka. There are also Ltd of guides who will explain the various complexes. We opted to explore on our own."

The views from up there over Cusco are awesome as well. Would highly recommend a guided tour (no more than 20-30 soles per person) of the site, as it will add a whole other dimension to your visit. We do believe that the 70 soles for a day pass to this site as well as the 3 other sites nearby, is too expensive. We'd visited the Convento de Santo Domingo church (another important Quechuan site) before and felt that gave us a similar feel for the history, so if on a budget I'd recommend the church + a walk to blanco cristo."

The water has hidden for protection both hygienically and to hide from enemies. These Inkans were so smart, always protecting their existence. The walls were constructed of huge stones carefully fitted together tightly without mortar. Some had interlocking pieces. These thinking was also implemented in the Burobodor Temple, the famous 8 layer Buddhist temple in Java Indonesia. In 1983, Saksaywaman became a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

(If you can venture further out of Cusco, Tipon is another must see!) This site is massive and very well maintained and although a guide would be a good idea, you can visit without one if you\u2019ve read up on it quite a bit. Especially if you\u2019ve been to other ruins where you did have a guide and were able to learn the history of pre-Inkan stonework. It is more the history and the story about this particular site, which is very interesting. The stonework here is absolutely immaculate \u2013 you can\u2019t even fit a piece of paper between those stones! Some of the stones are incredibly large \u2013 the heaviest stone weighing 300 tons, apparently! It\u2019s hard to imagine anyone moving these massive stones with no modern equipment, let alone making them fit so precisely together - truly remarkable! If you go to the upper part of the walls, there are several other paths leading to less touristy parts of the site. Views from here over Cusco city and the walls below is really something! Same goes for the stairs up the other side at the limestone outcrops. The altitude often puts people off from climbing those extra steps to a place which seems to be of no real significance, but you can often miss out on something quite incredible. Tip: We entered the site from the far end (no queues to get in\u2026) No toilets at this end, but at the main entrance (we didn\u2019t use the toilets here, so can\u2019t comment on them). If you have a driver, ask him to drop you to the far entrance and pick you up at the main entrance, That way you not only avoid the queues, but you also only need to walk through the site once, saving you from walking all the way back. Entry is on the Boleto Turistico.Wear sunscreen and a hat and take enough water and some snacks. It is a huge site and you\u2019re exposed to the sun the entire time. Definitely definitely a MUST see in Cusco!"

Get a taxi up and enjoy the all downhill walk back to the historic center. Also recommend hiring a guide at the site, or joining an organized tour from Cusco."

I grabbed a cab in Cusco with 3 other friends for 70 soles (roughly $22, less than $10/pp) TOTAL and he took us to Sacsayhuaman, Tambomachay, Qenqo and Pukapukara. I originally prebooked Sacsayhuaman and paid $70 for a tour of the only this site, but quickly realized that I could do it on my own for significantly cheaper and on my own time.Sacsayhuaman is a short 20 min drive from Plaza de Armas. We saw Cristo Blanco first and walked down to Sacsayhuaman. Of course, without paying for the tour, you do not get access into the grounds, but we still got to see everything we wanted to see from the outside. You'll still see the stones and be able to take pictures, but you miss out on the history lesson without a proper guide. If you're short on time/traveling on a budget, you don't need to book a tour to see Sacsayhuaman. Grab a taxi and negotiate a deal where you'd get taken around to all the sites. Again, you don't get access into the grounds unless you pay for entrance, but you still see everything and can still get up close (most of the sites just had a simple rope blocking it off, so you can do as you please as long as you don't cross the rope). Plenty of people chose to just grab a taxi instead of the tour, so you won't be alone!"

Its huge, with stones of various shapes and heights. The story behind how these stones were brought up to the site is incredible!!! I recommend buying the Boleto Turistico/tourist ticket which is 130 soles as Sacsayhuaman is one of the many places you can visit with the ticket. The views of Cusco city are incredible, and the entire place is very relaxing and peaceful. I also recommend visiting this site as part of the Cusco city tour, because the tour takes you to the nearby sites of: Qenqo, Pukapukara, and Tambomachay."

The guide option is the easier way since you get the information while visiting and are pointed the details \"on the spot\"So we saw the huge rocks making up the site, individually carved, similar to the Egyptian pyramids, the sacrificial stone and the crypt where possibly the bodies were exposed after the sacrifice...Seeing these places while the sun was down gave a it a spooky twist...All in all, the site is well maintained, the people very friendly and a private visit with one's own guide gave it a definite plus!!The phonetic way to remember the name is \"sexywoman\""

Workers carefully cut the could era to fit them tightly together without mortar. It was truly a sight to visit. We enjoyed our time here exploring around.

The \"temple\" buildings were constructed by lifting the assembled structure and supporting them with timbers while sliding the new stones underneath after the interfacing fit was determined and the tops and sides of the new lower stones were shaped by a rubbing and \"sanding\" process. The largest stones were about 100 metric tons. No engineer today would attempt to building anything from the top floor down by lifting the upper structure.

Our Peruvian historian is of the temple opinion, and gave compelling arguments in the structures themselves. Both the design and the use of the structures bolstered his temple center argument. Look into the question before you go.

I exploded by myself and did a lot of research on the area so I was able to understand the history and significance of the site, however if you do go by yourself, you may find yourself getting bored just walking around looking at enormous rocks.You can hire a local tour guide which is also a good idea and they can take you to the other parts of the site that the books don't tell you about. From here you can easily walk over to blanco cristo (the white Christ) and take more photos of Cusco and even do some plane spotting from atop the hill as the airlines make their approach in to Cusco Airport.

The rocks were so well put together and constructed robustly. The various symbologies and meanings from specific constructs indicates a society that has excellent architectural and construction skills. There are guide books that shows where to look for specific constructs and their meanings - or go with a guide or hire one at the gate. Be aware though - some guides will talk about the history and the factual state of the site - we ended up with a guide that was a \"shaman\", apparently. It was interesting to hear his perspective on each of the symbols interpreted according to numerology, healing power of the chakra, etc. He lost me when he asserted the Incans built the site some 40000 years ago.... and that the Incans used the symbols \"+\" and \"-\" on the rocks to depict the positive and negative forces. Still, it was an interesting tour of the site from a unique perspective. Be that as it may, the site is beautiful, a temple on top of a hill with a beautiful \"meadow\" in between the 2 parts of the temple. The peaceful setting is tinged though with the realization that it was also the site where the Spaniards defeated the Incans and many died there.Climbing to the top of the temple allows a beautiful view of the city and on a clear day, one can see the snow capped mountains in the distance. We were there late afternoon, so the light cast a glow around the temple - it must be magical at daybreak when the sunrises, especially during the winter/summer solstice.FYI: there are 2 entrances to the park - a lower entrance and the upper second one where the buses park. If you are catching a cab from the city (cost about 12 to 15 Soles), make sure you get the cab to drop you off at the 2nd (upper) entrance (where you can see the temple itself). It is a bit of an uphill climb (at high altitude) from the first entrance - not worth the effort if you can get to the 2nd entrance. You can also catch the cab back from the 2nd entrance - the first lower entrance seems not to have easy transportation - I see a few visitors waiting and one was so happy to grab the cab when I alighted."

My husband and I went there and quickly realized how expensive it is for tourists to visit - 70 soles per person! Blech. But since it's a \"must see\" of Cusco, we went for it. Didn't have time to see the other sites included in the ticket price, unfortunately. Once through the entrance gate and up to the top of the hill, we were approached by a tour guide offering us a tour. We paid 50 soles (bartered down from 60 soles) for a 1.5 hour tour of the main level of the ruins. If we hadn't had gotten a tour guide, we wouldn't have been able to recognize anything significant! Make sure to either arrive with a tour guide, or secure a random one at the site. There's a lot of history and symbolism at the site and it's pretty epic. Enjoy! The blanco christo (white jesus) is walkable from Sacasayhuaman as well, and while it's a steep hike, it's pretty neat to see it close up too."

We hired a guide at the gate to help us with the history, and he was fluent in a couple of languages, including English. I highly recommend a guide. Keep in mind that you may hear the guide's opinion, not necessarily facts about the ruins. Seems that everyone has differing opinions about the Incas and how this ruins was built."

It is much higher than Cusco which is 3,400 metres.From the top of the site, there are the most wonderful views over Cusco and the valley below.If you are going to make the effort to get to Cusco, make sure that you take the time to visit Sacsayhuaman, you will not be disappointed.To visit this site and others, we purchased \"vouchers\" that provided us with tickets to most of the sights around Cusco, and the Sacred Valley.

Sacsayhuaman was easy to get to and great to look around. Q'enqo was next, a little confusing about which path to take but it's simply just along the main road and easy to walk. We enquired at Q'enqo about how to get to the 3rd park (it was 4.5km away) and he said that there is no bus but we might be able to get a cab on the road...we didn't want to risk it so we walked back to Sacsayhuaman where there were a number of available taxis. It cost us 30soles for a ride to the 2 remaining parks and to get back to Cuzco. The other 2 parks are a nice change from Sacsayhuaman and Q'enqo as the have a more relaxed vibe and beautiful mountain views.However, now we are looking at a sacred valley tour I'm kinda wishing we went for the 130soles 10 day ticket!!"

The site requires reasonable amount of walking and climbing (and at 12,142 feet elevation it not an easy task). But it is easily doable if you don't hurry. The stone structures are defies logic. How a civilization that did not have wheels, metal tools can build such stone structures is unexplainable. Some of the stones are big, really big. They are cut in such precision and fit together that there is absolutely no gaps between the stone. You have to see to believe it. It takes two to three hours to see all the sites within the site.

Knowing a little history prior to my trip to Cusco, Peru - I knew that Cusco was the Capital of the Inca Empire and there are still many new archeological sites being discovered nearby and that is fascinating to me. What is also something to remember is the altitude adjustment - Cusco is actually higher in altitude than Machu Picchu - this location is over 12,000 feet above sea level - that is just crazy - so be prepared for possible headaches and nausea. There is much ground to cover and you might run into a Llama during your tour."

Photos do not do this pace justice.Some tips:There are no restrooms at Machu Picchu once you get inside. I would recommend you eat light before you go and visit the facilities before entrance just to make sure you are on empty. You don't want to have to hike all the way back to the entrance.We got up a 4am to be there for sunrise (This was in May). The sun was already up by the time they opened the gates. If I had it to do over again. I would have slept until 6am and taken my time.Go in the morning. It is nice and cool. In the afternoon, the sun is pretty intense.Take the train at least one way. It is a beautiful ride and comfortable with clean restrooms.We did not get a guide. There are so many guides that you almost can't help but over hear them anyway. Save the money.I saw some people with small kids there. I would not do that. Some of the ledges are no joke. I would only take teenagers. That is just me.If you feel the need to be there first, have your whole party at the bus line no later than five. The line will start to form between 4 and 4:15, but you will still get on one of the first three buses if you are there by 5. That will get you there in time for the opening. If you try to save someone's place i the bus line, it won't work. They come through the line and stamp your ticket around 5 or so. If stragglers show up later to join their group, they won't get on the bus without the stamp.The llamas up there are tame. You can approach them with no worries.The hike to the Inca bridge is not for people who have a fear of heights.Hope some that helps."

There is a lot of climbing and a lot of corners to explore, we were there for about four hours and could have stayed longer. Getting a guide is a good idea.We arrived around noon time and the morning had been very rainy but in about an hour the sky cleared. I think this is typical, so maybe going in the afternoon is your best bet, also a lot of tourist come from Cusco directly and they are gone by mid day so it is less crowded in the afternoon.Be ware of the bus ride from Aguas Calientes, it is a hair raising experience, the drivers seem to take pride in seeing how close they can get to the precipice, and the road is so narrow that can only accommodate one vehicle so sometimes the buses had to back up in this narrow, steep, slippery roar. You are better off not looking out of the window."

We visited Machu Piccu after four days of hard trekking on the Inca Trail, and happened to arrive just as a downpour was beginning.I have to say that the rain, quite apart from dampening our spirits, actually made Machu Picchu come alive - with ancient, carved rain gulleys and gutters roaring into life as they carried water from the mountain into the valley below.Most definitely a bucket list activity. Go and book your flights to Peru to see this place. Go on. Do it. Now! I will remember this place for the rest of my life."

The sheer size of the stones was magnificent, and the location overlooking Cusco, while not as mystical as Machu Picchu, is still pretty grand. Julio showed us some things that we wouldn't have picked up on ourselves, like the symbolism of aspects of the construction, the natural stone slide, the Incan tunnel (which we all went through in the dark), and even the acoustical qualities of the site--you can hear an amazing echo if you stand in the right place. Even if you've seen all the other ruins, don't miss this one. It has unique qualities to offer. We liked Julio's tour, so we told him we'd put his name in our review."

We got our tickets and walked in. By the way, the ticket includes a few other attractions but we didn't have time. Not long after we entered, there was a lady approaching us saying she offers tours on site. We were skeptical at first, but the price was cheap and she sounded knowledgable. I'm glad we did that!The total price came out to be less than if we were to join a tour, on top of that we got to spend as much time as we wanted and had a private guide to tell us stories and take pics of us. Don't forget to go on the rock slides! And don't hurt your bum coming down. A girl from our group couldn't walk the next two days because she fell hard on her bum coming down from the slick slides."

The alternative is paying $70 Peruvian Soles per site.For sites close to Cusco the local bus or taxi is cheap enough. 10 soles to Sacsayhauman. Ask price before committing.

It had some defensive purposes, but also served as a visible reminder of the power and advanced civilization of the Quechuan people. It also served as a ceremonial site, with a large field located between the defensive walls and the natural cliffs that provided the raw stones for much of Sacsayhuaman fortifications. The history is fascinating and the puzzle of how these people moved such massive stones without the aid of machinery, hydraulics and other tech advancements, is spellbinding. I so enjoyed the visit here but I was a bit sad to learn we had missed (by just a couple of days) a large annual reenactment of the Inti Raymi (Festival of the Sun) which occurs in late June around the time of the southern hemisphere's winter solstice. If I'd known, we might have altered our schedule a bit to be there for the show!On the bright side, there were a lot of dancing and musical groups marching in the Cusco city center in the days leading up to the solstice, so we saw a good deal of native culture you don't always encounter while visiting.

It is the scene of an ancient Inca fortress, where the Incas fought a battle against the Spanish invaders. It is well worth the visit - the City Tour includes the services of a guide. One thing to mention is that it is well above Cusco in altitude and requires a lot of walking, so if you are already having difficulty with altitude, you might want to take this into consideration. Another caution is that if you are there in summer (North American winter,) you should bring along an umbrella. Showers can come up suddenly, and there is no shelter. We brought ours, and those who did not had to madly scramble for the bus or buy ponchos from the locals who are on the scene. Part of the Sacsayhuaman tour takes you to the nearby Cristo Blanco, the 'White Christ' statue which is visible all the way to the Plaza de Armas in Cusco. Families with really small kids might find the going a little rough. It's not dangerous, just that if you have to carry a little one, it may be strenuous at the altitude."

Great view of Cusco city below.. \"Sexy Woman\" is not as spectacular a Machu Picchu or Ollantaytambo, so I think it becomes under-appreciated sometimes. That's a shame because I think the beauty of its architecture is subtle. Of all the Incan ruins I visted during my Peru trip, I think the stone walls at Sacsayhuaman may have been the most impressive, in terms of their size and the precise way in which the larger stones were cut to fit so intricately well.It's a shame that the original rooms and plaza were destroyed by the Spanish conquerors; I would have loved to see a little bit of them. The remnants are sparse and there has only been a little reconstruction.The other thing many people like about this site is that it provides great overviews of Cusco city below. We visited this site as part of a full-afternoon guided tour of several places in the Cusco region. I don't know how much of the tour fee went towards the admission fee here, so therefore I can't really comment on the value of the admission fee, since many have commented here that they felt the fee is very expensive."

Sacsayhuaman (pronounced 'sexywoman') is the first of the 4 archeological sites (Saqsaywaman > Q'enqo > Pukapukara > Tambomachay) positioned along the first 8km of the road that runs towards Pisac. Located only 2km from Cusco, near Q'enqo it is easily the best of the four peripheral sites and not to be missed.GETTING HEREI would recommend doing this as part of a trip incorporating all four peripheral sites. If you don't have enough time to go to all four I would still recommend making the effort to come to this site alone as it's spectacular. Two options - tour vs independent travel.TOUR - The four archeological sites are included as part of the popular Cusco city tours. Costing around 50Sol these begin in the afternoon by visiting several city sites (Plaza de armas, Cathedral, Qurikancha temple) before extending out into the peripheral sites. Because this runs over half a day and crams in the city sites as well as these four I found it to be quite rushed and I wasn't afforded the amount of time I would've liked at the archeological sites - which was really the only reason we did the tour. I wouldn't recommend it.INDEPENDENTLY - Biggest question is going to be your choice of transportation. You are climbing uphill at elevation from Cusco to get to these sites and because of this most seek transport to the most peripheral site of Tambomachay before walking the 8km downhill back to the town. Buses traveling to Pisac can drop you off at the most peripheral site of Tambomachay for 3Sol (although you need 8Sol to get a taxi to the bus station usually). From Tambomachay you trace back to Pukapukara > Q'enqo > Saqsaywaman, a distance of 6km, before the 2km downhill descent to Cusco. Tambomachay & Pukapukara are 200m from each other and it's similar for Q'enqo/Saqsaywaman so you could get an interconnecting taxi although I saw none when I was there. Instead of a bus you can pay 25 Sol one way on a taxi to Tambomachay. Finally you can get a private taxi for the entire trip for 50Sol (they wait while you visit and take you between sites). This is probably the best option but you'll need good negotiating skills. There are well documented reports of muggings of people walking between the ruins so solo travel is ill advised. I noticed a reassuring police presence between the sites when I passed through so I speculate the authorities are clamping down on this as to not discourage tourists. Entry to the sites is via the Boleta Turistico ticket - these cost 130Sol and covers numerous attractions in and around Cusco over the space of 10 days.If you wanted to visit Saqsaywaman in isolation from the others you can walk here from the Plaza De Armas (see below picture). This is around 1km but up quite a steep incline at an elevation of over 3000m and will take you over half an hour easily. From Saqsaywaman there is a path leading to the statue of Christ the Redeemer (Cusco version).THE SITESacsayhuaman is easily the best of the 4 archeological sites. It's an old citadel built from huge boulders cut so well that mortar was not required to hold them together. The stone work for me was a real highlight. It towers over cusco and offers excellent views for those who walk through to the viewpoint. Historically this was one of the sites of one of the most bloodiest conflicts between the spanish and the Inca during the 1500's in which thousands were slaughtered. Following this a lot of the stone from the site was pilfered for buildings in the colonial city but enough remains for it to be a worth wild visit.Please take the time to rate my review."

We arrived VERY early in the day, so there were no tourists yet except for us. The ruins were astounding. It was honestly one of the most impressive sights we saw in Peru. The slide carved into stone was a fun diversion, but the best part was that one of the alpacas that are allowed to roam around for the benefits of tourists gave birth while we were there! It was just walking around and then the baby started poking out! We watched for 20 minutes or so until it was done. What a memorable experience!"

We only had ~20 minutes to explore in our City Tour group, but the rock masonry is more impressive than anywhere else we visited in the Sacred Valley and Machu Picchu. To re-enter the site, we would have needed to buy an additional Boleto Turistico (S/130 each). I'd recommend finding a private tour so you can spend longer here. It is also next to the Cristo Blanco (White Jesus) monument, which you can walk to from Sacsayhuaman. It is an easy walk down winding staircases to downtown Cusco from there."

This is a must see if you aren't going to Machu Picchu just to see the complexity of the Inca structures. The elevation is higher than Cusco. Was also cooler than Cusco. You don't need hiking shoes, it's a gentle slope throughout. Not absolutely necessary to be with a tour. Worthwhile seeing even if it's just on your own, just take a guidebook and go.

It is impressive to think that hundreds of people worked for fifty years to construct this area, which was primarily a military installation and home of the Royal Family in the 15th century. It also served as an important astrological center for the Incans of that time. Unfortunately, when the Spanish came, they moved a lot of the stones into Cuzco for construction of other buildings. It is a lovely sight, nonetheless, and there are llamas grazing on the property who sometimes take off running at high speeds for no apparent reason. If you are going to Cuzco, you have to see it."

These sites are Tambomachay, Puca Pucara, Qenqo, and Cristo Blanco. Here is how we did it. First of all, don't for get your tourist ticket (Boleto turistico). We took a taxi from Plaza Regocijo to Tambomachay (20 Soles) then we walked to Puca Pucara. From Puca Pucara you can either walk or take a bus (1-2 Soles) to Qenqo. We walked and it took us about 50 minutes. It's about 30 minutes walk from Qengo to Cristo Blanco or you can take a bus for (1-2 Soles). It's an easy 5-10 minutes walk down hill from Cristo Blanco to Sacsayhuaman. You can do it the other way around, too. However, I like the way we did because you started out from a small site and end up at the bigger site. It's more rewarded that way an less for me anyway.Go check it out, you can't compare Sacsayhuaman with Machu Picchu. Personally, I think Sacsayhuaman has more Megalithic structures than Machu Picchu. The wall around Sacsayhuman alone is very impressive! Don't forget to slide down on one of the natural sliders on the Rodadero of the site."

The original structure was an expansive complex that are still used today for Inti Raymi festival. You can spend an hour or so to explore the entire area, though it is barren of any artefacts on its own. My taxi driver doubled as a tour guide and I found the explanation he provided gave the place more meanings. It was part of a guided tour that included three other sites: Tambomachay, Puka Pukara and Qenqo. Worth going to visit Sacsayhuaman alone if you happen to spend at least two days in Cusco. I personally think it was better to take transport to these places rather than hiking up/down the winding roads. Save your energy and spend more time at the sites."

How to get to Sacsayhuaman from the south:- Walk uphill from town: very hard, especially if you're still acclimating to the altitude.- Hire private taxi from wherever you can find one (such as Plaza de Armas): expensive, around 15-20 soles, but reliable.- Ride a colectivo whose final destination is Pisac. These leave from Calle Puputi, and will cost you around 2-5 soles. Unless you are within walking distance of Puputi, I highly recommend taxiing to Calle Puputi--taxi drivers will immediately know what you mean when you say Calle Puputi. Added advantage of colectivo: you can ride on the colectivo up to Tambomachay/Puka Pukara instead of just to Sacsayhuaman.- Take a senor del huerto bus from the same Calle Puputi. 1 sol. Wasn't obvious to us where these buses originated, so we went with a colectivo.How to get to Sacsayhuaman once you're done visiting Tambomachay/Puka Pukara:- Cheapest: hike down. this can take hours if you're slow. Sounds like the trail is poorly marked, and you walk across private property. We didn't attempt it.- Also free: walk down along the road. Probably a bit dangerous and definitely very slow (the sites are miles apart).- Next cheapest: flag down a southbound Senor del Huerto bus and tell the driver you want to be dropped off at Qenqo/Qenko or Sacsayhuaman. 1 sol.- Flag down a passing colectivo and tell them the same thing. A few soles.- Pray for a southbound taxi (probably one that's just completed a dropoff at Tambomachay) and pay a higher price. Again, highly recommend combining Sacsayhuaman DEFINITELY with Qenqo/Qenko as well as--if you can make it up there--Tambomachay and Puka Pukara."

Forgive us for not knowing too much of the history of this place and we didn't find much info whilst we were here. The sun was shining and we got loads of tourist photos. I can't remember what the entry fee was but it was expensive for what was a few people sitting in a hut at the entrance. I think this is the sort of place you have so see if you're staying for a few days at Cusco. I imagine i will see it on TV in a few years and think 'i went there' other than that, they are essentially some large (extremely well cut) rocks."

This site has far more significance that most of the guidebooks indicate, and we were stunned by the beauty of the place as well as its scale. Our guide was a bit creative including telling as the the Incans created tunnels from Cusco to Machu Picchu (what?) along with other questionable facts. She was an able tour director overall during our hour which given the very direct sun and attendant heat was plenty for our party. Don't miss this important part of the Incas' history. It will solidify their genius even more for you."

If you are open to hear about the native people of Peru's version of history and spirituality then he's your guy. If you are not an open minded person then you'll probably not like him. We had 1 person out of our group of 8 leave b/c his spill conflicted with her religious beliefs. The rest of us loved it, and I personally took some life-lessons and insight away from the experience He said he'd spend 1-2 hours with us and he ended up spending 3-4 hours for around $20 (we probably ended up giving him at least $50-60 from our group).

It's unbelievable how they were able to carry off this feat of construction. It's worth the drive to see this impressive place!"

Although most people will take a cab or bus to the summit, walking up from the city center is very doable. You'll get slightly winded but it makes it all the more worthwhile when you reach the top. Once at the top you can take pictures with natives dressed in traditional garb and their baby alpacas. Following the trail will bring you along a few areas where you can rest and take pictures with a breathtaking view. Highly recommend!"

To prep for Machu Picchu, I read the Last Days of the Incas by Kim McQuarrie (great book!), and I was hoping I could figure out how to visit this site, Saqsaywaman, when I go to Cusco. To my surprise, it\u2019s very close to the Plaza De Armas. I started at 6:30AM and took Amargura street (up a long set of steps) to Don Bosco street and followed that street all the way to the entrance. Sure, this is the same road that cars take, but since I started so early there were hardly any cars and actually a couple of people were going for their morning walk. I want to say it took me around 40 minutes to get up the road to the entrance from Amargura /Saphi streets intersection (but I was jogging parts of it \u2013 and it was a tough jog). It opens at 7AM.It costs 70 Sol to get in and you could take multiple marked trails. I took the 45 minute trail. There are folks asking if you want a guide, but I didn\u2019t get one. I just wanted to be there and think that this is the same spot where the Incas battled the Spaniards. It\u2019s a little hard to think about that at the Plaza de Armas (another location where they fought) when there is a KFC and McDonalds there, but at Saqsaywaman, it\u2019s just the land and what\u2019s leftover. And a great view of the city. I also ran into either Lamas or Alpacas grazing."

Best to go with a guide to show you some of the more 'secretive' areas to visit at the site and to provide you with amazing stories that will blow your mind (using only stone to cut stone and without the use of modern transport and measuring tools, the Inca moved 2000-tonne boulders more than ten kilometres and cut these rocks so precisely you cannot slip a dollar bill between the rocks -- that do not have mortar between them -- hundreds of years later). Don't forget your camera: best views of Cusco there is and very tame (and photogenic) llamas!"

Totally worth the small fee for the taxi. A great first day activity while we were getting used to the altitude! Only complaint was that we could not pay for just this attraction but had to buy a pass getting us into 4 attractions, some of which we were not planning to use. So it turned out to be expensive for a single afternoon."

Just to stand in front of the massive stones gives you a real insight in to just how difficult and how much intensive man power must have had to be used to make this construction. There is a doorway in the structure and the steps aren't too steep and it's easy to climb up to each level.

The one special thing about this site is the magnificent view you get looking down at the city of Cusco and it is worth going here just for that alone (even if you are Inca ruin jaded as we were a bit.) Also you can walk from the top of Sacsayhuaman over to the \"Cristo Blanco\" (White Christ statue) and that is also a must see.

Do not try to walk the other way (UP) unless you are very fit. Hard to imagine how 10.000 Inca's lost this fortress against 1000 Spanish..... No steel swords and armour must be the answer, but still."

The exercise will help you acclimate to Cusco's elevation and it's great exercise. We went up a series of steps and then walked up a winding road to find a church where we met a guide that took us horseback riding. He took us behind Sacsayhuaman into the valley and advised us we could go in the back entrance for free. This isn't true - if you want to see the ruins, you'll have to get a tourist ticket for 70 soles ( $23) to go in and explore the ruins. There is an attendant stationed by the entrance checking tickets. There are some llamas grazing and the ruins are impressive. You can hike up and see the Cristo Blanco for free, but otherwise you can pay or walk back down the road leading to Cusco."

The reward for hiking up the hill is the gorgeous views of the city, and the mountains beyond. This site is a good prep before going to Machu Picchu, especially because it has a fraction of the visitors and you can linger longer. There are more alpacas to get up close and personal with. Though there are only walls left in the ruins, what walls they are! At the lowest level, the stone boulders are enormous, and you wonder how they pushed them up and placed them exactly so. The tourist agencies advertise this place as \"sexy woman\" to make it easier to pronounce."

The top of the ruins also provides great panoramic views of Cusco. Entry is via Boletto touristico only which is something of a pain. The ticket is 120 sole and covers a bunch of attractions around Cusco and is valid for a couple of weeks; or you can get a partial ticket for 70 soles covering a specific four attractions for one day only. If you only wish to see one or two attractions this proves needlessly expensive. I purchased a day ticket to see the four ruins close to Cusco, Sacsayhuaman being one, and it turned out it was actually possible for me to gain access to all four sites without my ticket being checked... somewhat frustrating. That being said the site is remarkable and the second time I saw it was for the Inti Raymi celebrations; crowds of people, and largely local too flocking to see the dances and re-enactments. Set against the stony backdrop of the ruins. If you can visit during the festival do it, it's also free, don't let the tourist offices trick you into believing you need a ticket to see Inti Raymi."

(Machu Picchu was a religious and scientific outpost.) And Sacsayhuaman was the cultural center of Cuzco. That makes Sacsayhuaman the #1 most important tourist site in Cuzco, at least in my mind! It is located on the edge of the city and requires a taxi, bus, or tour to get there. I strongly recommend getting a tour guide, as there is only one interpretive sign on the entire site, located at the ticket office. Without a tour guide, you will just be wandering around a pile of rocks without understanding their importance. We hired a driver through our hotel's front desk, who drove us to Sacsayhuaman, where we purchased a \"partial ticket\" that gave us access to four adjacent Inca sites north of town. (A \"full ticket\" gives you access to 16 historical sites across the region, which is too much for most tourists.) The hotel promised us that we could easily pick up an English-speaking tour guide at Sacsayhuaman who could then guide us through all four sites. Not so easy! We waited more than one hour for an English-speaking guide to show up. The guide was quite good, but he charged us double the amount the hotel said it should cost."

It's perfect a vertical puzzle, an amazing example of human will, faith and hard work but also of human greed... the Spanish Conquest wrecked the citadel and the walls, stairs and rock slides remain because they just couldn't move them.

It is built of masonry walls of stones that are so large and thick that it seems impossible that humans could have moved and placed them there. The stones are so well fitted, that the point of a pin could not be inserted in between them. The fortress was originally built with terraces and flat spaces and with a trench dug in the front. Unfortunately, the Spaniards eventually seized Cusco and the fort was dismantled and much of the complex destroyed. The stones were used to build new Spanish government and religious buildings and also wealthy Spaniards\u2019 homes. This saved the conquerors time, expense and the effort of bringing in new stones for their construction. Today the only stones that are left are those that were too heavy to move from the site.

The Inca greatly expanded the fortress from the 13th century and used it as a military outpost and storage facility. It containes some of the largest cut stones found in the Inca Empire, precisely cut and fit together without mortor. Most of the smaller stones have been removed by the Spaniards and used to build the colonial city below. This site is often featured on the TV series Ancient Aliens as an example of Inca stone masonry. You can't help but wonder how they did it! Your guide will most likely tell you that people refer to the site as 'sexy woman'. There are awesome views of the mountins and the city of Cusco below and would be a great place for a picnic. The locals use the large open spaces for special events and festivals. On a nearby hilltop is the Christo Blanco, the White Christ, a gift to the city in 1945 from Christian Palestinians. It is a smaller version of the Christ the Redeemer statue above Rio de Janiero. You can see a video of these sites on my youtube channel: youtube.com/c/donstailey"

My suggestion, read up on the site before you go, and just take it at your own pace, or if you hire a guide, take it as A theory of what you might be seeing. Definitely worth a visit, though."

There's a cavern/tunnel you can pass through where it's completely dark - you'll have to hold on to the person in front of you with one hand and cover your head (to not bump it on the rocks) with the other - but a cool experience as you enter from the \"natural\" side of the fortress - as opposed to the side where it is all hand carved rock. On this side you'll also find several large natural slides that the kids (or maybe you) will enjoy sliding down.Once your guide is done, you can take your time exploring, admiring the stone work and taking lots of pictures.Don't waste your guide's time with this - there's so much to learn, if you're into that sort of thing. You'll likely want to take a cab there, but can easily walk down - maybe a 15-20 minute walk to the plaza."

It was an interesting mix of an Inca shaman, Catholic priest, an oriental religious person and several locals all together welcoming in the new season. Sacsayhuaman is a large complex made up of 3 huge serpentine walls of hand cut boulders that fit together perfectly with no mortar, just precision cutting. Some of the stones are as big as a car and fit together so tightly you can't slide a playing card between them. A true wonder of Inca engineering! You can spend up to 1/2 a day here of you so choose as the site is quite large. We spent about 2 hours wandering around and then headed for our next site.If you only have a short time in Cusco this is an Inca ruin that is exceptional in size and engineering and is just a 10 minute cab ride from the main square and well worth your time."

In any case, it is massive even after being partially dismantled by the Spaniards. It stretches several hundred feet and is comprised of least three tiers of massive stones, all fitted together with surgical precision without the use of mortar. In fact it is so huge that I, from the adjoining hilltop, could not fit the entire fortress in a single picture frame even using a wide angle lens. It is almost magical in its massive stones which had to be moved miles and miles to this site. You have to spend some time here!! The site is easily reachable from Plaza/Armas by a 30-45 min uphill walk. Once on top, you have a very nice view of the Cusco and the surroundings. Also nearby, is the statue of Christo Blanco overlooking the city. Admission is via the Boleto."

The ticket costs 70 soles for students and about double for non-students but you can get into about 10 attractions. Sacsayhuaman is located on top of a very large hill, and is hard to get there by walking due to the altitude, but it is doable from the Plaza de Armas. Set aside at least 30-45 minutes, or more if you're in bad shape. Once you get in, you have to walk more to get to the ruins. The ruins, though, are beautiful. Not as impressive after you've seen Machu Picchu, but they make for great pictures and you can have an awesome view of Cusco from it.

I also recommend that Cusco and the surrounding areas should be visited on the back end of your time. It is higher than the Sacred Valley and Machu Picchu so we feel that in order to get the most enjoyment (less chance of soroche) have your Cusco tours on the way back and before you move on to your next destination or head back to Lima to go home."

It is a huge place, where a series of complex structures were built using gigantic stones. It really takes your breath away. Sacsayhuaman is also the place where modern peruvians celebrate the Inti Raymi now, which is a spectacle to behold (it is held on 24 June every year). You also can go there during the third sunday of September if you want to behold the \"Warachikuy\", another important festival.All in all, a place you just cannot miss on your visit to Cusco."

The blocks of stone are huge yet the spaces between the stones are straight and tight. Truly one of the marvels of Incan civilization. The structure is in the shape of the jaws of a jaguar which can really only be appreciated after climbing some steps. At almost 12,000 feet above sea level (the top of Vail, Colorado is 11,000 feet), those 100+ steps will take the wind out of you unless you take the time to acclimate first. So, see Sacsayhuaman after spending at least one night in Cusco. (They sell tiny bottles of oxygen at the Cusco Airport for a reason.)"

The entrance fee to these ruins (and all the ruins in Peru) are expensive but that's what you're there for so whip out your wad of soles (Peruvian money) and pay the toll. Note that, if you are going to go to other ruins (Olytytambo etc.) make sure you get the multi-location pass. You'll save money for sure. Anyway, back to the \"Sexy Human\" (what the guides call it for fun) ruins. They are really beautiful. Set in a large flat plateau above the city, they offer wonderful views of Cusco and a great taste of the amzaing ruins in all of Peru. When you leave, continue walking on the same road over the mountain (don't retrace your steps down the hill again) and then cut down the steep staircase into town. You cannto get lost and although it looks sketchy, it's very safe. When you get down past some ramshackle houses, you'll come out into a warren of shops and cafes that are really cute with some great arts and crafts. Enjoy! Peru is the bomb!"

The space between each boulder is so tight rainwater doesn't even seep through. All this amazing construction is done with only stone tools. It has been theorized that Sacsayhuaman might have been used as a fort, or a monument to attest to the greatness of the Incan empire. The shape of it is supposed to be an outline of a puma's head from aerial view.This area is just huge and there are ruins on the opposite side of the walls too. On the hills you may find an alpaca/llama herd grazing. We took pictures with them and they were friendly. You can walk amongst them too but as with all livestock don't get too close. A different tour guide told us that behind the walls there are underground tunnels suspected to lead to other Sun temples or buried treasures.

Yes in Peru we can see inca ruins (or even ruins of an older civilization : nazcas) but the Incas built a lot of their foundations on older ruins that people have no idea where they come from, we just know they had been there before incas. We don't even know how those foundations were built because some rocks weight something around 20 tons.In Sacsayhuaman we can totally see the difference between the inca's foundations and the \"older/mysterious/not-human?\" foundations. Those latter are just too huge and too perfectly cut and put together to have been built by humans ages ago.This is what makes this place special, we can't stop wondering how (and by who) those foundations (that were used by the incas, but they had been there before) were built.AWESOME place."

First, it is one of the few Inca ruins where we can definitively say, \"this event happened there on this date,\" since it was the scene of a major battle in one of the Inca rebellions. This is quite a rarity, since the Incas didn't leave a lot of written records (for example, millions of people visit Machu Picchu but we don't even know why it was built or have any record of a single event that occurred there). Second, it's architecturally very impressive. Finally, it's a nice place to walk around. It definitely helps to have read something about the Incas, their architecture, and the struggle against the conquistadors. Or you could take a guide. The one downside to ALL of the Inca ruins around Cusco and the Valle Sagrado is that there is virtually no interpretive material on the sites. If you go expecting a sign at each structure speculating on what it was used for, or talking about design principles and techniques, you will be disappointed. There is nothing, anywhere. That having been said, if you do some reading in advance, or hire one of the guides, all of the ruins are an amazing experience. Also, it's cheap. I saw a lot of reviews in which reviewers were complaining about the price (130 soles is too much to pay, etc.). But the 130 soles isn't just for Sacsayhuaman - it's for the boleto turistico, which gets you into ten sets of ruins and three or four museums. That works out to about three dollars per site. I don't think this is expensive at all."

Of the many narratives that the local guide told about Saqsayhuaman, was that the Incas built Cusco in the shape of a Puma and Saqsayhuaman forms the head, A likable story as the remains on site are three different levels of zig-zagging walls, that could represent the teeth of the Puma. Another narrative states that 3 different levels represents the Inca religious symbolism of the Underworld (Snake), the Earth (Puma) and the Heavens (Condor). The first level of walls are the most impressive as they comprise massive boulders, the corner stones are more than 25 ft high and supposedly weighs more than 120 tons. Besides the megalithic size of the boulders, the different shaped stones are fitted precisely, without the use of mortar and \"no blade of glass, paper or steel can slide between them\". At the top level there are remnants of what appears to be a circular tower and other buildings.The main negative about visiting this site like many archaeological sites in Peru is the lack of comprehensive on-site documentation. Therefore you would first need to read up on the site before your visit so as to understand the significance and to develop a checklist of significant things to look-out for. Second you need to have a good local guide to tell you the stories and to point out the significant points on site. So do your homework first in order to enjoy the visit later."

We walked up from the town following a very basic map......a little steep at times but managable. Loveky to walk around the area once in the grounds. Lots of alpacas and birds which provide added interest. You are able to climb up to the statue of Christ which we decided not to do."

Now, this is an amazing place when you look at the architecture, the stone mason work, the geometry and calculations that went into building these terraced structures, some stones are 9 metres long weighing approx. 350 tons. The thought of intelligent processes put in place to move these granite stones is mind boggling. Incorporating into this is the Inca traditions of Serpents, Puma and the utilization of seasonal Equinox sundial properties. It is no doubt brilliant. The nearby gift by Brazilian Government of the statue of Jesus Christ- similar to the one in Rio, also offers some breathtaking views of the city.There are also friendly brown and white Alpaca roaming these areas and for some, that alone could be worth it. The Alpaca factory store on site also sells garments and Jewelry- I thought it was very steep but you can bargain them down 10-15%If you have visited Machu Pichu, it is a much smaller structure and you would not miss a lot, from that point alone.I hope, this is helpful"

Amazing how the Incas could built this fortress in the Andes Mountain.......These boulders weight ...Tons....the complex is made of large polished dry stone walls, with boulders carefully cut to fit together tightly without mortar.The longest of three walls is about 400 meters. They are about 6 meters tall. We are a group of 12 from Canada, had a local tour guide explaining the history and took us through the site for about 1 hour. We enjoyed this visit during our stay in Cusco"

I would have had an easier time with that if it included anything.. i mean a freakin map would have been amazing.

Coupled with a few other destinations, a visit to this walled complex can be part of a great, historical and fascinating half- or whole-day trip while staying in Cusco. Just two miles northwest of the city, it overlooks beautiful, red-roofed Cusco in the valley below. The HUGE foundation boulders of the zig-zagged walls that fit in so precisely with each other, with no mortar in between, will make you marvel at the engineering skills of the ancient Incas, and you should take the time to wander up and around the ceremonial plaza, the hilltop sections and take a gander at the resident alpacas munching under the watchful eye of their alpaca-herder in the field just past the main entrance. I recently read that, if you arrive by 7 AM, there is no admission charge. Security guards arrive at 8. Unless you are carrying a travel guide, you might want to pay to join a tour group so get a full appreciation for the \"Sexy Woman\""

There is no option to only pay to visit one location. We didn't have time to visit more than one, so we didn't actually go in. However, we had a good view of most of the ruins, and we noticed that there weren't any signs or labels to tell you about the rock structures. So you'd also need to pay for a guide. This was something we noticed with many tourist places actually, an expensive entrance fee and an even more expensive guide fee. Where the entrance fee money goes, we do not know, because there is no infrastructure around the ruins, no informational signs, dirt paths and very few employees outside the guides. This made us hesitant to pay because we want the money we spend to go to maintaining the ruins and to the employees who maintain it.

The alpacas grazing in the background completed a most interesting visit. Lovely views from up high of Cusco in the valley made for excellent photographic memories."

People were clamoring to climb up this walled fortress (which we did, too) but really what you want to do is climb up the hill on the other side of the grassy bit so you can actually get a view of this massive structure from a close distance. Make sure you allow yourself enough time up here - it's very impressive. There were even alpacas grazing on the lawn. The views to Cusco in the valley below are also very impressive - we came around 5pm and the light was good over the valley. Sachsyhuanan is a must see site when visiting Cusco. We accessed this site independently with a car & driver hired for transportation between Ollantaytambo and Cusco, and extended the day to include sightseeing. We purchased the 130 sol / person Boleta Turistica del Cusco ticket which is good for 10 days and includes this site as well as 15 other sites or museums in the Sacred Valley and Cusco."

A large part of the complex was destroyed long ago but many of the walls and stairs remain. The stones weigh up to 120 tonnes and are perfectly in place which is quite amazing to see. We just explored the site ourselves because we didn't have a ton of time but it might be good to have a guide to get more of the historical significance out of the place. We walked up to the site from the San Blas area and while it was steep it wasn't an unmanageable walk. You might not want to if it's your first day at altitude though."

Along the way you get to visit the ruins of Pukapukara and Quenco finally ending at Sacsayhuaman. The walk takes about 4 hours and will bring you to ruins that are smaller and not on the tourist boleto. If you want to visit Sacsayhuaman without paying, go at 6 am and enter from the back farthest side from the city."

Great views of city. We walked up mid-afternoon & stayed til sunset - were lucky to have a rainbow pop up over the city.

But once at the top of the hill, you will be near the Christ statue, and will be able to see all of Cuzco. Defintely worth the walk.The ruins are not quite as spectacular as many other sites visited during our recent trip to PERU. We were told by our guide that this was a triple-walled fortress, which appears as the head of a Puma (from an airplane). Of course, you cannot see any of this on ground level, and cannot appreciate the complexity of the ruins.What you CAN see however, are the huge stones (thousands of pounds in weight) which were somehow transported down the hill form the quarry to the site. That in itself is a miracle. The stones are not as smooth as at some other Incan archaeological sites. But they are still assembled tightly together without the aid of mortar. And our guide informed us that the structure was at least another 6 feet higher originally, so you can see how this would have been some type of fortress.The stonework here is what is really amazing. In some respect, this stonework might be considered more complex, and certainly more serpentine, than say at Machu Picchu. Anyway, this site is close to Cuzco, and a nice way to spend a sunny afternoon. There is an open area around the ruins, so lots of dog-walkers, kite-fliers, and picnickers await you at the top of the mount."

The place is located the outside of the town of Cusco, the top of the big hill. Place is large and contains some of the very huge stones in three layers. The first layer is amazing with some 30 m high stones. The second layer is more like Inca style and symmetry. The third layer is like natural stones - round and manageable. The square between the walls is big and festive - I could see all the fest and worship going on that square. There I saw me my first lamas - and I was exciting to take pictures of them. When we arrived to the gate in the morning, there was no queues, but as we were in the park I noticed that there was huge lining going on in the gate. Reason for that was that you have to buy a ticket, mark your name in it and show the passport in the gate. And they stamp the ticket and perforated it - and it will take time ... Some bureaucracy at the gate takes time - but it is probably safe then?The place is its best with guide so you hear the stories. The place itself is beautiful and interesting, but you need the stories to make it lively. So take a trip with group/guide.When you are leaving out the area to the other end, you come a cross with women and children with baby sheep ages only few days. They give you an opportunity to take pictures with sheep and them - for some sol. I didn't have sol coins, but I give just some small change that I had, but the girl I gave them was so disappointed that I couldn't pay for real, that I feld bad and did not take the picture. Otherwise the place was worth of seeing."

Amazing place and worth going too!Tip- they do charge an admission fee so make sure you have enough cash with you."

The large size one of the main reasons why the stone was not stolen by the Spanish for use in Cusco (very close to the site) and by Peruvians until early last century. The smaller stones used higher up terraces have largely been taken away reducing the height of this site. Another part of the site was used as a quarry and further construction was halted when the Spanish arrived so there are some other unfinished terraces.

On my second visit here, I was the first visitor to arrive at 6.45 am and fortunate to be given a private guided tour by a shaman who happened to be there early. He showed me all the energetic hot spots around the site, the dark passageway in the rocks that you can walk through, various places which I wouldn't have found without his help ... then he showed me his ceremonial centre nearby. I felt very blessed to have had such a fantastic guide. You can go walking in the mountains after your tour. I found some stables close by and went to the Temple of the Moon on horseback which was brilliant. Tip: if you are only able to visit for a short time on a tour, keep your ticket and you may be let in again to have a longer look around if you have more time to spare."

If you're really fit, you can hike up there from Plaza the Armas. The guidebooks optimistically estimate 30+ minutes - but that's if you're truly athletic and in prime shape. Another reason for NOT hiking up, even if you're physically able, is the fact that it's not safe to be walking on the shoulders of narrow, twisty and hilly roads where drivers are not in the habit of yielding to pedestrians. You can get a taxi up, or to 'kill two birds with one stone', you can get a city-tour (on a double decker) for 20 soles, get off at Sacsayhuama - and spend as much time there as you want, then catch another double decker bus (from the same company) back to town. Once you're at the site, do try to spend at least one hour to waslk around and appreciate the wonderful craftsmanship of the long-gone Inca stone masons. It's a real shame that some tourists just stay on the bus, which stops for maybe 5 minutes, for photos from afar. I believe that one can only appreciate the intricacy, the precision, the workmanship of the Incas by walking up and down the structures (staying on the marked paths, of course), eyeing the individual stones as well as viewing the entire complex from every possible angle. It's amazing how these large blocks of stones, some 11 feet tall, weighing up to 300 tons, could have been precisely fitted to their neighboring blocks by workers who had no use of the wheel and no access to power equipment. On the historic side: this was the site where one of the last Incas dared to challenge the power of the Spanish conquistadores - and where thousands of his followers were killed by the Spaniards. Due to its close proximity to Cusco, its grand architecture and its historical significance, Sacsayhuaman should not be missed by anyone visiting Cusco."

It opens at 8 so get up there at 8 to beat the tour groups. Its a great sight with many picture opportunities. Get there at opening and start at the ground level where the big stones are to get the best pictures before people start to arrive. Later on work your way up to see the city from the top. Also good to do is walk to the other hill to visit the statue of christ and a better view of the city."

So I started early and wound my way up the skinny streets, ascending steep stairs where dogs slept and worked my way up, up, up along the stream, until I was way above Cusco. Sacsayhuaman was the fortress where there were two towers and a formidable wall that is impressive to see because of its zig zag formation. You can enjoy a fabulous view of Cusco from where the towers were as well as vistas of the surrounding mountains and trees. Llamas graze freely along the hills. I really enjoyed my hike up! Bring plenty of water and sunscreen, because there are very few places to shop up there. The city tour bus will take you up there, but they stop briefly at a remote tourist trap and there is no time to buy a ticket and walk the grounds. You could always taxi it up, but why not hike, after you recover from elevation exasperation. I say go!"

It was definitely all uphill, steep and draining in the hot sun. We were unsure if we were going the right direction because there is no clear signage or view of Sacsayhuaman from below. We used directions given by locals along the way and as we got higher, we used the Cristo Blanco as reference. I want to add that hiking up to Sacsayhuaman will be quiet along the way and if you are a woman or with other females, you will most likely get some catcalling along the way. However, I recommend hiking up to Sacsayhuaman if you want to challenge yourself physically. I don't recommend it if you are thinking about doing this the first day you want to arrive in Cusco. One of my friends just arrived on the day we were going to Sacsayhuaman and ended up getting altitude sickness that night. I really enjoyed the view of Cusco while we were up in the mountain. The huge boulders of this old fortress was absolutely impressive to me. However, if you want to compare it to Machu Picchu, it is no comparison. If you are not interested in gazing at huge rocks that are remnants of an old fortress, you may not find that your trip up here or the money spent will be worth it. I was excited to look for the \"slides\" that I've seen pictures of but could not find it when I was there. If you are going to be in Cusco for a few days and have a few hours to spare, Sacsayhuaman may be a great thing to put on your itinerary. If you have limited time in Cusco, Sacsayhuaman can easily be skipped. By the way, we took a taxi back down to the Plaza and it was only about 5 minutes! I think our walk up was about 45 minutes with plenty of moments where we needed to stop and take a break!"

The remaining stonework is very impressive and there are lovely views of Cusco from the top of the site. It hosts Inti Raymi celebrations every June 24th. Entry to Sacsaywaman is included with the Boleto Turistico S/130 (along with 16 other sites around Cusco and the Sacred Valley) which is valid for 10 days. You can also buy a partial boleto S/70 (with limited inclusions) at the site which is valid for the day. You can walk here in about 40 mins from Cusco, but it\u2019s all uphill so, taking the altitude into account, we got a taxi and then walked back down into Cusco instead. The site lacks any informative signage, so we negotiated a price with a guide at the entrance. We definitely found that the historical information provided by our guide added to our appreciation and overall enjoyment of the site.

            "review": "Sacsayhuaman Walls. Saqsaywaman was once the capital of the inca empire, it is a huge wall structure located at nothern of Cusco, about 20 minutes from Cusco downtown at an altitude of 3.701 m. It played an important role during the the spanish invasion as it was used as a fortress by the incas against the spanish conquerors.When our tour van set off to Saqsaywaman it was raining, our tour guide said that the rain was not good, and if it doesn't stop or lessen it wouldn't be possible to visit Saqsaywaman, but besides that that was our luck day, right after we arrived in Saqsaywaman the rain started to lessen and it almost stopped completely, but we bought a peruvian hat just in case and to keep our hair dry. We had no umbrellas, but the weather during the day was really nice so we didn't need one.The Saqsaywaman walls are really massive, the view is amazing and mesmerizing, most of the stones used to build it are really huge, that makes you think how the incas were capable of cutting, polishing and stacking up these heavy stones. You can hear a lot of people conjuring conspiration and aliens theories to explain it. At a first glance, the place seems something fake, but once you get closer, have a better look and touch it, you realize how real it is and makes you admire even more what people are capable of achieving once they have a purpose and the right \"motivation\".The are a total of three line of walls that spreads through a long part of the site, at the middle you can find a huge open area that is if often used in modern days to celebrate the annual winter solstice Inti Raymi inca festival.The place is usually crowded with tourists with a lot of tour groups visiting the place at the same time, but will find lots of space to roam around, to have a better view of the walls you can go up the stairs of a steep hill oposite to the walls, and from the top amuse yourself with the stunning view of the entire site.So, be sure to have Saqsaywaman in your trip plan.Check out my travel videos on Youtube:https://www.youtube.com/user/ricfsCheck out my travel blog:http://www.tripcall.net/Check out my travel pictures:https://www.flickr.com/photos/ricardofs/"

Before going to Sacsayhuaman, I had already visited several Inca sites including Machu Picchu, and part of me thought that I shouldn't bother going as it would just be more of the same.

Before you know it you are in an initiation tunnel, it is only one minute long but not for those with claustrophobia."

The large site overlooks the city and contains an impressive view of the valley and offers a nice backdrop for pictures.It is the construction of the stone blocks that make visiting this site a must. These ruins have endured some devastating earthquakes, but the engineering techniques the Incans utilized in construction (rounded stone edges, interlocking shapes and leaning some stones slightly inward for structural integrity) helped many sections survive. Much of the destruction was due to the Spanish dismantling of the structures to utilize the stone for their own purposes."

All that remains here of the stonework are some of the three tiered fortification walls and a portion of the ground level foundations that used to be the base for the stronghold & towers, as the rest was used by the Spanish as a quarry to construct Colonial Cusco's buildings. However, what does remain is a tremendously impressive testament of the Incan's stonework skill, unmatched in all of the Americas.The blocks are gigantic, and were fitted so tightly together using rudimentary bronze tools and sand to polish and final fit that a singular piece of paper cannot fit between any two. This is truly amazing, esp in light of the fact that what remains does so after withstanding numerous earthquakes that flattened buildings and cities thru ought the years.The siege of this fortification by the Spanish ( which will also give you first hand Spanish accounts of what the original towers and building looked like ) is well worth the historical read. Also interesting is that Cusco was designed in the shape of a Puma, and this was the Puma's head. The views from the highest walking point over Cusco and the bowl ( which was entirely underwater, a lake many years ago ) are spectacular."

Information about the site was scant, even on the web. So unless I want to do a major study I have to guess what some of the features were about. There is controversy about the circular ruins on top of the high reaches of Sacsayhuaman but they were amazing to see. This site is interesting because it is build on a plateau so there is a large circular field on flat ground (different to the circular structures on the hill). Take your time here it is worth it. Those huge rocks were carved and brought to their resting places yet we don't know how this was done. The Incas were pretty amazing with their construction abilities. This was my second visit to Sacsayhuaman and I'll probably go again. The steep walk up from Avenida Arcopata or Plaza de Nazarenas are well worth the walk as you get better and better views of Cusco on the way. Yes you'll have to stop a lot as you puff and pant your way up, but it's worth it for a good work out. I loved this site."

Full disclosure: I never made it to Coricancha and I hear that one is really awesome too, maybe better than this one. We hired a taxi driver to take us to several of the ruins and then bought a day pass to half of the sites (your options are a day pass to all of the sites (120 soles) or to half of the sites (60 or 70 soles), there is no a la carte menu). The upside of this was we saved a lot of money. Our driver was 60 soles and he was with us for about 3 hours. The downside is he was just a driver and we didn't have a guide to explain what we were looking at. And there were no guides or books at the sites. So we googled it all when we got back to our hotel that evening, but it's not the same as knowing the significance of everything while you are at the site.

Guides, fluent in English, were available on site for a fee, but I opted to explore the ruins on my own with a guidebook in hand. The construction of Sacsayhuam\u00e1n was begun in the fifteenth century by Inca leader Pachacuti. It took\u00a0decades to build. Thousands of men used thick ropes to haul the massive blocks of stones from quarries many miles distant. Such a labor force was readily available since Inca lords imposed a labor tax on their subjects. Apparently built as a fortress, Sacsayhuam\u00e1n must have been awe inspiring to set eyes on during its glory years. It's now just a shell of its former majesty. The Spaniards, after subduing the Incas and occupying Cuzco, turned this fortress into their own quarry. The superstructure of the fortress was disassembled block by block. Those finely hewed stone blocks were then used by the Spaniards for walls and buildings in Cuzco. What remains today of Sacsayhuam\u00e1n are the massive foundation stones, many weighing more than 100 tons, with some reaching 300 tons. This foundation is arranged in three tiers. I strolled along the rows of blocks, set in a zigzag pattern. I was struck by their sheer size. Some seemed to reach twenty feet in height. And I was awed by how tightly the blocks were still fitted together after centuries. And without the use of mortar! I noticed that in places on these walls some of the blocks interlocked at their corners. Apparently this architectural feature was to prevent the massive stones from slipping away from one another in what is an area beset with earthquakes. So successful has been this construction that even today a knife blade cannot be inserted between the blocks! The ruins provide a commanding view down onto the city of Cuzco. After taking in these magnificent ruins, I hoofed it back to my hotel, an easy hike down a steep gradient.A site not to be missed."

There are no information boards - so we were glad we had invested in a guide to explain the complex to us. There is no way we would ever have known what most of the ruins were originally. Well worth the 30 soles! There are huge rocks cut and fitted together in true Inca style. What an amazing race of people! There is an excellent view of Cusco from the ruins."

We arrived at Sacsayhuaman as part of the City Tour from Cusco, and it was the highlight of our tour.Maybe not as impressive as Machu Pichu due to the relative flatness of the terrain, but impressive nonetheless. The area of the temple is huge, and there are some great examples of the magical stonework, with many of the stones weighing several ton (see my photos). It remains a mystery to me how these stones were cut and lifted into place. Despite all the theories expounded by the guides, no one has managed to duplicate the building process, despite all the modern equipment we have at our disposal."

Most people can hike (not difficult) to the entrance within an hour of leaving Plaza de Armas. If you don't care to take the hike, it is a inexpensive taxi ride up. There are always 'guides' hanging around to offer their services. Many of these 'guides' are not professionally trained, but with a 'proper interview' you should be able to determine if you like what they can offer.You can easily spend several hours at the site, once you get an idea of the layout and follow some of the available brochures.Enjoy"

The climbing up and then down and then up again were necessary in order to see parts of the site. It is a very large site and without a guide or some advance reading it would probably be just a bunch of large rocks .There are little or no signs on the site explaining anything. You can walk up to the site but given the elevation of 3,701 m or 12,142 ft its a little exhausting. You can get a taxi to drop you at the highest point on the site and then walk down but there are no hand out pamphlets or guides on site. These Inca men must have been very strong to have moved all these rocks and arranged them into the fortress that it is. The only bathrooms are at the entry and the site is large and on a hillside."

The fortress wall was uncovered and you can see the huge boulders that were used in the construction. It is very long and in the shape of a snake, when observed from above. The area where the stones are from is across the small opening from the wall. Construction techniques are still unknown, but there are few exhibits on how the stones were cut and grooved for fitting and placing in the wall. However they did it, they really knew how to fit and place stones, especially to withstand all the earthquakes that have occurred in the past. Climbing to the top of the wall you get a great view Cusco with its blanket of red tile roofs. While we were there we experience a flock of Alpacas with their shepherd on the valley floor. Be sure to go with an experience local guide, they will make the visit more interesting and you will get a better understanding of the culture. Our guide was great."

            "review": "the closest Inca ruin site, walkable from downtown Cuzco. There are various spellings you'll see to this name. One I've seen often is \"Saqsayhuaman\". It's on the hilltop just behind the Plaza de Armas. You can get a Boleto Turistico to this site as part of the 4 sites that is all clustered together on the hilltop behind Cuzco valley. Tambomachay, Puca Pucara, Q'enko, and Saqsayhuaman, can all be seen together for 70 Soles in 1 day. I'm sure you can get a ticket to enter just Saqsayhuaman by itself, but not sure how much it is. The day we went up we had planned to go do all 4 sites, but the weather turned really bad as soon as we got to Tambomachay (the furthest one away). Thunder clouds rolled in and it started to hail and it got very windy, cold, and there was lightning. We managed to also see Puca Pucara, but had to skip Q'enko. We got a taxi to take us up to Tambomachay and had planned to walk down to the other sites. On a nice day this would not have been any trouble at all. By the time we left Puca Pucara we decided that we probably needed to get a ride back down somehow. Luckily, a very nice Peruvian couple spotted us 3 tourists walking along the side of the road and offered to take us back down to Cuzco. We went passed Q'enko, but decided to at least try to get in Saqsayhuaman since we had already forked out 70 Soles to see these 4 sites. I wish we got to spend more time at Saqsayhuaman as it seemed like a very impressive site. Those HUGE stones along those walls will just blow your mind. How in the world did they even move these stones into place?? All the information about the place says its a fort given it's layout and strategic location above the city. But that's mainly from the perspective of the Spaniards coming in. I do wonder though if there is another explanation for what this place was really meant to be .... You can get a fantastic view of the Plaza de Armas from Saqsay. And after you're done you can just work your way back down to the city with not much trouble at all. Definitely worth it to visit this site and so close to the city.One major piece of advice .... we came here the 2nd day of being in Cuzco and so we were not yet savvy taxi negotiators. Besides I didn't have a clear idea of how far Tambomachay really was from Plaza de Armas and so didn't know what would be a fair and reasonable rate to negotiate. As it turned out it really was not very far at all. We paid 30 Soles for the 3 of us to get up there (just 1 way). But in hindsight it should have been no more than 15 Soles. It only costs 15 Soles to get to the airport from downtown, and later on we did a day trip out to Moray & Maras in a shared taxi (combi) that was only between 5-7 Soles per person each way and that was 30km from Cuzco. Tambomachay must have been less than 10km for sure. If you do a shared taxi it should not cost more that 5 Soles per person one way for sure. Stand your ground and don't back down."

There was absolutely no information available unless you wanted to pay a guide. No plaques, no map from the ticket office, nothing. Our guidebook had some limited information so we got the point, but I really felt like we overpaid to see some rocks. I'm not sure what they use the money for. From what I can tell there was one employee and very little upkeep necessary. What's worse, I'm fairly certain that you don't need to pay to get in. There seemed to be about 20 different ways to get in and out, and there was nobody checking tickets or anything. I would say that if you're going, go in the back way - there is a large field to the left just before the ticket office (if you come by car). Walking through that field will take you right into the ruins. If it cost under $5 I might call it 3 stars for the view."

First off, the size of the rocks, or perhaps I should say boulders that are perfectly laid on top of other boulders is amazing. It is impossible to grasp how the Inca could have accomplished such a feat. What is more amazing is looking at the site and imagining what it once was. I am not a big fan of guides at archaeological sites. Typically, with a guide you get a lot of false information, or guesses presented as truth. However, when you go to a place like Sacsayhuaman, it is necessary that you either read about the site in advance or get a guide to tell you about the history of the site and what once stood at the site. Keep in mind that the majority of the stores were taken into Cusco to build Spanish buildings. This is a MUST SEE if you are in Cusco! You will not find Incan architecture of this scale anywhere.

The stones are immense. It is really amazing. If you can read The Last Days of the Incas before you go it will help you visualize the purpose.

They Spaniards had no idea of what they were looking at, at all. Based on the chronicles of Pedro de Cieza de Leon whom is titled self appointed (later by the crown of Spain) the FIRST CHRONICLER OF THE INKAS. Sacsayhuaman isn't really a military fortress, (And yet here is where the last rebelion of the INKAS lead by TUPAC AMARU II was fought against Spain and lost) That in fact Sacsayhuaman was in part a warehouse but mostly was a RELIGOUS COMPLEX. Cieza whom had being a witness to the invasion of the Empire of Tawantinsuyo, arrived at 13 - 14 years as an square, comeback as a soldier at 16-17 and lived 17 years in PERU (Died at the age of 35 a year later after coming back to Spain) He took as his life's duty traveling across the entire Empire to record not only of what he was seeing but everything he could taking his time investigating, talking to the survivors of the massacres specially to the nobles to let the generations to come INKA and European known the crimes committed against humanity and the World instead of acquiring the knowledge of how the INKAS had accomplish such incredible organization and productivity in all possible aspects on a such bast and hardship land. He describes in detail the purpose of this complex. \"THE INKAS OF PEDRO DE CIEZA\" it's a wonderful book to read. Very clear, concise, impressive, and almost sad - fun :(.Translated into English it contains two of Cieza's books. Pedro Cieza's chronicles were banded by the \"holly inquisition\" since PEDRO brought to light not only the amazing history of the INKA culture and race but the unjustly abuses inflicted on the \"Noble people of PERU\" as he calls them and savages, ignorant nitwits and cruel to his fellow man the 'Spaniards'...

An absolutely breathtaking site containing a fortress of enormous proportions whose building must have called forth the maximum in human energy, endurance and skill. The height and thickness of the stones used in its construction are massive. They were obviously pulled over long distances by large teams of lower workers, using ropes and ramps to aid their formidable task. The most dramatic component is a large Plaza sued for ceremonial and sacrificial purposes that is buttressed by three levels of terraced walls, and for which dramatic views of Cusco can be enjoyed. Many storehouses, suitable for military equipment as well as food, can be seen, as sieges of the Fortress taking place during external assaults on Cusco have been authenticated by scholarly research. Ultimately, many of the smaller stones were removed to Cusco to expand the city, but the larger ones that remain provide the finest examples of Inca stonework: adjacent blocks are cut and polished to interlock without the use of mortar, and the joints are so perfect that the thinnest piece of paper cannot pass between them. The mountain scenery visible from this site is among the best you will see in all Peru."

I couldn't even begin to imagine how the complex shapes of the stone blocks were finished so that the blocks connected so tightly together.Sacsayhumuan is very easy to visit if you are staying in Cusco and well worth going with a qualified guide."

You cannot even fit a piece of paper between these mammoth stones. They are shaped in points jutting out from the central area.

The way that the Incas were able to move the large tablets, weighing around 200 - 250 tonnes, is amazing. We saw the ramp where they rolled the large stones down from the quarry on the adjacent hill, and then brought them up again. Similarly, the stonework where they fitted these huge stones to closely together and then finished them beautifully. It would have been nice to have also seen a reconstruction of the site in a larger scale. Secondly, our children loved the Llamas that were playing around the site (and some were tethered there), which made it much more appealing to them than simply being ruins.

Although the tour was helpful both from an informational and logistical (transportation) perspective, we only spent about 1hr here and a straight-thru line, not getting the chance to diverge from the main open areas into nooks and crannies. Not as impressive at MP for sure but the size of the stones still makes you scratch your head as to how the ruins were built, proximity to town is an asset, and it's not nearly as crowded as it may appear in pics given its large size. Buy 'multiple entry' tickets for the local ruins rather than at each site--save Soles for eats. For those who are gonna hike walk there, do acclimate at least a day first--ain't NO easy climbs in this town for us sea-levelers but it's just a lungs/heart thing, not other physical danger.

In my last day in Cusco I was so tired to go anywhere else so I took a hostel mate and went up the hill to this amazing place that I cannot remember and say the name :)) The ticket I must say was little expensive but the views were absolutely gorgeous.First you have an areal over the city of Cusco (see pictures) which blows your mind away O.oBesides there are ruins to visit and huge stones where the Pre-Inca civilization used to hide when the Incas came to conquer the lands. I suggest go want on the stones, hide around and make it an adventure, the feeling is amazing.The Temple of the Sun hides a little bit further and can be reached either walking either horse riding (what we did for one hour) When you enter the stony cave a sacrifice rock is placed in the middle of the place, the stone where animals were sacrificed as offering to God.One of the most lovely things to see up there are the cute fluffy llamas and alpacas. I just could not get my hands of them. Consequence? I want one home now :)))Ride the horse on the hills, visit the local shop that lives there since ages and go more up with a bus to have even a higher view over Cusco (which we did not have anymore energy to do it)Drink coca leave tea before and have some coca candies with you in case of high altitude sickness. I did not have any problems but my companion did :)A perfect day out in the heart of Cusco!"

There is a path that you can walk back to the plaza de armas (I think it took about 20 mins but all downhill, so not very strenuous)The ruins are interesting and there are several areas to look around here. You could spend a good part of a day here easily. We all enjoyed this as it was part of our \"taking it easy while we aclimate\" plan.

Head up to the white taupalin, cross that and continue up the path. The hedges get pretty close to the path and it\u00b4s pretty steep but only takes about 5 minutes. When we got to the top we arrived at a road and there were lots of vehicles parked at the top - so if you can find the road it might be an easier walk up - or it would be possible to get a taxi... Cristo Blanco is fairly impressive, although there is wire 6ft up from the floor. The views of Cusco are spectuacular and you can see Saqsaywaman clearly too.

I was disappointed that they didn't provide a map of the site when you checked in. We felt they wanted you to hire a guide. Without a map, we almost missed two areas that are on either side of the main area. Remember to ALWAYS take some toilet paper with you as almost every bano that we used outside of a hotel or restaurant did not have any!"

It was the first place we visited when we got to the city.Tip: wear sunscreen. We were there at the end of the rainy season during the South American summer. Even though we were wearing long sleeves, pants, and hats, I managed to get sunburned badly ON MY HANDS. It didn't even occur to me that they were the only part of my body not protected and, due to the altitude, I got burned. Ouch.The ruins here have some amazing examples of Incan stonework. Huge boulders fit together as if with mortar, but with no mortar! Also, you get a great view of Cusco from the site, perfect for a \"look where we are\" photo.The best way to explore Sacsayhuaman is, in my opinion, with a guide. If you have the money, there are always guides available for hire there. The one we hired was quite a good English speaker and well worth the money; he was able to explain a lot of the features and history of the site and we learned much more than if we were just reading a brochure.Tip: There is a pass/ticket that you can buy here that is a combo-type ticket for a number of sites within Cusco (several of the museums included) and in the Sacred Valley. If you are going to be doing a lot of sightseeing in these areas, you should check it out as it is a time- and money-saver."

Sacsayhuaman was and still is an archeological wonder, the summit of architectural skills of the Inkas. They knew how to maneuver nature to their advantage. Sacsayhuaman was a very important complex that housed storage compartments where they kept provisions for the people in times of extreme necessities as it was also a religious ceremonial center. In the chronicles of one the first writers honoring the Inkas who's writings were forbidding by the \"Holy Inquisition\" - Pedro Cieza de Leon... with sadness and regret explains the beauty of what he had seen and the destruction he was being a witness too.. Sacsayhuaman as he tells it was the most grandiose sacred religious site where most of the year around great Inka ceremonies were performed and where the Inkas kept the most important momies and deities represented by them in gold, silver and precious stones. These treasures were ransacked by the Catholic Church titled them as demonic along with the greediest of Human kind back in those days the SPANIARDS.. When you visit the site you can still see the foundation of the round tower in the center of one of the sides of the fortresses stand. Here was where they kept the momies this tower was tall - high and stand over the entire complex... After it's destruction the stones were used to build the Catholic Churchs that now stand still around the entire city of Cusco. Since the last battle of rebelion fought by Tupac Amaru ll the last Inka whom almost won back the Inka Empire from the Spaniards but lost it to a treason, keptured, tortured and killed dismembered in the Plaza Mayor of Cusco - Wacaypata... Spain ruled free abolishing the citizenship of the Tawantinsuyo Inka people took away not only the land, it's riches but dehumanized them as well. The Catholic Church proclaim that these people weren't worth going to the kingdom of God because they were evil. Tupac Amaru ll was the last breath of freedom of the INKA EMPIRE...

Overpricing is ruining the 'Sacred Valley' experience....the only thing sacred here now seems to be the God of Mammon."

We ended up getting the ticket for Sacsayhuaman (which for s/70 can be pricey but worth it)the ruins are neat but a lot like others. However most people really miss out by not exploring the entire park. We walked around, hiked over walks, saw the Inka slides, and spent a good five hours there.Take some wine and a snack and enjoy your day in a far more quiet and peaceful setting.

This site was the only one where we did not have a guide, as I was hoping there would be one at the entrance for hire- but there was not. While there we saw a small heard of alpaca, which was a fun to see. The stones used in the site are the largest we had seen amongst all of our ruins visits. While there, we took the short walk over to the Jesus Christ statue that looks over the city. Overall, I think I would have enjoyed the site a little more with a guide."

If you are in good physical condition and won't mind the climb, there are plenty of things to stop and see/do on the way. Otherwise it would just be a short cab ride. The ruins are interesting because of how extremely large the stones are. Moving and carving these ginormous objects seems unimaginable. There are also excellent birds eye views of Cusco from the top. We actually planned the rest of our route for the day from the resting point at the peak. There were also many llamas/alpacas in and around the site, which is fun for everyone!We didn't find the (more expensive) tourist ticket necessary, we purchased the tickets for $15 a piece, which also includes 2 other nearby ruins. It didn't seem like many people knew about this option. There are guides for hire on site. We chose to go it alone, but I'm sure they are willing to strike deals for their services. There are restroom facilities available, but bring some tissues or your own toilet paper! (Do this for all of Peru!)"

I have never done this type of tour but have heard it is a generic tour and does not last as long as people would want.I have done it privately and you go at your own pace. You decide how long you want the tour to be.We decided for a whole day. We walked up to the site from the Plaza de Armas and leisurely visited everything. We walked from one site to the next and rested as needed. At the end of the afternoon, we stopped to eat at a restaurant outside the site and had a good meal. It was nice ending the day outside of Cusco.We took a combi (mini-bus) back down to Cusco.I suggest that you mini-interview your guide before hiring him or her. I interview to get a feel of their level of English (or whatever language). Peruvians are not offended by this. Of course, the guide could speak perfect English and not know a thing about the place! If I am going to pay more money for a private guide, I want to be able to understand what is being said!!! You could ask at your hotel if they can suggest someone. Or go to a travel agency and ask there for a private guide.You could opt to go alone but it can be unsafe. Robbers really like the lone tourist. So extra precautions are needed."

The Inka sections are characterised by their mind-blowing geometric stone cutting, on a truly epic scale. The Spanish trashed the site looking for gold, then knocked most if it down to build their own buildings in the city centre. The area was also used as a quarry in the 18th century. Getting there is easy enough. Get the Christo Blanco combi from the Avenida del Sol for 80 centimos. Alternately you can walk. I was told to watch out for muggers both at and around the ruins so go in a couple or more if you can. The views over Cusco are stunning, as are the wildflowers that grow everywhere. You can get a guide at the entrance but going quizzed a few I wouldn't say they know a massive amount beyond the usual historical dogma. It's rather expensive for what it is, but a good way to spend a morning."

Three-hundred ton stones, quarried, moved, and hewn to fit together with laser-like precision. Truly an amazing site that poses more questions than proofs for answers. TIP 1: It's pronounced \"Sahk-sahee-wah-mahn\" (I've heard so many butchered versions, thought I'd help out)OTHER TIPS: It's at 12,000 ft altitude so be prepared for that; You'll take lots of pics; Put a person in front of/next to some of the bigger stones to provide a sense of scale; learn about it before you go, it'll be more impressive for you that way. (p.s. indulge yourself in all the \"conspiracies\" of how they are built). Although you may have paid for a tour, you will have to pay approximately 70 Soles ($28 US) for a 5 park/site pass that gives you access to this and others in this area, although it wouldn't surprise me if you don't pay until the 2nd or 3rd site. As you leave the site, there are groups of little bitty locals (Cholitas) dressed in traditional Quechua clothing along with llamas and/or alpacas. They know enough to say, \"voluntary donation\" for a photo op - so be prepared for a tip, BUT also be prepared for them to say, \"No, not enough!\" and I was generous - so they will try and milk you for more, just stick to your guns and say, \"Eso es todo\", meaning \"That is all\".All pics I've posted here are from Sacsayhuaman"

For example, we wanted to go where the towers used to be erected, the towers have been gone since the colonial times but it happens to be one special magnetic place (if you don't want to believe that, that is fine). I have been there several times over the past 15 years and this would be my last visit. Not only that but I recommend to avoid and even boycott. The regional or city government that sets up the price are only interested in the money. Little or no maintenance has occurred, other that getting some contention barriers so some of the walls don't completely fall apart. For US$28.00 I expect full access: price is been about same for several years but tourists see less and less and that is just NOT acceptable. Either post a sign a the office where one buys the ticket, so an informed decision can be made, or reduce the price. I estimated well over 60% of the entire site is not accessible now. Very upset!"

Our first taste was Saqsayhuaman above the city of Cusco. We were totally impressed with the vision, design, and technical prowess of the stone work there. As for the reviewer that complained about the price: it would be worth it just by itself, but it is part of the Boleto Touristico, which will get you into 15-16 different sites in the area, so truly a bargain. BUY ONE AND GO SEE THE PLACES ON IT!"

It is a HUGE wall made of a zig-zagging formation which was created to expose enemy flanks in battle. The zig zags represented puma's teeth (sacred animal to Incas). Unfortunately, they were conquered here and the Spaniards disassembled the wall in places to build the buildings you see in Cuzco today. Incredible how the Inca built this wall! A must see in Cuzco!"

It is a HUGE hassle to make it to all three locations in the same day before your ticket expires. Their refusal to sell individual tickets is a blatant way to get more money out of western tourists. As for the ruins itself, it was just ok. most of the ruins is closed and not accessible. the large stone walls were different but not worth $50 USD for my wife and I to attend. You also need to pay for a $10 cab ride (each way) and bring lots of water with you. there is a HUGE drop off from this site and Machu Picchu. We were dissapointed"

The first half of the tour (the shorter option) was your \"standard\" Inca ruin stuff - fabulous walls, huge stones, awesome doors/windows, Puma paw in the wall, etc. But the second half (across the \"field\" from the \"main\" part of the ruins) was wonderful, and totally had not come on my radar even after having done research in advance. It was like an Inca playground, with slides, caves, tunnels, grottoes; really wonderful. Nice views of Cusco from here. We walked to Q'Engo from here, but it is not marked, not obvious, not clear on the tourist map.

The cost of entry to this site alone is 70 soles. Not sure of the Boleto cost, but you can use it at Moray and the salt mines too I believe. This site is one that clearly attracts many locals on Sunday in particular as families are seen picnicing, hiking and playing soccer. The giant boulders are amazing and the position of this Inkan fortress was a great choice given it's position above Cusco. You can just drive by this enormous site, but if you have time, use your ticket and spend some energy strolling and climbing the ruins."

Quiet ,peaceful and calm.On the way back you pass textile weavers working outdoors in traditional methods. Very interesting and slightly upsetting to discover how long they spend weaving them and the price they accept for such quality work.

There is also the statue of Christ. All in all, you could spend at least half a day or all of it visiting these places. I had the Boleto turistico, which includes both these attractions. Do take care to stay within the limits of the site, I stepped outside and had to explain myself to a guard coming back in, even show my passport."

Being our first ruins, we were intrigued for about an hour, climbing them and exploring.Then we came upon the view of Cusco. Wow. Jaw dropping. We were lucky enough to be up there during a beautiful sunset. If you're into photography, then this is a must! Also, make the walk up to the statue of Jesus, as it's a neat little area to explore. When you're ready to head back down to the city, the walk is only 15 minutes or so.Overall, it was one of the highlights of Cusco for me."

It was a steep hike up but not that far outside of the main city. This site is included in the Cusco tourist ticket that gets you into a number of museums and other attractions throughout the area. Also right in the area is the Cristo Blanco overlooking the city, as well as a giant cross. The trails around the site are in good shape and relatively easy to walk, not too many stairs. However, a lot of the ruins were blocked off for maintenance of some kind. Given this, there just wasn't as much to see as I had hoped, and perhaps coming here after seeing numerous ruins along the Inca Trail and Machu Picchu was what made it less interesting to me."

Instead, what I got with the guided tour is a 20 minute run down which included what the site may have been used as, about the quarry process, and how the Inca moved the enormous rocks once cut. We then were permitted ten minutes to walk up to the top where there is a nice view of Cusco city. We then had to be back on the bus so that we could spend another thirty minutes at the Alpaca Wool Cooperative shop five minutes away. While I agree that buying from the Cooperative is a good benefit for the locals, I don't believe it should be at the cost of missing out on one of the most magnificant sites in the SV. A couple whom I had befriended on the tour sent me an email once they returned home and said they went back and spent four hours there!

Another cool mystery to contemplate.Walk up through the setting sun door was a bit challenging more with other tourists crowding around or trying to get you to move away for pictures than with the altitude. Great view of Cusco from the top.But Eddie also told us the sad lost of a fantastic monument when the stones were pillaged to put up some of the churches in town.Useful notes: there are bathrooms on either end of this ruin.

Other sites are highlighted by the remnants of temples or living quarters; Sacsayhuaman's structures are long gone, and what's left is the massive foundation of an important site. The focus today is on the stonework. The Inca carved massive stones into tightly constructed walls, all without mortar. These walls are a wonder.Another highlight is the view of Cusco from the site.

We were also pleased to discover that the notorious Cusco tourist ticket could be purchased as a one-day ticket rather than the full ten-day, which saved us money given our limited time.We hired a guy named George to show us around the site. He did a good job and seemed fairly knowledgeable. There was of course an \"artist\" who George knew waiting along the route, selling little hand-made statues. We bought one knowing full well that the artist's hands had just removed said statue from a shipping crate, but no hard feelings. Amusingly, they screwed up the choreography and another of George's 'artist' friends tried to sell us an identical handmade statue a few minutes later, and George tried to warn him off in rapid Spanish.We ended up renting a couple of horses from George to see three small, related sites. (Tambochay and two others, all discussed with Sacsayhuaman in the guide book, don't recall the names.) George sent us out with his ten year old daughter, who was very nice but spoke no English (contrary to his assurances.) It was getting dark by the end of the tour, and she ended it rather abruptly on a dirt road in the middle of the hills, instructing us pleasantly to \"walk straight, then take a right, then hail a bus.\" (it actually took two combis to get back to the plaza, we had to transfer.) My wife and I are fairly adventurous types, but it was a little odd being abandoned on an unlit country road well outside the city after dark. I would recommend reaching a clearer arrangement with George or his ilk before accepting tour services."

Interesting ruins, great view of the city, and while you are inside the boundary of the park the street vendors are not allowed in. A taxi up from the city center was 10 soles. When we went down the taxi driver wanted 15 -20 soles. Only a few taxis at the exit of the park- supply and demand. I think you can take the series of stairs to walk down to the city but since we visited the site late in the day (it gets dark very early in June) we didn't want to be in an unfamiliar area at night."

We took a taxi here from our hotel in Cuzco, had the driver wait, and then he took us back to the city. This was 25 soles, about $9.00 and so well worth it. There are alpacas grazing on the flat field at Sacsayhuaman, and this is where crowds come to informally play soccer, or to gather for the Inti Raymi celebration on June 21. We didn't spend a lot of time here, but I certainly think it is worth seeing to complete your idea of some of the major ruins."

The size of the stones used to build the zig-zag walls is unbelievable. We know they harnessed lots of human power, but still, the engineering knowledge was remarkable. Sad to know that the conquistadors were so fearful and hateful they had to tear down anything and everything they did not understand, and that it was not until sometime in the 1930s that the Peruvian government finally put an end to allowing builders to help themselves to what was left of what was obviously once a massive fortification/temple."

That is, Machu Picchu is awesome in itself, but I found this area to be doubly so. There are assumptions as to how the temple was built, but I don't think anyone really knows how it was done. Each tour guide will give you a different impression. Rocks that weigh thousands stacked upon rocks that weigh thousands???? Go figure! In any case, this is a DEF MUST visit on your travels through Peru. One of my favorite parts of the trip!"

Since we didn't bring ours, we walked to the White Christ nearby where you can take top view pictures of the site. Thought this was better since we didn't pay. So you have a couple of choices - go with a tour group, hire a cab to take you there, walk if you want/need exercise (about 20-30 min. hike from Plaza de Armas) then pay the entrance fee or hike up the White Christ for a free look. The Cusco view from the White Christ site is amazing. Lots of locals offering us horseback riding option which got annoying.

I visited Sacsayhuaman without a tour, but hired a guide there, that was great! Before this I did the Sacred valley tour so I was done with buses and organised tours, and had already some knowledge about the inca constructions. For me, to visit the whole \"city tour\" was very interesting, this is the group of 4 ruins, each one with a specific purpose in the life of the incas. And doing it with out a guide, doesn\u00b4t have any sense because there are so many not obvious things that must be explained by somebody that knows about it. Days after this I was in Machu Picchu, and of course it is overwhelming. I still think visiting Sacsayhuaman and the other ruins was good, in Machu Picchu the constructions made sense to me inmediately ,mainly because of all what I learnt before, even when the guide in MP was great. Cut it out of your itinerary only if you are really short in time. I was lucky to have time to visit all the ruins around Cusco. Tip: If you can, hire a guide recommended previously. In Sacsayhuaman the first one we hired was terrible and because we knew a little already we realised that, then we hired another person, called Lucho (an antropologist) that not only knew a lot, but was passionate to share his knowledge. Don\u00b4t have any other information besides his name, but I leave a photo in case you see him there and recognise himTip2: Take in consideration that if you are visiting several ruins and sights in or around Cusco, is better to buy the whole Boleto Turistico that allows the entrance to this and other main sights."

Most of the items are missable but Sacsayhauman should be a \"must see.\" Sadly, no. There is a single explanatory photo at the entrance and then you are free to wander -- but wait! Turns out most of the citadel is fenced off from visitors. You cannot see enough of the ruins to gain an understanding of the fortresses' arrangements. The bulwarks, arranged in slants, for example were an innovate design at the time, centuries before the star-fortresses of Europe discovered the virtues of enfilading fire when defending a castle. The guides I overheard had very little information and some of it was obviously wrong: you build form-fitted 30-ton stones with water freezing and cracking the stone. (I heard this explanation throughout Peru but a little Goggling will set you straight.) Sacsayhuaman (it's a Spanish rendition of the Inca/Indian word 'sashaywama' (my attempt at the phonics). is the \"head of the Puma of Cusco\" (cuscah in the Indian tongue) and the fort plus the area below it were the heart of center of the world. Sadly, none of that comes across at today's exhibit. Far better to visit Pisaq which is stunning visually and a lot more fun to climb around."

Sacsayhuaman is the largest and most impressive ruins site within a few minutes of Cusco (Pisac is a good hour away, as is Ollantaytambo). It's easy to take a taxi here, or you can walk from Cusco (if you're a masochist), but the best way is to go here with a tour guide so he can explain to you about this site.The most impressive feature of this site is the stonework - it stretches the imagination to think how the fairly primitive Incas could have collected these massive stones, shaped them so perfectly, and fit them together absolutely seamlessly - you can't even slide a blade of grass between the stones! The site was built in about 1508, and purportedly took between 20,000 and 30,000 men over 60 years to build. Of course, like most Inca sites, when the Spanish came, they figured such mastery must be the work of evil spirits and destroyed it in the name of Catholicism, so there isn't a lot of it left now. People figure that the complex stood at least 10 feet higher than it does today.If you climb up the ruins, you can get a great view of Cusco, and a nice photo op with \"Viva Peru\" carved into the side of the mountain. The site is part of your \"all-ruins\" ticket for 130 PEN, or you can buy a ticket to this and two other nearby sites. There is a restroom here that is usable. Like all the Inca sites near Cusco, make sure to visit this site before Machu Picchu or it will seem quite unimpressive in comparison. It will only take a half hour or so to visit, it's not that big, but it is amazing to think that this city you're looking down on was once the capital of the Inca Empire."

There are also fantastic views across the valley cusco city below. We went on our own with no guide, only a guidebook - which we left behind !!! We managed to spend 3 hours looking at just the main temple !There are quite a lot of steps on the site so good practise for Machu Picchu ! We were a little annoyed that it wasn't possible to buy and entrance ticket to just this site we had to buy a ticket that included 3 other sites that we didn't have time / desire to see, so it cost us about \u00a335pp. The alternative was to buy the cusco pass which was about $100. We noticed that most attractions on this pass were extremely expensive to visit independantly so this may be worth purchasing.Must say however that the bathroom facilities were very clean."

Don't try to walk up if you are recently arrived to Cusco, it's all uphill and you will be sucking wind! There is no shade, so if it's sunny bring a hat or umbrella. There are bathroom facilities at each entrance. The cheapest ticket is 70 soles, which lets you into Sacsayhuaman and 2 or 3 other sites, but it's only good for one day. The other sites are up the road a bit, by bus or taxi. You can buy the combined ticket for 130 soles, which gives you admission to other archaeological sites and museums.

The walk is great practice for getting used to the altitude and for any further trips, and at the top provides an excellent view of cusco and the surrounding mountains.The ruin itself is quite large compared to others on the ticket, after the initial jagged formation make sure to cross the flat grass area and head on up the curved rocks (while we were in this grass area some llamas were being farmed providing entertainment as they chased each around us), on the far side of these are large smooth curved rocks which are good fun to slide down! At the bottom there is a circular patch of grass, on the far side of this is a hole which leads to a tunnel, this does become completely black as you walk through but just keep going and you will come out the other side of the rocks eventually! A nice way to spend a few hours on a quiet day.While here you can also walk across to the Cristo Blanco, i wasn't particularly impressed with the monument itself but there is a very nice view from it and you can continue walking up the road from here to Qenko and a little further to temple de la luna."

We probably should have gotten a guide since much of the sprawling site seems rather unplanned without someone to guide you through what it once looked like. Still, guide or no it's certainly not the kind of experience that you just can't miss so if you don't have time for it on your visit don't despair. If you do go hire a guide and be careful when you pick a horseback tour."

            "review": "Must see/do, impressive. The last review is way off. Sure it seems like an incomplete set of rocks because it is 75% destroyed by the Spaniards and Cusco government. For hundreds of years they stole rocks from this fortress to build Cusco. Although it is the top Sun Temple where Inti Raymi is performed, it is really built like a heavy fortress. It was so strong the Incas were able to hold off the Conquistidors from taking it over for 2 months and the only way they took it over was by cutting off the water to it. The remaining foundation and lower walls is utterly impressive in size and design. The rocks used are the largest I've seen in any of the ruins, including Macchu Pichu, at over 500-700 tons. The design is powerful with two dry moats and only 3 enterences. I felt impressive military power from this ruin that Macchu Pichu does not have, as it is much more a city dwelling with light military defences. Our guide said he lives down the hill from it and when he was a kid while playing in the filed next to the ruin a massive earthquake occured and he said he say the massive rocks slip and slide appart and go back and forth during the quake and the all settled back into their original possition after the quake as if nothing happened. He says the Japanese since visited and studied this site to learn how to design buildings to survive big quakes. With all the crazy cuts and angles of the rocks, there was a genius to it that will likely take many more years to even more appreciate.You have to see this one with a guide if possible. We did it as part of a horseback city tour. The landscape was nice but not impressive since we are from the SF bay area and are used to the similar type of mountainscapes of that area, but if you are from flatlands, then horseback might be your most interesting way to go. There is a beautiful natual vulcano rock formation in front of the ruin. Of course, pictures don't do any of these things justice."

            "review": "I can't see the puma!. Compared to Machu Picchu, Sacsayhuaman (pronounced unusually like sexy woman) seems like a pile of rocks and much more of a tourist trap. It's definitely worth seeing because it is huge, but I couldn't really see that it was supposed to be a puma. Although the one geographically interesting point is the stones carved by glaciers that came through millions of years ago. Other than that, once you leave you are subjected to a borage of locals looking to make a sole. Make sure to purchase the sites pass as it will save you money if you are going on a day tour."
