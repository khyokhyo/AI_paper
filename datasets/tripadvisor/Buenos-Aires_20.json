We found the garden very well maintained - similar to ones we visited a number of years ago in Tokyo and Kyoto. While boarded by busy streets, the gardens seem well isolated from the busy city. A wonderful display of plants and Koi fish. Depending on your interests, a visit will take approx. 1.5 to 3 hours. We enjoyed our visit very much and have recommended it to friends."

The park itself is wonderfully kept and very pretty all year round, as the different plants, trees and bushes show their lovely colors at varying points in the calendar. Apparently the horticulture on show includes black pine trees, gingko, sakura, and of course, the ubiquitous bonsai trees, that will impress all budding gardeners and karate kids alike.In case you are wondering \u2018why exactly are there Japanese gardens in Buenos Aires?\u2018, well, they were given as a \u2018thank you\u2019 to Argentina, by Japanese immigrants living in Buenos Aires, when they constructed this lovely five acre park in 1967.It is open from 10am to 6pm daily, year round, and costs a small fee to get in. To get there you can take a number of buses, including the 10, 37, 67, 102 or 130."

I loved the concept and was only disappointed that when we asked for a plaque for our daughter, they said, Kids could not have one to participate. I am not sure if there was a reason culturally or if it was something else. I felt it would have been a beautiful chance to explain to kids to let go of negative things (even little ones can learn about being more mindful and positie - not just adults).

Surprisingly, most trees don't bloom until the middle of October which is the middle of April up in the Northern Hemisphere. Considering that this is an almost semitropical city, you'd think earlier, but maybe it works the other way around in warmer climates, things being relative.I like the small Japanese Garden with convenient small bridges and well-cropped shrubs and plants. There is a very good restaurant inside the main building where, on the second floor, classes are taught for a variety of Japanese oriented martial arts, etc. It is very very clean. What I dislike, as do any who have commented to me, is the overcrowding of the water area, loaded with goldfish, I believe, but severely overcrowded, as if no one knows what they are doing when it comes to space for fish. The rest is a nice experience in a beautiful area of the city and again, the restaurant, authentic, a bit expensive, is a treat."

We ordered sushi and it came out on the wooden boat. There were also tables I saw in the restaurant that were low to the ground and you could sit on pillows to eat...So COOL!The gardens were very peaceful and seemed to be popular because there were a bunch of people there. It never seemed overcrowded though!!It was fun to watch the fish and walk over the bridges and admire the scenery.There were restrooms and an interesting gift shop as well.Fun Fact: There was some sort of \"Comic-Con\" event going on at the gardens during our visit, and it was interesting to walk around and try to guess who the people were dressed as!"

Understanding that it's June, chilly outside and not the growing season in BA, I still felt it was worth taking a look at the famous garden.THE POSITIVES:- artfully mapped out with quaint bridges over streams.- large koi in the streams.- the trees and shrubs are well manicured.- several small snack kiosks selling chips, ice cream, drinks, etc.- one snack stop offered a small selection of gluten free treats! Delicious empanada! The attendant did not speak English at all, but was very kind and patient to try and communicate with me.- the banos where acceptably clean and stocked with toilet paper.THE NEGATIVES:- the park is bordered on 2 sides by major roadways. The traffic noise inside the park is VERY disappointing. - the koi are hard to see, as the water is very dark and murky.- I took my time, and tried to meander slowly - still I walked the entire park in less than 15 minutes. It is quite small, which is fine except they charge $70.00 pesos for entrance. Not a terribly large fee, but unsure of the value.- unfortunately there was a large group of boisterous students there at the time that I was. Adding their energy and volume to the road noise made for a rather unpleasant visit. No ones fault here, but the small space couldn't absorb the numbers.Overall it wasn't a waste of time, but if you are on the fence about visiting - then I would save the 70 pesos for something else."

You can also have lunch or enjoy a typical Japanese te at the restaurant. The kids love walking around the park with it charming Japanese bridges and feeding the fish. You can visit the cultural center and learn a little about Japanese culture while you at it. The place is clean and safe. Bear in mind it has seasonal hours and usually closes at dusk, while the park entry closes an hour earlier. I think in summer it closes around 6 pm, plan your visit accordingly."

It hosts an exhibition room and for the month of April it housed examples of Japanese art including dolls, kimonos, origami, flower arrangement, and more. 70 peso entry fee. Main entrance is on Avenida Casares. If you're prone to mosquito bites like I am, you might want to use your anti-bug spray/balm/repellant of choice."

We were hoping for a greenhouse with some old bonsais, but aside from a few to sell, there was nothing. We may be biased since in Montreal we have a very large and very nice japanese garden with a rich collection of century old bonsais. Unless you are a fan or have a lot if time on your hand, this is not worth it in my opinion."

The grounds are well maintained and despite being located in a buzzing metropolis, it was surprisingly tranquil. One of our favourite features was the display of Bonsai trees available at the nursery. We enjoyed reading about how they are grown and looking at the different varieties. A stroll in the garden hand in hand is a lovely way to spend an afternoon. If time permits, it\u2019s also worthwhile to visit the onsite museum and appreciate Japanese works of art, instruments and traditional garments on display."

If I had a few days in BA I don't think I would make a special visit....if you have a week then maybe on a sunny day it could be a good place to just relax and take a stroll. The most impressive thing about this garden in my opinion was the sheer numbers of koi carp in the lake and some of them are huge. I did go and have sushi at the restaurant (separate review) and I would advise against it as it is very expensive. There is a separate little place that sells ice creams and that would have been adequate refreshment. Overall it is nice but nothing special, some good photo opportunities so if you are in the area and want to chill out from the hustle and bustle of BA for an hour then give it a go."

It's very small and will take you about 10 minutes to walk around - and that's at a slow pace! There isn't much to read and the only exhibition panel is all in Spanish which was also a little disappointing. We also tried the restaurant. Maybe the standard of Sushi in London is better but it was pretty bad in this restaurant. I'd try elsewhere for sushi.

It was built in the 1960s and has been beautifully maintained. I doubt you'd see anything like this anywhere else outside of Japan. The sushi restaurant inside the park is also a really nice respite from the ubiquitous steak meal. It's also relatively close to Recoleta Cemetary, which makes it easy to do both in a couple of hours."

It didn't help that it was a scorching hot day and I had just walked for miles through bustling streets and avenues to get here, but it wasn't the oasis of oriental calm I had expected. It was much larger than I'd imagined, but the size didn't add to making it impressive. It was just more of the same thing: little fish-filled ponds, cute little bridges, pagodas, bushes on and on. Outside, roaring traffic hurtles past unceasingly. It's a park but its parkiness is undercut by being intersected by highways full of traffic. This garden is an approximation of what someone brought up on Disney films, but hadn't actually seen an actual garden, might think a Japanese garden should look like."

It is a pleasant picturesque place to spend some gentle time in this vibrant city.There really is no need to book a tour as it is easy to find and not very large. It is a bit of a walk from public transport though A visit of 2 hours would probably suit most people. If you come in summer a hat or umbrella would be handy as the garden isn't completely in shade. Also bring water to drink and if you want a little food for the fish(carp) some of which are huge."

It was probably quieter than it would have been on a better weather day. The sky was now blue and the sun was back out and seeing the garden was an absolute treat.

He is studying japanese 7 hours /day and his English was not bad either. We exchanged email addresses.As in 2008, we responded to the \"feel\" of Japan. We spent time in Japan in the early 1970's.

We visited for an opportunity to take a break from walking in the Recoleta neighborhood. Many benches provided the perfect place to rest. The restaurant serves only Japanese food, but there are a few carts serving ice cream and cold drinks. It seemed a bit pricey for the size of the gardens."

Although beautiful sculptured with almost all iconic Japanese garden inventory, we could not find the Zen pebble garden, the public and the surrounding blocked any appreciation of the beauty of this garden in January 2015. The visiting Japanese Imperial family probably agreed. To admire the real thing fully and quietly, take an airplane to Kyoto.

I do realize that BA has been in an economic crisis for quite some time, but what I saw here reminded me of my trip to China in '99. It tried hard to give the authentic vibe but it came off like a cheesy amusement park attraction and the ponds were filthy. There wasn't enough vegetation to give it an organic natural feel like a real Japanese garden and the use of asphalt walkways was an eyesore. I went to the Portland, OR Japanese Gardens the year before and that was amazing so you're definitely underwhelmed here. Since it was right by a bunch of major roads and is a relatively small place, you can't ever get out of your head you're in the middle of urban Buenos Aires in some run down faux Japanese Garden. The gift shop was also in poor taste- there was way too much anime and hello kitty and not enough traditional, classy gifts. They sold all these japanese junk food for kids such as melon ice pops and pocky but nothing truly authentic or worthwhile PS: no toilet paper in the bathrooms."

It is one of the largest gardens of its type in the World, outside of Japan. It was a typical Japanese garden in that it featured manicured lawns, ponds full of large koi, streams flowing slowly over rocks, wonderfully pruned shrubs and small trees. It was not, however, peaceful, as it was bordered on three sides by busy, multi-lane roads and on the fourth side another park that sounded as though it was filled with dogs, their barking varied and continuous. We spent about ninety minutes strolling around the park and admiring its composition. Japanese gardens are very photogenic and I took many photographs."

It costs 32 Pesos (about two pounds Sterling) to gain entry and once inside peace and a lot of quiet reigns. The gardens are about 2-3 times the size of a soccer pitch and are laid out beautifully. There are bridges, lakes containing hundreds of huge Koi Carp, cafes, toilets, a shop by the entrance selling hundreds of plants for cheap prices and a rather pricey restaurant within the grounds. I went today and there were a few hundred visitors of all ages enjoying the atmosphere. Close by are the zoo, Botanical Gardens and the parks of Palermo ..... so spend the whole day in the area as it is a wonderful escape from the madness of Buenos Aires. The gardens are self-funding and receive no help and a most worthy of a visit."

Opened in 1967 by the then Crown- Prince Akihito (present Japanese Emperor) and Princess Michiko and inaugurated on occasion of a State Visit.The entrance is on Figueroa Alcorta Avenue on the northeast corner of the city's extensive Parque Tres de Febrero. Many bus lines serve the place as Palermo (the area in which the Japanese Garden is located is a busy one).It has a cultural centre, restaurant, a greenhouse (well known for its collection of bonsai trees) and a gift shop (with an extensive selection of Asian garden seeds and craftwork).A brigde \u2013 known as Divine Bridge - crosses the Central Lake, representing entry into Heaven: The Truncated Bridge, in turn, leads to an island where Japanese medicinal herbs are grown.A Japanese Peace Bell, a large ishidoro (kind of stone lanterns of importance to Buddhist traditions), sculptures, a Buddhist Temple, flora from Japan, South America native species and carps can also be enjoyed. Everything contributes to the colourful atmosphere of the place. Japan\u2019s traditional festivals are held here annually. The garden also includes a library with specialized volumes on Japanese issues, Cookery courses, Origami technique, Reading of Japanese Stories and Tales, and a free guided tour to the Zen Garden (on weekends). Last but not least: Acuatic landscape, kimonos and orchids expositions, and a bomsai clinic! Worthwhile. An oasis in the middle of the chaos! Relaxing! Would definitely go back!"

It looked like a Japanese restaurant, sounded like a Japanese restaurant, then we saw the menu... And it was all down hill from there. First off, the selection of maki available makes a California roll look legit. Every single option either has cream cheese or f'ing cheddar cheese. That's just sad. The noodle dishes had what looked like spaghetti. In the end we ordered a few things that seemed palatable. First were the salmon dumplings... These are more like deep fried salmon wantons... They arrived a little burned on the outside, and still frozen on the inside. Not cold, frozen. So we sent it back (and we never send back food) to warm it up. 5 minutes later, comes back... Still frozen on the inside. Embarrassing. Third time was a charm, and it ended up being an ok appetizer. In no way authentic, but passable.I ordered the tuna tataki. One of my favorite dishes, and listed as a speciality. Which they came back to tell me they didn't have any. Sad. Ordered some nigri in it's place. My sunomono salad was a pile of cold noodles and cucumber. Almost no seaweed, and barely any kani at all, I guess less than one piece of kani all told. It was tasty for what it was, but it wasn't a sunomono salad. My wife ordered the swordfish. This was delivered to the wrong table, where that patron mistook as his meal, and put his fork into the accompanying salad. The fork he had already used. The server noticed the mistake... But just moved it to our table. More fantastic service. The swordfish itself was decent, but could have used a little flavour enhancement. The highlight of the meal was my nigri. The fish was very fresh and delicious. This is what to order, even if the selection of nigri is very limited.When we were done our meal, it took 2 requests to get the bill,and about 15 minutes in total. Thank you for wasting our time. This was only the second time in my life I didn't leave a tip. Service this bad is an embarrassment, and would not be tolerated in any real japanese restaurant."

If you've been to the Japanese gardens in Rockford Illinois or the Pacific Northwest of the US you'll find this a real disappointment. Very little is special, and the water is so clouly any fish aren't visible. But it's a nice, tranquil place in the middle of the city, with plentiful benches, so it's worth it for that.

We took a picnic which saved on the quite expensive fast food available from the kiosk. What was interesting was a display of aquariums designed with bonsai tree type underwater plants and the garden shop which was selling normal bonsais in their own right. It is very popular with tourists & locals. The amount of people there when we went was overwhelming and not at all conducive to a feeling of peace"

The park is very small, has a lake with lots of carp, a couple of Japanese walking bridges, and ... well, that's pretty much it. You would have to be a very strong admirer of Japanese garden design to see anything else. If you're in the area, you might want to give it a shot, but really only if you have nothing else to do."

Ok, the tourism publicity says it is the bigger japanese garden of the world, an incredible place ....First of all, it's Ar$16, one of the most expensive atractions of this kind in Buenos Aires. Inside, there is a big lake, with two bridges and some shrubs pruned in oriental style. The water is dirty, with some garbage floating. There is a japanese house, with 4 kimonos, maybe the unique really interesting thing of the place. It's nothing excepcional, compared to the other gardens and lakes of Palermo. And after all, you can see similar places in any part of the world. It's better to use your time with other atractions, go there just if you really have time and already visited the mainly atractions of the city."

The signs everywhere telling visitors not do climb rocks, touch the fish, or walk on the grass became a source of amusement, and they detract from what peaceful beauty one might try to conjure. If you are short on time, go next door to Parque 3 de Febrero. The rose garden and lake are pretty. The people watching (as they jog, walk, roller blade and bicycle around the lake) is great. The museum had some good art when we were there, and, it's free."
