Along the way you see the hustle and bustle of Hong Kong as people go about their daily activities. We sat up the top at the front seat and took a lot of photos as we travelled along. Will be doing this each time I go to Hong Kong."

Something like $0.40 cents? One pays as one leaves the tram. Years ago, the upper deck was for rich people, the servants, amahs with their groceries, the delivery men, all took to the lower level as it was half the price of upper deck. Now it is the same price. One can have a great tour of H.K. On the tram from the western tip, to Shaukiwan, the almost end of the tramline. Oh there is Happy Valley tram as well. It travels the almost oval shape of the race course. Fun!"

If you can snag a seat on the upper deck the views are better, I love seeing the shops along the way especially in the Western District, and then the hustle and bustle of Central.

It only runs on Hong Kong Island and used to mark out where the harbour front used to be. These days, decades of land reclamation has meant that a lot of the tramways are now many blocks in from the harbour. The trams are great for shorter journeys and you avoid having to go all the way down into the subway and then out again if you were to use the MTR - the stations are deep and huge and it can take some time just to get to an MTR platform. The fare anywhere on a tram is just $2.3 which is just dirt cheap. They are often packed full but run very frequently so you rarely have to wait more than a couple of minutes for the next one to come along. They are generally not air conditioned so are a bit uncomfortable in the summer but still tolerable. Some of the tram cars are very, very old but still functional. But the rolling stock is gradually being upgraded and the newer trams are reasonably comfortable. You just get on at the rear of the car, exit from the front and pay as you leave by cash or Octopus card. No change is given if paying by cash. Even if you only do it once, make sure you take a tram ride on your visit."

It is such a convenient and low cost transportation it is always a bit crowded. Touring For tourists the best way to see Hong Kong is to start from the terminal station in the Western District or the Eastern District, hop on, go up to the top deck and try to get the front row seat. Otherwise, any window seat is great. Then see the various districts as the tram goes from stop to stop. Hop off when you are done and pay when leaving. You can pay with coins or the prepaid Octopus card. I think the entire ride is about US 40 cents. Bring a nice cold beverage and a camera. As practical transpirationIt sure beats going into the Mass Transit Railway (MTR) as there is no need to climb in and out, down and up all the MTR stations. That is, provided you are travelling along the northern shore of Hong Kong Island. The trams do not go elsewhere. It sure beats taxis. Taxis are snooty and hard to flag down. Empty taxis cover their meter and pass you right by. Then when you get one you are stuck in traffic jam. Tram lines are free from motor traffic. And they arrive at stops regularly. So it often is the fastest way to go. "

The tram can take you across Hong Kong island from east to west or from west to Happy Valley where the horse race track is. Avoid the rush hour to make sure you can get a seat on the upper deck. You can see the the Hong Kong streets from above.The whole journey may take over an hour. Best to do it in Autumn season around 9 pm after dinner if you have ample time to spare. It is better to board from the Tram Terminal either at western district or eastern district in order to experience the whole route. Please note the tram is not air-conditioned."

Sit all the way to the end of the line that will take you about 15-20 minutes. Remember to sit in the left at the upper deck so that you can stick your head out of the window. Do not sit on the right as your head may get chopped off with the oncoming ding ding going the opposite direction.

You can spend over an hour in the ding ding for 2,3 HK$, see the busiest shopping street and the business areas, and if you go outside of the peak hours, the tram is not full at all, si that you have almost all the upper deck for yourself. Not too comfortable, and cool, as windows remain open."

Use an Octopus Card rather than carry exact change. Trams are boarded from the rear and exited from the front. You pay on exit. You will need to be able to use stairs to board. In addition there are stairways to the upper deck. No air conditioning but plenty of open windows. Plan ahead to get off as you need to make your way to the front of the tram or miss your stop.

Slow, uncomfortable and often over-crowded, wouldn't miss them for the world. They are a tourist experience par excellence. Road transports answerer to vintage steam trains , but with a couple of added benefits. Firstly they are actually a practice and low cost, means of transport and secondly a trip from the Kennedy Town terminus to the Shau Kai Wan terminus is a comprehensive history/geography lesson about Hong Kong with the added benefit of enjoying the smells of spices and drying fish (on top of the Tram stop shelters) .Entry is at the rear and exit at the front where payment is made. Payment the same for any trip 2 mins or two hour .. Use cash or swipe your Octopus card.Tip In New Zealand we have a famous rugby football team called the All Blacks. one of the Keys to their World Champion status is their scrumaging ability. They learned this by trying to board Hong Kong trams. You may be first in the queue, but when the tram arrives a hoard of elderly Chinese ladies will push you aside and often Europeans are left bewildered at the stop as the overloaded tram departs. Learn fast, at tram stops, in rush hours, its all in fighting, use your knees , elbows, shopping bags, anything to stop being pushed aside.

In case of danger, the driver will \"Ding Ding\" the people nearby. Later on, we called it \"Ding Ding\" and all of the HK people know it.Almost all the trams are the same but there are 2 trams different with others.The newest one, number 88, air-conditioned. Just released in 2016 and having a trial run for 3 months starting from Jun 2016.The oldest one, number 120, most popular one. It is the 1st generation tram and almost all the visitors are waiting for this tram. I have to reminder you and please keep it in mind that the window in very old style. You have to hold tight the handle to pull up or down. If you release your hand at half open, the window will drop down and hit hardly on the frame. Until now, I do not know the teachnique to hold the window at half open.Why I say it is the fastest transport during traffic jam? There is a tram lane for the trams to go through in most of the area. No cars can drive on it. So, there is private path for the tram only.I would like to give a reminder to the tall people. The room height is about 170cm. So, you'd better get a sit, otherwise you have to enjoy the journey with you head down.If you want to enjoy a slow life and see the HK living style and buildings from old to modern then back to old style, I advise you to take the tram. Get on the tram at Shaukeiwan (the eastern terminal) and get the tram to Kennedy Town (the western station). It costs you $2.30 and you can have over an hour trip."

We picked a rainy day, and it was a good activity. For only $2.30 HKD per person, you can go from one end of the line to the other, enjoying the views along the way. However, we did it during the late afternoon, and since the tram takes the city streets, it was very slow going. We finally got off somewhere about halfway down the line and took the MRT back to Central. That said, it's a nice experience and definitely does feel like \"Old Hong Kong,\" and it's interesting to get to view all the neighborhoods along the way. Best during non-peak hours!"

            "review": "See the Island a slow motion. The tram runs along the old seashore line, which is now extended at least a few blocks out as a result of land claims in the pass many many decades, of the Hong Kong Island. A lot of local people call it \"Ding Ding\". You can ask the beautiful ladies on the street where to get \"Ding Ding\" somehow if you couldn't spot the stop yourself. It costs HK$2.3 (~US$0.3) per trip and you pay, by either coins or Octopus the local e-money, when you get off the tram and thus don't look for the fee box when you get on.At the Tram stops, first look for a map explaining which stop you are at, and which line you should take. There is no difference that you get on a eastbound one or a westbound one, as long as it goes through the areas including Central, Wan Chai, Causeway Bay (I am counting eastbound); you just don't want to get on the one passed the key areas or with next stop being the terminal. However, if you want to see a more quite and older fashion of Hong Kong, take a westbound trip all the way to the terminate so to see the area generally call Sai Wan. For conservative ones, you won't get lost on this double deck vehicle as it only travels in the city and one should be able to find an MTR (local subway) station without difficulties at almost any Tram stop. Go to upper deck and enjoy the slow movement accompanied by the \"Ding Ding\" sound. All trams, but one as of today, are not air-conditioned. So, the street, the air, the building, everything is more accessible to passengers onboard a Tram. Don't just look at how close these trams can stack with each other, but also drop your eyes or cameras on the busy streets, appreciate the shops and people on the road, find the colourful lighted ad flashing right beside you, etc in such a packed city. You will find that you just had a most worthy US$0.3 ride ever when you get off the tram. It is a super experience for individuals, couples, family with teens or younger ones."

You simply get on and find a fun seat on top (if you'd like) and enjoy people watching, seeing the buildings, hearing the buzz of the city, and just taking a 'load off' from all the walking you have probably been doing. It is not the best way to go from one place to another though as it does move slower than busses, MTR (subway) or taxis but it is fun to do at least once. They are all open-air but they have just put one with air-conditioning in service and may create more soon but again, there is only one for now. If you are here while it is hot out, It may be nicer to enjoy near the end of the afternoon as the shops around the island turn on their street-lit-signs and you can enjoy sitting longer as it could be more comfortable with the cooler temps. Please Note: Unlike with the busses or MTR, you pay as you get off (not sure why they do this) and it is helpful to have an Octopus card to do so but you can also pay with exact change (currently $2.30 HKD)."

They are a big part of Hong Kong history and a worthwhile experience whilst visiting. Although a lot of tourists ride them, they are there for a purpose, and that is to provide cheap public transportation for the residents and workers on the island. With that in mind, they can be quite full at times. They are not overly spacious and the seats are timber and are comfortable enough whilst getting off your feet for a while. It might take a little while before you can get a seat during busy periods, but most people only travel a few stops and are happy to stand to let others sit. All the tram stops have identification boards as well as on top of them, so identification is easy. We did a bit of research before traveling and checked out a few journey's on utube, so we could familiarize ourselves with the area we were visiting. Costs is extremely cheap. We used or Octopus cards for payment. We entered the station. Enter the tram at the rear door and exit out the front door. Scan your Octopus card as you exit. The fare is the same regardless of how long your journey is. If you are unsure of where to get off, like anywhere in Hong Kong, just stand there with a map open and somebody will come up to you to help you out."

It has no air-conditioning but you may enjoy the natural breeze and hear the buzz of locals' everyday life. The upper deck would have better view. As a local, I still enjoy every single journey.

Don't miss the opportunity to ride the full route from Kennedy Town to Shau Kei Wan. The cost is practically nil, your tired feet will thank you, and you can enjoy a dazzling 30-40 minute visual treat. The tram not the quickest way to get around, and that's the point. Some scenery is not meant to be seen from a speeding vehicle. If you spot something intriguing from the tram, you can spontaneously hop off at one of its many frequently-spaced stops.The tramway is Hong Kong's first mode of public transport and still uses the same route as when the service started in 1903, when the city was just a sleepy colonial outpost. It's hard for me not to get a bit nostalgic on the noisy and bumpy tram and ponder what Hong Kongers back then would think if they could see their city today."

You can always take the other ways around too. Lowest cost to sit on the upper deck in the evening to watch all the night lights and activities on the street. OK, it does not move fast, this will allow you to see what's going on the street. I loved the rides."

It's $2.30 HKD and you pay at the front when you get off. Be sure to have enough change in coins for your ride because you get no change back. Or you could get an octopus card and never have to worry about it. The tram line goes from the East end of Hong Kong Island all the way to the West end and vice versa. This covers all the notable stops including Central, Causeway Bay, North Point, Wan Chai, Happy Valley. There are many trams running at once, amounting to a wait of less than 3 minutes during off peak times and one almost every minute during peak times. It is certainly the cheapest way to get around Hong Kong Island and effective too.Try to avoid travelling during peak times if at all possible. The trams are crowded and you can get quite hot in the May heat.Pro tip: link up with the star ferry at Wan Chai or Central to cross back over to Tsim Sha Tsui for only $2.50 hkd (or $3.40 on weekends/public holidays). This makes for a very cheap day's outing with transport costs. In a city where the costs are quite high, it pays to save when you can. Plus the trip on the ferry is a must do for your time in HK."

Thirdfrom Shout ki wan to the Central. Fourth runs to the depots from anywhere. Youget on the tram from the middle of the street, it's kind of narrow especially the stairs to second floor but it is dirt cheap and you are at eye level or slightly above but only few feet from everybody...it runs slowly and noisily but you get to see the whole stretch of the island from very west to very east for peanuts. Oh you pay only when you get off the tram, just put two HK dollars (about 25 US cents) in the coin box for one ride. Every ride from one terminal to the last runs about 45 minutes depends on the traffic. It's the most interesting and cheapest way to watch how Hong Kong moves!"

I recommend you to do that as late as possible, because when there is no traffic around, it can go quite fast! It goes pass all the interesting places on Hong Kong Island, you actually see all the major architectures historical or modern."

Advertising is plastered all over the trams. The newer trams still retain the tram aura on narrow gauge tracks. Seating is along each side and ends of the tram, on 2 levels. Standing is between the rows of seats. A grab-rail is mounted on the ceiling for better stability for those standing. It can be very crowded inside. It's a true experience of what's it like to be a sardine. The trick is if you know where you need to alight, is to squeeze your way to the front (exit is in the front by the driver) by the time you reach your tram stop. Otherwise you may miss it. However that's one of the cheapest, most memorable and unique ways to see Hong Kong."

My Hong Kong associate convinced to get on this old and woody looking tram after we finished a meeting with one of my client on a sunny afternoon. I often drive to work back in Toronto, Canada and avoid taking the street car (electric tram with one deck only) because it always stuck in the traffic. But in Hong Kong, the tram has its only lane so it never get stuck in traffic. That is a very good thing to attract more passengers. The sad thing is, it travelled very slow just a bit faster than running steady. It would be nice if it had air-conditioning because it was certainly hot inside the tram. I was told it was cheapest ground transportation in Hong Kong. It did give me a taste of the past."

Very easy to get around and you are never far from it. As a new arrival to HK, I found it a great way to get oriented.

These little \"Ding Ding\" trams, whilst not as fast as a bus or MTR service, they are fantastic if you want to see the sites of Hong Kong while you are getting to your destination. Its a bit like a hop-on, hop-off situation as they run almost every 5 minutes in either direction, so if you see a shop, restaurant or point of interest, you just hop-off and hop back on again later. The fares are very cheap, HK$2.5 for adults or HK$1.1 for seniors, (over 65), on current exch rate this is about AU$0.45 or AU$0.20 for a senior. Most off the time the tram operators take a HK$2 or HK$1 coin so its very easy to use this service.Its certainly worth a trip upstairs in a Ding Ding, just make sure that the windows are closed when it rains??The routes that they follow are quite long so you can go from one end of the CBD area at Kennedy Town, thru Central, to Causeway Bay and Happy Valley and return, all for HK$2 or HK$1. If you are in Hong Kong for Four (4) days I would suggest that you buy a Four (4) Day Pass which costs HK$34, (approx AU$6.50) and allows unlimited rides, hopping & on & off as much as you like with this ticket.I would throughly recommend this tram service for getting in and around the main parts of Hong Kong Island. Of course if you want to go to Kowloon or the New Territories, Stanley etc., then the bus or MTR are the options. All in all the \"dings Dings are a fantastic experience"

Make your way upstairs for a good view of people scurrying along the streets going about their daily routines, take in the aromas of dried fish and seafood as you pass through Sheung Wan where dozens of dried seafood shops line the street and see what is being sold in other shops that seem to offer endless assortments of plastic goods and stuffed toys. Your journey will finish at the junction of Catchick and Davis Streets. As you alight, pay your HK$2.30 fare. There are lots of restaurants around - our recent choice for an excellent lunch was an old favourite, Bistro du Vin, every time a winner! Set lunches are excellent value, US$15 for two courses at time of writing, the evening menu is fine dining, there's a great wine selection - a favourite with the growing number of French expats who live nearby. Take a look at the nearby harbour front and return by taxi (there is a rank across the road from Bistro du Vin) or look for signs to Kennedy Town MTR station. Or take the tram!"

Unlike the vehicles running on petrol, the tram running on electric rails are far slower & pick up stops every 2 blocks.Since the speed of travel is much slower, you are able to observe things in the street and notice different characteristics of each area. You have time to study an interaction of people in the sidewalk and see details you would otherwise miss in a bus.I appreciated my tram ride because it was a nice tour around the streets without being rushed."

The tram fare is fixed at just over HK$2 for all rides.One can travel from Saukiwan (east) to Saiyingpun (west) , and be able to view most of the north side of the island.

We glad we choose the latter, Depending on the tram, we rode from Central to Kennedy town one way and there were hardly anyone so we sat on the top at the front seat and had a great view. On the way back however, the whole tram was so packed with what seem to be a tour group plus the local people.Cost $23 Hong Kong Dollars for one way ride and just drop the coins, notes into the box on the way out. There is no fuss if you pay more or less.If you plan to use the tram, have a map printed out so you can plan your trip better as there are no tram way maps that I could find on the trams or at the stops."

Warning - no change is given if you don't have the exact fare. Visitors will probably just use coins; locals tend to use the MRT public transport 'Oyster' payment system.Best to head for the upper deck, which gives good views and photo-taking opportunities. The trams can get very busy, standing-room-only busy, at commuter times. If all you want is to travel through the main part of Hong Kong Island, you can almost ignore the destination board of individual trams, as they all go along that route. If you intend to travel further afield, take more care in selecting the appropriate tram. Since many tourists are inclined to draw the windows down on the upper deck, to take photographs, that area can get somewhat cold, depending upon the weather, and can also get damp in the rain. If you aren't seeking views or intent on capturing images, you may wish to sit downstairs. Travelling on a tram is an almost must-do if visiting Hong Kong."

Big tipper!The tracks are in the middle of Central, easy to find, just walk towards the harbour and you'll find the track. Follow the overhead cable until you find a station, they are quite close together in Central.My tip is to take the Kennedy Town route first. That goes slowly through some amazing suburbs and ends near the wharf, Kennedy Town.Coming back, take either Happy Valley or North Point and you'll go through a completely different set of suburban activity. Wan Chai is a teaming, high rise jungle with plenty of street side shops as well as huge malls. Get on and off the tram regularly ... it's only $2.30, remember.The low down; seats are hard, the ride is rough and if it rains the roof will leak in places. It is slow ... and that's the beauty of it. Take the upper deck and you'll have fantastic views throughout.Unless you have GPS you will not know what station you have stopped at.

My first ride was from Kennedy Town to Central. Great way to slow down and just take in in the sights. Make sure to get the seats on the second level and preferably the one in front.The travel is very slow but very cheap. The line travels from West to East with Kennedy town the last station in the West. Cannot remember the name of the last stop though in the East.Make sure to have 2.30 HKG and to put your money near the device near the driver before you go down. There is no change though."

No real views or interesting landmarks, at least in the few miles we travelled. Beware also the racecourse loop when travelling west. The trams go on a southerly diversion and not all go straight through; some stop half way round and you have to change - and pay again - to complete your journey. Also, the tram route is a bit of a yomp if you come like we did from Kowloon. From the central ferry terminal is quite a hike on long overhead walkways to reach the tram road and the places to descend to ground floor level are not well marked and often you have to go into a shopping mall to get down."

In peak hours this multi level tram will require you to stand in most skimpy place as foreigners or westerners double or triple the bulk size of Hong Kong residents. This is a very cheap way of transport versus the Mtr but the crowd is not really for Expats or tourist. Beware of pickpockets and occasional elbow from locals. The train and the road is not exactly the cleanest or the sanitize mode of travel but if in Hong Kongs Central or Wanchai or Causeway the tram will beat walking in the streets."

The fare is affordable (less than 3 HKD); have the exact fare as no change will be given or use the Octopus card which is the HK transport card that you refill as you need. Avoid the pick hours when locals and the working crowd use it a lot. If you are a 1st time user go upstairs and enjoy the street sights. The tram is not air conditioned but the windows are always opened to have some air flow. This is a great way to experience HK local life."

If you are visiting Hong Kong for the first time and want a cheap way to see what it's about, a trip along the northern side of Hong Kong Island is a great tourist treat. The trams are not mean for tourists - they are normal economy transport for HK residents - but they give a good glimpse of life in the bustling urban area from a safe distance. Trams run from Kennedy Town in the west to Shaukeiwan in the east, and the full journey takes about an hour and a half, but not all trams go all the way - the destination is on the front. Tip - avoid rush hours, as the trams can be extremely full. If you time your journey for mid-morning or early afternoon, you have a good chance of getting empty front seas upstairs. If the tram is full, simply wait for the next one - they are very frequent. The fare is a mere $2.30 (about US30c) which you put in a slot on exit, or use the very useful octopus card, which is well worth purchasing, as it is very convenient for other forms of transport and even buying goods in supermarkets or convenience stores. Shaukeiwan at the end of the line has an interesting market and is good for seeing the non-tourist side of Hong Kong."

Every 2 or 3 years, I would make a special trip visiting HK and I ALWAYS went on a tram ride from one end of the island to the other end. All in all, the journey would take between 2 to 3 hours depending what time of the day one travels.The tram travelled through different parts of HK, the Central, business centre, The Causeway Bay, the entertainment and food centre. The west end of the island, one could see the stalls for dried sea products and sometime, one could smell it too. The other end of HK was mainly residential flats or apartments. Of course, there are shops every where. Every time I took a tram ride, there was always something different. It reminded me of my happy childhood growing up in the British colony.One cannot visit HK without sampling its different cuisines. I dare say that HK can offer international dishes if one knows where to look. Due to land/space at the premium, a lot of restaurants were located upstairs and they are always full!As many contributors have already said, get on the tram from the rear and go upstairs. Grab a window seat on one side. What one misses the other side, one can see it on the return journey! Just enjoy the scenery."

You can do it in about 3 hours, if you are already on the island or in Kowloon... This starts on the island and finishes on Kowloon side but can reverse the order and do it just as easily... Start anywhere along the cross island tram route - take the tram toward Central - it's a fun ride - you pay $2.30 when you get OFF. You'll be on Des Veux Road - hop off around Jubilee Street / Central Market. Walk through Central Market toward Queens Road - you'll come to the foot of the Mid Level Escalators. Ride it up the mountain! When you come down - on foot - you'll be headed toward the harbor. It's about a kilometer from the base of the escalator to the Star Ferry Terminal. At the terminus of the escalators turn right on Queens Road and go down a few blocks to Pedder - take a left, join the network of sky bridges, go toward the harbor and the Star Ferry Terminal. Ride the Star Ferry to Kowloon - you can then either grab a taxi or walk the few blocks to the East Tsim Sha Tsui MTR station and head back to where you started. Three great rides in a short time!"

The stations are close together so don't require long walks and of course the track limits the tram to go anywhere other than up and down, but through the most popular areas.

There are a few things you should know before using a Ding Ding. Make sure you know where you want to go (not in detail but at least the area) because when you re sitting in one of the Ding Dings no one is gonna tell you at wich station you re at or where you generally are. So either know what you should be looking for eg a big building or a special tourist feature what ever. You could also just count the stations where you stop at.You always go in from the back door and go out from the front door where the driver sits. You are going to pay at the end and you are supposed to have either an octopucs card or in cash exactly 2.30 HKD because you re going to put it into a box and you re not gonna get a change. No matter where you exit you always pay 2,30 HKD.You can not use the Ding Ding to get from HK island to mainland but you can have a wonderful long ride to get from west to east or visa versa. I think there have been 6 different paths all marked by colour. The longest ride is around 90 minutes. As for me when I went on I just chose a Bing Bing wich went to the east because my hotel was located at the west. I had a 40 minutes ride wich was absolutely awesome. I did not believe it myself how much I liked the drive. No crowds, no waiting its totally inexpensive and you get a nice tour through the main part of HK island. I had no destination I decided I will just get off where it looks interesting and thats what I did and it was so much fun.So yes try it out if you re in HK its interesting and worth it."

Trams are probably quite incongruous in a high-speed city like Hong Kong, but along the north shore of the Island, it's a surprisingly good way to travel: not like the MTR underground there's no need to climb flights of stairs, and to figure out where you pop out of the warren, the tram stops are often in the middle of the road next to a pedestrian crossing. Sure it's slow, and at times packed like sardine cans, but you can get to all the good spots on the north shore. Just be careful to jump on the correct one for your destination as there are a couple of detour loops which might not go as far as you wish."

The standard card simply provides a convenient way to pay. At the end of your stay the balance on your card, including the deposit, is refundable less a $9 admin. fee. Well worthwhile. On some services you swipe when you get on, eg bus, some when you get off, eg tram and some on and off, eg MTR except Airport Express when you swipe off.

I am from a city with an extensive tram network so am very comfortable with these slightly outmoded forms of clattering transportation but the Hong Kong trams are something special. Firstly, they have retained their design essentially from the very old ones still in service through to the not-quite-flash new ones. Very narrow and double decker they hurtle along adorned in their often garish advertising carrying happy commuters from here to there. Here you get on at the back and off at the front. Sit upstairs if you can although it does not really matter and don't forget to tap your Octopus card to pay.It's all fun and very handy and you will see some great streetscapes on the way. Perfect!"

Also, download the pdf of the tram routes(east & west) to your phone. The older trams do not announce the next stop and don't have any indication of the upcoming stop. I would suggest that since they come so often wait for a newer tram so you don't miss your stop. The trams say on the front and back where they are going. I got on the Western Market tram because it was going in the correct direction but it makes a u-turn at the market and starts in the other direction. So look at the routes you downloaded because there are a few weird ones. Also, the east and west have different stops sometimes. You get on at the back and don't pay anything till you get off. You are supposed to migrate to the front of the tram as your stop approaches so you are ready to tap your octopus card on scanner as you get off. Your balance will be displayed as you do. It's one price per ride regardless of how many stops you stay on for. It's only $2.30HKD (30 US cents). I rode it for over an hour one day after I arrived to sight see and I recognized a lot of places I researched and wanted to go."

We decided to just go for a ride on the tramway and all we did was decided that we would catch a tram going to Happy Valley and get off when it looked interesting. We waited to a tram came along which did not look to crowded and we got on and went up stairs and sat down. It was fascinating how narrow the trams are. We saw some great sights on the 20 minute tram ride. As we were going along we saw some markets down a side street so we got off to have a look. It was the Bowrington Street Markets and they were so fascinating and we spent over an hour just walking around with the ordinary people of Hong Kong looking at the peoples markets. There was nearly everything that you would want in this market which ran for probably four streets. Better than the Central Markets. Getting back was the same process waited til a tram came along that we thought we could get on and get a seat upstairs. By the time we went to get off in Central Hong Kong the tram was crowded and it took a bit of effort to get off and down the stairs. It was well worth the ride on the tram. Last time in Hong Kong I was lucky enough to have a ride on an open top one. Did not see them this time. Make sure you have your Octopus Pass as it makes transport so easy."

One of our best rides started from Happy Valley Terminal to Sheung Wan. Select the tram you wish to take (one goes West, and another goes East), then board at the rear and exit with your Octopus card at the front of the tram. As we boarded at the terminal, we could pick our seats on the upper deck (front seats are the best). I'm not sure if it's just our luck, but we found the tram operators one of the most sullen people I've met in Hong Kong. (Most folks we meet elsewhere were friendly, or at least, professional in handling enquiries.) But try asking the tram operator for assurance that the tram you have boarded is headed to your destination, and you will be greeted with a glare. No answers given."

Sit on the upper deck in the front few rows of the tram if you can for better views. Costs HK$2.30 per ride and you can use your Octopus card. Board from the back & pay/tap your Octopus card only when you alight in the front near the driver. It's natural fresh air with windows down inside the tram (no air-con). We boarded at the tram stop facing Sogo at Causeway Bay. Took Tram number 7 heading to 'Shek Tong Tsui'. We wanted to go to Central to take the Mid-Levels Escalator. Not too sure which tram we could take so we asked the locals at the tram stop. It was quite a slow ride but we were not in any hurry and happily took in the sights at the upper deck of the Tram. The Ding Ding #7 passed by Causeway Bay, Wan Chai (Wan Chai market), Admiralty and alighted at Central to head to the mid-levels escalator and then to Lan Kwai Fong. It's a fun & inexpensive way to see Hong Kong. Go try it! Note : Take the MTR if you're in a hurry. The tram's speed can be too slow if you're rushing somewhere."

Prior to hopping onto a Ding Ding, we would ask the driver if it would take us to our destination. They were all helpful and we had no problems at all using the Ding Dings.It's also a way to sight see as the trams move on the roads slowly. Best to get front seats upstairs. Do be careful when you are coming down. The trams may jerk rather strongly, usually when they are stopping.You enter from the back, and alight from the front where the driver is and pay at that point."

You get to intermingle with the local people, and enjoy the scenic view along the route of the tram. Upper deck has better view if there are seats available. My family and I went to the main station in North Point to start our sightseeing ride. The reason we picked the main station at North Point was that there were plenty of seats available. By the way, the name Ding Ding is derived from the sound of the bell the tram driver uses to warn pedestrian crossing the tram rail."

If you can manage to get the front seats upstairs you can see all of the life of this amazing City as the trams trundle along the main road from one end of the island to the other. The are also unbelievably cheap, about 20p ( in English money!) per journey, however far you travel. For short journeys they are a lot more convenient than the MTR. By the time you have gone down to the platforms and back up again along numerous tunnels and escalators, you can be on a tram and at your destination. They are very well used by locals and tourists alike. A must do in Hong Kong."

Just watching these trams go by in the morning, pushing through the throngs of rush hour traffic, is an experience taking you back to 1950s Hong Kong. So important is the use of the tram, and its appearance every day, that Hong Kong people don't call Queen's Road Central or Queen's Road East by those names. They will often call the street, The Tram Street. It seems they have been there that long, and should always be.Lately, though, their existence is in doubt, as a developer and some contractors have recently floated the idea of eliminating them altogether to make traffic and pedestrian egress and ingress easier. It's a crock. Somebody wants to build more buildings, straighten out roads, and take over property. The Trams are special. They move along with an electronic murmur and in your lazier tranquil moments during the hectic Hong Kong day, you can listen to them and take in all the sights by sitting on the top, for just a few pennies! And transport yourself back to a time when \"coolies\" walked around pulling rickshaws, and British businessmen smoked Chesterfields on the street corner as they read the Standard."

Their is a popular opinion voiced on here and various other travel sites, suggesting that the dng ding tram which operates along the North side of Hong Kong is something is not to missed.In the course of my long life I have endured the sheer misery of sitting on London M25 motorway during Friday eveningrush hour. I have sat quietly fuming in the back of a New York taxi attempting to get from JFK to my hotel on the upper West Side. I have even attempted to pilot a rental car through Romes tortuous streets, made all the more tortuous by the sdriving style of crazy Romans. However, if any country has devised a more uncomfortable way of getting from place A to place B, than the ding ding tram., I have yet to expoerience it. This item of vehicular torture belongs in a Chamber of Horrors.Actually getting on the tram can be a problem. The bording stations are not on the side of the road. They happen to be in the middle of the road, so you may have to cross a couple of lanes of fraffic just to get to board the thingFirst on the list of miseries is that when you get on to the blooming thing, if you are a male you are likely to be whacked in a rather tender place by a turnstile. Quite why the turnstile is there in the first place is a bit odd - so far as i can see all it is there for is to prevent a passenger trying to leave by the rean entrance thereby avoiding the HK$2.30 fare. If that is the case it realkly would be easy for the evader to vault the barrier anyway.So having been dealt a painful blow in the male bits you stagger to a seat, only to find that some elderly chinese lady has deposited her various bags there. She gives you this kind of glare that only a 4ft 5 in seniorChinese woman can give, leaving you with an almighty sense of relief that she does not hold a public executionesr licence (hopefully) So having eventually taken your seat you then discover that the pre-stressed concrete blocks that proviide the support for the Hoover Dam have more give in them than the seat.You may dacided to go for a scenic seat so head on to the upper level. The steps up to the upper level are incredibly steep and the stairway itself is incredibly narrow. So whilst getting up the stairs may provide a challenge, getting down them can be a nightmare.The ride itself is so hard. The tram runs on metal wheels on metal tracks on tarmac roads. So far as suspension is concerned it just does not exist. Every bump in the tracks is tranmitted via the wheels, exacerbated by the seat and eventually arrives in you via your rear end ! One of things that some people seem to think of as being a major plus point is the fact that trams have open windows - great if you enjoy breating in the noxious petrol and diesel fumesSo, sorry to put a downer on anybody who is looking forwrd to riding the ding-ding. If you do so, dont expect any comfort and wear padded pants. Personally I prefer the buses any time - now if I only could purchase a pocket size Solent, whose knowledge of HK busses seems encyclopedic I would be all set!"

You get onto the tram at the rear and exit at the front. Payment, by Octopus or coins (no change given) is on exit. A suggested itinerary would be to travel by tram to Happy Valley (only trams displaying 'Happy Valley' at the front actually go there) and alight at the tram station. Then you could walk back on yourself a little way and up the hill (3 mins walk) to the Tam Kung Temple on Blue Pool Road. From there, you could cut across Happy Valley to Shan Kwong Road and visit the Jewish Cemetary. The gated entrance is between a brightly coloured Buddhist school and a Buddhist monastery. After that, head down the hill, bearing left to Wong Ngai Chung Road. Just past the pink Hindu temple you will find the Parsee Cemetary, which also contains a local plant nursery. Beyond that is the Hong Kong cemetary, followed by the Catholic Cemetary and finally, the Muslim cemetary. Reading the inscriptions on the various headstones, provides a fascinating glimpse of Hong Kong's history. There is a tram stop outside the colonial or HK cemetary (you will need to wave to the tram driver to make sure he sees you and stops) and also in front of the Muslim Cemetary / Cosmopolitan Hotel. Trams from these two stops may go either towards the West and Kennedy Town or towards the East and Shau Kei Wan."

Dating from the 1900s, the tram is one of the cheapest and environmentally friendly ways to travel along the north coast of Hong Kong Island. The double decker trams are now unique (other British colonies in Asia did away with them) and the current fleet of 150 or so date from the 1950s. Interiors are basic: for airconditioning, slide down the window and firm wooden seats, but what do you expect for HK$2.30, a flat fare however short or long the distance you travel? There is essentially one track that runs from Kennedy Town in the West to Shau Kei Wan in the East, passing through Central, Wan Chai and Causeway Bay, so it's almost impossible to get lost. There is loop that runs from Causeway Bay around the Jockey Club horse racing track in Happy Valley and back again: worth the detour along leafy Wong Nai Chung Road and the views across to the Jockey Club grandstands on the west side. (Don't miss the chance to enjoy it while you can: there are some in Hong Kong who think the tram has no place in the city and want the system closed down and the lines removed.)Tips: You must have the EXACT change (HK$2.30 in coins) or a stored value Octopus card. Get on at the BACK, only pay when you get off at the FRONT. Top deck is best for views, breeze and less traffic fumes. It gets crowded at peak hours and pushing and shoving is part of the deal, so chill out and go with the flow. Keep valuables secure - Hong Kong is one of the world's safest cities but why take a chance. In summer it does get very hot and humid, so those of a sensitive nature should carry a scented hanky for that close-up sweaty experience on board."

We buy an Octopus travel card for use whilst in Hong Kong which is valid on all forms of transport including the Peak tram (the peak tram charges 28HK$ for a one way ride for an adult and 11HK$ for a senior over 65). The local trams charge a flat rate fare of 2.30 HK$ for adults, 1.20HK$ for children and 1.10 HK$ for seniors (aged over 65 - take along proof of age when buying the senior card and keep it with you when you travel in case you are asked to produce it). You can buy the Octopus card in MTR stations at the customer service desk. They charge 50HK$ deposit for the card and you add money to cover the cost of your trips. We put 100HK$ on adult cards and only 20HK$ on senior cards as typical fares for seniors are 1-2 $ per ride (even when the standard adult fare on the bus or train was almost 12HK$). When you are ready to go home, surrender the card and get a refund of the residual top up value as well as 41 HK$ of the card deposit. A ride on the tram is a great way to see something of Hong Kong life on a rainy day. We got on the tram in Central and went all the way to the terminus- a journey of 80 minutes and all for the regular flat rate fare! A real bargain way to travel and lots of fun!"

The most confusing problem with the trams is that some go the entire line distance, and others only go one segment of the tram route. The tram can be a great way to see the Hong Kong Island from Kennedy Town to the Happy Valley Raceway -- but make sure you take a tram that goes to these ending destinations, or you'll find yourself having to get off and on different trams along the way. Check the front of the tram, as they post the final destination. Go on the upstairs of the tram for a great view -- they are not known for speed, but do provide an alternative to the subway. There is something charming about them. The \"long run\" on the tram gives you great view of the different neighborhoods of Hong Kong Island's urban core. They have discounts for senior citizens --"

As a newbie to HK, I found the tramway made for a great little excursion, alongside the locals, who make good use of the service. You can ride as far as you like east to west or vice versa and to all points in between for HKD 2.30: use the city's excellent Octopus card (purchased from MTR stations, you can load it with cash at MTR stations, 7-eleven stores, Circle K stores and other outlets. It's valid for buses, trams, the Metro and ferries and makes life a lot easier). Tram stations are in the middle of the street. Enter from the back of the tram and exit front, paying on exit. Sit back and enjoy the ride, taken at a slower pace so that you can soak up the street life all around you. I headed up top (these are two-tier trams with windows open to the fresh air and I would enjoy edging my way to the front and when one was free, bagging a front seat for a great view). The tramway has an interactive map (https://www.hktramways.com/en/interactive-map/) on its web site so that you can scout out attractions such as Hong Kong Park, the Peak Tram and various districts such as Central, Wan Chai, Happy Valley and the Mid-Levels, where you can ride the escalators to Hong Kong's trendier parts. All the stops are numbered for both routes East and West so it's easy to plan a trip. I got the tram from the Quarry Bay area and travelled West towards Admiralty, alighted at 64W, took the escalator from Pacific Plaza next to the stop, alighted at Hong Kong Park, spent time with the exotic plants and birds in the walk-through aviary and conservatory, ambled over to the Peak Tram terminus and caught a vertiginous ride to the top of Victoria Peak with panoramic view across Victoria Harbour. Travelling by tram might not always be so convenient or as quick as the excellent metro (which runs both on Hong Kong Island and on the Kowloon side), but it makes for a quaint, relaxing way to explore. You can also become a bit of a spotter, as I did, and look out for the historic number 120 (all the trams are numbered and come in a variety of cheerful colours and almost artful advertising), the oldest tram on the network. Get on board and have fun. Ding! Ding!"

We took the tram from Wanchai to Kennedy town and to North Point. The rides were very slow with many stops allowing us to literally soak up the atmosphere of this very busy island of Hong Kong. Only thing it didn't have was airconditioning. From the upper deck we had full view all the way. We saw modern shopping malls to financial office buildings to shops selling dried goods, markets and residential buildings. On another day, we rode the tram again and this time to Happy Valley to dine at a one Michelin star restaurant Pang's Kitchen. Apparently the MTR doesn't come this way so riding the tram was the cheapest and most scenic form of transportation here. Each trip cost only HK$2.30. Payment can also be made using the Octopus Card. You can download the maps of the various routes onto your mobile phone to plan your tram sight seeing trips."

To cut the long story short, I had already completed the entire stretch from Kennedy to the other end without knowing it! I was highly disoriented at that time, expecting the distance from one district to the other to be longer. I didn't notice when th tram turned back and found myself staring at the buildings of central the second time around. Thus, I got off at Wan Chai laughing at my faux pas."

Only that it travels from quiet residential area to the busiest shopping area in the island and then cut through the heart of a crowded business area (while all traffic are jammed but your tram is the only transportation that moves without being affected on the ground). It's also good for tourist to hop on and off between locations like Tin Hau (Victoria Park) and Causeway Bay (Sogo Department Store) or Causeway Bay to Wanchai (Computer center / Convention Center)However, you have to be smart to avoid some peak hours where you could find yourself like a tin fish in the tram. Avoid weekday 7-8am, 12- 2pm, 5- 7pm, where people get to work, lunch and back home. Avoid Sunday from morning till evening coz most of the domestic helpers in HK will pack each tram and travel from Tin Hau to Central where they meet their friends. Go to the top deck as it usually has more space and as a tourist, you get to see more. Another tip is choosing the right route. If you head west from North Poing / Causeway Bay and want to go to Central district. You can hop on to any of the trams but not Happy Valley. If you want to go to Sheung Wan's Dried Sea Food Street, you should only hop on any trams but not Happy Valley & Western Market. In any chance, you can have a look of their website. (not suggest to buy the 4 day ticket unless you know you travel at least 20 times in 4 days.)Enjoy~~!"

And of course taxi is more direct to where you want.Whether it is first time visitor or repeat travelers Ding Ding Tram is actually my preferred method of transport on the Island side (not available in Kowloon, New Territories nor Lantau Island) not because it is the cheapest (currently @HK$2.30, accept Octopus also), but because of it's over 100 years history and most interesting way of seeing HK. A very unique perspective that MTR, taxis do not provide. Buses have similar heights but you cannot open the windows. As many times as I have used the tram I always enjoy the scenery above street levels, you get the feel from older neighborhoods on the western ends (Kennedy Town, Sai Ying Poon etc) as well as the eastern ends (Shau Kei Wan, North Point) and of course the business district of Central and the shopping areas of Wanchai and Causeway Bay. Here's an excellent link from their website:https://www.hktramways.com/There are different lines that have different end stations, many of them with overlapping routes.If you can, find a seat on the upper deck for better view. Though for most westerner beware of your heads if you are standing especially if you are over 6 feet tall. There are currently no Air Conditioning (though there are couple prototypes in the work) so summer or winter or heavy rainstorm can be a little harsh, but that adds to the fun (besides there are windows that one can slide up and down or tilt inward for venting). On a beautiful day when it is not hot, humid nor bone-chilling, with the windows opened and a slight breeze in your face, you just cant help but have a smile on your face.You really cannot get too lost on the tramway even if you overshoot or undershoot your station since they are separated by short distance in between most stops. Hong Kong people are mostly a friendly bunch and you can always ask for help if you get lost.Oh you enter through the back (turnstiles) and exit through the front (where the tram operator stands) and that's when you pay (Octopus or cash).A must try for Hong Kong visit."

At only 2.3HKD a ride, it is a lovely way to wind down on your way from work or to travel short distances as you tour the Island (I.E. from Central to Admiralty or North Point to Causeway Bay). The renovated trams are MUCH nicer and have individual seats and a much cleaner look. The older trams are more traditional albeit a bit drab. Definitely try out a ride on the tram and sit in the front of the second story. It's a great photo opportunity and view."

Great observation skills! heheThe popular Octopus card is used on these trams so you are never stuck for small change if you have your Octopus. Unlike the Sydney way of using their similar system of tapping on and tapping off, we only tap off our Octopus card upon getting off the tram. Get a seat upstairs and it's so much cooler for you because their is no air con on these trams plus you get a better view of the bustling life of Hong Kong!

Use your Octopus card to get on this inexpensive, slow pace transportation to go from one end of the island to the other end. Get the front seats on the upper deck. Check out the different districts you pass through and make a mental note to come back to those you want to visit again. Do not hesitate to ask the young people questions, they are more than happy to share their city with travellers. The Ding Ding is not for anyone who is in a hurry. If you have a few hours, this is one of the ways to see Hong Kong."

It costs just a matter of pennies to travel regardless of distance and you can pay either by coins or by oyster card as you exit the tram. I stayed on Hong Kong Island so these were my main mode of transport along the harbour front area. They rarely get held up by traffic so travel times are fairly consistent and with open windows they are a great way to see HK and its people. The display as you pay also shows the balance on your card so easy to keep track of your payments.I would recommend early purchase of an oyster card, I got mine at the airport. They are so cheap and you can use them for purchasing food drink as well as transport on the Ding Ding, MTR and ferries."

It is a great fun to take a ride with it, in Financial District, surrounded by the glasses of the skyscrapers and different stores and shops of myriad brands from all over the world. There are the vintage open- top tramcars, in which are held awesome parties, as birthday celebrating, wedding anniversaries, reunions or gatherings.

They fill up (and empty) fast, so we didn't have any issues boarding the ones we wanted. We were staying on Hennessy Road in Wan Chai so we were able to use the trams to go to Lan Kwai Fong, Causeway Bay, ifc mall and Star Ferry. They are all open air carriages so there is no relief from the heat. However the best thing is that you can SEE everything when you're on the tram, all the while skipping the sometimes horrific traffic. Stops are eastbound and westbound, with maps at every stop to determine where you need to go. Be cautious - sometimes the eastbound and westbound stops are on different sides of the road or spaced out without a crossing in between; do not try and cross against the lights or in traffic."

When the trams arrive you enter via the rear of the tram and can either sit downstairs or upstairs and when you depart the tram you pay on exiting which is at the front of the tram. I personally prefer to sit upstairs.

From there, the picturesque scenes of HK unfold before you. The skyscrapers and luxury stores in Central, the busy streets of Wan Chai, the shoppers paradise of Causeway Bay, and the local flavour of North Point's market. There are side spur lines to Happy Valley racecourse and points further east, but those parts get less photogenic, so I suggest only riding up to North Point.It's super cheap and you'll get a great feel of the city from above-ground, one of the few things that the MTR cannot provide."

There were a few spare seats - 24 on the upper deck plus more downstairs - at all times on my trip.Tourist Octopus cards are not accepted. This could be remedied by talks with MTR and would save tourists looking for small coins.The trams may be an 'archaic British colonial relic to some', but despite their very slow speed (although at peak hours faster than noisy diesel buses whose routes partly parallel the trams) and swaying motion especially over crossovers and points, these Hong Kong trams are a great public transport resource and heavily used by locals and tourists alike.The route frequencies are very good. There are many short workings such as to or from North Point or Whitty Street Depot. The Happy Valley branch is not quite as busy as the main route.Staff cannot mostly communicate with English speakers.The stops are pretty regularly spaced. The trams are unsuitable for those in wheelchairs. The stairs to the upper deck are steep, but the views from it are excellent.Make it a part of your Hong Kong experience. The route passes a number of MTR railway (metro) stations such as North Point."

Trams have their own tracks on normal roads, so you will have the experience of getting around, whilst being surrounded by traffic etc! The tram moves so slowly that you will have the chance to relax and take pictures (without them being blurry), and even just to ponder and enjoy Hong Kong as a city itself! Keeping this in mind, don't take the tram if you are in a rush! The MTR will cut your travel time to your destination by at least half the time!"

            "review": "Trams - The main artery for a very special neighbourhood.. Trams are located along north side of Hong Kong Island. Cost is $HK2.30 for one stop or whole journey. Entrance is at back of tram and exit at front along with payment .Use of Octopus card is most convenient way for paying for all transport and everything else in Hong Kong. They are not the fastest form of transport but like all surface forms of transport they share equal problems in busy times. In many sections pedestrians may walk faster. I prefer them to buses, taxis on the same routes in which they operate. Only when needing to make MTR links outside their domain do I find it more practical for time to keep with MTR alone. Trams are works of art and billboard advertising always tasteful and artistic. Most tram lines run eastbound or westbound. They, plus the harbour provide good reference points. At each stop one will find location name plus direction of tram whether eastbound or westbound.Trams deviate from the east-west direction when arriving at Happy Valley. Happy Valley is a north south loop out of Causeway Bay. Useful for going to Happy Valley Racecourse. When one considers shape of north shore HK Island the area of Happy Valley is widest area and whole region is shaped like an eye. Tapering at Kennedy Town and Quarry Bay. The tram exploits this fact.The tram to the east actually rises quite a bit for any tram to get over Quarry Bay area to end at Shau Kei Wan.Another interesting and important tramline is North Point which gives access to North Point Ferry to Kowloon City and Hung Hom. The North Point Tram is very interesting in that it is to my knowledge the only tram that passes along a market street and flanked either side by stalls. A market that tourists have very little knowledge, but which caters to the local community as do other street markets. I have a special liking for the North Point Tram and its market as I discovered it by accident when walking.Another very useful tram stop is around Queensway Plaza also serving the Admiralty MTR and Pacific Place. Why tourists continue to go to Peak by using Central astounds me. Using the tram stop or even Admiralty MTR stop is far more multipurpose than Central. Go to Queensway Plaza by tram. Take footbridge into Pacific Place and at 2 o\u2019clock you will find escalator that will take you into start of Hong Kong Gardens (Conservatory, Tea Museum, Feng Shui appeal and Aviary) and exit western end directly opposite Peak Tram $HK28 one way. Or return to Queensway Plaza and take Bus 15 to the Peak. Definitely and by all means come down from Peak on Bus 15 (front seat, top deck best for ride not surpassed even by Sae King Bus 92,96R) and go to Central and on to Star Ferry and evening in Kowloon. The water in the Park will not however be turned on before 10am on weekdays so check on that and plan to arrive HK Park around then to see water features flowing. Taking trams to ends of lines is both informative and examines all aspects of Hong Kong Island History and Sociology. The fact that HK Island tourist maps finish prematurely at Sheung Wan and Causeway Bay has always disappointed me but should not deter tourists from exploring the beyond to end of tram line. Many tourists go to ends of tram lines and walk back. Go to Shau Kei Wan and see gaps in shopping areas on way as tram rises over and down what is a continuation of the Peak Ridge Line coming down to the harbour. Forming a rise in tramline which I consider significant for line trams operating on the flat. The gaps in shopping areas are a novelty, like dead zones in what is otherwise an unbroken line of shops, lights and Malls punctuated by business, judicial district, sports and social amenities throughout north side Hong Kong Island. The high rise estates of Abbott Point I believe at one time once were part squatter areas, high density housing, where many relocated and boat people once lived. The new estates are themselves mind blowing and they became a characteristic prototype adopted in housing plans elsewhere in Hong Kong. In all aspects of Hong Kong infrastructure there is an incredible amount of research, skill, expense and out of box thinking to achieve goals. Sometimes in face of public opposition projects have a habit of encouraging other aspects of economic development that only Hong Kong can deliver. Invisible opportunities and ingenuity follow many projects. One such current like project is the Hong Kong_Macau_Zhuhai Bridge which attracts critics, is probably ahead of its time, but may grow to become appreciated with time.Trams are well supported and serve an admirable purpose. Hong Kong would be heartbroken without them. You can actually hire a tram and conduct a party on board as it tours Hong Kong. So look into it.Courtesy Wikipedia - HK trams have been around for over 100 years and are only ones in world to be double decked.6 Lines and 120 stops. Proposed in 1881 it took until 1901 to be accepted. First tramline coming into being from Kennedy Town to Causeway Bay in 1903 and later extended to Shau Kei Wan. Initially single decks were progressively changed with first introduction of a double decker in 1912.All single deckers were retired by 1941 with very little tram service during Japanese Occupation. Class distinction was prevalent on trams up until 1972 when one class and one flat fee was adopted.Courtesy Wikipedia - There are six major overlapping routes, Shau Kei Wan to Western Market,Shau Kei Wan to Happy Valley, Shau Kei Wan to Kennedy Town, North Point to Whitty Street, Happy Valley to Kennedy Town, Causeway Bay to Whitty Street and Western Market to Kennedy Town.It is important to understand the above route variations so as not to stop short or end up on way to Happy Valley \u2013 a initial common mistake. The North Point spurline through the market is however a well kept secret and tourists do not go there (said deliberately to motivate). The attached map does not show the digression (loop) due to scale. It is only 300m down the street. End of line loops are great places for innovative tram pictures. One can also wait for a tram to Kennedy forever at places along a short part of Hennessey Road in Causeway Bay for a couple of blocks where the Kennedy tram loops into Happy Valley. I talk from experience. So walking up to Tonnochy Road is necessary to reconnect westwards for Kennedy Town coming out of Happy Valley or take Whitty or Western Market and change en route.As I said get on trams at back and if going a long way do not go towards front of tram but hold back and wait for a seat to open up. Going forwards prematurely limits opportunities for getting a seat and you will get squished."

            "review": "A bit underwhelming. We did not find this to be as useful as many other reviewers did. It can be found by exiting the Admiralty MTR through exit C1 - the tram line is then right in front of you. The first problem is the destinations showing on the trams- many of them travel only along part of the end to end route so you will have to be aware of where you want to go before you get aboard. The next problem is that many of the trams do not have a commentary so unless you have a map, it will be difficult to know where you are which will then make it difficult for you to know when you have reached your destination if that is before the end of the route.If you get a tram with a commentary, you will be told the name of each approaching street. If you have a map, you can note exactly where you are and plan ahead. So a map is a must.The advantage is that you can get off at any stop and get back on at any stop. This will cost the full fare of $2.30HK every time you travel, but it is a cheap way to move around and explore."

There was a large queue to get on the tram and the it was absolutely ram packed when it arrived. We managed to squeeze on but the experience was not one I wanted to repeat as far too hot and humid to be squashed against the armpit of a stranger! Trying to get off was a nightmare - you get on at the back and have to push your way to the front to get off where you scan your Octopus card or pay cash. The tram was really slow due to the volume of traffic so it really would have been quicker to get the Mtr or to walk. My guess is that they keep the tram as it is nostalgic and tourists like it. It's good to get a photo of the tram but I would not be rushing to have another journey on one."

In the end myself, the guy immediate in front andf the girl behind decided to leave the queue and take a taxi up - it cost just under HK$50 which we split 3 ways. We got to the top in 15 minutes, no wait, saw the view and taxied back down again - so if it is more the view you want and not so much the ride in the tram - take a taxi and save maybe 90 minutes of your life!! - not to mention if you share the cab it's a lot cheaper than the tram anyway"

In fact, it is about the cheapest way to travel around on the northern part of Hong Kong Island, and if you are not in Hong Kong for business but for leisure, this is probably the best way to see the northern part of Hong Kong Island.Getting off at various stations along Des Voeux Road would bring you to within walking distance of all the usuall places of interest, such as Hollywood Road, Central, Admiralty, Wan Chai, Happy Valley, Causeway Bay, and for the lion hearted (those who are more adventurous), places less travelled where you can see the local way of life rather than how tourists burn holes in their pockets. LOL!I saved a lot of time and money travelling on the Ding Ding instead of taking the MTR. If you ask me, why time, since the MTR is reputed to be very fast, well, you know, the amount of walking you have to do inside Central or Hong Kong Stations, for example, and climbing in and out of the stations and all that, it's actually faster to just go to a Ding Ding station and continue your journey to your next destination."

The tram is only on HK Island and there is only one line from Shau Kei Wan to Kennedy Town, with one tram that does a small loop via Happy Valley. Very straight forward and there are stops every 100 or 200 meters. The driver will stop, no need to look for any bells.You pay the tram on the way out. It accepts coins, notes or octopus card (it will not give change back so be ready). Travel TIP: If you stay in HK for more than a day, get an octopus card. You can get them easily in any Subway (called MTR). It's just a card that you will charge with few hundred bucks and that you can use to pay in any shop and transports (except taxis). Very convenient and it avoid having too much change!Be careful, there is another tram (not the ding ding). This tram is from central to the peak. But it's a different tram so do not jump into the ding ding expecting to go to the Peak! The ding-ding is the most popular transport on HK island and so if you want to enjoy a bit of HK life, this is a must. Enjoy!"

The tram is fairly slow but would give you a good view of the streets of Hong Kong. The best vantage point would be the front seats on the upper deck. It takes over an hour to run from one end of the island to the other end, but its worth it. You will be able to see the different districts of Hong Kong with its different characters. However, in the summer it is quite hot. This is the reason why I am not giving it a 5-point."

            "review": "The tour that cuts through the heart of Hong Kong. The tramway on the Island has been around before the second world war and cuts through the heart of Hong Kong Island, taking you through some of the most iconic areas of Hong Kong.I suggest that you start in Central, maybe after having taken the Tsim Sha Tsui to Central ferry and explored central a little, and take the tram in the east direction towards Shau Kei Wan & Causeway Bay. The first area you will past through is Admiralty with its high rises and posh shopping mall that is Festival Walk, I would get off here and walk through the mall and take the lifts up to Hong Kong Park, its a very nice park with a world class aviary and a really awesome plant exhibit building. The mall itself is so so, with the usual posh brands and everything is on the expensive side. There are some good restaurants in this mall if you have the time.Get back on the tram and the next area is Wanchai, also worth getting off to explore its back streets from Lockhart Rd to Queen's Road East, there is lots of see and explore and the area still retains some of the old Wanchai of the past, with some colonial style buildings here and there.The next area you will past over is Causeway Bay, probably the 3rd mecca for shopping and food in Hong Kong. Trailing behind Mongkok and on par with Tsim Sha Shui in my opinion. I also love visiting Sham Shui Po if you are more interested in Knick Knacks. There a lot of see in Causeway Bay, but it shouldn't take too long as it isn't as big as you think it is.Next few stops on the tram include Tin Hau, North Point, Fortress Hill, Shau Kei Wan, all have merits for the tourist, but if time is pressing you can probably skip them and end the tour at Causeway Bay. You will be missing some of the older areas of Hong Kong with lots of older residential areas with uniquely Hong Kong architecture. I will leave those areas for other reviews in time.The tram is super cheap and is quite quick for short hops, its not for long trips. Recommend that you get the Octopus payment card that is available at the airport (where you buy the airport express train ticket) or you will probably won't have the exact change to get on and off."

It takes only HK$2.3 and you can travel from one end of Hong Kong Island to the other. You can take a very close look at city life in Hong Kong on the upper deck. Usually the distance between two stations is not long, so you can always get off whenever you see something interesting on the street. Not all trams are air-conditioned but it feels good with all windows open. It is slow but it serves best when you want to go somewhere not close to any MTR station. If you come in a big party, you may consider booking a tram party with catering service. Please note that not all trams travel the longest journey (between Chai Wan in the east and Kennedy Town in the west), so make sure the tram you get on can take you to where you want."

It moves at a leisurely speed and the most attractive bonus you get is that you get to see the major neighborhoods and its distint characteristic. Various types of people take this tram from office workers, regular folks, the elderly, school kids, and even amahs.

At any time, the double-decker in particular, offers interesting views of the bustling city and its smartly dressed people. Inexpensive way to commute in this costly city. Time was in the 90s when gangs of us youngsters would fill a full tram and go up down Kennedy Town and Shau Kei wan, holding Round table meetings on the move. Today, the traffic is too heavy to even think of such fun!Again, the Hong Kong trams are as much city icon as the Star Ferry.

The tramway runs almost the entire length of Hong Kong Island, from Kennedy Town in the West to Shau Kei Wan in the East, with a branch line to the Happy Valley Racecourse in the middle. It has always been the cheapest mode of transport in Hong Kong, with a fixed price of HK$2.30 (in 2015). It's also the least comfortable as the poor old dears wheeze and jerk their way along the bumpy tracks. 'Modern' trams with plastic moulded seats and air conditioning are beginning to make an appearance, and at weekends 'Party Trams', packed with drunken yobbos, vibrating to duff-duff music, cruise the route. (Don't try to catch one!) If you want to get anywhere quickly, take the MTR, or comfortably take the bus, but if you just want to cruise the streets at first floor level and watch life go by, you can't beat a Hong Kong tram.BTW, if the tram seems too crowded when it arrives, wait for the next one - it is always empty. It's a physics-defyling phenomenon unique to Hong Kong as far as I know."

Make your way to the top deck and wait for a seat to become available and then watch Hong Kong go by. Its a slow ride, so relax and enjoy.

I always go upto the top,and try to sit in the front seat. I get a great view and fun ride. It is amusing to come flying up to the back of a tram,which has a passenger sitting in the rear seat,and come to a stop, inches from each other's face. Several times I got them to loose their drinks in surprize. Because of the low center of gravity, the drivers speed around the streets,and curves on Central Hong Kong, just like the bus ride in the first Harry Potter movie.

Full stop - no argument.I beleive that they first saw service in Blackpool in England on the promenade areas, and were brought over to Hong Kong in the 1890s (yes, they are that old!!). Of course, there have been some newer vehicles introduced since then, but many of the original trams are still in service.Another amazing fact is that the tram lines are still in their original locations, but that it's fascinating to learn that the northernmost sections (from Western Market all the way through to near the end of the line at Shau Kei Wan) ran along the seafront. In some places reclamation means that they are now close to a mile from the sea!!Although it's a very slow way to see Hong Kong, there is no more relaxing (apart from the crowds of passengers!!) way of seeing the contrasts of Hong Kong. From the gleaming skyscrapers of Lippo Centre, Bank of China, and so on, to the bamboo poles of washing hanging out to dry, it's a colourful chaotic trip. My favourite route has always been to take the MTR to Shau Kei Wan, then jump on a tram to Western Market - must be around 10 miles or so (about an hour in duration), and all for a flat fare of HK$2.30 (about 28 pence or 40 US cents) - bargain!!On HK race days, these rickety quaint old trams are a favourite way to get to the racetrack at Happy Valley - there's a branch line that stops very close by the main grandstand. So if you find yourself at a loss on a Wednesday evening, you could combine two of HK's iconic attractions and go racing by tram!! I did!"

When I was a kid in Hong Kong back in the 1960s, my ama (cross between a nanny and a domestic aide) would take me to school and our mode of transportation by choice was the tram or ding ding as we endearingly called it. The upper deck then was called first class and at the price of 30 cents per person, where else could you go first class? The tram, as I remember, was not everybody's favorite, some lamented that it was too slow while other complained of the blood sucking fleas that lived in between the rattan seating. But for myself then as it is now, the ding ding is more than a mode of transportation. Before I left Hong Kong, I could not think of a less expensive or better way to while away a muggy summer evening by sitting in the front row of the upper deck with the windows rolled then and allowed the gentle nocturnal breeze to caress my face and sooth my soul while feasting my eyes on the gradual transformation of a busy city that was about to call it a day as the ding ding slowly made its way from North Point to Kennedy Town.Several decades later, while I am no longer a little boy and my ama was long gone, I still make it a point to at least ride the ding ding once or twice every time I visited Hong Kong. In this world of uncertainties, it is nice to know that something has remained constant. Try it, you cannot go wrong."

Ding Ding at HK actually made me believe that trams can prove to be a great people-mover instead of just being a mark of tradition and the perennially cause of traffic snarls. Trams in Hong Kong are fast, frequent, double-decked and also cheap. They run from 6Am till half past 12 in the night. They provide the best vantage point to admire the innumerable and glitzy malls & hotels dotting both the sides of the entire strength of road from Keneddy Town in the west to Shau Kei Wan in the East. We used the tram a lot in our 4 days trip of HK city and enjoyed every bit. It very simple to use as they run almost straight in East-West direction on the Hong Kong island. So even if you have a slight notion of which direction to go in general, you can just hop onto the tram, besides detailed maps are displayed on all tram stops and on their website. My wife was especially excited to see the cheetah-print tram racing across the town!!"

The cons are that if you are in a hurry, this is not the quickest way to travel and sometimes the tram is packed of people so one has to wait for a long time before being able to take a seat. The pros are that this is a great way to have a look at the various sightseeing spot throughout Hong Kong, one can take many photos, it is also particular and that this way of travel is very cheap compared to the others(one has to pay when he/she gets off and I paid something less than 5 HKD for the whole ride)."

You should choose to go for the ride during weekdays non-rush hours and sit at the upper level. Then, please sit down and relax to enjoy the scenery of remaining old buildings at West part of Hong Kong, passing through the Central (financial district), Admiralty (business district), Wanchai (some old buildings along the tram line), Causeway Bay (Victoria Park), North Point, Taikoo, Sai Wan Ho... Approaching Sau Kei Wan area, there are many old buildings still around. You may realize the cultures and daily life of Hong Kong people by observing from the upper deck of the tram. It is a much better experience than paying more to ride the Big Bus Company tours. Tell me your own experience after."

Take the double decker and enjoy the view of the buzzling city, buildings and people. It is a tourist attraction, but it is also easy to use as a main transportation if you stay in HK Island side. It is hard to get lost on the tram as long as it operates between West and East. Remember that the driver doesn't change if you pay in cash. Alternatively you can use an Octopus card. Remember also that you pay when you leave the tram (in front by the driver). Entering the tram is on the back/rearside and the driver will not let you enter in front. In rush hour it is very crowded. Try to avoid this if you only want to try and experience the Ding Ding as tourist. Strollers on the trams are also difficult/impossible in rush hour. We only carried our 5 months daughter."

Probably the cheapest possible tour you can do perhaps with the exception of the Star Ferry. Mostly the Tram's just go east to west or west to east with the exception of Happy Valley Tram's which deviate south halfway along. The price is currently 2.3HK$ which is a bit of a fiddly price, most locals have an Octopus Near Field cash payment card, worth getting if you are visiting for mire than a couple of days. they can be used in many places including McDonalds, 7-11 etc. You pay when you get off the Tram and it does not matter what distance you go the charge is the same. when you pay the driver will usually feign interest in your payment and ignore you when you say that your Husband or wife paid the fair who is in front of you. The Trams can be VERY crowded in rush hour and Sundays. Be prepared to have to fight your way towards the front when your stop is approaching. When I first arrived here, I found Navigating very difficult due to the overwhelming amount of sights. Combine that with the fact that a large amount of the signs are in Chinese, I found navigating hard. I therefore suggest that if possible you count the number of stops you need to go before getting off"

I live here so I have found that taking the tram at off peak times and getting on at the terminals is the best way to improve your odds of getting a seat. Standing up is really rough especially if you are tall. The main thing to remember is that even though the tram is a very popular tourist attraction, it is very cheap and so it is really a crowded public transportation mode. If you go during peak hours you will get on at the back, and will be very unlikely to even stand still, let alone sit down, as people tend to move forward to get closer to the front to get off. This is true upper and lower deck. If you are traveling with a group or your family, try to go non rush hour and start at the terminal. They may even be empty and you might have to wait as bit for it to move, but you will see it fills up. It really does move slowly. But at $2.xx dollars, you can see the real HK and save a few bucks. Don't expect to see anything particularly interesting. It can be very pleasant and relaxed if a little frenetic at times. Your kids might get bored... Make sure you know where you want to get off, the signs of the stations are on top of the station shelters and near the front and you can only see them from the left side. The old ones don't have announcement signs inside but the new ones have them. And if you miss your stop its usually only a few blocks between stops. As with anywhere in HK, being pushed and shoved may happen to you, but it can feel worse in a crowded tram car so if you want to enjoy it most, go non peak and find the terminal! Hope this helps."

As the tram moves slowly along the middle of the road towards Causeway Bay you will see how the landscape change, modern sky scrapers to thousand of small businesses with flashing neon lights and thousands of people on the road...that's the real Hong Kong.Because the tram runs on middle of the road and goes very slowly, it is the best way to see around. Windows can be open, so kids had a very good time looking around (be careful tramps pass each other very closely!).Travelling on Ding Dings are quite easy, just get in from the rear door and scan the Octopus when exiting from the front. Price is fixed for the route no matter how many stops you travel. It is very cheap, we paid only HKD 2.50/adult. Tramps are very clean and very well maintained and still looks the old passion they used to be.If you are in Hong Kong Island, this is a must do and is the best way to see the real Hong Kong."

You pay into the pot by the driver when you leave the team, something we had to figure out.That aside, these are great for seeing Hong Kong and all the sights. They are double-decker, so raced upstairs each time and headed for the front to take in the views. You could happily spend a day pottering on these, but we took a few routes, watched the world go by, as people have done so on these teams for over a century- a definite activity in HK."

It used to be my favourite way to enjoy a relaxed ride on the upper deck of its double-decker tram with windows wide open during not so warm weather. Yes, it is slow moving and without air-conditioning. But it is also relaxed, moving gracefully on the busy roads of Hong Kong island. It is also interesting to watch the shops and people on the way. My favourite districts are Wanchai, Sheung Wan, Western District, Causeway Bay, and Central, in that order.Do allow yourself at least 60 to 90 minutes. Don't rush. Payment of fare (upon exit in the front by the side of the driver) can be by coin (which has to be exact) or against stored value card like called Octopus (similar to Oyster card) card available from most convenient stores.Relax and enjoy."

When you arrive, get off at the front and pay the driver your 2 HKD (that's something like 17p). For simple journeys, for example between Wan Chai and Central, they probably take just as long as the MTR as you can simply hop on and off quite quickly.

In addition, there are trams approaching the station so frequently but just have to make sure you get on the right tram! Good way to explore Hong Kong as it gives you an opportunity to look shops located at the street, people etc. Remember getting in from the back, pay and exit at the front.There are times whereby the tram can get very very crowded! I remember it was a weekday during lunch hour, I did not enjoy the tram ride at all as I was having difficulties inside the tram to look for sign of the station I wanna hop off! This is worse if you are the lower deck. There was a newer tram I took which is equipped with LED indicating each stop, I guess it's just more convenient for the tourists though."

Whatever your reason, HK 2.30 per ride is not going to eat into many peoples travel budgets so I'd encourage everyone to hop on and take a trip!After disembarking the Star Ferry at Central, the closest stop for visitors to Hong Kong Island is Pedder Street. Board the tram from the rear then go upstairs to try and get a seat at the front. Then it's just a matter of deciding whether to ride to the depot before boarding another tram for the return journey or hopping off and exploring a new neighbourhood. Pay on the way out the front door with an Octopus Card or with the exact change. Be aware that some lines are longer than others, so it may be wise to get a copy of the eastbound and westbound routes from an Information Centre or a PDF version online. Each tram displays the name of the depot it's travelling to and each stop is announced, English included."

It's so convenient to take the tram and it's cheaper too. Agreed with other reviewers as this is the best way to see Hong Kong. Just hop on, look out the window, see something interest you, get down and explore! So easy. And the tram stops at every tram stops and you will definately won't miss any spot.Also the tram travel the same route except to check out the last point you want to go.

The real grandeur of Hong kong city center, with its impressive skyscrapers and buzzing shopping areas can be completely experienced only from the top of a tram! I frequently used the tram to get to Central, thus avoiding the faster but no-chance-of-sightseeing metro and the costlier taxi options. Wherever you stay, just go to the nearest tram station, travel to the end of the line and then come all the way back (or alight where you want!). P.S.: Keep in mind that you should have the exact change (it was $2.30 during my stay) and you get into the tram from the rear end, but exit via the front and only while exiting you have to pay the driver (you put the change into a small box next to him)"

In our case, we got on one tram, came to a terminus and had to pay and get off the tram to get on to another tram to get to the place we want to go. If you have some spare time, to stop and go up and down the trams, it is ok. We had a toddler and an infant so getting on and off was a bit tiresome.At each stop, there is a map, to tell you where are you and which tram will stop at which stop. All you need to do is look at the location you want to go (Eastbound or Westbound) and then see where you want to go. Then look at the tram's color line, which will tell you the first and last stop of the tram. When that tram comes on by, just hop on. Since it goes on a single entry basis, it doesn't matter which stop you go. We didn't use any travel cards so we had to make sure we gave enough coins.

The upper deck offers an unbeatable view of the hussle and bustle of Hong Kong life. They are often crowded, but people tend to get on and off often so, chances of getting a seat are quite high after a little time.Trams, although moving quite slowly, often are the fastest form of transport as you don't have to go up and down to the subway for the MTR. They are frequent; the next one usually comes in under 5 minutes.Tram fare is unbelievably cheap - HK$2.30 for as far as you want to go. That's less than US30 cents"

But do bear in mind that being cheap, Ding Ding is often crowded and sometimes over crowded.Particularly, if you enjoy seeing all walks of life of Hong Kong, it is an eye opener.

Then you will enter the west side starting with the \"Dry Sea Food\" old district. Most shops and buildings are over 100 years old.

I lived in Hong Kong for 18 months back in 2007/2008 and have used the trams to commute and also as a fun tourist activity with family and friends. during a recent trip to Hong Kong on business (Dec 2014) I used the tram to get from my hotel in Johnston Road to Pacific Place in Admiralty and it reminded me how great they are and prompted me to write a review here on Trip Advisor.They have been running for 110 years and are the cheapest and most environmentally friendly way (other than walking) to explore Hong Kong. At just HK$2.30 (about GB\u00a30.20) per ride for an adult and HK$1.20 for a child aged 12 years and under, it's amazing and no wonder that the trams with their 6 lines and 120 stops have about 220,000 riders every day! You get on the trams at the rear and exit at the front, paying as you exit with cash deposited in the trams farebox or by tapping an Octopus card on the fare processor machine. All the trams are double-deckers and it's great sitting up top and watching the bustle of Hong Kong as the driver 'Ding Dings' his way through the busy streets. If taking a 'tourist ride' I strongly suggest taking the tram right from it's start to end, so get on in Shau Kei Wan and ride all the way to Kennedy Town... It really is something you'll never forget or regret doing. This journey will take about 80 minutes and for the HK$2.30 Fare that is exceptional value for money!!! Note that due to their age and restricted space inside they are not suitable for wheelchair users or for baby buggies."

If you go on a longer journey, it's worth trying to get a seat on the top deck as it's a great way to see Hong Kong's streets and neon signs. You always spot something different from up there, that you wouldn't from just walking at street level. There are Albert and Victoria, Hong Kong's oldest two trams.

Since it goes so slowly and the stops are frequent, one can easily hop off at places of interest. The trams are mostly non-airconditioned and can be something to consider if you visit during the summer months. However, if you visit between November ~ January the ride is very pleasant.

The iconic trams made their debut in 1904 in Hong Kong where a large number of residents lived and had a growing demand for cheap and convenient transportation on the island. The HK Tramways launched their seventh-generation tram in 2011, which is a combination of modern interior design with traditional exterior tram outlook. The face-lift allows the tram\u2019s iconic image to be maintained but the interior is a lot more comfy now than how it was decades back. HK people fondly refer our famous trams as 'ding ding' because of the tinkling sound it gives out as it trundles daily, weaving through major streets stretching from the East to the West of HK island. If you are pressed for time, Ding-Ding is perhaps not for you cos it is confined to run on assigned tracks at a restricted speed. However, if you have time to spare, I strongly recommend anyone, esp tourists to take a ride on these very comfy, airy, and clean public transport, to get a glimpse of real HK where east meets west, with routes leisurely taking you from our newest, most cosmo districts in Central to our older, more conventional and historical areas like Sheung Wan at a fare you cannot resist and nothing can beat----hop on and ride the entire routing for just , look----adults HK$2.30, kids HK$1.20( 3-12 years old), and senior citizens HK$1.10. People can hire the trams for tram parties and it is getting more and more popular with product launching or weddings or graduations.The tram windows open wide to bring in the draughts in cooler days and breeze in the hot summer. This is unique to HK and no tourirts can claim they have visited vibrant Hong Kong without a ride on our beloved 'ding-ding'."

They're quite fun to watch, and many tourists and locals alike take photos of different designs.The trams are not air-conditioned, so that's a slight issue in the summer, especially if you take this during rush hour. Generally a tram is ok for the same distance as 2 or 3 MTR stops, otherwise for convenience the MTR is better. However if you are visiting HK and want to have a good view, go upstairs and enjoy the gentle pace of the tram.

The Ding Dings are a cherished part of Hong Kong's present and past that can be easily enjoyed by visitors who spend time on Hong Kong Island. These slow moving tramcars have been plying their way along the streets of Hong Kong Island since 1904 with the same look and feel that passengers would have experienced a 100 years ago. For the cheap fare of HK$2.30 per adult and HK$1.2 per child, you can catch one of the Ding Ding trams going west and east from Kennedy Town all the way to Chai Wan, passing many historic districts and neighbourhoods, the massive skyscrapers in the Central Business District, the shopping mecca in Causeway Bay and Victoria Park. There are many tram stops and quite a few Ding-Dings on the street so you never have to wait long to find one that you can board. If one passes by and is full, just wait a few minutes for the next Ding-Ding. If there is room on the top deck, we suggest going there as the views are much better. Upstair seats provide you with much better views of the interesting street scenes along the tram line. This is especially true after dark, when you want to have high vantage position to see the neon and bright street signs you will pass during your journey. In the end, Ding Ding trams are not just a important link to Hong Kong's past, they are a heritage treasure and something that we regularly enjoy using during our own leisure time. If visitors have time we highly recommend adding this to your bucket-list of things to see when in Hong Kong."

Heading from Central to Kennedy Town is probably a better way to go, there are a few bars and restaurants at the terminus, where you might want to enjoy happy hour before heading back.Make sure you head up to the top deck and nab one of the four front or back seats for the best view and the best chance of some air.Enter via the back of the tram and you exit via the front, where you swipe your Octopus card or pay your money (exact change)."

It's interesting that in such a hustle and bustle place like Hong Kong, this relatively slow mode of transport still has a role to play. It's actually a very good way of touring around HK. It runs from the western end of the island towards the eastern. So to complete a tram ride means you can manage to see the different parts of HK in just one ride. Suggestion is to get a seat on the upper floor as it can get quite crowded (still a very popular mode of transport for the locals!).

The Tramways,also called Ding Dings,are double deckers.Try to get a seat on the upper floor,right up front,where you can enjoy a panoramic view of the passing street life below,while the Tramway clanks and sways along.There seems to be no regular schedule,but Tramways come along every few minutes, sometimes 2-3 behind each other.Depending on the time of the day,the Ding Dings can be packed.If you are on the upper floor,leave plenty of time before your departure,because you will have to squeeze down a very tight spiral staircase,and then push to the front,where the pay station is located,right next to the driver.Only exact cash ($HK 2.30=$US 0.25) or the Octopus Card are being accepted.Not all Tramways travel from end station to end station.The final stop before the turnaround is displayed at the front of the Ding Ding.Consult your street map,before getting on.We found the most interesting stretch of Tramways travel from \"Central\" to the \"Western Market\",because you will get a glimpse at the \"Old Hong Kong\" with colorful shop signs (or neon signs),some deliveries of goods still by hand-pushed dollies,old fashioned shops,all in a somewhat chaotic atmosphere.We usually get off at the \"Western Market\",where we can enjoy a light lunch or a piece of cake with cappuccino at the German Bakery/Cafe' \"Das Gute\".A trip on one of these Tramways is even more colorful at night."

It costs just HK$2.30 no matter where you go \u2013 from East to West one way or back, and we found this an really good way of discovering different areas on Hong Kong. Some of the areas are posh and modern (like around Pacific Place and Central) and some that are westwards are crowded and busy, but the Ding Ding tram is the way to go. If you want to see the real Hong Kong, forget the underground MTR (quicker) and take the slow lane of the tram.We downloaded the PDF maps (East and West bound maps have stop numbers and accurately show you where you are) from http://www.hktramways.com/en/index.html. Some of the tram cars are really old, while others are pretty new, but the experience \u2013 specially if you sit upstairs (with your camera of course) is just unforgettable. We took the ding ding tram several times across Hong Kong island.Use your Octopus card \u2013 that is the best and only reasonable way to travel across Hong King, and the fare is automatically deducted as you swipe when you exit through the front. Some of the stops are pretty close to each other, so make sure you are ready to exit through the front before your stop arrives. Keeping those two pdf maps on your phone is a good way to use the tramways. Each tram has a number \u2013 but you should look for where the last stop is (says so on the front of the car) rather than the number of the tramcar. New tramcars are made of alumnum, and the older ones are wooden. Trams come along frequently, although sometimes they get delayed in traffic. When they do arrive often we let the first couple of them pass (crowded) and we boarded a near empty one (usually the third one along). Tram stops are marked clearly and they sit in the middle of the streets (both way stops usually face each other and are shaded). Each stop has a map. Whatever you do in Hong Kong, you absolutely must get on the tram, and ding ding through. It's an item that should be on everyone's bucket list."

Usually, the speed at which they travel does provide a breeze, and you'll see elderly people sitting beside you barely breaking a sweat (guess I haven't acclimatized yet). One more thing that's worth noting for first-timers, you enter the tram at the back door and exit at the front, which is also when you pay. I didn't know this my first time and was a bit confused. Happy travels!"

It's also very cheap, costs you less than $3 HKD. If you have time to spare, its a very enjoyable ride during the fall / winter (It maybe a bit too hot during day times in Summer) to see Hong Kong Island in a 1 hour ride or so from Central all the way to Shau Kei Wan. You can jump off the tram to visit any place you see interesting and hop back up to the next available tram, usually within 5 mins waiting time. You must give it a try!"

There are many fantastic things to do in HK but this is NOT one of them. The buses move at a glacial pace and even sitting in the front seat on the upper deck you can't see much above about 5 floors of a building.

Had to wait for several trams to pass by as I wasn't so sure anymore which one to take. The stairways going up to the top level are a bit narrow and challenging now for me to take. Good thing I was able to find a seat. IT was hot and humid inside the tram but got to see a section of Hongkong which I haven't seen in a while from my elevated perch. Not too advisable for people with physical disabilities or seniors. All in all, a pleasant enough trip but would opt for the speedier mode of public transport."

The tram stops at all the traim stop along its route and if you have only little time to spare , you may want to just take a trip for a few stops rather than the whole route as it takes quite a while from one end to the other."

Just choose your time to avoid the rush hours. The best time is to travel during the early hours.For the equivalent of 30 US cents, you can travel from the eastern end of the island to the western end - a trip that will take closer to 2 hours. The trams are clean and the newer version have stop announcements and displays. I always prefer to travel on the upper decks to catch the sight and fresh air.I have always wanted to check out if someone knows that the trams still uses sand to assist turning.

We told one driver we were riding for fun and let us know in facial gestures that he thought we were nuts.

It is a wonderful ride in Hong Kong Island only (perhaps not too much city has it now) if you take the tram for HK$2.3 (adult and 12-year child as well as senior citizen for $1) by spending one more hour on the upper stair. The eastbound route starts from (1) Kennedy Town to North Point and (2) Western Market to Shau Ki Wan; for the westbound one is from North Point to Whitty Street. If you do not want to go to Catholic graveyard and horse racing course, just skip your way to Happy Valley.The whole journey takes you from Sheung Wan (dried seafood products, Cat Street), Central (Hong Kong Bank head office, Lan Kwai Fong, Mandarin Hotel, Statue Square, Old Supreme Court, Star Ferry etc), Admiralty (New Legco chamber, Tai Koo Plaza shopping malls), Wanchai (Central Plaza, ferry to Tsim Sha Tsui), Causeway Bay (Sogo Department Store, Victoria Park) , North Point (Chun Yeung Street market, tram depot), Quarry Bay (Tai Koo Shing), and finally the last stop at Shaukiwan.If you follow the tram track, you won't get lost, just like from Tsim Sha Tsui to Mongkok by walking along Nathan Road in Kowloon.Bear in mind to buy an Octopus card ($100 basic fare with $50 for deposit, you can get it at any MTR station), I think there is no need for you to buy a tourist card unless you want to keep it as a souvenir. Either paying tender fare (on tram, bus, ferry, peak tram and even train etc) or buying quick food (MacDoanald) as well as buying snacks at 7-Eleven, Circle K, Vingo etc., this value-added card not only save your time, but also it is extremely easy for you to get your refund back at any MTR station before your departure."

The tram system here is recognized as the largest in the world with the biggest fleet of double-decker trams and is owned by Hong Kong Tramways Limited. The tram is an environment-friendly, convenient and the cheapest mode of transport in Hong Kong.Many people use the tram (known as \u201cDing-ding\u201d to the locals) and one arrives every couple of minutes at every stop and this would ensure people movement is not disrupted for long periods. The trams come in different ages and looks, some older ones and some newer ones which are brightly-painted and carrying advertisements to boost revenue. To get a better view choose a window seat on the upper deck. No matter how far you travel the fare is the same at HKD2.30 per adult and unique to this tram service, you only pay into the box or touch the device with your Octopus pass when exiting the tram.For the experience, it is a must-do when visiting Hong Kong Island."

We hopped on the tram from Central and took it all the way to both ends. Perfect way to catch up on the gossip and periodically marvel at the site that we see along the way. It took us over an hour and by then we are fully updated with each others lives and have seen the high contrast of HK that most tourist don't get to see. It's also cheaper than a Starbucks coffee. HK is not short on things that will marvel you. Nightife, shopping and just soaking up the vibe in SOHO/LKF you'd feel the earth really move in HK. But there's other parts of HK that's almost idyllic and we felt that like saw that by taking the tram.If you have time to spare and want something away from the usual trifecta of eating, drinking and shopping - take the tram. have a cup of cuppa on random stops. watch the world go super fast and relatively slow just a few stations away from Central. On another occasion - we have taken the tram to party. Literally booked the entire carriage and partied all night long. So whatever you fancy - take the tram!!!"

It is a great way to see the city especially sitting upstairs and in the front. They generally criss cross the island side of Hong Kong, and you can get on and off as you would a local bus route. Get on in the back of the tram, and leave by the front where you also pay for your fare. If you have an octopus card. Just swipe it over the device and exit. Cost for a full length ride is about 2.30 HK$. They get priority on the road, but must also stop at signals but the slow movement allows for picture taking or maybe even a video. No visit to Hong Kong would be complete without a ride on the double decker trams."

The trams arrive at regular intervals, go up the stairs and find a seat on the top deck. Locals use the trams too so even if you start off standing it won't be long before you can get a seat. The trams trundle slowly along the main streets, allowing plenty of time to gawp at the tall buildings that surround you on all sides. You can see the locals haggling for fish with much shouting and amusement, or pushing their wooden cart across the road in front of buses, cars, trucks, bicycles and people. It is cheap, I think you just pay when you get off, but HKD2.50 or so. The driver doesn't take much notice but I made up for my short-payment by overpaying another time, honestly. I was so busy looking around I didn't see the fare notice, or perhaps it is not displayed on every tram? Seriously recommended as a way of getting to grips with the scale of downtown HK, where things are, how much distance you can reasonably cover. Much less frightening than trying to cross the main road."

If you have an hour or two, you would get a close up and personal view of Hong Kong for next to nothing! If you are in Hong Kong, I would definitely recommend getting on the Tram.Tips: The top offers great views, however, for those that are taller than say 5'10\" watch out for hitting your head on the ceiling.

Children may be 1/2 the price. Sorry don't really know for the children fare). The journey from Central to Causeway Bay it's more or less 1/2 hour, the driver will stop at every stopping point. I like to seat upstairs just to see what's going on around the area because there is always a new building coming up or the old one being torn down due to a new development. All in all, taking a tram ride in HK is fun and full of surprises just be ready with the weather situation it can be nice & windy or hot & humid but overall it's pleasant!"

Pay as you exit, with coins or Octopus card. You can more or less see if you will need to stand, before you get on, so if you have time, just wait for the next tram to come along."

The tram travels all the way from Kennedy Town in the West to Shaukiwan in the East, covering almost the entire northern shore of Hong Kong Island. With fare at HK$2.3 for an adult per trip, which usually covers more than an hour if you stay on from terminal to terminal, you cannot beat it for value with any other means of transportation. The tram which starts at Kennedy Town travels through Sheung Wan, Central District, Admiralty, Wanchai, Causeway Bay and normally terminates at Happy Valley which is mainly a residential area with few touirts attractions, unless, of course, you want to see the race course. But you can get off at Causeway Bay, the busy shoping district, and catch another one which bounds for Shaukiwan to continue your journey eastward (with fresh fare payable). After Causeway Bay, the tram will pass by Victoria park, Tin Hau, North Point, Quarry Bay until it finally terminates in Shaukiwan. Actually, with fare at HK$2.3, you can always hop off to see things or places which you want to explore further along the way, and then hop back on and continue your journey after each such stop over. The upper deck, of course, offers better view than the one down below. It is also a good idea to do the tram ride in the morning, and again at night. It is quite a different scene, sight and sound when the lights are lit and the crowd has dissipated. Bear also in mind that there is no air-conditioning on the tram. So you have to brave the heat if you come in summer.One more piece of info - you can actually hire your own private carriage and have a tram party. It costs just a few thousand Hk dollars but you can have the whole tram which can hold more than 30 people for about two hours. You can design your own intineray too. The other good point is that you can bring your own food and drink onboard at no charge for the enjoyment by your own party. But please book early if you want to try this unique experience. Finally, a word of caution. Because it is cheap, the trams are always busy and crowded. Hence, pickpockets of different nationalities ply their trade on them. But just stay alert and be careful as in in many other busy tourist spots all over world, then you should be okay."

There is a good map online of the routes, the start/end destinations, and the times the begin and end running. Also, a great way to see the city from a different perspective for very little money. The destination is stated on the front of the tram, which can be used to determine on the map where it will go and what time it will stop running. Enter through the back and exit through the front doors. YOU PAY WHEN YOU EXIT. We used our Octopus card and just kept it in our wallet and pressed our wallet to the reader and it registered. Quick and easy. It will tell you how much is left on the card every time it is swiped somewhere. I strongly suggest buying an OCTOPUS CARD at any MTR station. They are 150 HKD, 50 HKD is a deposit you get back when you turn it back in and 100 HKD is to use. IF you don't use all 100 you get back what remains on the card when you return the card at an MTR station. We refilled in an MTR station at an ATM looking machine, just by inserting the card and then inserting the amount we wanted in bills, and then take the card out. So easy. It works in MTRs, Trams, and 7/11s. I'm sure it works more places but that is all I personally have experience with."

The tram gets its name, Ding Ding, from the sound of the its bell. You can use an \"Octopus\" card to pay for you ride making it easy and you don't have to fumble around with unfamiliar coins, there is no change given if you pay in cash you just drop the money in a box. One very important tip when riding Ding Ding is that you enter from the rear door and exit from the front. once on board make your way up the small staircase to the upper deck and take a seat for some great views of the city."

It was nice to get out of the ritsy financial center and see areas where most of the people can probably afford to live. But, it was hard to get a seat. I think the suggestion was to start at the end, which we didn't do, and this very much may help you start off with a window seat. The seats at the front have the best view and the entire front of the tram is glass. One thing though, is this tram moves extremely slow. So, going anywhere takes forever."

The trams are very busy and are often crammed full of passengers like canned sardines- something that you may want to avoid during your vacation unless you prefer rubbing other people's elbows or smelling sweaty people's body odours. There is no air conditioning so the windows must stay open (and hence you'll be breathing in all the wonderfully polluted air from the road - exhaust and fumes from other vehicles and A/C from surrounding buildings, etc. - not good for your health especially if you were to be stuck there for an hour or two). For just a slightly higher costs (which is still very affordable compared to other parts of the world), you can get the same city views from a double-decker bus; it has much more comfortable seating with A/C and, more importantly, it saves you valuable time."

It was a refreshing experience, the interior of the tram was of a unique antique mechanical design. And it's pretty fast and affordable too!"

A tram ride is very cheap at HK2.3 regardless of distance covered. You can have a smooth ride from Central to Causeway Bay passing along the picturesque streets of HK amidst beautiful skyscrapers.This system is only available in Hong Kong island, not anywhere else. The entire system has 9 routes with the westernmost terminus at Kennedy Town and easternmmost terminus located at Shau Kei Wan. Since majority of HongKongers rely on their excellent transport system to move around, you would never see traffic gridlock anywhere. You'd be amazed how HK run so smoothly despite its being a huge city. No chaotic vehicular traffic on the major thoroughfares. Not too many people crossing the intersections even in major shopping and tourist areas. Why is that? Because of its extensive networks of elevated footbridges or subways."

I took the tram from the Western Market Terminus (3 min walk away from Sheung Wan MTR) and alighted at Shau Kei Wan, the east terminus of this route before hopping on again and alighting somewhere in Causeway Bay. The tram offers great glimpses into daily Hong Kong hustle and bustle, and the cheap fare was well worth it. I recommend people who are into simply enjoying city views and interested in seeing the infrastructure of surburban areas as well to take the tram from the West to the East terminus or vice versa. The tram was able to bring me to certain streets and places along the way that I wouldn't have been able to get to directly with the MTR or bus. Remember to board the tram by the rear entrance and pay using your Octopus card or coins while disembarking by the front entrance when you alight. Amidst the modern modes of transport, the ding ding tram certainly stood out with its old school charm that reminded me of colonial Hong Kong and pleasant childhood memories."

Decided to catch a tram as I hadn't been on one yet. Caught the first one along that was going to North Point. Entered through the turnstiles at the back into a packed tram. People were standing upstairs so I just stood at the back. The tram then proceeded to stop everywhere and even though it was akin to a can of sardines in there, that didn't see deter up to a dozen people getting on at every stop. Some couldn't even get through the turnstiles so just stood in them.Then the fun part, getting off. You pay at the front and trying to get there when there's no way of getting through is challenge. Eventually managed it a few stops after where I had wanted to get off by gradually pushing forward.So avoid Friday evening as they are packed. Buses seemed fine.To cap it, went to Admiralty MTR to get to Kowloon and it took a good 10 trains, one arriving every minute, to get on board as the crowds must have been a good 50 deep and just surged forward every time."

In order to do this you do not climb on the buses that say Whitty Street, Western Market, Causeway Bay, Shek Tong Tsoi, North Point or Happy Valley. They do not go to the eastern terminus station. At the terminus is a great market where you can spend a lot of time to browse, buy some fruits and cooked foods and snacks. We had a great lunch here (goose). We asked for them to chop it up in bite sizes. Make sure you bring tissues with you. You can return via MTR which is quicker but we decided to take the tram back to Central to see the other side of the street. You have such a good vantage point on deck too. Good people watching activity (folks on the street and on the tram).

They provide mobile grandstands to the hustle and bustle of the City and travel slowly enough to enable great pictures to be taken from the airy top deck. The system is to join the tram from one of the special stops throughout the route initially get on at the back of the tram. When you reach your destination leave from the front (there are two staircases). The fare is 2.30 HKD which is placed in the container by the exit. No change is given. A great bargain."

What I love about HK is that is very much a walking city. Few people except politicians and Tai Tais (ladies who lunch), drive in Central so the best way to get short distances is by tram. Enter via the back platform and make your way upstairs, grabbing the handle bars as you go. The tramlines turn and you find yourself being suddenly jostled hard. The best view I think is not at the front but the back = cool cruising, superb photo ops of the many hanging neon signs at night. You only pay as you get off downstairs at the front.10/10 for value and atmosphere. Not recommended for the infirm and those with strollers, too hard to get through the entry turnstiles. Don't wear stilettos either, easy to get caught in the wooden floors. Take also crossing the roads to board the trams as the platforms are in the centre of multi-lane roads shared with double decker buses, mini buses, taxi, rick shaws and bikes!\"Where is the tram = Ding ding hai bin doh?\""

Echo what others have said with it being a great way to watch the world go by.On one trip we went east from Happy Valley to the end at Chai Wan Road. Returning to Western Market took almost two hours so you certainly get your monies worth!The seats are rather hard for a longer trip and the 'air con' is whatever temperature the outside air is!You can use the Oyster card to pay for the trip and it's payment on exit."

It's also very friendly. In our opinion, this is the best mode of transport if you want to watch the world move by at a slow pace, down the slope or vice versa. Very shaking but have a nice view at night time.Enjoy the panoramic from the double decker and make amazing photos.We loved it!Enjoy your experience!"

I saw slumber people walking on the tram track while the tram got to stop by and gave way to them... For visitors, remember to prepare exact change for the ride as there will be no change for you... Do download the tramway map from their website before the ride so that you wont feel lost. Enjoy your ride! :)"

You have to know which tram goes where and for me, I just travel from one MTR station to another but I chose to take the tram for that. Instead of travelling in a straight line between to points, it travels in circles before reaching the actual destination. The tram is old and open-aired and it's travelling at a very slow speed. It's almost equivalent to the speed of a person jogging or walking. But I think it's a unique experience after all and it can be a little bumpy."

It's such a relaxing thing to do and a good way to take a good look of HKI especially on a Sunday morning. The scenary is simply awesome and very rewarding. For less than HK$3, you get to see the real HK rather than being taking the subway. Highly recommend for all tourists to take advantage of this form of transportation. It's another alternative to take your date on a stroll especially in the autumn months. The best seats on the tram is the front section of the tram IMHO."

The trip to North point took around 35 minutes, when we got there the tram stopped for ten minutes and we stayed on, the cleaner came on but we just took in the atmosphere of the bust market street with food stalls that the tram had stopped on. After ten minutes or so the tran headed back westward to our origional stop. A great way to spend an hour seeing the real Hong Kong and it cost around 20p.

Really well worth riding it, but do it at night time or on a weekend evening to really enjoy the atmosphere. Calm to Wild and Crazy on the Journey with everything in between. Safe environment all the way up."

We were staying in Sheung Wan and as the tram ran past our hotel it seemed only natural to utilise them.They are not air-conditioned but have open windows, upper and lower decks, can be crowded and also time consuming. However, where the MRT has speed and distance, the trams with their distinctive bell, electric power and narrow body is the quintessence of a bygone era.The cost is a princely $2.30 HKD per trip no matter how far you travel without getting off. We went from Sheung Wan to Cityplaza Shopping Mall (nr Quarry Bay) and got off at the depot stop on King\u2019s Road outside Tai Koo MTR Station. It took just under an hour (depending on traffic) and all for just the one price. Get on at the back sit or stand at the bottom or head upstairs (this is where the best views are). Pay when getting off downstairs near the driver (back doors will be shut). Have exact change or as we did, use a loaded Octopus card and place over the pad.Not the quickest or most comfortable way to commute but it was definitely the most enjoyable thing we have done in Hong Kong over several trips.They run so frequently that you never have to wait too long for one to come along. Some trams have been refurbished with newer seats but on the whole they are plastic and not sized for taller people \u2013 all part of the fun though!We loved it!Enjoy your experience!"

Entrance is at the rear through a tight turnstile and exit at the front. The trams were frequently crowded which I found meant it was best to gradually work towards the front to pay by Octopus Card or exact cash fare when leaving. I did not travel upstairs where I understand it is also permitted to stand, only because if I found the tram was at my stop or nearby a swift exit would have been required.It was all good fun, if you are in a hurry, use the MTR otherwise the tram is cheap, slow and not particularly comfortable.

Entrance is at the rear through a tight turnstile and exit at the front. The trams were frequently crowded which I found meant it was best to gradually work towards the front to pay by Octopus Card or exact cash fare when leaving. I did not travel upstairs where I understand it is also permitted to stand, only because if I found the tram was at my stop or nearby a swift exit would have been required.It was all good fun, if you are in a hurry, use the MTR otherwise the tram is cheap, slow and not particularly comfortable.

If you are in a hurry wanting\u00a0to get some places fast, don't think this HK$2.30 (US 0.30 cent less) fare ride will take you there on time, most locals who use this transportation know that and don't mind about the snail speed. It is like the cable car in San Fransico, Califirnia. As much as how efficient the MTR (mass transit railway) or\u00a0buses system\u00a0run,\u00a0when I go to Causeway Bay or North Point, I take the ding ding tram and\u00a0I\u00a0love\u00a0to get onto the\u00a02nd level\u00a0where\u00a0I can enjoy the bustling city passing\u00a0beneath me and the air is \"fresher\" (okay, put the air\u00a0pollution index aside). You can close the window if you do get cold or when it rains, each huge window has a single handle bar and\u00a0just pull upward. By the way, they just come out with one new\u00a0model, a very\u00a0sleek\u00a0looking ding ding with auto swing door entrance instead of the old turnstile metal bars, they also put out the digital\u00a0display sign so that you know where you\u00a0are at,\u00a0see photos.

From my experience the best way to feel the city is to get to this old-fashioned double-decker and enjoy the ride from the one side of the city to another. Get yourself a sit on the second level by the window and enjoy watching people, traffic, buildings and dynamic of the city. Good opportunity to take photos of urban life. Get on from the back door and get off from the front paying 2 HK dollars regardless of teh length of your journey. The weather was pleasant in March an I fully enjoyed the ride. But I guess it might be pretty hot during summer (there are no ACs in trams)."

We recently spent over six days in Hong Kong and stayed at one of the hotels in the Western district. The Western district has no MTR coverage - tram is the cheapest way to get to a MTR station.We ordered a 4 days unlimited tram ride pass before our arrivals in Hong Kong. This turns out to be a real money saver for us since we use the tram everyday. A single ride on the tram costs HK $2.30 for adult. A 4 days tram pass costs HK $34.Also, the tram terminates at different point - if you want to continue the ride beyond the termination point, the passenger needs to pay the tram at the termination point and pay again when getting off the transferred tram. We saved quite a bit because of the ride pass.We ordered the 4 days ride pass directly from the Hong Kong Tramways website. Many people we met in Hong Kong did not know such a product is available. Tram travels real slow - so if you are in rush, skip the tram and get a cab to the closest MTR station. But if you want a slow close up look at Hong Kong, ride on the upper deck of the tram and you get a very different perspective of Hong Kong Island."

The tram system on Hong Kong island is a great way to travel around the island as it gives you a flavour of the history of Hong Kong and its unbelievably cheap at 2.3 HKDs (about 0.2 GBP or 20p) The system is simple, you hope on at the back of the tram and to you move to the front to get off. You pay upon getting off byt depositing the correct fare in the money machine or by using the Octopus system (which is much more simple).The trams are double decked and its a great and cheap way to explore Hong Kong. Hope on at Central in the West and travel all the way to the East (Shau Kei Wan) or vice versa. Enjoying stunning views of Hong Kong, it travels at a fairly steady pace which is good for taking photos and soaking up the different atmospheres each part of Hong Kong has to offer. The tram does not stop at every stop along the line. It only stops if someone is waiting to board or if you stand near the front (exit doors) so allow time to get to the front doors if you intend to get off at the next stop - especially when the tram is packed.The tram is not air conditioned so its best in the cooler seasons, in the summer you might prefer the MTR for the air conditioning. The locals refer to the trams as \"ding ding\" owing to the sound that it makes.It is by far one of my favourite ways to get around Hong Kong island."

Tram Number 50 was withdrawn from service in 1991 and can now be seen on display in the its original 1950s condition in the Hong Kong Museum of History. In 2010, a new generation of trams was introduced replacing the wood-frame tram bodies with aluminium ones. Tram 168 was the prototype.As Hong Kong tramways celebrates its century of the double decker tram services, visitors and locals look forwards to continue enjoying the inexpensive and reliable journeys."

They are hard to miss due to the wires, rail track and the incredible racket they make. There is no mistaking the noise of an approaching trolley. They run very frequently so they are also a good way to get around, although the buses may be faster except at rush hour.Whether or not the bus is faster, it doesn't even come close to the experience of actually riding in one of these spam cans on wheels. If fortune is smiling upon you, you may just be lucky enough to snag one of the wooden seats, the vibration of which is enough to rearrange your skeleton into a modern art piece.

When on the north of Hong Kong Island you must use the trams, for people of my age it brings back memories, albeit vague ones, of the Glasgow trams so that is a bonus. However, the main attraction is that you can travel east to west across a lot the north of the North of the island and identify places that you may wish to visit later. It is also a great way to people watch and see locals about their normal activities. The fare is standard 2.3 HK dollars and is deposited in a cash collector on leaving the tram. It is important to note that the trams get very busy at rush hour and lunch times and can be busy most of the time at the weekend but then this also applies to the MRT and you cannot see much from it. Great to get to Happy Valley, Times Square and in and around Central and Hong Kong station where many of the attractions and much of the night life is centred"

Then they'd get all sleepy due to jet lag and would take a nap, when they woke up, we're still on the tram as us parents also appreciated the view and some down time. If you'd like to go to the Bank of China by famed architect IM Pei, it will drop you off right out side and all you need is cross the street.

If you have time duirng a visit please consider taking the tram from Kennedy Town to North Point. or vice versa .This could take up most of the morning but is the best way to get an overview of the city while sitting down. If your time is limited then get off in Central. You could then do one of the walks suggested in the Tourist pamphlets or go up The Peak. Whatever you decide, you should get on at a terminus so you get the best seats which are upstairs at the front.The tram ride begins in Kennedy Town ( Catchick Street ) which is the far western point of the harbour. For a short distance the line runs along part of the original route close to the harbour. Board the tram and go straight upstairs to the front seats (you pay by Octopus on alighting). From there you can sit comfortably and watch life in the bustling streets. The tram route was once on the waterfront but the harbour is getting narrower as the years go by. Getting to Kennedy Town is easy if you know the city but could otherwise be a hassle. You could get a tram going west outside the HCBC main branch in Queen\u2019s Road Central . The destination should say Kennedy Town. Stay on until the terminus then pay, get off then straight back on again. If you do not want to do a longer trip at least try and use the tram at least once while in HK. It is a unique experience."

They are mostly old and very few have air conditioning, however they also have a charm that makes them a great leisurely way to see the busiest parts of Hong Kong Island. Regardless how long or short your trip on a tram, the price is the same and it is ridiculously cheap - you can use coins or an Octopus card to pay. As the trams travel relatively slowly they offer a fantastic opportunity to pull out your camera and take some action shots of Hong Kong streets and buildings (best to sit on the top deck to get those). For tourists, I would recommend taking the tram from Central to Happy Valley, Causeway Bay or North Point (or vice versa). You will go through the High rise areas of Central and Admiralty and the bustling hub of Wan Chai where craziness abounds out the windows as people race about their various activities. You will see wet markets and if you travel at night the rapidly disappearing neon lights that once made the city famous. During peak hour the trams are PACKED like sardines, so best to avoid those times if you can. My kids love to ride the trams and watch Hong Kong pass by. They are a great attraction for both young and old alike. "

One thing that simply impresses me about public transportation in Hk is the sheer integration of it. On one hand you have a piece of heritage idily rolling down the tram tracks while a few seconds later, a zooming air-conditioned modern double-deckered bus zooms past it. There seems to be a healthy respect given and accorded to these rustic looking trams as the modern buses always seem to give way to them. That being said, it is a good photo-op as they are indeed an iconic sight. Riding on one is cheap to the point of disbelief and if you are like me, with time to spare, taking a round trip around HK island on one of these trams is a good way to see HK Island for what it is. Besure to take the upper deck as it affords a more spacious sitting environment and provides better air circulation as the trams are not air-conditioned. It is simply great that the HK transport govt has not eschewed these old rustic models for more snazzy modern ones. It will simply kill it if they replace these trams with the modern alteration which will most certainly kill the rustic flavour and heritage of this unique mode of public transportation. A must do when in HK Island. Try it you will find the experience pretty interesting!"

Everything is so convenient and straight forward that it's almost laughable! However, keep in mind that the lines to Mongkok and Central are often extremely busy. If you're not one for Claustraphobia, if you're on the red Tsuen Wan line to Mongkok, get off at Admirality and change lines. It's better instead of suffering one stop to Mongkok. This is just my opinion."

You can get off at Waanchai, or Central opposite the Star Ferry terminal so it's very convenient, and slow !A trip to Shaukeiwan will show you that HK is much more than the Star Ferry, tailors and annoying touts.

Before you get on the tram, make sure to read the sign on the top as to where the tram goes. I thought they all made the same route until my mom and dad pointed it out to me. HA! We wanted to get on and go to the end stop in Shau Kei Wan to have a bowl of fish ball noodle. Paid only $2 and on the tram for like 1 1/2 hour from one end to the other was kind of cool. The seat were a little hard, all made of wood but it just has that nostalgic feel to it. Well worth the money you pay. Not to miss!"

That's because we're Americans, and this whole driving on the other side not only makes us a danger for getting run over when we cross the street, but REALLY screws up whether we want to go west or east and which way that really means on the tram. Tip - let one or even two go by so you can see their destination on the front of the tram and compare it to the tram line map at each stop. Because if you get confused to begin with, heading the wrong way on the tram will sort of imprint that confusion for the duration of your stay. If you drive on the other side of the road, ignore this tip as you are doing just fine."

But when we talk about frequencies, Hong Kong is 'the most'. In none of its stations I spent more than two minutes (literally two) for the next train.

They can be incredibly crowded at rush hour but that's all part of the fun. I recommend using your Octopus card because of the sheer speed of payment when you get off at the front end and also because cash can be a pain because you must have the correct fare as no change is given. Seats are hard, basically a bench of flat wood so not ideal for longer journeys if anyone has comfort problems. If you have small children, they should love it, I know the big kids do!"

Then, you don't have to undergo busy time with the locals especially during peak hours. Don't start too early (after 10:00 a.m.) as most of the shops along may not yet open. Go to the upper deck and try to sit in front. Prepare exact coins to pay when you leave (unless you have bought the pass) as there is no change available. Despite having 3 routes in general, all the trams run the most busy areas - Causewaybay, Wanchai and Central District.

If you are on your first visit to Hong Kong and have the time to spare, you should not miss this nostalgic way of transport in Hong Kong Island. Fares are really cheap at only 2.3 HKD for one trip, and you really get to see more parts of Hong Kong when compared to the faster and more comfortable MTR. It is open air and not air-conditioned though, so it can get a little warm sometimes. The deck can also get rather crowded at times as there's not too many many seats on board compared to a normal bus. But still, all things considered, I feel it is really definitely worth the trip."

Not very recommended for families with little kids. The tram could get really crowded. The entrance is at the back of the tram and the exit is at the front.

I recommend taking the MTR, taxi, or bus to your destination the first time and using the Ding Ding on the return, until you're familiar with the way your stop looks.Also, prepare to exit the Ding Ding at least one stop before your destination, trying to scurry from the top deck to the exit in a hurry can be a challenge."

For just HK$2.30 (adult) and HK$1.20 (children) per ride, you really can't go wrong with this quick, easy and child-friendly attraction. The Ding Ding slowly plies its way along Hennessy Road and is best taken between Sheung Wan and Causeway Bay. We enjoy it best at nighttime when you can see the endless building lights, especially as you approach Causeway Bay. You can find a nice map on the Hong Kong Tramway website and a nice travel guide for the Ding Ding on the Discover Hong Kong Website, both are worth taking a look at if you intend to use the Ding Ding while on Hong Kong Island."

With only HK$2.3 (almost US$0.3, half for kids under 12) you can travel from the western end to the eastern end of the island on one of Hong Kong's oldest transportation system which has over 100 years' of history. You can either pay in cash or via an Octopus card. Slow in motion but not short of efficiency, the tram will give you a good idea of all walks of people in Hong Kong and if you've been here before, the changes that took place in recent years. My friend from USA remarked that, compared to what she saw 5 years ago, the tram ride displayed an array of high rise properties in Hong Kong which reflected the outcome of the property boom, but short of character - fading away of the Old Hong Kong in which you will find old low rise buildings or communities with it's own unique style.Some factual information for those who want to ride on the ding ding tram: the western end is 'Kennedy Town' and the Eastern end is 'Shaukeiwan'. Remember to take a seat upstairs as the views are much better and the space less crowded. Highlights includes: West bound: Sai Ying Pun - Des Voeux Road West (nicked named 'Salty Fish Street' where over 30 shops display the preserved/dried seafood such as squids, fishes and shark's fin etc outside), East and West bound: All trams - Des Voeux Road Central and Queensway (the financial & commercial hubs of Hong Kong), Hennessy Road (busy for shopping), East bound: North Point, Quarry Bay, Shaukeiwan - King's Road (the longest road on Hong Kong Island which stretches from North Point to Quarry Bay). The whole journey will take about 1.5 to 2 hours depending on the traffic conditions. Get off whenever you want. Avoid the peak hours (0800-0930 or 0430-0630) as the locals rush back to office/home, or occasionally, Sunday afternoon - when there are parades and demonstrations, which will virtually affect the mobility of every single vehicle, including the tram, from Causeway Bay to Western District."

            "review": "Longest Double Decker Tramline in the World. Ding Ding Trams - the cheapest way to explore this city. By paying US$0.30, you can hop onto a tram that takes you tour around Hong Kong Island for hours. It is a good recommendation for the first time visitors, and for those who like to watch the street scenes in an easy way. It is NOT good for visitors who like to have something exciting. There are not many double-decker trams in the world and our tramline is the longest!There is just one long tramline along the northern part of HK Island (east-west direction) plus a little loop into Happy Valley where the horse-racing course is located. In case you see something interesting, you can always get off, find out what interests you then hop on another tram (have to pay another US$0.30 of course). If you have enough, just take the trams in the opposite direction and it will bring you back to your starting point. There is no tram running in opposite direction in the loop.When you wish to add this program into your itinerary, here are some advices: (1) AVOID the busy hours when there are a lot of people using the trams, (2) AVOID the HOT DAYS as trams have no air-conditioning, (3) be sure you have an octopus card as you probably do not have so many coins! For the above reasons, I only give it 4 stars instead of 5. :(Bring your camera or video recorder along. If you can find a seat in the front on the upper deck (always go onto the upper deck for better views), you can take some beautiful pictures/video of the street scenes of Hong Kong. In my opinion, the section in Wanchai is the most interesting where you can see a lot of interesting things going on beside the tramway. I recommend you to get off there and visit the side-streets too."

The much loved Hong Kong tram is called the \"DingDing\" by the citizens of Hong Kong, in a reference to the double bell trams use to warn pedestrians of their arrival. We are convinced there really is no better way of taking in the sights and sounds of Hong Kong Island than by riding a \u201cDing Ding\u201d tram. Hong Kong\u2019s trams have borne witness to the development of the city and served the Island extremely well as an efficient, environment friendly and economical mode of transport. Some noteworthy features:- Hong Kong Tramways have served the Island for over a hundred years starting 1904\u2026which means that the service is now almost one hundred and ten years old!- Starting with 26 single deck tramcars over a hundred years ago, today a fleet of 163 tramcars is in operation, carrying a daily average 230000 commuters.- Hong Kong has the world's largest fleet of double-deck tramcars, running on seven different routes. Hong Kong Tramways is fully owned by Veolia Transport China Limited.The tram line runs 13kms \u2013 from Kennedy Town at the western end to Shau Kei Wan on the east with a 3km track running through Happy Valley. A new route introduced in late 2010 from Shau Kei Wan to Kennedy Town made it possible to travel the full route without changing trams \u2013 in the normal course, changing trams is a must with Western Market being the most common interchange station. Hong Kong trams operate from 6am through midnight and the flat fare for adults is HK$ 2.30 (for children 3-12 years the flat fare is HK$ 1.20). Fare can be paid by Octopus card or in exact change.Trams can be boarded at tram stops which are an average of a quarter of a kilometer apart. Standing in trams is allowed on both upper and lower decks \u2013 which is practical, since trams can and do get extremely crowded during rush hour. Many trams look bright and colorful since they sport whole body advertisements for various products.Some interesting asides:- the inspired, path breaking decision to knock off multiple fare classes and replace it with a flat fare was taken forty years ago in 1972- apparently in 1984, Hong Kong Tramways conducted customer surveys to decide on the future plan for the tram system \u2013 the wise people of Hong Kong voted overwhelmingly in favour of keeping the trams going- In 2000, when Hong Kong Tramways replaced the trams\u2019 bells with a beeper, the Hong Kongers were up in arms at this sacrilege which led to the \u201cding-ding\u201d bells coming back!HINTS:1. If you have only limited time to spare, try and time your tram ride around 12 noon which is when they seem to be least crowded. During rush hour, even standing room is hard to get. Standing in a crowded tram is not an experience to be recommended since the journey is quite obnoxiously odorous and suffocating.2. This is sort of obvious \u2013 nonetheless, do try and get a seat on the tram\u2019s upper deck and ideally right at the front. From this vantage point, you get to see more and can also take photographs of the action on both sides of the tram as also all that\u2019s happening directly in front of it.3. If you are not carrying an Octopus card, then make sure to have exact change with you since there is no system on the tram to get change back in return.4. If you are on a leisurely visit to Hong Kong, we strongly recommend your spending a full day on the trams starting early morning through late at night. The trams offer you simply the best and most economical way of experiencing the heritage and cuisine of Hong Kong Island. We suggest the route starting from Kennedy Town through Sheung Wan, Central, Admiralty, Wan Chai up until Causeway Bay. In particular, the variety of culinary options available on this route are simply scintillating \u2013 for example: a cup of tea in an authentic tea house, hand made breads, signature cakes and desserts, cookies, egg rolls and egg tarts, buns, puffs, pies, ice creams, meringues, congee with accompaniments, a mind boggling choice of soups, glutinous rice balls, dumplings, noodles, satay, duck, chicken, pork, beef, eel, squid, crab. If like us, you are a foodie, please do read the \u2018Ding Ding\u2019 Hong Kong Tram Guide for more information (http://www.discoverhongkong.com/tramguide/eng/) \u2013 it is an amazing resource that tells you how much you can do riding Hong Kong\u2019s trams."

I headed for the top deck and took photos from the back - it was hot in summer and you only get a breeze when tram's actually moving. It's similar to any double decker bus, so if you've 6ft like I am, be prepared to duck.

You can catch it from the West side of Hong Kong Island and head to the east. It is an experience in itself and will allow you to soak in more of Hong Kong at a digestible pace. Once you have done the tram you will get around faster on the metro or cab. Tip: go on the 2nd level in the front seat for the best seat in the houseMore videos of the experience and more info and photos of Hong Kong athttp://chicvoyagetravel.com/featured-experience/hong-kong/hong-kong-guangzhou-experience/"

They work perfectly on all the public transit so you do not need to worry about having the correct change.

By paying US$0.30, you can hop onto a tram that takes you tour around Hong Kong Island for hours. That is my recommendation for the first time visitors, before they have some idea of what they want to do in the city. It is cheap, safe and EASY. There are not many double-decker trams in the world and our network is the biggest!There is just one long tramline along the northern part of HK Island (east-west direction) plus a little loop into Happy Valley where the horse-racing course is located. In case you see something interesting, you can always gett off, find out what interests you then hop on another tram (have to pay another US$0.30 of course). If you have enough, just take the trams in the opposite direction and it will bring you back to your starting point. There is no tram running in opposite direction in the loop, of course it is unnecessary.When you wish to add this program into your itinerary, here are some advices: (1) avoid the busy hours when there are a lot of people using the trams, (2) avoid the hot days as trams have no air-conditioning, (3) be sure you have an octopus card as you probably do not have so many coins! For the above reasons, I only give it 4 stars instead of 5. :(Bring your camera or video recorder along. If you can find a seat in the front on the upper deck (always go onto the upper deck for better views), you can take some beautiful pictures/video of the street scenes of Hong Kong. In my opinion, the section in Wanchai is the most interesting where you can see a lot of interesting things going on beside the tramway. I recommend you to get off there and visit the side-streets too."

Once there, we walked around the open-air food market, ate in a local snack bar, visited one of the temples where you can photograph inside without a flash and without a tripod. We then hopped back on and went to the western-most stop - Kennedy Town. A bit run-down looking and later, I found out this used to be the red-light district. In any event, it is not the destinations that are important, but the journey itself. Try to get a seat up top and in the front for the best views and photos.

They are operated by two trams linked up by a cable one running down hill with the other one running up-hill on a single track but split into two somewhere in the middle. From the Peak Tram station up the hill, you can see a large part of the Victoria Habour; just like the typical post card you can see about Hong Kong. There is also a shopping centre with restaurants next to it. Bus station is just at the basement. The Peak is definitely a place that is worthwhile (highly recommended to tourists) to go if you have never visit Hong Kong before or leaving for long time. What you can do is to take the Peak Tram uphill but take Route No. 15 bus downhill. When riding on thedouble deck bus down the hill, you can have a view on the famous horse racing course - Happy Valley from the top. Leave the bus in Causeway Bay or Wanchai where you can visit another shopping area in Hong Kong Island."

You'll see Hong Kong much more and in much better conditions by doing this. And it's cheap too!"

I have used this transport system each time I have visited Hong kong over the decades and am surprised by so many long time visitors who have never ever tried it. Not only is it a charming relic of the past but it's actually a very practical way to get from North to South in HK proper. You can really get lost as it's mostly on one track. It's easy to see and get on and off even if you don't know the stops the worse that will happen is you're two blocks too short or further down. It's costs almost nothing plus you get a very nice birds eye view of the streetlife from the 2nd floor. Most recommended!"

You literally hop on and off.The equipment was antique so at least you had something to look at while travelling.But we rarely got a seat. Forget about the reccommendations to get a seat upstairs in front - it was always crowded. It was popular amongs the elderly and Philipino maids, possibly because it was the cheapest way to travel.

The cheap fares in part explain the crowded trams. The trams are slow but they provide a visitor with an interesting insight into Hong Kong. The routes extend from Kennedy Town in the West to Shau Kei Wan in the East on Hong Kong Island. There are 118 stops and there is a tram stop roughly every 250 meters. There are 161 passenger trams and they constitute the world\u2019s largest double-decker tram system. History buffs should remember that the trams run along the harbor shoreline, as it existed in 1904. This is one way to see how much land has been reclaimed in the last century. The trams are all painted with advertisements that are very colorful. Companies can hire a tramcar for a year and use the tram body as a mobile advertisement. Considerable ingenuity goes into the decoration of the trams. For a wonderful view of the city from a different perspective, climb to the upper level and sit in the front seats of the tram to see Hong Kong from an entirely different perspective.

Taking the ride during off-peak hours will guarantee a seat at the front of the upper deck to get a good view of the city. You pay a flat fare of $2.3 as you get off and get on at the back of the tram. If time allows, take the longest route from Western Market to Shau Kei Wan, it takes about an hour and a half. Don't worry if you want to get off at a particular place of interest as there are many stops along the route (approximately every 250 metres) and the service is very frequent."

The tram was built years ago and runs along an old shoreline, before landfill extended the city out and out into Victoria Harbour. You can get off and on with little expense, but my friend and I stayed on as I was exhausted from a month of travel and a busy time in Kowloon the previous day. I loved seeing the different neighborhoods, including where my friend went to school and lived, and the famous race track and sporting clubs of the city. I loved passing great statues, lively streets that begged to be photographed with their colorful signs, and old cemeteries with their great stones suggesting the history of the city.When we had finally run through all the routes on the tram, we got off the bus, had a quick bite to eat at a local fast food restaurant, although McDonalds was across the street.When we finished, it was dusk and darkening quickly So we caught a bus, as they are faster, back to the neighborhood above my hotel and I walked the labyrinth of walkways to my high rise on the Harbour.The tram is the perfect way to see non-tourist Hong Kong and take a day off from the scurrying about that seeing a busy metropolitan area demands."

The historic 'ding ding' cable car tram that slowly makes its way down the streets of Hong Kong Island. This is something visitors can do very quickly and easily and is an activity that children can enjoy as well. Just board the ding-ding at one of the many hop-on, hop-off stops with HK$2.30 in hand or tap your Octupus Card and off you go!We much prefer to ride on the top level, in the front is the very best but those seats are very frequently taken. Best to have your camera ready as there always seems to be something to take a picture of when looking out the Ding Ding windows. The ding ding has recently increased its prices from HK$2 to HK$2.30 but this is just a fraction of the cost of riding the similar, but much more touristy San Francisco trams (just to offer an example). There is an excellent 'Ding Ding' HK Tram Guide available on the Discover Hong Kong Website, includes maps and and area highlights. Its well worth a quick look prior to taking a ride on the 'ding ding'."

All journeys are the same price, stops are frequent, so you can just hop on and off. Locals use them all the time and they can be crowded, but it all adds to the experience! There's really just one line running the length of Hong Kong island so almost any destination will do -- the only one to avoid is Happy Valley which will take you on a detour. You get on at the back and off at the front -- if paying cash rather than Octopus Card, you put the money in a box by the driver. There's no change given, so ask at your hotel for some small coins."

Fruit, meat, clothes - there was a bakery there and a few other things. Being further from the tourist area it seemed rather cheap. We tried to go for dimsum but the menus were completely in chinese - but if you want to get away from the tourist area, but close to the subway or tram - this seems like a good place to go"

My plan was to ride it from Western Market to North Point possibly in both directions to get a feel for the area.Well the first issue was where to get on. It seems that it runs down the middle of the street so while the normal buses run right at the curb, the open air double decker runs down the middle and I didn't see where I could board it. After exploring I discovered that there are only a couple of designated stops where there is a platform in the middle of the street, so off we went.Buses seemed to run pretty frequently and after just missing the first one we didn't have to wait long for the next one. But for some reason it looked like 100 people had the same idea. We boarded in the rear and headed upstairs to get a seat. Luckily we got the last one, the only problem was that it was in the back and faced to the center as opposed to the front. My suggestion is that if you want to experience the ride, wait until you see a bus pull up that is fairly empty and then jump on the get your seat. Our bus had standing room only both upstairs and down.Then let me tell you about the traffic. It was horrendous but since we weren't driving who cares. We were riding between 1-2pm so maybe this was luch hour related. I would suggest that you try to ride earlier in the moring to beat the lunch madhouse.You pay when you depart and you can use either cash or for us an Octopus Card. Made all of our traveling a little less hectic. We got off at Causeway Bay instead of riding to North Point and waited for a return bus that had less people and more enjoyable."

Along the way you would see the old dry goods stores in the Western District, financial district in Central, local neighbourhood life in Wanchai, a busy traffic light just outside Sogo Department Store in Causeway Bay, Victoria Park and the Central Library approaching North Point, and the market in Shau Ki Wan..... because the tram travels at a relative slow speed, you can take great photos of all the sights especially if you sit at the front on the upper deck."

The tram experience was so culturally rich, my husband and I probably could have just stayed on there the whole time and just ride from the one side to the other and enjoy the view of the main streets of HK Island. It's impossible to get lost on those things, so if you forget to get off, just enjoy the ride..."

            "review": "An excellent way to spend HK$2. These old-fashioned tram cars are a blast to ride and a fun way to experience travel along the HK island major streets. The cost is just HK$2 per ride, making this ridiculously cheap and good value for money. In addition to the star ferry (our historical ferry boat) and the peak tram, this is our third historic means for transportation that has been well preserved. Like the others, HK manages to make continued use of the Cable Cars. The The advertisements lining the sides of the street trams are also interesting, helping add context and color to your photos of the districts between Causeway Bay all the way past the main central district. We recommend taking a ride on the cable car while you are touring HK island side attractions, you can hop and off for a quick ride, takes just 5-20 minutes depending on how long you want to stay on."
