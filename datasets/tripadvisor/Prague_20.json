            "review": "One of a kind. Very popular destination at old town in Prague. It is hard to miss as there will always be a crowd in front of the clock. It chimes with a little animation every hour and the tourists mill around it to capture the event. The clocks on the tower are one of a kind. They are impressively large and still operational including the little animation that happens. There is also the clock tower that you can purchase a ticket to go up. You can take the elevator or walk. It is quite busy since it is a popular designation. Once up there the views of Prague Old Town are quite impressive. Some of the best pictures I have of Prague are from the tower. I believe that it is worth the few extra Euros to go up the tower. I don't really know if there is an off peak time or not as there seemed to always be a line and crowd, but having said that still worth it. 4 stars for the crowd but a 5 star attraction."

I was expecting a complicated array of mechanical actions to take place on the hour. That didn't happen. There are a few religious figures popping out like the man and woman in a cuckoo clock and not a lot more.There were hundreds of people who were expecting, I suspect, a spectacular son et lumiere type of show. Instead we got a fairly boring display. I wasn't impressed."

We stayed in the Old Town a the Grand Hotel Krakow and our shuttered bedroom window opened out onto the astronomical clock face, so the twelve apostles hourly ritual featured large in our three day trip as they all came and went at the little tower window on the hour every hour, day and night. It was fun to watch and they are a novelty, but I suspect the better choice is the climb up the adjoining bell tower. We didn't do this as the days were hot and the queues long. Most fun was watching from our window the LARGE crowd gather every hour with cameras at the ready waiting for these twelve little wooden dolls to pop out. Hilarious."

For the 21st century public spoiled by cinema and 3D effects it may seem funny and even pathetic and not worth milling in the tourist crowd. But take time, look at the details of this wondrous building and the clock with all its additions, then have some reading in history and legends (ghost on the clock, necessity to keep the clock in good working state, a boy, born in New Year\u2019s night, etc.) about the clock and just go a time back in imagination. Then the miracle will work even in the middle of the bored tourist crowd, even in the 21st century."

The views at night time were spectacular and there is even a lift to the top if stairs arent your thing.We returned a few days later and took in a guided tour of the Old Town Halls which was excellent. The tour guide was a young guy who knew his stuff and kept his audience interest. For us, the best part of the tour was the tour of the underground cellars and old streets of Prague; it was just phenomenal.The Old Town Hall is smack bang in the middle of the Old Town Square and you cant miss it. Tourists gather outside the clock on the hour every hour to see the 12 apostles appear in the window of the clock which is worth seeing. If you take in the tour you get a closer look at the back of the clock and the individual apostles.Definitely a must see in Prague."

Yes, back home the first question you'll be asked will be: \"Have you seen the Astronomical clock\" ?Then what will you say ? No ?Then what have you done in Prague, why have you been there ?Of course it will be overcrowded between June and September...And yes of course the place is way overrated and besides stopping for a few minutes in front of it there is not much more to do (I might have missed something there so let me know if I did)....But you are already anyway there ... so do see it ... And enjoy the atmosphere of a fair from another century ...Skipping it would be like being in Brussels and skip the Manneken Pis...And anyway you'll probably have to pass in front of it on your way from the adjacent Old Town Square to Charles Bridge and to Prague Castle ... So stop there ...You can take a look at the pictures I have attached to get the feeling of the place ...By the way I preferred it at night ...You see ... this middle age mysterious atmosphere ;-)So yes again, it is a MUST in Prague ... Remember, it is one of the most visited attractions in Prague, and missing it would leave a FOMO taste to your visit in Prague."

These are moving figurines and sculptures that will begin to move on the hour.You can enter the clock tower for a small fee of around \u00a34-5. You enter and either by the original staircase or via a lift if your unable to make the venture upwards. At the top you'll be greeted by a spectacular view during day or night but the latter is the best option. All the lights of Old Town will glisten as you peer outwards. Again for a small fee you use the provided telescope for a close up view of the castle on the hillside. Overall a thoroughly enjoyable bit of medieval history"

There is a ticket office at the base of the clock and for the equivalent of about $6aud you can take an elevator to the top of the tower and walk around the rampart to take beautiful pictures. Really good view in all directions. It can have a very long wait but if you go after 4-5pm it is almost a walk straight up. It is open to 10 at night but in October it was gears by 7. You enter through the tourist info centre next door and walk up 3 flights or take elevator, show your ticket and then take the elevator for the last flights. You can actually walk back down the top flights (ramp not steps) which offers several photos and information along the way. There is also a gift shop at the midpoint. Worth the money. During the day the wait would be a negative. Can't imagine how tedious this might be in high season."

            "review": "Tick Tock - come to Prague See (and climb) the Clock!. If you have appropriate expectations and pay close attention you will enjoy seeing the clock do its thing on the hour. Expectations: This is a 600 year old clock, NOT a cirque du soleil show. A clock that has hand made characters that move is cool. Pay attention: Watch the skeleton and guy next to him (right side of clock) in addition to the moving apostles above. Also, be sure to buy a ticket and go into the clock tower. There is a paved path you can climb up to the top. There is an elevator, but as long as walking on an incline is not a problem/health risk, take the walk. It's cool to see the inside of the tower and there are posters explaining the history and all the things to see within the tower/town hall. Once at the top, you have a 360 degree view of the city which is beautiful even in the rain. The view is like that seen at the top of the Eiffel Tower in Paris or Space Needle in Seattle. It's pretty cool. I must comment in agreement with another TA reviewer that the people taking selfies can be annoying and self-centric. It's a small walk about on the top - basically single file. If you stand there taking 100 selfies in all directions you block the flow of traffic and are just annoying. Take a couple pics and keep moving!They also sell tickets for tours to go under the tower to the Old Town Hall. It's not expensive (100 kc) and only 30 min. with a few tours in English, Spanish, German, Etc. this is a nice to have option but not a must see. Our \"English\" guide barely spoke English and was very soft spoken so we only understood about 20% of what she was saying, but still cool to see it. It's very medieval."

There is a Zodiac ring, which represents the stars in the sky and it moves according to it. The two clock hands bear the signs of the Sun and the Moon.

This is probably one of the busiest attractions I have ever been to, so try and arrive here as early as possible, and if that isn't possible, get here at around quarter past to half past the hour, before the crowds start milling around for the hourly striking of the clock. You can certainly get better photos and get much closer without all the crowds around, and once you have done that by all means stay to watch the actual striking, although it is bit of a disappointment as not much really happens. The clock itself is a fantastic looking object though, and amazing to think it was built over 500 years ago!After this, certainly consider taking the time to climb to the top of the Old Town Hall as the views are fantastic. There is a lift, but if you prefer to walk, there is a ramp and on the way up there are plenty of pictures on the walls to look at. The cost is 130czk (about \u00a34.50), and tickets are bought from the small room under the tower, although the entrance is confusingly through the tourist centre about 50 yards or so further down. Allow at least an hour for this, as there are queues and only a certain amount of people are allowed at the top at any one time.No matter where else you go in Prague, this is a must-see."

And I do like the figures around the clock, I will recommend seeing this attraction once as I said before. Nice thing is, it is free, but if you come here in the May thru September months there are a lot of tourists so the square is really really packed.The old town square is a nice square with shopping,entertainment, food and restaurants and of course a tent merchant that sells a delicious dessert called Tredelnik.This is all I can say about this attraction, so run and go see it soon."

We picked a place in front of the clock one half hour before it was to ring for noon in case the crowd was too thick to push through. At noon and midnight two little doors open on either side of the clock, and statues of the 12 apostles turn around, one after the other in each door. While this must have been really something to those in the middle ages, I confess to being somewhat underwhelmed by the event, and that is not to take anything away from the genius of the artisan who originally built it.Definitely see the clock but my suggestion is that you don't put too much emphasis on seeing the clock exactly at noon or midnight."

Be in front of the clock 2 minutes before the hour, sooner to fight the crowds. What \"show\" there is ends quickly. I did go inside the old town hall, mostly for the view. (Side note-bathroom has a fee) The view is very nice and if you time it with sunset you can enjoy Prague by day and night all within minutes.

I will admit I did not go up in the Tower, but didn't have time. Old Town Square is lovely, but it was very crowded when we were there mid-morning. I can only imagine what it's like mid-day, mid-summer."

You will arrive at this jam packed square full of people waiting on the clock to strike and mechanically move a host of saints and characters around for a minute or so.

There's tours in different languages available throughout the day.The tour begins with a visit to the chapel, where you will see the figures from the astronomical clock from the inside - much better view and less crowded than the view from the square itself during the day.The underground segment was really informative, and there's a few older items kept in that part of the building which you would otherwise be unable to see.We found the queue for the lift surprisingly short, but the viewing platform around the tower seems to always be very busy.

Thirty minutes before the hour people start claiming their spot in the Square to either photograph or video the thousand year old Astronomical Clock. The beautiful facing of the clock tower and the finely crafted figurines that perform on the hour are well preserved considering the age of the clock. The Square adjacent to the Clock and the location of the Old Town Hall is a hub of activity during the tourist season. Many street performers entertain the throngs. There is no charge to visit either of these popular attractions and no trip to Prague would be complete without seeing them."

Unfortunately it was extremely crowded and difficult to move around. Better crowd control is needed especially in a day as hot as the one we were there and better signage to explain waiting times and the narrow viewing areas.It's good value for money especially as you get a 360 over the rooftops of the town.

We returned the same day around 4:40pm and sat at a cafe directly across the street with a perfect view of the clock. Although there were many people standing in front of us it wasn't a problem because you need to look up to see the clock anyway. It was worth the $10.00 for a coffee and a beer to avoid being jostled by the huge crowd that gathers every hour."

It tells solar time (whenever high noon is or sunrise to sunset) accurately for every day of the year, the arms of the clock changing length as the length of the day changes throughout the year. If that interests you then it is definitely worth a visit, also to see the intricate paintings and names on the yearly calender face.

The mechanics, the simple but effective movement of the elements is mesmerising even in an age of technological marvels.

Would like to go back and bring my husband who missed seeing it because of work. It works every hour with 12 Apostles passing by a window above the astronomical dial and with symbolic sculptures moving aside. The clock shows medieval thoughts of the universe. The Earth the center, the blue dial represents the sky. Latin words for east and west written above the horizon and Latin words for Dawn and twilight below. There is a zodiac ring representing the stars and sky and it moves according to it. The two clock hands have the signs of the sun and the moon. Three circles on the dial, show different times/ the outer circle shows the Old Czech time. (Italian times), the circle with Roman numbers shows the Central European time and the inner circle with Arabic numerals shows the Babylonian times. (The length of an hour differs there according to the season. It's longer in the summer and shorter in the winter. The Prague Astronomical clock is the only one in the world that is able to measure it. The Calendar dial is the newest part of the clock. There is the Prague old town symbol in the center. The rotary outer circle describes every single day of the year, the current date is indicated at the top, also has medallions with zodiac signs with pictures depicting every month."

The queues and crowds ruined this experience slightly, but I suppose that's to be expected at such a popular tourist destination. The views were spectacular although the time you get at the top of the clock tower are far less than the time you get queuing! The toilets located within the old town hall you pay to use and as you've just visited the tourist attraction connected you'd think these would be free. I wouldn't mind paying for clean toilets but these were mixed and absolutely disgusting!!! I won't go into the gruesome details- but believe me- DO NOT USE THEM!!! Such a shame for such a beautiful building!! The clock itself is quite lovely- and I'm glad I've seen it, but not as amazing as expected. Pleasant is all I can say!!! It chimes every hour and the crowds gather beneath."

As for climbing the tower, it's an easy walk up, or there's a lift. My only complaint was that it was hard to move once at the top due to so many people stopping to take pictures or chat. A not so polite lady knocks on the glass to get people moving, but it's still hard to get around the top without shuffling. You definitely need to have a bit of spare time, as there are queues to get tickets, go up the tower and get down again. Nevertheless the views aren't to be missed and do offer spectacular views of the square below and the city itself. "

Clocks that have a variety of different things moving around on them when they chime the hour are pretty common in Europe, but this is an especially cool one, because of the skeleton ringing the bell as the display of various figures progresses through. The square is beautiful, and this particular section has a great deal of medieval buildings that set off the clock tower. It's also just a beautiful clock as well as a wonderful feat of engineering. It's worth waiting with the crowd for the hour to hear and see this fabulous attraction."

However it is only when you understand the history, culture and science behind the clock that you can begin to appreciate it. It was built over 600 years ago and still works today. That in itself is impressive! The fact that the mechanics from centuries ago still produce a cool display is fantastic. Even more so are the rings around the clock which are related to lunar cycles, the time and even one dedicated to an individual people names in the region depending on the day of the year. An invention ahead of its time really, and one that is worth seeing. Don't forget to arrive on the hour mark!"

It's alright when you're going up the stairs where there's a lot of space, but on top of the tower itself it gets very cramped. Sometimes people just refuse to let you pass even though there's enough space, so you can't even walk to the exit normally.Service at the ticket desk is extremely unfriendly and unprofessional, refusing to answer a very simply question that could be answered with one word. However, the people that work in the tower itself are very friendly and polite and there's one lady at the souvenir shop who's happy to tell you about how the tower works and what everything represents.I think there's more to see on the outside anyway and there are other areas that provide a great view of Prague which are not so crowded (Vysehrad, Letna Park for more distant views, Prague Castle for view on the city itself which is also busy but it's far more spacious)."

Not only is it huge and elaborated, it is also a technical masterpiece. If you look at the art- side of it you can find many statues and paintings, and also the hands of the clock are one of a kind in the world. Looking from a technical perspective you wonder how people managed to bring information on time, sun, moon and several stars together in one piece of work. We waited for the bell at every full hour, if is ok to do, if you can spend a few minutes, but do not wait too long, it is not as if the playing statues do bring a lot of additional value to this masterpiece. Ok, the skelleton ringing the bell is funny."

There is so much to see and do here including the famous astronomical clock where you can go to the top and take some amazing pictures of the view from above for memories to cherish for a lifetime. You will find a lot of segway tour companies soliciting your business, but don't fret, and I highly recommend chatting them up. It was a great way to see the city and visit some really cool spots in a unique way. I highly suggest Cool Segway Tours as they were awesome setting up our private tour and you can't beat the value. But again the square and entire Old Town area is a happening place with plenty of shops, restaurants and cafes to enjoy and take in all scenery has to offer. Don't miss walking around out of the square and going down all the side streets too as you you'll find lots of interesting places and more of the same to enjoy. Certainly a great place to visit."

During our short stay in Prague, we visited the Astronomical Clock to see the clock strike at 11am, and on the next day, we visited both the observation deck of the clock tower, and took the tour of the Old Town Hall.The clock itself presents a display of the apostles of Jesus when the clock strikes the hour, and a hanging skeleton rings the bell. The display is cute, but short, lasting perhaps 40 seconds at most. Of course, this does not stop the massive crowds of people from assembling to see it.The next day, we took the tour of the Old Town Hall, which offered a comprehensive and interesting look at the Old Town Hall with stories of its history and many interesting historical relics to view. The tour is available in numerous languages, scheduled at different times throughout the day.The clock tower is accessible to the public (for a fee), and it is definitely worth ascending to the top for some breaktaking 360-degree views of Prague. The most appealing view is that of the Old Town Square, encompassing the Jan Hus Memorial, wide variety of architecture along the square and surrounding streets; and the imposing and impressive gothic architecture of the Church of Our Lady before T\u00fdn.Despite the touristy nature of the venue, it is worth a visit, but be aware that the observation deck can become crowded rather quickly, and there is very little room on the exterior deck, so my recommendation is to arrive early before crowds of people descend upon the area."

To really appreciate Old Town I think you need to know the history. Same goes for the Astronomical Clock. The clock strikes every hour in case you would like to record it. Go during the week to this area if you don't want it to be so crowded. You can cover Old Town and the Castle in two days."

Do not miss!!TIP: Be sure you spare enough time to go up the viewing tower.

There were so many people in the square as if there is a festival. There were uniformed musicians with trumpets and drums. And the astronomical clock was indeed a unique sight. I don't know how people read time in this clock, but every hour on the hour, it chimes with two upper windows opening and a parade of statues of saints pass through the windows. The view on the square is beautiful with church buildings towering around the hall with a clear blue sky as a fantastic backdrop. There were stalls selling food and drinks, and a park where weary walkers can sit as doves flies around. There are musicians who perform on the road side. A good experience of Prague!"

The clock was first installed in 1410, making it the third-oldest astronomical clock in the world and the oldest one still operating.

The first recorded mention of the clock was on 9 October 1410.[2] Later, presumably around 1490, the calendar dial was added and the clock facade was decorated with gothic sculptures.Formerly, it was believed that the Orloj was constructed in 1490 by clockmaster Jan R\u016f\u017ee (also called Hanu\u0161); this is now known to be a historical mistake. A legend, recounted by Alois Jir\u00e1sek, has it that the clockmaker Hanu\u0161 was blinded on the order of the Prague Councillors so that he could not repeat his work; in turn, he disabled the clock, and no one was able to repair it for the next hundred years."

Not sure I enjoyed it as much as the people that were lined out to see it, but it's an interesting thing to see."

Shops & restaurants galore in the area. You'll find beautiful architecturally kept buildings & the iconic 15th century Astronomical clock here. Not surprisingly, the clock is one of the most visited sight in Prague throughout the day. This is especially true at the top of the hour, when figurines appear from behind closed doors, on the face of the clock. I went to take pictures of it around 10 PM & even then, there were people milling around the clock. A great place to take in the sights & sound of Prague & people watch. A must see when in Prague."

Anyone visiting the Old Town in Prague will definitely not miss this iconic and historical landmark as it has been there for many years over centuries. It's impressive architectural design. And if you are in Prague and not visiting it, its like you would have missed out something!The design and theme was nice and lovely and its one of the few remaining oldest astronomical clock that is still working. At every hour, the clock will chim and there will be \"dancing movements\" on 2 small windows with the 12 apostles moving around.And this place is the \"crowdiest\" here in the old town as people would gather, 30 minutes before the full hour and wait to watch the dancing movement. And nearer to the time, many more would gather and its very difficult to find a spot where you will not be blocked from the view! (advice: if you have a good camera with a HD zoom, you may stand far, perhaps even at Starbucks or the Jewelry Shop and will have a better and clearer view with it)When we were there, it was about noon and guess, many more people were gathering there. It was a sunny day then, crowded and warm!When the clock chimed at 12, the sound was nice with the dancing movement that lasted only about a couple of seconds, where people would snap pictures at it and cheering.Honestly speaking, there is really nothing much to see except the short movements and really not worth waiting and squeezing through the crowds to watch it.And if you want to have a good view over Prague, you can consider to go up to the clock tower (payable and about 4-5 Euros). It was gorgeous from on top! (the entrance is via the tourist office)In fact, the clock will chime every full hour and every time, big crowds of people would still gather to watch it.Personally for us, even if you miss the dancing movements, you don't lose much as you can still take photos in front of it at any time.Caution! Like any other cities that attracted large crowds of visitors, do pay close attention of your personal belongings as pickpockets like to operate in these places to pry for targets."

For serious shoppers there are large, indoor shopping malls and department stores in the area. The Town Hall has the impressive 13th century astronomical clock, Which is a marvel of complicated mechanical workings that one would not expect to see from such ancient times. There is a plethora of movement, sights and sounds in this old clock. Every hour everything comes to life with the procession of Jesus and disciples, a scythe-wielding Death figure, an hour glass turning over, gongs and a rooster crowing (in addition to other more subtle movements). Our guide did warn us to beware of pickpockets while we are standing mesmerized by the goings on of the clock. We were also luck enough to be there during a display of Korean culture with fan dancers in geisha-like costumes. The clock is a must see and there are many other attractions close to it."

The time was one hour off but I suppose that has to do with daylight saving time. Most people come to watch the figures move, but it is the actual clock that is the thing here. Do not miss it!"

Before you go, quickly read about the different features and you will enjoy the experience even more. The clock shows the phase of the moon, has a calendar for what day of the year it is, the month, the zodiac. For those more astronomically inclined, it also tracks sidereal time.It's also worth seeing it strike the hour. The 12 apostles can be seen at the top of the clock. In addition, the 4 figures come to life. The skeleton rings the bell, signifying the end of another hour and our mortality. The other three figures, signifying vanity, greed, and hedonism, all shake their heads refusing to accept that it's time to go. Don't think of it as being depressing though, that's just life :)If you have the time, it's also worth it to go up the tower. The views are awesome, especially around sunset. The walk up the tower also has a history of the tower, when it was built, extended, burned, renovated, etc. Finally, there are also some good books and pamphlets about the functioning of the clock which will help your understanding."

If you choose the lift for both directions - you miss this,I was expecting to see the mechanisms of the astronomical clock from inside - but was disappointed as it was only the main clock mechanisms which were visible.The view from the top was amazing as one could walk round - to see from all directions. Crowd control was poor - and the directions of walking at the top were not clear and most people were not adhering to it, Best would be to go up when most people are down waiting for activities of the \"clock\""

This clock, which is 600 years old, was once considered one of the wonders of the world. I have never seen so many selfie sticks in one place and it was fun just watching them watch the clock. The Old Town Hall has stairs or an elevator that takes you approximately 228 feet high and offers you one of the most amazing views of the city and the Old Town Square below. This entire venue is also a major attraction, especially early in the morning, for wedding couples wanting to get this attraction in the background while being photographed in their wedding gown/tux."

Because it's so beautiful and its architecture speaks for itself. Medieval style, the old town is full of restaurants, bars and crossing it you will find the amazing Charles Bridge. The first thing you see when you get there is the huge Astronomical Clock, which still works until nowadays (it was installed in 1410). It's also the 3rd oldest one in the world. Through there, you can also find the Jewish quarter, heading to Vltava river. Almost in front of the Clock, you will find one of the best bars I've ever been, Black Angel's Bar (been there more than once). On its surroundings, charming narrow streets. Perfect place for photography lovers and history ones!"

There is a lift available all the way to the top, and the view is very good. Unless you particularly want a view of the Castle from this height (which is more achievable from Charles Bridge), go in the evening. Far fewer people both up the tower and down in the square.The Astronomical Clock, although worth seeing if you happen to be around the area near an 'o'clock', is really nothing special. Honestly, when you see it, you are left expecting much more. Some little statues move around for a bit, and a skeleton rings a bell, and then it finishes. Maybe more happens at noon, I do not know. Again, go in the evening to avoid the tourist hordes and actually get a good view."

Thousands of people surrounded the site. I heard the chimes, saw the \u201cskeleton\u201d tinkle a bell, but it appeared to be only a few inches tall. The next day after breakfast, I arrived at 8:50. Few tourists were there and I stood front and center under this magnificent astronomical clock constructed in the 1490s. Not even a Rolex would work after that many centuries. This cuckoo clock-like mechanisms perform for the audience. The \u201cskeleton\u201d in the right side of the attached photo rings a bell, and the other menagerie of characters interact with each other. This is far more than a timepiece. The clock measures astrological signs and astronomical events much like the Mayan calendar foretold of eclipses and the moon signs. Knowing that this was created more than 500 years ago staggers the mind. I have trouble adjusting my watch for the extra February day in a leap year. This is a must-see site in Prague, just off Old Town Square\u2014where you\u2019re likely to be, anyway."

My tips:1) Dont miss the photos exhibition on way up esp from Nazi period.2) The ticket office on corner of building doesnt take credit cards.It caught us out, and the bulk of our long ticket queue. They direct you to a red door to the left which does- and this office is much larger.3) Even when inside you still need cash for toilet."

The view from the top is most impressive over the red tiled roofs of the surrounding buildings and streets and the Old Town Square. Don't worry you can go up by a lift.The horologe (Astronomical Clock) is the most famous feature of the Town Hall and , it was first built in the first decade of the 15th century. The moving features and chimes - the Parade of the Apostles show occurs every hour on the hour,No visit to the city would be complete without going here."

The figures of the Apostles and other moving sculptures parade out to greet you.Behind this famous clock there is a tall 13th century Gothic tower and several ancient houses connected together that make up the Town Hall. From the outside you can see the Clock Tower, the chapel and other buildings. Each building has a unique architectural style. The interior is beautiful. They offer guided tours. The door at the left side of the clock is the main entrance.Happy Travelling!"

It is a bit of a walk to get to the top of the tower, but the panoramic views of Prague are well worth the effort and small admission fee (there is also an elevator).There are a series of rooms under the Old Town Hall, which were used in medieval times (the Hall was built on top of it) and also used during WWII."

We left this till the last morning, and as it opens at 11am we waited to get tickets with no problem (most people were stood watching the clock) Avoid the rush add walk the first set of steps, then get the elevator UP and walk down the tower to view the pictures and history. At the top you have great views (it was sunny) and well worth taking your time. With wording explaing the views it is easy to see whats in Prague from up here. Definietly worth the trouble of getting here, on our way down we saw hundereds of people coming up, so GO EARLY."

The interior of the old town hall was very impressive with painted walls/ceilings & statues at the main entrance.There was a lift that took us up to the upper level - from here we walked a little to get to the next lift that took us right up to the top of the tower. There was the option of taking the stairs but I wanted to get to the top without losing my breath, therefore, the glass lift was a necessity!Once at the top of the tower the outside space was really limited & a very tight squeeze. It was very busy when I visited so I felt obligated to only stop for a minute to take in the views & then move on to let someone else see. You do get great views of the Old Town & can even see Petrin Tower in the distance. The views at night were worth getting squashed for. There is no time limit to how long you can spend at the top of the tower but you will probably find 1/2 hour is enough time to get a 360\u00b0 look around.There was also an exhibition in the town hall area but, unfortunately, it closed at 1800 & we were there around 2100. At around 240K\u010d (approx \u00a36.70 for 2 people) it was definitely worth paying to see inside the tower. Great attraction in Prague's Old Town & I would highly recommend it."

The 12 Apostles showing up at the windows while the bells are ringing is an added attraction. If you do a bit of research before you visit the site I am sure you will enjoy it even more.A word of caution, be careful with your belongings while watching the clock display. A person in our group got pick pocketed during the display but was fortunate to have her wallet returned to her with everything intact."

On our first day we happened to stumble upon it not long before 2pm. We therefore waited to see what all the excitement was about and were left somewhat disappointed. I am not sure if this is because we were expecting something outstanding to happen or what. On the other hand, the clock is very intricate to look at and is worth a visit, although I am unsure I would stand waiting anymore than 10 minutes to see it chime. We didn't go up the tower as we had made plans elsewhere, but I would've liked to have done this and think it may have been an extra touch on this trip."

The clock has lots of stories relating to its maker and the symbols so again worth reading about it beforehand or taking walking tour"

I would never have expected the wonder of this clock. It's intricate with a lot of moving parts and it's beautiful in its craftsmanship. The background doesn't move, but it has a sun and moon that move. The sun will move above and below the horizon on the background depending on whether it is day or night and also shows the time. The moon shows the phase of the moon. There are four animated figures that move at the top of the hour, which represent death, vanity, lust, and greed. Watch as the skeleton that represents death rings the bell and the other three shake their heads. The twelve apostles are also seen every hour.Be sure to grab a spot well before the top of the hour, because it can get crowded. I recommend going during the daytime for the best visibility. There's a lot of jostling if it gets too crowded so be careful with your bags and/or small children. My friend felt someone try to tug her bag."

Being in Prague and missing this is dumb and very difficult since it really is in the center of town so you are just bound to bump into it.It is always filled with tourist night and day so keep a look for pickpockets alhough I must say I never felt in any moment anything else but safe and at ease."

He told us all about the clock, the workings of it and how it tells you the time, date, where the planets are, the phase of the moon, how high the sun is etc. I went back the next day to see the very short show on the hour, which is lovely, you really have to appreciate the mechanics involved for something that old to still work that way."

The guy who designed had trouble getting paid for it, so tragically ended up throwing himself into the mechanism, an action which prevented the town burgers from using it, this lasted 150 years, efficient sabotage!! It's now working well (all cleaned up!!) and an interesting display on the hour! The tower also gives splendid views of the city (there's a lift!!) Plus an historical review on the way down(recites War damage, Nazis and so on, massive restoration work, impressive!)."

Everyday, every hour on the hour the clock does a little display where the 2 small window above the clock open and you can see the 12 disciples dance past the opening.. That's it.. The funny thing is seeing the looks of disappointment on people's faces who have stood there for sometime for 20 seconds.They also sell tickets to go up the tower and look at the view... Don't... Just over from the clock is a hotel / restaurant next to the \"Black Angel\" bar. They have a roof bar (from where I took the photo attached) it's free to go up there and you can have a beer at the same time.Overall, it's a must see otherwise you've just not done Prague... **warning**Be careful the area is full of people selling tours and pick pockets...!!! Keep your pockets and bags zipped up.Thanks for reading, I hope this has been of help, if so please give me a thumbs up.. I need the points!"

On a guided tour you can visit historic rooms of the houses that constitute the old town hall, see the apostles figures that move on the top of Astronomical clock every hour, visit the chapel, go through Renaissance doors and even descend into cellars that are in reality houses from 12-14th centuries. Everything very unique and with a lot of fascinating facts provided by the guide! And of course views and pictures from the top of the tower are amazing!"

This is a medieval clock in Old Town, It announces every hour with 12 apostles passing by the window above the astronomical dial and with symbolic sculptures moving aside. It is very very quick so make sure you observe on the hour. We were warned this is an area for pickpockets to so be careful with your belongings. The clock stops at 22.00pm so dont wait around after that for the movements. A very beautiful clock and a quick stop as you visit the rest of the surrounding areas."

Tou have to pay a modest amount to ascend and whilst there is a lift for people with disabilities, once at the top anyone in a wheelchair will be unable to exit onto the exterior walkways for the great views. The only dissapointments: the overcrowding at the top (so bad the authorities should consider limiting the numbers) and the constant grafiti. This old lady survived being partially destroyed by the Nazis before being rebuilt only to be slowly degraded by morons who feel the need to scrach or write their name over every inch of this beautiful tower."

Going up to the top of the Old town hall was great, but you were sandwiched between lots of other tourists trying to see the lookout. Oh and beware you are charged 3CZK to use the toilet at the basement of the Hall, it's really not obvious until a lady in a hatch of the toilet wall, calls out to you to give her money....awkward indeed"

We were a bit worried about climbing all those steps, but it turned out this wasn't an issue! The walk up is pretty nice, without many stairs and you can also just take the lift - on the last few meters are some steps, where only one direction at a time is possible so there's the red and green light to show who has to wait and who can go..and on top of that a guy with a trumpet, to guide those going down when the green light was on - it was one of a kind ;) and like I said the view on top was pretty amazing!

Really good disability access to the top via a (really really cool!) Lift but also a good ramp winding it's way up as well. Is pretty cramped at the top, even though they keep an eye on numbers up there. The info boards are really interesting, but the panoramic views over the city are the clear winner here.The clock is pretty cool. Neither of us could work out how to read it. Everyone says the moving parts on the hour are a key down but I thought it was pretty cool!"

There are a few steps but most of the climb is up a 4 sided ramp on the inside of each of the tower walls. On each incline there are large photos on the walls with a brief history of each. By the time you have read all of these you have reached the top without a hint of breaking sweat!! Well worth the small entrance fee. Alternatively you can use the lift which reduces the number of steps even more. Once at the top the views of the city are amazing, even more so on a clear sunny day. Don't forget your camera!! When back on the ground outside you can record the Astronomical Clock and its operations on the hour every hour."

You can either take the two glass elevators (one was like Willy Wonka's and I thought it was going to go sideways!) to the top of the tower or walk up stairs to the third floor then a spiral ramp to the top of the tower. We took the lifts up and walked down, and I'm glad we did as several people younger than us came up puffing and panting!The tower doesn't look much from the square below, but it is taller than it looks and the views from the top over the city are spectacular. All the spires and green domes and gold are stunning. I thought the clock was ok. It's not the original as that was destroyed when the Nazis fired tanks at it and set fire to it. I would have loved to have seen the Old Town hall, but that was destroyed at the same time and was demolished. There are now rows of trees where this was (I think they are cherry) but the old photos of the rooms look fantastic.Definitely worth a visit and I can't recommend it enough"

We went in the middle of the day on a Monday and the Queue was significantly less than it had been over the weekend -(45 mins advised queue on the Sunday, virtually non existent on the Monday) and bought our tickets from the little shop on the right of the clock tower. The queue her was about 5-10 mins to get tickets and they do not accept card - however if you wait until you get inside you ban buy the tickets from the 3rd floor and there was nobody queuing there at all and they do accept card. Be warned the toilets inside charge to use! We did not buy the extended ticket and chose to do only the clock tower itself, and got the lift up to the 3rd floor after looking at the ceiling inside the lower doorway. You can either get the little glass lift up the tower or walk up (Ramped not stairs) and read about the history of the tower as you wind your way up. We chose to do this and it only took us about 10 mins to get to the top, and we enjoyed reading about the history of the clock and the town hall and looking at the photos of it during the war and the revolt etc. The very end bit of the climb is a traffic light controlled windy staircase (as it is too narrow to fit people going up and down simultaniously) but this is not too strenous, i would just imagine this is what may cause the queues on really busy days. Once at the top you can look at the view from either inside the glass viewing platform or go out onto the outside balcony. This has a one way system to walk round the balconies and it did get quite busy up there, with a few people ignoring the arrows etc. We did get a beautiful view of Prague and Old town square from up there, and it was funny when the clock was due to go off and we could look down and see all the people standing waiting to watch the astronomical clock do its thing! A very lovely view of Prague and a great way to see why they call it the city of a thousand spires!"

The clock its self isn't as breath taking or big as some other well known clocks around Europe, buts its selling point is that it still uses the same mechanism that was first installed in 1410.Every hour when the clock hits 12, two small doors within the clock open and a series of heads pop out with different expressions. To be honest if you are watching this without any explanation on what the faces mean and all the little intricacies of the clock, it could be quite underwhelming.I came back the next day as part of a city tour and the tour guide spent 15 mins explaining the history of clock, what all the little marking were and what the faces meant, and this made the express a lot more interesting.I believe you can also pay a small fee to walk to the top of the clock and get a view of the square."

All three are well worth checking out. Our tour guide denigrated the clock, but in my opinion it's still very impressive given its age and well worth watching once during your visit. The clock tower offers a great view over the city and has a lot of interesting information about the building on offer as you're climbing up (assuming you're not lazy and don't take the lift). The highlight of our visit was the tour, which takes you through most of the surviving chambers in the hall and even into the cellars. Our guide, Filip, was friendly and knowledgeable; I learned a lot. The chapel is beautiful, as are some of the statues and paintings around the building. Both the tower and the tour are reasonably priced, and definitely recommended as part of your exploration of Star\u00e9 M\u011bsto."

The building suffered at the hands of the Nazis in 1945. They destroyed a Gothic chapel and a neo-Gothic north wing. The chapel has been reconstructed. The most popular part of the tower is the Town Hall Clock. Built in the early 15th century, the Orlij, is the oldest functioning clock of the world. It is not just a mechanical marvel but also a an architectural and sculptural masterpiece. Some say that the four levels of the astronomical clock represent the four elements of the universe- water, earth, air and fire. Over the years it was repaired, reconstructed and restored after a ravaging fire. It displays 12 signs of zodiac, a bell and a procession of Christ and the apostles. Just like Prague's many other buildings this clock too has many legends associated to it. The story of Master Hanus tells us that he was the builder of this unique machine and after it was completed the town councillors started fearing that he might make a similar one for some other town. So they sent hitmen to blind him but even when he was blinded he took one if his assistants with him and did something to the clock that stopped it and could not be fixed by anyone for a 100 years. Other legends relate to the skeleton figure fixed on the clock. This figure is said to predict the good or bad times for the city and it's inhabitants. Some say that he is a symbol of hope.TipsDo not miss the 27 crosses in front of the town hall.Do go up on the tower for some stunning photos of the city.Beware of pickpockets when you see the Orlij demonstration."

The functionality and engineering skills back in 1410 something should put the modern Apple watch to shame. Think of it, this is more than just a clock. It shows celestial positions based on the signs of the zodiac, the dials are made of gold (I think!) and you can use it as a magnetic compass because there is a north pole position. There are 4 animated figures that come into view during different times of the day reflecting various sins like lust, vanity, greed, death etc. The allegories are pretty medieval but again, I love medieval era.Oh, there was this Old Town hall too, where this clock is mounted. Forgot what was the purpose of the remaining building. The clock is called \"Orloj\" in Czech."

The clock shows the time, the current zodiac, the season, place of the sun and moon, and a lot more! It's a must-see.The town hall itself is nice to visit as well.

Alot of tourists here and a few hecklers trying to entice you into different bars and restaurants, just ignore them."

This was one of the first places we visited and yes, it's a gorgeous piece of architecture but I'm not so keen on the surrounding area. The square is beautiful but full of people trying to get you to take a segway ride and some very strange performers doing statues\u2026 the baby one was very disconcerting. Please don't restrict your trip to Prague with this area as you only have to go down a few back streets to find some beautiful places without the distraction of tourist luring! I can't deny the buildings are beautiful though!"

At top you have an amazing view over Prague and especially the old City Center. The astronomic clock on the other side itselft Looks also very interesting but too wait for the hourly Event is not really worth it."

Stretch your legs (or use the elevator) right to the top and see Prague from above. It's a sight not to miss. That ticket your bought for the tower? Keep it! It gives you a discount on a guided tour of the town hall. Alow the knowledgeable guide to take you through the many halls inside and see the paintings, statues and even the underground of this fascinating old building. A must see on your trip to Prague!P.s.

The Old Town Hall actually has quite a fascinating history that you can learn all about as you walk the ramps up the Old Town Hall Tower.The tower itself has a great view, but can get very crowded at prime times especially since the passage at the top is very narrow. I would recommend going mid-morning or mid-afternoon to get a great view of the Old Town with still a lot of people around the city, but not necessarily in the tower. Enjoy the view!"

Make sure to take the tour of the birds view of Prague it's beautiful.. a lift takes you right to the top where you can walk outside and see different parts of the city.. also if you don't like the idea of a lift you can walk up a ramp right to the top with different parts of history info on the walls, definitely recommend this"

The Astronomical clock is a national treasure of the Czech Republic, but it is literally just a fancy clock outside that opens its windows to show you the 12 Apostles when it chimes on the hour. It's free to access, and you can also climb to the top. It's beautiful and a great place to snap a picture, but don't expect it to be more than a clock."

As a piece it is interesting to know but the actual hour chime is quite the anticlimax. However I would highly recommend the tour to top of the tower. It's a beautiful view. We went at sunset and it was snowing so got some gorgeous photos. We went at the end of our trip so could point out and look for all the places we had been over the past few days. I have a extreme fear of heights and falling so it is always hard climbing towers however I still recommend. If you really struggle there is an elevator to the top but the walk up there is a series of ramps. Not stairs. It's a long way up but the information on the walls in the way up shouldn't be missed. Oh also, be prepared for a small steel spiral staircase at the top. Anyone with height fears will know how it feels when you get taken off guard when you are facing your fears. But just do it. You only live once."

Fun and quirky, with the 12 apostles appearing in little doorways and miniature statues moving, the hourly performance is over within a couple of minutes, and if you're taking lots of photos, you might well miss some of it and have to return, like we did, several times! The Old Town Hall, despite being a payable attraction, attracts lots of visitors too, so you have to plan your visit inside for the quieter times. In our case, we went up the Tower early one evening, which, being dark December, meant no distant vistas across the city, but, on the plus side, excellent views of the Christmas Market in the square below, and the beautifully lit up old buildings. Great for night time shots of the city. The history of the building and the clock is explained on info boards on the staircase walls, and they are exceptionally helpful in picturing the building's history. The before and after war images of the Town Hall and clock are very enlightening, esp if you didn't have time for pre-holiday historical research. The modern lift is an interesting piece of technology itself, though rather small, I'm guessing, for the summer crowds. The whole building, Tower and Clock, shouldn't be missed when visiting Prague!"

If possible, try to visit the astronomical clock early in the morning before the sea of tourists flood the square (because they will). It was wonderful being in front of the clock in the morning before all of the tourists emerged from the warmth of their hotels. Since we were in front of the clock early in the morning (it wasn't even that early - it was just a little after 9 am), we were able to take unobstructed views of and with the famed Astronomical Clock that was first constructed in the 15th century. Just an hour later, the swarm of tourists would have prevented that from being possible. We also enjoyed our visit to the astronomical clock in the evening. It was beautiful and looked as if it were glowing.The Astronomical Clock, which has been one of Prague's greatest treasures for 600 years, is located in the heart of the Old Town Square surrounded by exquisite historic and romantic buildings and is mounted on the wall of Prague's Old Town City Hall. During the Christmas season, the magical aura of the square surrounding the clock was intensified by the kiosks of Christmas markets that were lined up in the middle of the square. The kiosks sold all kinds of goodies, including souvenirs, trinkets, baked pastries and other baked desserts that emanated sugary flavors into the air as we walked by, candies, chocolate, hot mulled wine, and other yummies.The medieval clock does not display the time of the day. The clock had two dials: a calendar dial and an astronomical dial. The outer circle of the calendar dial describes each day of the year while the astronomical dial demonstrates how the universe was perceived 600 years prior with the earth at the center. It displayed the phases of the moon and the equinoxes. Each hour, the twelve apostles emerge two windows and nod to the swarm of tourists below."

It announces every hour with 12 apostles passing by the window above the astronomical dial and with symbolic sculptures moving aside. That makes it a popular tourist attraction.Legend about clockmaster Hanus:The origin of the Astronomical Clock was misrepresented for centuries. It was believed, that the author was clockmaster Hanus, also called Jan of Ruze, who lived in the 15 th century. The story said that the clock was admired by many foreigners, but Hanus refused to show construction plans to anybody. When Prague Councillors found out that he was going to make another, even better clock, they became jealous and blinded him so he could not finish it. Later he allegedly damaged the astronomical clock in revenge, and nobody was able to repair it.Real history of the Astronomical Clock:The real author of the clock was discovered in 1961 in an old document, which describes the astronomical dial and says it was made by Mikulas of Kadan in 1410. He probably cooperated with the astronomer and Charles University professor Jan Sindel. The Astronomical Clock was repaired and improved by Jan Taborsky in the 16 th century. However, it became very faulty as time went by, and it was mostly out of order. It was even considered whether it should be liquidated in the 1780s. The clock soon stopped working for a long time. The major repair was inevitable and it came in 1865. The clock was modernized and a new Calendar Dial was painted by Josef Manes. In 1945 the German army damaged the Astronomical Clock and some of the statues burned. They were replaced by replicas later, and the striking of the clock was changed from the Old Czech Time to the Central European Time. The Astronomical Clock consists of the windows with apostles at the top, the Astronomical Dial, which is the oldest part, the Calendar Dial underneath and various sculptures around."

It is a perfect spot to take a break and sit down in one of the outdoor cafes and watch people while you rest and sip something hot during the winter in one of the glasshouse type gas heated cafes, Some even provide blankets on the chairs! We visited during Christmas so the square was filled with kiosks of the Christmas Market offering hot mulled wine, sausages of all kinds, chocolate, candy, bakery, souvenirs, artisan's ware, general crafts usually involving bohemian glass, so it was a definite bonus. Beware because on special days like New Year's Eve (Sylvester for them) it becomes a swarming sea of people, multiple tours of 20 plus people and annoying tourists blocking the way while they take selfies with the extension sticks. Despite all this, it is the heart of Prague and worth visiting and spending some time there going up the Astronomical Clock Tower to take in magnificent views of the city or just spending time there, hanging about and getting a feel of this vibrant city."

You should be careful and look after your belongings here. I stood in the back just in front of one of the cafes where there were slightly less people and I felt more comfortable. When the clock struck 7 pm, the show began. You need to read your guide book to understand in detail what is happening (I recommend the Rick Steves guidebook) but it was a lot of fun to watch. I videotaped the whole thing with my iPhone. It lasted about one minute. The crowd was a little slow in dispersing so you have to be patient. I returned here on my last morning in Prague and watched it again. Same crowd and I took the same strategic position near the cafes in the back. For some reason, the show only lasted 40 seconds this time. Anyway, this is a must see during your visit to Prague."

Czechoslovakia, as it was, must be one of the most historical places in Europe and the Astronomical Clock is one of its most famous attractions. It is now just over six hundred years old and. as such, is the third oldest such device in the world. It says much for the mathematical skills of our forebears that they realised that the positions of the planets in our solar system could be predicted centuries or even millennia ahead.There is a display every hour on the hour which draws huge crowds and lasts for over a minute if you wait for every stroke of the noon performance. If you want to photograph the whole event, and hundreds do, my advice is the watch it once and then do the videography an hour later. This is to find out which parts of the clock are animated which you might miss if you are not prepared.There is a tower there which you can mount and from which there are outstanding views of the town. That is a crowded attraction as well despite the fact that it incurs a fee. What is free is a view of the vast number of Segways which frequent the area (and a number of others in Prague). They could be a danger but I did not see any collisions and the skill of the more experience riders is worth seeing. It's a pity our namby pamby government in the UK won't allow their use in public places. In Germany they are authorised with their own number plates as actual vehicles and are probably the best way to see Berlin. Wake up UK! At the time of writing this we are less than a week away from 2016. Time to get modern."

Whilst everyone is watching that (I recorded it... took 1 minute, 33 seconds, and my phone couldn't even see what was happening) go up the Clock Tower where you can view out over the Old Town Square and across some of the city. Beautiful views and where we went at Christmas time was very pretty with the lights and looking at the markets down below. Makes for some great scenic pictures and a good ol selfie! Very cheap to go up. Can walk up. There is a lift to the level of where the clock tower starts or alternatively can take the stairs if your not a lazy unfit cow like me. As for going up the tower, again there is a lift that shoots straight up the middle. If you didn't wish to take the lift, its a gentle slope going round and up with a slight incline, so better than stairs. I did the lift up and walked down as there are some little windows you can stop and peer out of for more lovely views and picture memories! Enjoy!"

We were walking around Old Town Square and decided to do the tower since we noticed people were taking pictures from the top. We also happened to be 10 minutes from the top of the hour so decided to wait and see the clock move. It was cool, but you're not missing much if you don't see it. The tower is the best part because the views from the top are amazing! It was not busy when we went, and we took the elevators up and down without having to wait in any lines. Roughly $5 to go up, so not expensive at all."

It is a clock that still works from the Middle Ages and the third oldest astronomical clock that still works. The clock strikes on the hour with the apostles and also it has the zodiac signs and the world famous skeleton chasing time. It reminds me of a Hugh cuckoo Clock. The tower is available to climb to the top. You can get some wonderful views of Prague. You do have to pay for this but on a clear day it is worthwhile. Again bring you comfortable shoes. There are shops and eateries around which are great especially After you experience the beautiful views."

            "review": "A little explanation of how the clock works. The astronomical clock is one of the coolest things here in Prague and what's even cooler is that you can spend about half an hour reading up about it and understand a lot of how it works, and once you do that you would appreciate it a million times more than what you would without understanding it. So, here goes a brief and hopefully easy explanation from what I've learned. First, an astronomical clock is a generic term used for a clock that tells you about the sun, moon etc. in addition to the time. What's amazing about this is that when this clock was made about 600 years ago people used to think that earth is at the center and the sun and moon revolve around it, so if you see the top dial called the astrolabe, you'll see a blue background which is the earth and on top of that there is an arm with the sun on it and another one with the moon on it. Look at the sun first, and you'll see it is in one of the signs in the inner dial. These twelve signs represent the sign of the zodiac and they are the same signs that we use today and you can Google up which image represents what sign. I was lucky in that we went in December which is my birth month, I'm Sagittarius and the sun was in the Sagittarius sign, so cool! Now, look at the other hand, that's the moon. That also falls in one of the zodiac signs, you can Google up to see where the moon is when you go and then find the moon in the same sign when you visit. The second cool thing you can see about the moon is that this clock shows you which phase the moon is in! When we went it was almost a full moon so most of the moon is white, and only a little part at the bottom is dark. I think the half moon would look so cool on this. The third thing it shows about the moon is its relative position to the sun. Now let's go to the time. Look for the golden hand and where it is on the dial with the Roman numerals. This is the common civil time which is almost the same as we tell time. Our clocks just have twelve numbers and this one has twelve numbers repeated twice, but if you go at 8, the hand should be around VIII so you should be able to read this immediately. The hand with the star tells you the sidereal time which is a bit complicated and I didn't quite understand it. Now, to the lower dial which is called M\u00e1ne\u015b calender plate. Here, you see twelve paintings which represent the twelve months of the year. In January a child is born, February, farmer warms his feet by the fire etc.\u00a0 You can Google all the paintings and then check it out on the clock, it's very wonderful. Inside of it shows another zodiac sign which is a different design from the top and quite beautiful as well. Now for the simple stuff. At the stroke of every hour, the twelve apostles show up in a procession on the two windows at the top. This is a big crowd puller but I'd say this is quite underwhelming for most people who don't really know what to expect. The real beauty of the clock is in the other things that I described earlier in my opinion. There are four sculptures which represent four negative things. Left most is vanity depicted by a man looking at his mirror, to his left is a miser holding a bag of gold, then comes death which is a skeleton and lastly there's a guy who represents lust, but I'm not sure how he's doing that. At the bottom are four positive things: philosopher, angel, astronomer and chronicler. There's a rooster at the top of the clock as well but God knows what he's up to. Phew, that was long. I have touched upon all the major things that I found really fascinating and easy to understand about this clock. I hope this will add to how much you appreciate it and enjoy it!"

The crowds, lines, and overall buzz around the clock is too much for someone who can risk visiting it \"next time\". It offers a beautiful and unique view at night and we were able to sit upstairs for about 10-15 minutes due to the low attendance. Summer is going to be a headache, but I highly suggest spending the roughly \u20ac10 for two people to ascend the tower and peak out! We held our baby the entire time and left our stroller at the bottom where it was watched by the cashiers. A little freaky getting to the edge with her, but all in all safe and doable!"

Because it had to be rebuilt after wartime destruction, it actually has a lift! However, there are conventional steps, an interior ramp way and very tight spiral staircase if you fancy more of the medieval experience! I tried both! The walkway also has photos and info about the history of the tower and astronomic clock. From the top, you enjoy a 360 degree panoramic view of Prague and the surrounding hills. The balcony can be a squeeze with all the selfie sticks but it's worth it, especially with the Christmas tree, etc, in the square below. If the weather's bad, you can enjoy the panorama through clear glass. Highly recommended!"

Everyone can watch the spectacule of the astronomical clock from the Square which happens at every hour on the hour, when the figures flanking the clock are set in motion. Honestly, I was a bit disapointed, everyone was like \"go see the clock working, you have to go!\", and then it was just like one figure ringing a bell for like 1 minute, and the others spinning around. It was fun, and you should see it, but don't expect a magical show. Went to visit the tower inside, very cool to climb to the top. It's a good climb, but it has an elevator too :) For me it was only worth it for the amazing view of the city from above, but if you went to other places where you can see the city in the same way, like the Astronomical Tower in the Klementinum, the view it's similar, or even better, so it may not be worth the ticket."

And there is a very interesting story behind it (I am not going to spoil it for everyone). All I will say is please check this out if you're in Prague. You also have the option of going to the top of the tower for a few korunas (maybe 250 kournas). You get a really great view of the city from there. Also, given that it's in the main square, you have plenty of things to do after this. Don't miss the hot dogs that the street vendor's serve around the corner. Best hot dogs I've ever eaten and it only cost's like 100 korunas."

You can by a book for 100kpk (about \u00a32.50) which explains all the workings - book is available in many languages. It is a must see when in Prague and am glad we did."

Every xx:00 hours tons of people would wait in front of the clock, and the bell will ring plus the statues from inside the clock tower will come out and give a little one-minute show. Honestly saying, the mini show wasn't impressive, but since I'm in Prague, why not come and see.The more interesting part is the inside of the Old Town Hall. I entered from the information center; it's connected. There's an elevator so it's disabled-friendly. Floor 1 is takes you to the town hall history if I'm not mistaken, but I wasn't interested. I went to the top of the tower to see a bird's eye view of below, Church of Our Lady before Tyn, St. Nicholas' Church, Prague Castle and Parizska street. Ticket costs CZK 120 for adults. I'll say both daytime or nighttime is fine to go up and see some of Prague from up there, but to take pictures, daytime's still better any day.Once you have bought the ticket, you can either walk your way up and read the history of Prague's legendary Astronomical Clock, or take the elevator. Once up, you can go outside and walk around. It's a one-way passage and it's pretty scary up there. There were explanation boards but I don't remember everything; it has the churches and Prague Castle but others I can't remember.You can also pick your own souvenir; a little commemoration of you coming all the way up. One machine is the simple souvenir machine: you pay and pick which one you want. The other one requires some effort; you spin until you reach the souvenir you want, take a token (it's provided next to the machine) and CZK 20 or 40 (I just remember it's very cheap), push both coin and token to the machine and then spin the lever until the souvenir pops out. Spinning the lever will be easy at first but it gets heavy in the middle until right before the souvenir pops out.If you go to the clock, make sure to come inside!They even have a special souvenir: (replica) pocket watch! They only sell it here and in Prague Castle Area V (Torture Museum). The small one costs 14 Euros and the big one 28 or 38. Go buy the small one to reminisce your trip to the Astronomical Clock :) it's cheaper to buy here than other souvenir stores."

The pagan Turk, the omnipresent moneylender Jew(cosmetically altered after WWII),vanity, greed and on the lower part, historian, philosopher, angel and astronomer will keep you company. Go the crepusculum time (Twilight) and you will see it lighted which is better.Beware: This place is extremely popular, even in winter time and it gathers thousands of tourists. The guy that offers you a better exchange rate are going to fill you with worthless old Bulgarian Levas. Pick pockets work this area 7/24. So before this mouth opening, jaw dropping awe you feel seeing the clock take care of your wallet or your friendly pick pocket will do it for you. The cafes around the square have the most horrible, undrinkable, most expensive coffee in Prague. Don't order water, say tap water or you will be served a small Evian bottle for 5 Euros a bottle.

It will give you just enough time to grab a hot mulled wine and a pastry treat from a local stand and get a good spot for the show. The 'show' occurs on the hour and lasts a minute or so, consisting of all of the original mechanical workings of the clock moving and dancing around. I'd recommend going on a free walking tour (specifically the HostelCulture one) to find out the history of the clock which makes you appreciate the show even more.As per any busy tourist area, pick pockets apparently operate here so be careful - especially when your eyes are glued to the clock because you don't want to miss it! I didn't have any trouble but just keep alert and enjoy the show.TOP TIP - Ladies... do NOT bring high heels to Prague. It's unavoidable to be around cobbled pavements about 90% of your trip. Because of this, hardly any women wear heels so you won't stand out. Don't ruin your trip trying to look good as you will injure yourself and will frankly look pretty silly trying to walk."

The views of the old town square, Kostel Matky Bo\u017e\u00ed p\u0159ed T\u00fdnem, and the castle are some of the best in the city. This was my kid's favorite attraction in Prague."

There are lots of restarants here and streets leading off everywhere. Such a lovely centre."

Got to know the building in two attempts - the first one was to see the clock and its show on the evening I arrived to Prague, and the other was the guided tour next morning. The clock show itself did not change much in my childhood memories of it when after twenty minutes of waiting for the show, it turned out to be what it is. :) Well, unlike back then I am now able to value its artistic and technical qualities, not just the show, so together during my 1.5 days Prague visit I stopped by and waited couple of minutes for it three times. The tower, in turn, was quite a nice visit and, if only physically able, do not take the elevator, but go up the stairs - then by the time you get to the top you will know the history of the tower and its adjacent building from the panels on your way. The nightview from the top was great too and there are also pointers what to pay attention to in the panorama and why. But from all the things I preferred the guided tour most - I went for 9.30AM English one, that ended up to be for me and another couple. We got a really good, kind, friendly guide, ready to tell, explain and, as he commented \"due to the small size of our group\" let us go some places that are otherwise behind those red ropes of \"no go here\"."

The trip to the top of the clock tower is worthwhile for great views across the city, though it can be very busy even in low season. The show when the clock strikes though is very underwhelming and disappointing, I can't quite believe such crowds flock to see it. Be aware also that the cafes overlooking the square charge an inflated cover charge and two coffees can cost in excess of \u00a310! Also be aware of the food venders that quote prices per 100g, you think the price quoted is very reasonable but it can cost you many times more."

It is definitely worth seeing, but for us, it was a bit anti-climactic. We needed to keep reminding ourselves that it was an engineering marvel.

Although it was busy at the top of the tower with tourists too it was nice to get away from the crowds and see the city from up high. 360 degree view once outside with great photo opportunities! Walk up or down the tower (instead of taking the elevator) in order to see historical photos and corresponding information related to the town hall and astronomical clock. To be honest the astronomical clock 'show' that happens on the hour is interesting but I wouldn't go out of your way to see it as it was a little lack luster, but if you are nearby on the hour then definitely check it out. Essentially, the doors open and the 12 apostles pop their heads out (like a cuckoo) and the 4 men on the sides of the clock wiggle (including the skeleton, aka 'death'). But the astronomical part of the clock itself does not move during the hourly clock 'show'."

You will definitelly enjoy this unique clock mechanism that recently celebrated 600 years. Find some legends about astronomical clock before you see it, you will find it even more magic.Short version:Based on the legend Master Hanu\u0161 was chosen by the councillors of Prague to construct a unique time measuring device at Starom\u011bstsk\u00e1 radnice that would have many other functions besides measuring time. Hanu\u0161 did what he had promised. After he had introduced his perfect machine to the councillors they got scared. They wanted the machine to stay unique and they worried that the clockmaker could make a similar machine for another town. So they were thinking how to get rid of him. One night a group of people broke into the master\u00b4s house and they blinded him with a piece of iron. Hanu\u0161 knew very well who was behind that and therefore he asked one of his pupils to accompany him to the very heart of the astronomical clock. The pupil did what he was told and Hanu\u0161, despite his blindness, stopped the clockwork. Based on the legend it took more than a century before the astronomical clock was in operation again.

It included a trip to the top of the tower to take in the sights as well as a tour within the facilities, seeing the apostles rom the other side as well as some great state rooms.Then we went underground through the several rooms. Granted, the guides English wasn't great but it didn't matter. The tour lasted 80 minutes and was heaps better than the other 400 Krowns tour I did earlier in the day.And there were only 3 of us doing try tour! Fantastic!"

The guide gave us a very good overview of the history and how one section was burned when the Germans left. I really enjoyed going down into the cellar to the old medieval dwellings. After dark it gave the whole place a slightly spooky atmosphere, I felt. It was quite amazing to be in a place where people had lived so many years ago.

We found the hall and clock area were less crowded later at night (after 9) and early in the morning (8 or 9a, depending on the day of week). If you are trying to get the perfect shot, this is the best time to go. As it got closer to mid-day, the crowds got larger and more people were posing with the clock (even brides and grooms and they would be there for long periods of time!). Don't miss out on see the 27 crosses at the base of the tower. They are located on the ground near the small park with trees facing the square. They are a memorial for the Protestant nobles, merchants & intellects were beheaded in 1621 after the Battle of White Mountain."

This ended up being one of my favorite things we did that day! The walk to the top of the tower is full of plaques & pictures detailing the history of the clock & it's unique features. For those not able to climb the tower, a lift is available. Once we made it to the top there was a 360 degree incredible view of the city. We went at night, which was stunning. I'd go again during the day just to be able to make out the various city landmarks with more clarity. After our experience inside the tower weren't down & were able to see the hourly show put on by the clicks working figurines on the front facade. I highly recommend taking some time in Prague to have the full clock tower experience rather than just a walk-by...it's worth it!"

And then the motion of the statues, the crowing of cocks. The downside is that the crowds are always something to behold when the clock strikes the hour.

It really enhanced our whole stay in Prague.My only word of caution is it is very busy at the top with very little space-it does feel that they should restrict it more/allocate time slots. We entered the clock tower just after watching the Astronomical Clocks 2pm display and walked back out the door just as it struck 3pm- longer than we'd expected to enjoy it for and offering great value for money."

The tour is wonderfully informative. While the astronomical clock is beautiful and interesting, the hourly show of the figures in clock appearing lasts about for a very short time and it is difficult to see more than the outlines of the rotating figures.

Every hour a huge crowd gathers around to see the show that the clock puts on (and try to make sure their wallets are held onto as pickpockets circulate). The real attraction is to ascend the tower and get the best view of the old section of Prague. You'll take a modern elevator in an adjoining building up a few stories to get to the entrance. Once inside the tower, you can take a small, circular elevator to the top if you have trouble walking (or a touch of vertigo). Otherwise, you can walk up a spiraling walkway that has a series of photographs of Prague and other exhibits that are worth the price of admission alone. At the end of the ramp, there is a steep spiral staircase that doesn't have enough room for people going up and down simultaneously. Be sure to use the light as a signal or you can spend a long time waiting for people going in the opposite direction during crowded times. Up top, you have a narrow balcony with 360\u00b0 views of the old city. Signs tell you to proceed around in a counter-clockwise direction, but some tourists (mostly Asians for some reason) insist in going the opposite way, and getting past one another is very difficult. The views on a clear day are well worth the bother."

The tower can give you a panoramic view of the red roofs of Prague and beyond if the weather is clear so it is worth the effort (use the stairs). The clock is a disappointment as its celebrated movement is muted to say the least. You will be much better off learning about the clock, its creation, meaning, operation and what happened to its designer. If you do stay to see its operation be prepared for heavy crowds and have your pictures photobombed with selfie sticks."

The square in front of the clock is crowded all day but particularly as the hour (every hour) approaches. There are cafes near to the clock, to wait but sitting too near can obscure the view as latecomers stand in front of you to view the chiming. In truth the chiming is not spectacular, but given the history of the clock is remarkable and always draws a round of applause.We paid our fee (we paid 140 Czk for senior citizen tickets) at the base of the tower and then went into the Town Hall to take a lift up. There is a second lift to go up almost to the top but we walked up a winding gallery and steps reading the historical descriptions as we went. The final spiral staircase takes you up to the viewing gallery, which is narrow and when we were there very crowded. The view is worthwhile."

There were so many people standing around that it was difficult to get through the throng to get to the other side of the square. Go in the morning so you can get closer to the clock for better pictures. At times the crowds are so large during mid-day and in the afternoon (this was in mid September), that it is impossible to get a good close photo of the clock unless you have a good telephoto lens on your camera. If you want a close look at the clock go in the early morning and then in the afternoon you can sit at one of the near cafes and people watch."

People - throngs of tourists, to be exact - gather at the front of the building at the top of the hour to watch the clock chime and a number of statues come out. For the sheer experience and to mingle and \"chime in\" with the crowd, it is worth the experience watching it. There are numerous restaurants in the vicinity to pass time, if you feel like hanging out for a little bit more."

The views from St. Vitus Cathedral and the Charles Bridge Tower were definitely better than the Old Town Hall Tower \u2013 you could see more of the city from the first two options. However, the Old Town Hall Tower does have two things going for it: (1) While you walk up the inclines to the top of the tower (no stairs), there is an outstanding pictorial history of the tower, the role it played during WWII and the damage it received during that war; (2) You can take an elevator all the way to the top. So, for those individuals who don\u2019t have the mobility (or desire) to climb hundreds of stairs to the top of St. Vitus or the Charles Bridge, you can still get a pretty decent view over the old town rooftops by stopping here. If you chose this route, make sure you walk on the inclines on the way down so that you can read about the history of the tower.The clock outside is definitely worth a (brief) look."

That thing is some 500 years old and back then both technology and people-amazement-level were much different. It has a bell, some figures that move, some doors that open and close -and, that's it !!! 2. The true beauty is the tower itself. It was inside totattly rebuilt. 3. Three elevators and a long ramp make the climb super easy. With many interesting historical info-photos on the walls, I recommend taking the ramp.4. The view is amzing. While you might see farther on top of the Vitus cathedral and Petrin tower, here you can see more of the inside Prague downtown.5. Take time to watch people, segways, and performers on the Old Town square. 6. Often, there are tons of people on the tower and it gets crammed. Watch your pockets, bags, and walltets. Also hold on to your camera. A lady next to me, pushed on accident a guy and his fancy camera nearly fell off the tower.7. I recommend going twice (or more): once during the day and once at night8. Consider combining your visit(s) with the Prague Card. If you have an airport transfer, it likely pays off for you9. Look at the mass of other tourists on the day you visit, try to plan your trip around the time when \"everybody else\" visits"

I would not waste my time waiting for the hour to strike. Just look at the click, enjoy the beauty, read the literature and go elsewhere."

I only have one on my watch :-) The work on the big 2 clocks is exquisite. Too bad that the statues have protective wires around them. I guess the pigeons liked them too much. It is an intersting piece, but not the only astronomical clock in the world! There is for instance one in Lier, Belgium, not as old as the one in Prague; but also an ingenious piece of work. The one in Prague dates from the 15th century. That makes it probably the oldest one in the world.Anyhow, most tourists come for the procession of apostles. Once every hour little doors open up above in the tower and you can see them passing by. Be there on time (or come at an early hour) as a lot of people seem to come only for them. I went twice ;-), once to see it (I wasn't much impressed) and once to make a picture of the people watching. That was fun.So, if you're over there, don't miss the clock and have a look at the others around to while watching the parade of apostles."

On the hour there is a presentation of statues of the Apostles at the doorways above the clock, with all twelve presented at noon. In 1870 a calendar display was added below the clock. A golden rooster also makes an appearance. It's historical, complex and a little mind-boggling.During World War II the clock was nearly destroyed by Nazi fire.

At a certain time of the day, there's something that comes out (sorry i forgot what). something like a cuckoo clock that tells you it's a certain hour of the day already."

There is also an interesting old clock at the base of the tower."

Very crowed after 10 in the morning, you will need to stand and watch this clock more then once to catch the action. I think sitting at the restaurant and getting food and drinks might not be a bad idea. You need to catch a tour and the tower. All tours in your language is not all the time. English maybe three times a day. The night tour 8 pm was worth the money. Same price as the day tour. Less crowded. Pictures from the top of the tower are great again, you might want to do the tower in the day and the night."

From this location you can walk to the Charles Bridge and other sites. The restaurant \"El Toro Negro\" has wonderful food and if you sit at the end of the patio you are in a perfect spot to watch the clock strike the hour. Between 9am and 5pm a couple of the statues move and panels open up for saints to be seen. I highly recommend paying the very small fee to walk to the top of the clock tower and take in the view. Recommend you go late afternoon for the coolness and great time for picture taking! The area in front of the clock gets crowded so arrive early then stick around to listen to wonderful singers in the square and grab some ham, potatoes, sauerkraut and a beer from the outdoor vendors or visit one of the great restaurants. The area is full of life and things to do. There are often bubble blowers and jugglers in the area as well. Great for all ages."

So, I was adamant that we would be there to catch the performance of this iconic landmark in Prague. We got there early to get a good vantage point, and soon the square filled with thousands of other tourists waiting for the same thing. What a disappointment! We felt let down and definitely wish we hadn't wasted time waiting for a performance that just lasted a few minutes and wasn't that impressive. If you are nearby at the right time or have plenty of time to see all of the sights in Prague, by all means stop and watch, but don't give up time you could use for something else just to catch the clock move around."

Only problem is, it's easy to miss it if caught up inside a store or a few streets over jazz club but there are several hours in a day. Was able to be there two different times - both time, very crowded but if you go 15 minutes prior, you can get a pretty good spot to see the clock straight on which is important as you can't really see the figures if you are too close as they stay within the clock. Regardless, the clock itself is quite impressive and the whole mechanics behind it is as well. Saw it at 6 pm and another night at 10 pm. We had been warned to watch for pickpockets which would be easy with the crowd but fortunately we did not experience that and enjoyed seeing people have a good time. Did not go to the top, didn't even realize it but glad to have seen the Clock -- not many in the world."

Seeing it at 9 or 10am in the high season is stress-free, but 11am to 3pm it is not even standing room anywhere straight in front of the clock, which is where you need to be to see the moving apostles when the clock doors open - they do not come outside the clock.The view from the top of the tower is worth seeing as it not only gives you another perspective on the square, but the tangled mess of rooves around the square emphasises the narrow twisted streets you experience on the ground. The elevator takes you right to the top. Again, go early or late to avoid the crowds."

For a fee you can climb to the top or take a lift which is wheelchair accessible for a spectacular view of the city.

The Prague astronomical clock, or Prague orloj (in Czech: Pra\u017esk\u00fd orloj), is a medieval astronomical clock located in Prague, at Old Town Square. We walk around several times in month. The story says that the clock was first installed in 1410, making it the third-oldest astronomical clock in the world and the oldest one still working.The clock mechanism itself is composed of three main components: the astronomical dial, representing the position of the Sun and Moon in the sky and displaying various astronomical details; \"The Walk of the Apostles\", a clockwork hourly show of figures of the Apostles and other moving sculptures\u2014notably a figure of Death (represented by a skeleton) striking the time; and a calendar dial with medallions representing the months. A legend, has it that the initial clock-maker Hanus was blinded on the order of the Prague Councillors so that he could not repeat his work; in turn, he broke down the clock, and no one was able to repair it for the next hundred years. Every hour on the hour there are hundreds of tourist taking movies and photographs of this medieval miracle."

There are figures at the front that represent vanity, greed, death and pleasure. On the hour, every hour, the figure that represents death rings it's bell and the other three shake their heads symbolizing there unreadiness to depart.

To start with the clock is stunning, there are not many example of these anywhere in the world, but the game it has for when it strikes the hour is that you will be inundated with crowds. Do go and see it chime and watch the parade of the apostles, but beware the whole thing lasts about 30 seconds. You will need to be there about 10 minutes before the hour to get a good spot.We also went up the tower, don't be put off by the height as it is a very easy walk and is in fact a ramp most of the way and also a lift if you are that way inclined. The view from the top is stunning and there is a very good illustration of the towers history as you walk up including the incredible damage done during the nazi occupation and also the subsequent restoration. Finally pay for the visit with the tour as it includes a visit to the clock which they don't tell you, and if you don't pay if upfront it works out very expensive.I would recommend a visit."

On the hour it gathers a lot of people to have a look at it and although it isn't anything firework like it is still very nice to see. The tower at the town hall is really great. The views (I have written how beautiful the views are at 3 different locations in this city!! BUT THEY ARE :) ) are stunning. Watching over the square and just a great building."

Be sure to buy the \"Prague card\" for as many days as you plan to stay in Prague if you intend to visit most tourist places. It is worth it! It will make your transportation around the city stress free and it entitles you with several free entrances to most interesting places such as this one(old town hall and astronomical clock).You can take the elevator to reach the tower top and enjoy the beautiful view of the whole city. You will take some of your best photos from up there! On the way down do remember to take the guided tour in the \"hidden\" underground internal of the tower. You will understand a lot more than you will read in any written guide and you will experience the atmosphere of previous centuries in the well preserved remains and paintings.For sure a must do during your visit to Prague!"

The hourly show of the workings of the clock is interesting, but a big disappointment if you haven't researched the why behind what it's doing. The look on most people's faces after the brief display (that seems to start during the minute before the hour) is one of disappointment, \"is that it\". I would advice to read up on the history of the clock and some of the smaller animations that are happening (hard to see unless your fight under the clock and the two on the left are missing right now) which makes it much more interesting. Also take a look at the white X's on the ground facing the square and learn about their history. Also the astrological components of the clock are amazing considering all that is being displayed and the accuracy involved. Very cool sight, just read up on it or risk \"is that it\"."

I can recommend this since it's the only way to see the rest of the hall, but unfortunately the tour guides English was of sporadic quality, and she was very quiet, but she did try and answer all questions thrown at her.

We had expected a mechanical performance in the style of Munich\u2019s Glockenspiel, but all that happened was that a skeleton rang a mournful-sounding bell and then the clock struck five times.

One of the main attractions in all of Prague is the Astronomical Clock at the Old Town Square.This medieval clock might not be as famous as Big Ben, but it has so much more to offer.During daylight hours, at the top of every hour is more than just the typical ringing of the bells. While the bells ring there is a related show that tells a story. I'm not going to tell you the whole 'story' here, because I think you should have a tour guide tell it to you while you are there observing it. But you will see a parade of the Twelve Apostles. You see a reaction of Three Vices and Death.And there is more that the clock does on a functional basis then its artistic show that they can tell you about.With such a wonderfully made clock that was impressive both in its day and now, you have to be curious about it's magnificent creator. And the story involving the clock's creator is just as amazing as the clock itself.Take a tour or read about the clock in the guide, and get there at least twenty minutes early so you can get a good viewpoint as the crowds fill in to watch the show at the top of the hour."

The clock dates from the 1400's and has been rebuilt and improved many times over the years. On the hour, crowds gather under the clock to witness the \"parade\" of the Apostles who do a little parade through opened windows above the clock face. It's a fairly simple event, but it is pleasing to watch what the old master clock builders created to entertain and inform the populace. The clock is surrounded by restaurants and is adjacent to the large Old Town Square where many people congregate in the evening, to sit, to stroll, to talk, to enjoy. We much enjoyed our visits to this area."

Consisting of windows with apostles at the top, an astronomical dial, which is the oldest part, and a calendar dial beneath with various sculptures. It provides us with a amusing exhibition every hour I like the skeleton. Legend tells of the master clock maker Hanus who was reputed to have built the clock refusing to show construction plans to anybody. When Prague Councillors found out that he was going to make another, even better clock, they became jealous and blinded him so he could not finish it. We now know this is not the correct version and that the original clock did not work well for a long time. In recent time the legend continues when on the 21st of June if the clock stops it is a sign of something terrible will happen. It was considered to remove it many centuries ago! I and I would say millions more are grateful they didn't also the Czech people of today as it is a wonderful free landmark that everyone visits more than once during their stay in Prague."

You will quickly discover that the hourly chiming of the Astronomical Clock is a special treat, as thousands stop what they are doing and gaze skyward to see and listen to this treat. If you are lucky, you will also here someone at the top of the tower play their trumpet! As cool as this is from the ground, every visitor to Prague owes it to themselves to pay the small admission fee and venture up to the top of the tower at some point. During the day, you will be blown away by the beauty of the Prague rooftops and extended landscape. Plan to be there at the top of the hour and have a who new perspective as you see the crowd looking up at you! It is also pretty cool to stand next to the guy playing the trumpet! This is one of the best views in Prague and well worth the price of admission!"

The clock displays many interesting information. The dial with the sun and hand shows the present time on the Roman letters (Central European Time, not taking daylight savings time into account), the ancient Czech time on the outermost circle (its first hour starts at sunset, so it moves around) and the Babylonian time with the Arabic numerals (a 12-hour day, divided between the time when the sun is up). The little star on the other side of the dial shows the so-called \"sidereal\" time. The \"sun\" displays the current zodiac sign on the inner wheel. If that would not be enough, the little moon gives information on the current moon phase (full or half for instance), and the background of the clock indicates whether it is dawn, day, dusk or night according to the sun's position. Wonderful! Interestingly, this is the oldest working astronomical clock in the world, and only one which can measure the Babylonian time."

It gets VERY busy around the clock with lots of crowds and we were warned against pickpockets (Especially if you had your hands up to take a picture!) Maybe try to see this early in the morning, as when we were in the square around 9ish (On a Friday) there wasn't anywhere near the crowds we saw later around 4 when we went up the tower. We paid the small entrance fee to go up the tower and it was definitely worth it. There was a bit of a queue and it was slightly confusing where to go and saw a number of people turned away for not having bought a ticket first. (You have to buy a ticket in the ticket office just to the left of the clock and then go through the tourist information to the 3rd floor to enter)When we did get to go up the tower the descent was extremely easy as it was a slope, so very accessible. There is also a lift straight up to the top, but would recommend if able to to walk up as there are LOTS of information boards and pictures all the way showing the history of the tower. When up at the top it is a little crowded with lots of people trying to get the perfect picture at various view points. But you get an awesome panoramic view of the city. We really liked the information boards explaining what the key buildings you could see were. Having walked round the city throughout the day it was great to see it from another perspective. If like my partner you're not as good with heights the views are still spectacular without being right by the edge. Definitely worth a trip up."

I would recommend to take one of the FREE \u201cGood Prague Tours\u201d as they share with you a lot of detailed information about the clock. This is also a zodiac clock so it shows the zodiac signs and the bottom circle shows there is a name for each day. So in the old times, whoever was born on that day that was their name they were given. I\u2019d recommend going early in the morning before 8am to get a great picture in front of the clock with no one else around. I\u2019d also suggest to go up to the Old Town Hall Tower to experience the beautiful view of the square and the city. If you purchased the Prague Card the tower view is free. If you are looking for somewhere to eat, the U Prince Hotel is a great option as this is a very nice restaurant with a terrace that offers a 360 degree view of the city! The price is very reasonable as we ate pasta and salmon for only $35. If you don\u2019t want to eat there you can order just drinks or just go to the top and snap a picture! The terrace doesn\u2019t open until 11am and it\u2019s free if you just want to take a photo!"

We were there on a bright sunny day, and were able to walk around had get the 360 degree view. You will easily spend 40 minutes there. Do not be put off by the waiting line.

At the same time the 12 Apostles rotate through the windows, and the Golden Rooster at the top flaps his wings. Once you recall that the clock mechanism which runs all of this, and shows three types of time and the Zodiac on its beautiful dials, was crafted over 500 years ago and is still running accurately, you may appreciate the genius of Master Hanus.

Once you've seen it from the square, you MUST go up in the clock tower itself to get an amazing bird's eye view of not only the square, but of the city as well.Also, our tour of the town hall, including the basement and prison were so interesting.

Don't get me wrong this clock is pretty amazing from a history point of view and has a really interesting back story but the actual clock chiming on the hour is a bit of a let down. This is no disrespect to the clock or the history but possibly due to too many people writing 5 star reviews you expect more to happen. You are left afterwards thinking is that it? Considering when it was made and the fact it still works are marvels of engineering. We stayed opposite the clock and saw it many times from our window. I was hoping it would do something different each time I watched it but it was the same. Some people even clapped and cheered after it chimed. Not sure why as it was pretty unspectacular. Yes see if it your around but it is very busy and people will literally stand on your feet to get a better view and it is difficult getting a good view through all the phones and cameras. People need to enjoy the moment in real life instead of recording it. People don't realise that by recording the event they actually miss the real event and go home with a memento recording of something they didn't actually see for real."

The astronomical clock is in the main square, where there are also a lot of restaurants. (Note: Be VERY wary of the restaurants, they charge ridiculously expensive prices. Make sure you ask the waiter for all costs prior to ordering as they slug you with a bunch of unexpected costs at the end. They will keep leaving bread baskets or sauces on the table without being asked, make them take it away as it is not free.)The clock chimes every hour with characters around it moving. The tower is surrounded by tourists wanted to photograph or video it.It is really fun to watch.The tower and clock themselves are stunningly beautiful. If you like history, it is worth reading up on the legends relating to the clock before you see it as it adds another dimension to the experience. Just use google.Cost: Free"

This is where the crowds gather, the 1st time I went, we didn't know where everyone was going, so we just followed through some narrow streets, before we came out in the main square where the most popular Prague tourist attraction is, the wonderful Astronomical clock. It's a wonderful clock that chimes every hour, my favourite is when the Skeleton does his funny little shake at the end of chiming. Everyone gathers from about 1/4 to the hour in the summer time, to about 5 to the hour in the colder winter days (I've been both Summer & Winter, and it does get cold in the winter). So if you are thinking of sitting at one of the restaurants around the clock tower, remember the prices for a coffee will be treble the prices of anywhere else, but why not as it is \"Tourist Central\" location, so perhaps just have a drink and treat yourself. It's well worth just people watching."

The clock tracks the sun, the seasons and other stats which the clockmakers have added over centuries of time.

It's a miracle it survived the bombing in the area, and there are many legends about it, but beware: the whole \"march of the Apostles\" or whatever it's called takes about two seconds, so if you are messing around with your phone or your camera, you WILL miss it. However, you can watch it, so you get the hang of it, then wander around the wonderful Old Square, go to Our Lady Before Tyn, or have a refreshing beverage at one of the numerous cafes, then go back prepared to take the picture.Make sure you observe the really amazingly well-preserved little figurines around the clock - a little skeleton is the character that rings the bell, or at least wiggles a chain - always time for Death, eh? There are a couple of little Turks, and some wise-looking men. It really is a very cool thing to look at while waiting for the Apostles to come out, which, incidentally, they don't really do - they parade around inside the clock while you are hopefully looking at it right at that moment. But don't feel bad - if you go in high season, there will be a thousand other people looking confused along with you! But it's a must see, and you won't see another one like it any time soon."

I asked what it was about and found out that the clock does a performance on the hour. Waited and yes, there were moving figures for a few minutes. OK, been there, done that.Later, I did some research and found out that this clock was first made in 1410, and is the oldest one in Europe that is still working. (It was most recently renovated in 2015.) I could not figure out how to fully interpret it but the next time I saw it, I had a greater appreciation for the technology. And it really is quite attractive and colorful."

Since the stairways and elevator were small, we inched our way to the top. What was waiting for us was a most spectacular view of Prague!!! Below you'd find the red roofs of all houses and buildings in Prague and the mountains nearby. We were lucky we were among the first visitors, otherwise, it would have been very uncomfortable going around the small balcony to take shots of the 360 degree view.

The clock is over 600 years old, looks quite spectacular and if you are in Prague going to see it is one of the things expected to do, but if you miss it don't lose sleep over it.The area around the clock is extremely busy for at least 30 minutes before the top of the hour show. Best to grab an expensive beer near the clock and watch from there.Now I was not expecting a Cirque du Soleil performance, but it's a bit underwhelming and over rated.In saying that, go and see it and make up your own mind and watch out for the pickpockets."

That way you'll know which direction from Old Town the Castle Quarter is, New Town etc...

Try to be there for the striking of the hour as this is when the top doors open to reveal the figures inside but you had better be quick because they don't hang about and they only come out once an hour no matter what time is struck. You can also go to the top of the tower where you will get great views of the city. But it is free to watch and why not sit in one of the eateries opposite relax with a coffee and experience the atmosphere of the Old Town Square and watch a spectacular Time Piece marking Time."

But who wouldn't want to see this? Now please notice that though this is a tourist attraction, you really reallllly must read up on it before you just take a few quick pictures in front of it. The history and story of it is amazing. Take a closer look at the clock and notice all of the names?! Read the history. It's a fascinating clock that I take time to see each time I've been to Prague. It really never gets old. The colors a simply stunning as well. Do yourself a favor and get a guide while you are in this city, because there is SO much to take in and learn, it's always easy to go back home and read about something, but having a guide point things out while you're there in person is really truly wonderful. I've yet to go to the top of the tower (I have another place in the city that I really love), but I imagine that it's well worth the money spent to get up there and to see the behind the scenes. It's on my to do list for next time I pass through. It's a busy little corner, especially to watch the little \"show\" that happens every hour. The clock comes alive with characters coming out of the clocks. Nothing crazy, but cute to see. I once heard someone I was standing by say, \"That's it?\" When it finished. Yes, because it was created hundreds of years ago, now appreciate what the creator made with what he had back then. I think it's beautiful to see at night, but of course, get there in the early morning while everyone's still asleep. Grab a coffee and just hang out in front it for a bit, before heading off to the St. Charles Bridge."

Even the crowds gathering for the \"TOP OF THE HOUR SHOW\" of the apostles statues showing through the tiny windows of the Astronomical Clock Tower. I stayed for over an hour. You can also attend a tour for about $2 more (every 30 minutes in different languagez, Czech, French, German, Spanish, English) of the historical halls and get a view of the figures of the apostles. This one I will do in my next visit to get the full experience. The top of the tower offers uninterrupted view since there is a balcony with many open windows (no glass) and you can enjoy the view and take pictures to your heart's content. If you can only go up one tower because of limited time in Prague, this must be it. And you can tell your friends, \"I was up there!\"."

Cultural changes between then and now may obscure the meanings that would have been obvious to Prague\u2019s residents back then. The three statues that surround the clock represent mortal sins: vanity, greed, and hedonism. The fourth personifies Death. When the time comes, Death moves his hour-glass and pulls the cord, which rings the bell. Two windows open and the 12 Apostles move swiftly by, each looking at the crowd below. The rooster crows \u2013 perhaps a reference to the text in which Jesus tells Peter that Peter will deny knowing Jesus three times before the rooster crows. The windows close and the clock then tolls the hour. This is definitely worth seeing despite the crowds!"

We heard the description from our Sandeman Guide (free tour) and we were impressed with the history of the clock & the fact it's been working since 1410. We happened to see it in action on another day as we were eating nearby, and, truly, the history is more interesting than the vision."

One will find a swarm of people standing with head back looking up on the hour when the characters play their part. This is a crowded place so be careful at your belongings. I think it is a one time experience. Remember to read up on it before you go in order to know what you are looking at. The areas around the clock has fantastic little cafes and restaurants to sit, drink, eat and enjoy the architecture of the city and watrch people passing by.Prague's Astronomical Clock is an intrinsic part of the Old Town Hall. The clock was created in 1410. It displayes the motion of the planet and the 12 apostles. Apart of the 12 apostles the clock features moving figurines including Vanity, The Miser, the Skeleton and the Turk (a simbol of lust),"

The crowd packed every square inch of space from which you could see the clock. Cheers erupted from the crowd in the minutes and seconds approaching the top of the hour. Then, a hush, to enjoy the movements of the clock. A grand cheer signaled the end of the show, and the crowd was slow to disburse in their many ways to further enjoy the beauty of Prague...the jewel of world capitals."

I would encourage you to learn about the history before seeing it. It will make you appreciate it all the more. To climb the tower, you'll have to pay 120 crown and then wait in line to go up. The line gets real long after mid day so plan early. The view at the top is worth the wait though. There is an elevator that will take you to the top, if your not up to the climb."

On the full hours the apostles move past the windows and a skeleton representing death tolls a bell. Some visitors are disappointed that 'the show' is not more elaborate and thereby miss the point of the clock. To understand the clock face you need to read up about it first or have a tour guide - it is far from intuitive, however once understood you will marvel at how this was designed and assembled in 1410."

We chose instead to have pizza and pilsner at the sidewalk cafe next door. I recommend that plan. Be sure to time it right so that you can watch Mr. Death turn his hourglass at the top of the hour!"

The whole complex is massive but there are restaurants where you can have a drink or eat and people watch/rest. We had drinks on a terrace that looked down over the whole of Prague and the weather was fantastic so it was a lovely experience. Lovely atmosphere. Went up the tower in the Town Hall where the astronomical clock is. I took the glass (indoor) elevator and fantastic views of Prague. Had lunch opposite the clock afterwards and watched the clock strike on the hour - you get quite a gathering about that time. It was very busy the day we went to the Town Hall as Czecvh was hosting Ice Hockey World Cup (or European??) so people came from everywhere. They also had their own \"London\" type Marathon that day. All back to normal and cleared the following day though. You should try and see Prague by night. The castle across the river looks beautiful when lit. We ate in a boat moored permanently at the side of the river right opposite the castle and watched as the night closed in and the place lit up. As we left there were 2 firework displays - possibly I think Czech had won the ice hockey game. Eating is very reasonable. Food it great - various schnitzels, goulash, salads. Pretty fussy eater but loved the food something for everyone. LOADS of shops from souvenirs - lots of beautiful crystal - to the top designer shops like Dior, Cartier etc. Hadn't realised just how big Prague is. All the buildings beautiful, you can get anywhere on the trams, metro or buses and buy very cheap day passes so you can use all 3 all day - or walk around and take in all the buildings. Jewish Quarter, Old Town, Wenceslas Square (yep - the very same Good King W from the Christmas carol!). We took a horse and carriage ride around as well. Hundreds of cafes, shops and lots to see and do. We also took a boat trip on the river - about 45 mins with drink and gingerbread thrown in. We loved our time there and had fantastic weather as well."

And yes, the clock-attraction only lasts for a short time only, but it's nice, and you can always return for another round an hour later. What's even better, though, is going up the tower. As they only let up a given number of people at the same time, you will probably have to wait a bit (around 20 minutes), but it's worth the wait. Granted, it's somewhat frustrating that the whole process of letting people up the tower resembles the process of leading animals to the slaughterhouse, but I guess that's the way it is when visiting a site in which thousands of other people are interested as well.Anyway, once you're up, you can hang around and take your time, and look at Prague from all the different angles - and it's beautiful.A big plus is that the tower is accessible with wheelchairs as well - either by lift, or by going up the ramp (no stairs)."

I won't tell you how the clock works as this will ruin the mystique however i would advise that you you either get some written information on how the clock works (available from the Tourist Information Centres) before visiting it, or take a city walking tour with a guide who will explain the clocks workings.

It is a really beautiful piece of art. If you want to see it in action, better be there a little in advance to find a good space because a crowd gathers there at every full hour. We actually went on the tower at first to enjoy the great view over Prague. It was a beautiful sunny spring day and I really enjoyed the view over the city and the square. It is very narrow on top of the tower and we were not really alone, so it took a while to get around. Time passed really quickly with so much to see and when we realized that it was 5 min to the full hour and we needed to go down to see the astronomic clock, we didn't quite make it in time. We were not the only ones who had that plan ;-)"

Buy the ticket to the right of the clock and go inside some 50m to the left from the clock. You can take the stairs or an elevator. From the tower, you will have the whole Prague lie open in front of you and the hustle and bustle below will transform into a distant rustle. Enjoy."

Clock souvenirs were sold at the entrance/exit of the tower including different pocket watches of the \"clock\", T shirts, and other small items.

Not a big deal, much of Europe is messed up due to the wars and revolutions and what have you. But the detail and thought, not to mention the blood sweat and tears that went into making this thing is mind boggling! Upon first glance you can see the clock and you admire it for it's beauty. Then you see the clock working and the 'show' that happens every hour and you realize the time period this was made in and you have to think 'holy cr*p'! It is a thing of beauty and is a must see in Prague. The good thing is that if you start at Prague castle, head over the Charles bridge you walk straight into Old Town and to the clock, so it doesn't take and extra day or anything like that. Prague is know for it's beauty and original work beacause it wasn't affected by the war like so many other countries were. It makes you think what if all the other countries still were intact? The beauty Europe must have had before the war!Anyway, back to the tower. The walk up is a mini workout, but the views are worth it. Sometimes there are lines and groups around the clock, so come early in the morning to avoid this. We were there one morning at 9 am on a Thursday and we had a clear path to the tower and up to the top. We got to take tons of pictures with our family and then left as people started coming. Best to do that for this particular attraction more so than some others."

The hourly \"show\" is very short so read up on what all is going on--pictures of saints rotating, birds calling, skeletons moving, etc.--to get the full effect. Amazing to realize the clock is hundreds of years old and still working so well. Get there a little early for a good view and watch out for wedding parties (and their attendant cars--the only ones allowed in the pedestrian-friendly square), especially on weekend, as civil ceremonies are conducted right next door."

There are great views from the top with information boards about the surrounding buildings. There is a lift that will take you up and down or a slope if you would rather walk!

Remember when this clock was built: it's medieval, for heaven's sake (pun fully intended), installed in 1410, and an amazing technical achievement of its time! We found it absolutely charming, and beautiful too. It goes off on the hour, every hour, incidentally. Not to be missed!"

While from a historical perspective it is pretty cool, all that you see is a rotation of the apostles passing by, which lasts about a minute. I agree with some of the other reviewers that the tower/clock would be best viewed at a time when it wasn't mobbed with onlookers. That said, it is an 'experience'."

The clock is situated just beneath the Old Town Hall and is easy enough to find; if you happen to be approaching towards the end of the hour you can't miss the queues that inevitably develop to watch the quaint display that occurs every hour between 9am and 9pm. The 600-year old clock consists of two intricate faces, and features a mechanical display every hour, where a skeleton figure (named 'Death') rings a bell prompting twelve apostles to make an appearance in the windows above the clock. The display culminates with a cockerel crowing which usually draws a few laughs from the captive audience before the crowds disperse. It is certainly worth visiting at least once while in Prague, although those expecting something a bit more substantial might be disappointed."

A unique clock - The clock was first installed in 1410, making it the third-oldest astronomical clock in the world and the oldest one still working.The Orloj is mounted on the southern wall of Old Town City Hall in the Old Town Square. The clock mechanism itself is composed of three main components: the astronomical dial, representing the position of the Sun and Moon in the sky and displaying various astronomical details; \"The Walk of the Apostles\", a clockwork hourly show of figures of the Apostles and other moving sculptures\u2014notably a figure of Death (represented by a skeleton) striking the time; and a calendar dial with medallions representing the months. According to local legend, the city will suffer if the clock is neglected and its good operation is placed in jeopardy and a skeleton, mounted on the clock, was supposed nod his head in confirmation. Tourists gather in front hourly to watch the Apostles appear in the windows above the clock. Many interesting stories and legends are connected to this clock so it is worth having a guide"

Also, please be reminded majority of the staffs here will be mentally or physically challenged. A huge achievement by the authorities for promoting this.

However, towards the end of the walking tour we ended up back at the square and once again i was waiting for the clock to strike on the hour, but this time the tour guide was explaining why the clock was so unique, all of the stories behind each of the characters and it really did impress me!"

The clock actually does tell time but the baseline is from sunset to sunset so when we were there the hand was on 18 which meant it was 18 hours since the prior sunset. It also tells the date of the year and the saint appointed to that day. It also tells you the phase the sun and moon are in - for example now it says Pieces. It is very interesting. The statutes were added later as well as the apostles who move on the hour. The statutes symbolize vanity, greed, death and other characteristics. The rooster cooes at the end of the show and this symbolizes the optimistic dawn of a new day to come - even though it may not be morning when he cooes, it is to symbolize hope. It is remarkable how someone could create this clock so many years ago. Worth a visit. It is not as glamorous as many clocks (for example in Munich) but worth the visit."

At the same time a skeleton on the right of the clock pulls on a rope which operates a bell (or at least it is made to look like that) and this signifies the death of the old hour, before the cockerel hails the beginning of the new hour.

We were very disappointed with how impolite the staff were all around, including a woman who wouldn't let me use the toilet because I only had euro to pay her in! I used it anyway when she wasn't looking :PThe other qualm I had was how silly the little performance on the hour was!

Amazingly intricate clock mechanism - not by today's standards of course - and easy to understand why thing king did what he did to the designer/maker - not going to spoil the story...Rather than standing in a huge crowd on the pavement waiting for the hour to strike, we chose to sit on the terrace of the Toro Negro bar, in a comfy, cushioned armchair with a a beer instead.As the bar's terrace is raised and for customers only we managed to get a great view of the clock while avoiding hundreds of people in the December cold. This also negated any possible pickpocket situation which inevitably presents itself in every city where crowds of tourists may gather to focus their attention."

Top tip, there is a big queue downstairs for tickets, go past it and up the stairs and you will find another ticket office with shorter queues. There is a lift inside to make the journey to the top easier, although apart from a short spiral staircase the whole way up is on ramps anyway.

It strikes me as truly amazing that the clock has been around since 1410 and over the centuries has undergone a series of transformations, arriving as we see it at the present day. It has variously functioned and not functioned over the years for one reason or another including significant damage sustained in 1945 from German anti-aircraft fire.

It\u00b4s a wonderful machine that has been preserved, and it is the oldest still working.The clock not only includes the figures of the apostles, a skeleton and the representation of greed and vanity, but also all astronomical science, it shows the years, the months, the days and the hours. The rising and setting of the sun and moon, and the zodiac signs.Every hour several tourists meet in front of the Old Town Hall tower to see how the clock strikes the hour and the 4 figures of the clock set in motion, as well as the presentation of the 12 apostles. All the figures shake their heads. It is really nice and beautiful.Nearby you can find restaurants where you can taste local food and the Pilsen Urkel at reasonable prices. But also, at the end of the day, in the afternoon you can also try a local sweet fresh bread rolls (Trdelnik) and other kinds of breads. They are served hot. You can see how they are prepared in a roasting grill. They are delicious, and some places serve them with hot wine. I include one picture of them. The price is in local currency."

It is amazing that the trades people of long ago crafted such beautiful masterpieces, which is admired by generations of tourists. The clock chimes at regular intervals and when the light is angled correctly, the colours and stonework is magnificent. We did not use the outdoor seating in the covered bars as they catered for the tourist market with high prices.During the Christmas markets we ate from the stalls and the hog roast together with the local bread and brew warmed us up."

The only thing is it gets packed up there & no one seems to pay attention to the directional signs & it can be a free-for-all in a confined space! Worth the visit."

Enough about the clock, yes it is very entertaining but there's more to the mechanism (and the building) than a couple of mechanical doors and the parade of saints' puppets. Take time to examine the astrological and seasonal symbols, and the astonishing perpetual calendar of saints' days. It's an incredible achievement and far more impressive than the admittedly crowd-pleasing clock trick. What skill and artistry they had to design something so sophisticated based on limited technology."

On our last day we bought tickets and took the lift up the tower - it's fabulous and worth the (relatively low) price. The views are ace and the small plaques telling you what you;re looking at are really handy if you haven't been before! (there's a loo on the ground floor)"

By the town square near the white church, there is a tour guide company that we booked a day tour to Cesky Krumlov. I recommend them as well, we enjoyed our day tour with them. Beware of the currency exchange places around the town center, however. We got ripped off, I lost about 50 euros which is a great deal of money for a backpacker, and they take advantage of tourists. It's better to go farther away for currency exchange. Definitely worth the visit overall."

We walked up the tower, with its sloping ramps for most of the climb, which are easier than steps for many - the fantastic circular glass lift is even easier for the lazy. I wanted to catch the rooftops at twilight and as the lights came on. After a full on day walking with a backpack full of gear in freezing conditions it was good to be able to shelter as I waited for the light to change. A pity nitwits choose to go against the clockwise flow around the outer path. Tourists from certain parts of the world seem determined to get their selfies and stuff everyone else."

You can also treat yourself to a beautiful garnet - I chose something modern, not like the usual old designs and negotiated a price. They resized my ring and I went back an hour later to collect it! There are lots of shops on the cobbled streets. Every hour, the Clock will chime and you will see the famous statues moving round the Clock. It can get quite packed, even though this was winter (there always seem to be someone taller in front of me!). So get a good spot - and if you miss it, don't worry; go and have a coffee and come back an hour later, with a better space! ;0) You can also pay to climb up the tower, but we didn't bother.Lots of beautiful buildings to take a photo of! Loads of restaurants to choose from. You can also still eat outside as they have heaters and rugs to keep you reasonably warm! Great if you are a smoker as you don't have to leave your table and your partner isn't left sitting on her own while you normally have a cigarette break!"

There's absolutely nothing spectacular or breathtaking about this clock, besides the fact that it is the oldest working clock of its kind in the world. If you're in Prague, you'll inevitably be in this area anyway, so walk to the southwest corner of Old Town Square and see what the fuss is about. Do NOT wait for the top of the hour to watch the clock chime and figurines to appear because it lasts barely 10 seconds and you'll miss it if you blink. If you don't have time, skip this attraction, although that means you may also exclude visiting Old Town Square and the Tyn Church (inspiration for Disney's Sleeping Beauty Castle), which are worth seeing during the day and at night when it comes alive."

It's cheap to climb the tower 110czk each which is less than \u00a34 and you can spend as long as you like up there. Although, be warned, it does get rather busy! You get a view of all areas of Prague once at the top and you can be mesmorized by the skyline of the city.Another thing you shouldn't miss is the 12 apostles that come out of the tower when the clock strikes on the hour. Join the multinational crowd as you watch the show, but be aware of pick pocketers. Overall, fab experience"

The Astronomical clock is beautiful and on the hour every hour the little doors open with bells sounding and the twelve apostles move around in the ports. For an entrance fee its possible to climb or take the lift to the top of the town hall tower and view the city from above. Not for those with height fears as its open at the top. Well worth the visit to the top for the views alone. Visitors can also visit the basement to see city ruins of the original street level of Prague and chambers used to hold prisoners of war during ww2 and the cold war era."

The animation that comes on the hour is unexciting by today's standards, but when you consider it started in the 15th century, it's pretty amazing. Save the trip up to the lookout in the tower until you have learned your way around a little. It's much more fun to see the places you have been.You can buy the tower tickets at a booth on the side of the clock for 110 Kr per person with discount for students or kids. Tower has elevators, or you can take a series of steps and ramps which make you appreciate the tower's height. The spiral staircase at the top is especially interesting with its stop and go lights. At the top, extending the main castle in the west, the river circling the town, the Vseyhrad Castle in the south and the Zizkov TV tower in the east. Don't forget the camera for this trip. you are rewarded with a view of the rooftops of central Prague."

We had the choice of a lift or steps to go up to the third floor where we had to queue to get in. Again we then had the choice of a lift or steps to take us up the tower... we took the steps! It was really busy up there but there's a one way system in place around the tower (it is quite narrow up there though). We couldn't have timed it any better as it was just starting to get dark as we got to the top. With all the Christmas lights and the markets below the sights were truly amazing.

Restoration work took place to get the clock to work again in 1948. On the hour four figures move, one being Dr Death, a skeleton, that strikes the time upon the hour.

The view from the tower of the Old Town Hall is very much worth your effort, while the Astronomical Clock is a kinda cool relic from the 1600's that really doesn't do much. In fact it was so mundane that we had to brave the rather large crowds that gather on the hour twice to convince ourselves that we were looking in the right direction and didn't miss something. We didn't. The tower on the other hand affords a magnificent view of the square, castle, and a 360 degree view of Prague. The elevator ride costs 6 euro at the ticket office, and I imagine the line gets quite long during busier times as there is only the one elevator, and it's somewhat small. In any event, the view makes whatever you had to go through to get there worth it.It's all in one location on the west side of the square on the way to Charles Bridge, so you're going to go that way anyway, so you might as well stop and take it all in. A Prague icon is a Prague icon afterall."

Installed in 1410, this clock still draws huge crowds on the hour, every hour (or at least the three hours we were there when it happened. The clock is so high that it is difficult at first to see what is happening. There are four characters on the outside of the clock. From the far left, is vanity holding a mirror, next greed holding a bag of gold, then on the right is a skeleton that rings the bell on the hour. To his right is a Turk who represents pleasure and entertainment. When the skeleton rings the bell that it's time to go, the others all shake their head, apparently that they don't want to leave. Windows at the top show the 12 apostles every hour. The movements of the clock showing all the aspects of the day, month, and year, move so slowly that you can't see them moving. However, you can Google a link that shows slow-motion cameras that reveal the movement. I've put in a link below for you to watch a slow motion animation of the clock as its movement is so slow that it's impossible to just look at it and see how it all moves. For your own contemplation, just realize that in 2010, Prague celebrated the 600th Anniversary of the clock. Most of us have a hard time thinking about that length of time, even when we look at buildings. But to see a complex working clock that has been working that long is amazing."

Meanwhile some figures rotate pass an open door above this, now for 2014 this see silly and some people expect a light show or something crazy . for the time this clock was designed and constructed this was the best technology, therefore in my opinion making it a wonderful must see attraction.

The clock itself is really interesting and complicated to look at and there's a little show on the hour every hour, which tbh isn't hugely impressive but worth checking out all the same. I'd recommend going into the building itself and seeing the views from the top. It's pretty inexpensive and there's also a lot of information and history on the clock if you walk back down rather then take the lift (don't worry, it's on slopes so you don't have to walk down loads of steps!)."

They made a reservation with Best Tour and my friend and I were picked up at the hotel by a gentleman who knew more about Norwegian skier Northug and other skiers than we do. He had travelled in Norway and knew a lot about the country.As we reached the down town area, we met 3 gentlemen from Japan ready to join us. They worked for a Japanese Air Company in London. We also had the pleasure of meeting our fantastic guide Michaela. All of us entered the minibus to be used during the tour and we started and Michaela explained the history of Prague in an excellent way. We toured the down town area for a while before we proceeded to the worlds largest castle.We crossed the river Vtava and could see the well known Charles Bridge(construction started in 1357). In the castle area we got more explanation and guiding in perfect English by our guide. After the castle tour our Japanese friends decided to leave us and proceed on their own and my friend and I was lucky to be alone with our sweet guide. Of course we invited her to lunch and she selected the food that was goulash for us Norwegians plus white wine. The food was very delicious and tasty and the splendid white wine made the lunch even better.After an excellent lunch we drove towards The Astronomical Clock(one of the best known tourist spot in Prague). Then the very pleasant tour covering all historic sites in Prague, was almost over. Thanks to our splendid guide Michaela, we can only say it was one of the most fantastic sightseeing tour we ever had. She even spent some overtime with us showing us where to find a good store where crystal was sold. We made some shopping for our families and could look back on a very succesful, educational and memorable tour in Prague that will never be forgotten.November 16, 2014Arne Magne TjaalandVisited November 2014"

When we visited the Czech Republic and Prague we walked from our hotel and wandered directly into the main area of the \"Old Town\" where the Astronomical Clock is the centerpiece. We have had a few \"jaw dropping\" moments in our travels (Walking out of the rail station practically into the Canal in Venice, Walking into the Grand Place in Brussels (top moment of all!) and coming into the Old Town in Prague and its main square which was bedecked with Xmas lights and trees for the Christmas Market. Its was a Shiver down your spine moment especially since when we were there we were lucky enough to have numerous snow storms which gave Prague an unbelievable fairyland look."

It was built several hundred years ago, and shows the position of the sun during the seasons, as well as the various astrological signs in their orbits. It was built when people still believed the sun revolved around the earth. When the clock strikes the hours two doors open at the top of the clock and figures of the twelve disciples show themselves in succession in the open doors. Worth visiting when in Prague, but if you are their at the top of the hour when the clock strikes and the apostles show themselves, be sure to protect your wallet. It is a favourite spot for pickpockets as the square is very crowded, and everyone is looking up at the clock."

As the hour approaches, the square in front of the clock gets very crowded.The clock is a beautiful piece of medieval workmanship.After the crowd dispersed, we went to the top of Old Town Hall, you can walk up to the top of the tower or take the lift. When you reach the top the lines are a bit long in the small landing and move slowly to get outside because everyone is so mesmerized by the views. As you walk 360 degrees around the tower the views of Prague are breathtaking, one advantage is that it helps you to orient where one site is in relation to the others and you can see the crowds in the square below and be above them all!Well worth the trip to the top of the tower."

We also saw a convincing Punch & Judy-esque screaming baby in a pram. He had a little more discipline than the statues, but I imagined it would have been funny to see him standing up and walking along, with his pram strapped to his back :-)The large square is surrounded by cafes and restaurants, with a group of stalls selling sausages and fresh roasted pork and ham."

It's incredibly impressive to see it on a clear night with all of the lights on the old buildings around the city. They make the climb easy because instead of stairs like you normally see in these types of things, they have ramps after about 1/3 of the way which makes it much easier. If you're really dreading the climb, you can even take an elevator to the top but I recommend the walk."

Not much room to walk around the edge but remember to go the right way round as it can cause problems. I failed to read the big sign and forced myself round the wrong way. Duh!"

The crowds were smaller (when we went at 11pm) and the clock is lit up, so it's easy to see everything at work. Actually, there was a glare from the sun when we saw the clock during the daylight hours. 9am to 11pm.Free to see the clock \"performance\" but a fee to enter the Town Hall."

You can pay to climb upto the tower which will give you an impressive aerial view of Prague. The clock is unique and quite a feat of engineering. It is impressive to look at and you have to watch what happens when it chimes on each hour. Apparently when it was built the locals liked it so much they wanted to ensure it was one of its kind in the world, so invited the inventor to a party, then poked out his eyes and cut off his tongue!! So be warned, don't accept any party invites from the locals!!"

The underground tour provides insight into the time of the beginning of the Old Town, when the street level was much lower than it is today. Due to frequent flooding, the street level of the city was raised during the 13th century, turning the original ground-floors of the buildings into underground chambers. The oldest part of the Old Town Hall's underground is the Roman hall, dating from the 12th century. The second tour takes you through the city hall\u2019s interiors, which includes a chapel and historical halls. You can see the apostles up close and personal.The clock tower is almost 70 meters high, and provides an all encompassing view of the city of 1000 spires. On a clear day, you actually can see forever...into the suburbs and surroundings of the city.You can climb up the stairs, but thankfully, there is now an elevator to the top of the tower. Plan to spend much time here, as the views are amazing and will provide for your best photos of this magical city."

It not only has scientific value but it also has many other meanings like the 12 apostles dancing every hour and the 4 sculptures representing the four things that were despised: vanity, greed, pleasure, and death. Every hour the skeleton representing death pulls a string to ring the bell and the other three sculptures nod their head rejecting their time to die.Besides that it has the name of each day so if you're lucky enough to have someone that understands the clock, you might get to know when your name day is. People often gave their children the name of the day they were born but for those that didn't follow this custom get 2 bdays: their birthday and their name day. It is a very fun clock to get to know."

The Jan Hus Memorial, Old Town Hall and Astronomical Clock are individually beautiful and compliment the square. Unfortunately during our visit to Prague, the Jan Hus Memorial was covered in scaffolding as much needed repairs are made. The Astronomical Clock is an amazing piece of engineering for its period, but don't feel like it's a \"must see.\" Instead, venture inside the Old Town Hall Tower and take in the Old Town Square from an elevated perspective. Old Town Square at ground level is very different compared to the observation deck inside the tower. An elevator is available, but the casual stroll winding up the tower is filled with history and unique snap shots of the Old Town Square. The small fee is well worth the view, and we found many large tourist groups completely bypassed this feature. This was an impromptu visit on our final day in Prague, and the rain (only day of entire stay) set a dramatic backdrop on the rooftops and cobble streets below. I was pleasantly surprised the observation deck inside the tower isn't publicized in more guidebooks, and we would highly recommend."

When we got up there (there are lifts!) we were suprised by the amazing sunset behind the castle. The view of the square and the Cathedral were awesome. Totally worth climbing the tower. And regarding the clock, it is very beautiful and complex. Many people don't know how it works or what it shows. Read about it and then go there to see its complexity, even more picturing it in the year that it was built"

A lift will take you to the top of the tower for amazing views of the city. The hours vary depending on the season. There is no fee to see the clock, but there's a small fee (100 Kc) to take the lift to the top of the tower and to see the halls & displays in City Hall. This area is usually jammed full of people, buskers, tour groups - so be prepared for shuffling about - and mind your purse, bags, wallets as this is a prime location for pickpockets in the city. There are many restaurants, shops, and street food options available. Hardly any seating, though, unless you're dining at a restaurant.The entire area is cobble stoned streets."

A visit to the Old Town and the Astronomical Clock is a 'must-see'. The Old Town area is filled with gothic architectural buildings and I bet you that you have never see such a quaint but unique clock ever!"

It was the highlight of our trip to Prague because it is so central and gives stunning views across the Old Town, and across the river to the Castle and Petrin Hill. I would suggest aiming to buy tickets and queue at around xx.40 where xx is the hour of the day. Don't go soon after the hour as people flood in having watched the clock do 'its thing'. While you are very likely to have to wait around in a queue, this is more than worthwhile. The queue is because the top is quite compact and so can become cramped. An absolute MUST DO in Prague."

I'm not entirely sure, but we certainly did go to the top of the famous bell tower, with a few million other people, to gaze across old and new Prague. The town hall itself is an agglomeration of buildings starting with one house, then another and another, no doubt as city officialdom grew. Unfortunately,the Nazis demolished one end of the building towards the end of the war and that bit was never rebuilt. We had a little tour of the interior of the town hall which was not too long or too short and the amount of information provided was about right. The tour included some rather grand function rooms as well as the cellars.The astronomical clock is so well know that I will say nothing which has not already been said. Be there at the top of the hour and you will enjoy the little display. I felt sorry for the newly married/about to marry young Czech couple who had difficulty fighting their way through hundreds of tourists to get to the town hall for, presumably, their ceremony and photographs. A very picturesque place and certainly worth a visit. Just take your photographs quickly before somebody moves past and spoils your shot."

Together with the Charles Bridge and the Castle District, I would say that the Astronomical Clock is the symbol of Prague.It is amazing how a mechanical clock could be created that shows more than just the time and still works after many years after its creation. There are statues on it and when the clock shows an exact time, the statues will move a little and two windows will open showing other statues moving inside. There are a lot of tourists waiting for that moment filming and taking picture, but it is not that spectacular as you may expect (or as I was expecting). The great things about it are the architecture, the mechanical mechanism and the history behind it (it is really an old clock, at its time people in Prague were using it to get the time).You can go up in the tower (you need to pay a fee) and there is quite a view from there. Definitely worth it. Choose a time when it's not so crowded, for example, when the clock shows an exact time there is likely to be a good time to visit it as people focus on seeing the show the clock makes rather than visiting it."

After getting a good view, walk down the tower instead of taking a lift. You can get some details of the astronomical clock as you walked down the slope."

In any event you will next find yourself in a very small space waiting on another very slow line to ultimately stand by a view and move as slowly around the tower as the slowest person on the line allows. I said to myself what if someone, heaven forbid got sick or if there was a fire, how would we get out of here.

The kids ran around with them. There seemed to be a ton of beggars at every corner around this square. I was surprised but they were non invasive and truly begged down all the side streets that lead to the square. Lots of restaurants have bathrooms so do not hesitate to pop in and use it if you need to. During the day there were performers, strings, a flame thrower. Fun night people watching. All the shops close at 9pm. So if you are not bar crawling, you are pretty much done at 9pm. They allow drinking on the streets and since beer is sold in glass bottles, there was a lot of glass on the streets. Suckling pigs were at a number of restaurants. People here seem to be put off by the tourist. Its very odd. While here you must try the Trdelnik - traditional pastry of Czech Republic spinning over coal with butter, sugar and cinnamon. They all cost the same, in a street vendor shop. Delish!"

We looked up, there was a slight tear in the top of the note.my boyfriend asked 'why' to which this rude man could not give us an answer due to lack of english. I found this to be unacceptable. If you are working in a tourist attraction you should be able to speak the English language to some extent. I then said that the watermark had not been torn and that we had just been given the note in a restaurant aschange but he still refused . After that we walked out. I could not justify paying any money to an ignoramus like that.Ten minutes later we walked into a shop and the note was accepted without a second glance.

A bit hard to take a picture or even get a spot to have a clear view since it's always crowded with tourists in front of the clock. Make sure to see the performance every hour from 9 AM to 9 PM. It's amazing that the clock still work very well. Definitely should not miss this one!"

This is when the clock will chime and amazing things will happen. Do notice a few things just in case you will miss it and wait another hour. 1. The Blue Glass Door will open and figurine will be rotating 2. Notice the 4 figuring from left to right (Man with a Mirror looking at how handsome he is, next is Rich Merchant with bags of gold, next Skeleton and lastly a Turkish man with musical instrument.... close to the end please do notice the golden rooster... it will flap its wings."

A fair crowd joined us and we can only imagine how busy it would be in the middle of the day. The clock has four major figures including one that was a skeleton that we worked out was Death as he was holding the bell. There was a small cuckoo above. Death rang his bell and a number of old guys who were saints or apostles rotated through the window frames. Then the cuckoo hooted once. As these clocks go this was one of the better ones.We then got tickets for the viewing tower. This is located two doors down from the office. We took two lifts up to save walking. The first one was largely a glass affair and took us past an historical display of the tower. The second one was a scientific creation similar to the double helix structure. It was quite unusual. From the viewing platform at the top we had lovely views including towards the imposing Powder Gate. There was also Zizkov Tower from which we could just make out the climbing baby sculptures and several churches above the streetscape. The only disappointment was on the walk back down. There was info boards detailing the history of the clock and tower but the workings of the clock were not visible as we had read. Otherwise a wonderful sight to see."

Lots of places to eat and drink but of course - the highest price. Nevertheless I would rather suggest to sit with a beer just to have a look at the square.

But dont get too excited about hanging around for it to chime on the hour.Crowds get in this square because its buzzing with cafes, restaurants and buskers.On the hour the chimes are rung by the skeleton thats stands high up on the clock.Then the doors open and 2 at a time the apostles show themselves.All this lasts for approx 30 seconds.So dont look away because you'll miss it.You can pay a little bit of money to go up the tower.There is a lift to the top if you cant manage the stairs.Wonderful views from the top. And my last thing to say is :-Apparently the area is easy pickings for pick pockets so be careful.But please dont let those words put you off.Old Town Square and the Astronomical Clock is a must.The Architecture of the buildings are well worth looking at.Round the back of the clock near the park is Kotleta restaurant.Visited twice.

One can easily tell when the hour is approaching without even bothering to view the clock, purely from the amount of crowds that cluster around it and block all walkway through the passage in doing so. Due to this, it is best to see the clock chime in the early morning before the crowds have a chance to gather.The tower itself is exactly the opposite: best climbed in the late evening as it is getting dark - for the best views. It is slightly confusing that the ticket office is around the corner from the entrance, by a souvenir shop. But after the doorman explained this to me it was not to difficult to find.The lift up the tower is rather spectacular also. It appears as if they borrowed it from the set of a sci-fi film and transported it into the middle of a medieval tower in Prague. If you take the stairs, however (at least one way: up or down), one can stop and learn about the history of the tower and medieval Prague from the mileposts located on the way up - which I would thoroughly recommend.Definitely something one should do whilst in Prague - but then, being located right in the central corner of the old town square and en route to most major tourist areas from there, it is rather hard to miss."

The place starts to come alive about 11-12ish and by early afternoon it gets really busy. We got there about 10am and got a great view of the clock and there wasn't the throngs of people that showed up for the 12 noon show. The clock itself was beautiful in it's own way because it's soooo old and has an old school charm. What I didn't expect is that the bottom of the clock it is only about 15 feet off the ground, I expected it to be pretty high and not being able to see much but it was just the opposite. The \"on the hour\" show is not even a minute long, it's not super elaborate by today's standard but several hundred years ago it was a huge feat and today it's still cool (even by today's standard its pretty cool engineering) We went up into the clock tower, which I believe was about $6 usd (approx) its pretty neat in there, you do NOT see any of the clocks inner working though, so be aware. The top offered a great view of the city below and I would recommend this since it's only a few bucks.*Warning: If you go during any of the busy times (we walked by it several times but didn't stop to see the show again) there are tons of people packing in to see it and bumping in to you etc so BE MINDFUL OF YOUR BELONGINGS!! take the proper precautions, purse/backpack zipped and in front of you, wallet in front pocket, camera cases locked and in front. You will be looking up for the most part and getting bumped into so you will be vulnerable."

We didn't know what was happening so we also stood along with the crowd. As the time turned 12, a lot of things started happening above the dial of the clock. The dial also has significance and meaning but I will let that pass. The wooden figures of Apostles appeared from inside and many of the sculptures begin to move at the same time. The golden cockerel crows and the clock chimes the hour. This happens each hour but at 12'O Clock it happens 12 times ! With the show over, the crowd dissipates and involves itself into many activities which are happening at the square.The whole day people visit Astronomical clock and sit around it."

We were there at 9:00am and the crowd and Square were pretty quiet compared to when we walked by at 4:00pm and couldn't move due to the crowds of people!Basically what happens is that on the hour, a skeleton pulls a cord to ring the bell while at the same time the Twelve Apostles \"walk past\" the windows above the clock. Yes it is kind of interesting but to be honest, a little naff. The sound it makes is quite nice and yes it is a very old timepiece but not worth the hustle and bustle of the crowds. Go there at a time that is not on the hour to obtain a better photo with less crowds."

The medieval architecture of the Old Town Hall is enough to make you stop and be amazed, but the clock and the 'action' on each hour is purely astounding. The clock is detailed in so many depths for which you could spend an hour just taking in the intricacies. On each hour the bell strikes as would any tower bell -- but the 'show' is the truly the attraction! Two doors open high on the tower and various saints rotate up to and partly out the doors, taking their turn showing their face to the crowds below, then pull back in so the next saint can rotate in and out. All the while, a skeleton hung out on a parapet moves its arm and rings a small bell, reminding us that time is fleeting and life is short. Try to situate yourself about 10 to 15 minutes before the hour to make sure you get a good spot. Don't get too close to the building since you won't be able to see the saints in the doors [vertical line of sight], so try to situate yourself closer to the sidewalk caf\u00e9 across the cobbled street. Don't worry about people lining up in front of you since you'll be looking up [unless they're really tall people]."

However, with that said, it is truly amazing the history of the clock and the intricacy of how it works and how accurate it is. And everyone shows up, so it is fun to people watch, and everyone claps. I prefer the astrological clock in Messina, Sicily where I was in early May 2014 which is on the belltower and strikes at noon. It is far more intricate and spectacular from a spectator point of view. There the statues move, the lion roars and wags its tail, many mechanically-animated statues.

A climb into the tower will allow you to see all of prague surrounding buildings . Lots of picturesque photos. Also every o'clock the bugle is blown by a court jester, the clock does lots of movements and openings . It's most busiest time is the o clock time to see all this happen."

Climb the stairs or take the elevator to the top of the clock to get the most fabulous 360 degree view of Prague. This is one of the most famous landmarks in Prague, located in Old Town, is historic, unusual, and fun."

It was installed in the 1400s and has managed to survive all these years. But what in the world are you expecting? Fireworks? Fire? Real life gnomes?If you decide to watch one of the shows, you will be surrounded by (quite literally) hundreds of people. Our local friend that took us around town just laughed while we waiting, telling us about how the joke is, the astronomical clock is the most disappointing tourist attraction in the world; despite the fact it was rated as a travel's choice of 2014? Go and see for yourself, but don't expect much more than what you could guess the 1400s engineers created. There are cooler places to visit while in Prague."

We spent 4 fabulous days in this fantastic city and visited the square every day at sometime. We visited early morning, throughout the afternoon and by night each time the square was full of tourists, street artists, a cleaning crew and a low key police presence who were always available to guide and help tourists. We visited a couple of restaurants on its perimeter and was great to eat good food whilst people watching and enjoying the performances of the street artists. Very pretty in the night and locals were really helpful and polite. We visited in October however would love to return in the snow. Fantastic city we loved our stay."

But, we did not really appreciate it until we listened to the Naked Tour guide's explanation of the clock. It is a marvel. My husband and I went up to the top and saw the city from above. The stairs going up were quite a trip. Along the walls of the tower there are many signs for one to read. I imagine in high season, the signs keep the crowds entertained. In May we galloped up the stairs like two gazelles. There is an elevator which goes to near the top. Eventually, everyone will have to walk up a spiral stairs to the observation deck. Once up there, it is madness because everyone wants to take photos and videos. When someone edges over to the outside wall, then one camps in that position until they have taken enough photos. Meanwhile, the people near the inside ring are trying to move around the inside. Some people are going left, some people are going right. It is a mess! But, it is a GREAT view of downtown. It is fun to take the photos from that position and then go to the ground level for the same photo. The cost was minimal. I can not imagine what it would be like in high season!"

I was impressed the clock is located in such a low height, approx. 5 meter from the ground, since they are normally located near top of the tower or church. That is why I could see the details of the statues around clock, and was surprised at the skelton death and saints near the clock. I also climed up the tower. I strongly recommend to take elevator rather than climbing up the internal spiral steps if you do not want to use the energy for this point (because you may need to walk around in old town). The elevator took us to the top of the tower for less than one minute. The veiw was nice for its red roofs and the big church in front of this tower, even though it was raining. The tower climbing is MUST-Do in Prague."

The symbolism evident is even more interesting. The skeleton chiming the bell on the hour indicates that the Great Leveller is watching and like time, applies to all. The three other statues on that level indicate vanity, greed and infidelity all relating to the results indicated by the skeleton. However, the answer to the impact of vice is shown when the two doors above open and a display of the apostles moving through the open spaces show the faithful the way. We overheard a tour guide telling people to watch the clock chiming as it would change their lives, his tongue was firmly in his cheek. Nevertheless, the clock is a clear indication of the time it was installed when few could read but all could understand the symbolism. It chimes on the hour from 9am to 9pm and a local joke is to tell people to watch it at 10pm. It only lasts a minute or so but its a feature not to be missed."

The clock is a historical marvel and survivor. You cannot visit Prague and not partake in this experience - it would be like missing out on the castle! Better yet, it is absolutely worth it to go up into the clock tower and see the square and 360 views of Prague from up high. For purchase is an excellent and educational two-sided, 8 page laminated fold out explaining and describing everything you need to know about the astronomical clock = its history, what it does, it's theory, how the horizon and positions of the tropics and equator are important, how to read the dial, what statutes are on it = on and on.

If you walk over to it there's an inconspicuous door that leads up to the top of the tower with one of the vest views of the Charles Bridge, castle, and surrounding city scape. It was weird because the door and entrance weren't marked, and at first we thought it might be a maintenance access and we weren't allowed to go up the stars, but our adventure side took hold and we were well rewarded.

But kept missing the hourly chimes until I made the effort to actually make a point of sitting in the overpriced restaurant opposite and awaiting the magical moment. When it came I was really disappointed with the display, perhaps I expected more? However what I found hilarious were the herds of Wildebeast tourists clapping and cheering, around the square like it was a live show.! Don't get me wrong this is one of those ancient masterpieces you have to see In ones life time I suppose, but do also go inside the tower for a small fee and you'll be rewarded with some stunning views across the city I promise you, that's after you survive the mad scrum and elbowing that goes on up there as there's hardly any room to swing a cat, I'm surprised someone hasn't fallen off already? Just be careful. Also, Hanus is the man who built this clock many years ago, and he supposedly had his eyes gouged out by the city fathers to stop him building another one.! So much for gratitude, but some say afterwards he got into the clock and put his hands in the mechanism damaging them in the process, putting the clock out of action for 80 yrs too, thus getting his revenge on the city.!Just remember that when you're jumping up and down screaming folks."

There are several walking tours that start here under the clock. On the hour the clock chimes and some of the pieces become animated. Usually at these times the area is very crowded. I think it is a good strategy to get a seat at one of the cafes at a table with a view and watch it seated while relaxing with a drink. The clock has some detail according to yearly, monthly, and hourly calendar. I would read up on the clock before you go to fully understand all the markings and fully enjoy the clock."

So you want to get there early, at least 10 minutes ahead, and find a good spot to watch the two small blue doors.I personally found the bell tower and the tour very interesting. The tour starts on the first floor. The tour starts on the hour, so you can see, through a large glass door, the Apostles and the mechanism that rotates them when the clock strikes the hour. Then you walk through the 5 houses that make up the Old Town Hall. The rooms and the furnishing are interesting, but what is particularly interesting is when you go into the lower floor, or what should be a basement of the Town Hall. You will be in houses that were built in the 1100's and all were occupied at least from the year 1190. You will also go through one that was an early debtors' prison, and walk on a street that was used for several hundred years, till the Old Town Square was raised to its current height. These 12th Century houses are the foundation for the \"modern\" Old Town Hall, but give us a view of life in year 1190 AD, something most of us will only see and experience once. The Old Town Hall Tower is wonderful. You can take the lift to the top, but I found it much more interesting to walk up. You do not want to walk down if you have vertigo. The spiral stairs from the top of the tower juts out in \"mid air\" and you are looking down about 8 stories. A couple of people coming down behind me had a serious problem with it. The view from within and outside can not be beat. Both the stairway and the glass lift are fascinating and it is even better once you walk around the outside on the tower walk. Terrific view! Great place for pictures of Prague."

Don't miss the opportunity to get tickets to get to the top of the tower where you will have the most fabulous view of Prague."

It is certainly a must see in Prague and the climb to the top of the town hall is well worth it.

Well worth the wait and you can climb the old tower and the views at the top are brilliant overlooking the city Cost of tower 110 kr worth the climb or you can take lift right to the top"

It does get really busy on the hour every hour as this is when the clock comes to life and chimes, moves etc. At this point the area in front of the clock is packed even in off peak times of the year. Definitely worth seeing but once you've seen it, it's probably not worth braving the crowds again. The town hall is impressive on it's own with some spectacular architecture that's also worth a look."

It is a unique clock which has been operational and showing the correct time since the 1300 . Every time the clock strikes 12 , there is music and an act of the clock , which is a huge attraction with the crowd . The attraction is crowded by the hour . You would get an opportunity to see it several time as it is in the heart of the city and cannot be missed .The old Town Hall has a good view from the top. This tower has a lift , so no climbing of stairs . It will cost 100 Kc which was good and worth it . If you go before 1700hrs , there are tours which show the inner working of the clock as week."

That said ...there is something about the lines and colors and flow of the actual clock face that I found simply striking. I love everyone of my pictures of it and every time I see it I am struck with the same awe. The movement of the 'statues' is at the top of the hour and while that is cool to see along with your 1,000 closest friends ... For me simply gazing at the clock face each time that we passed was delightful. Having lived on five continents - I've done my share of traveling ...and so far, there is something in that clock face that has me convo ended it is the most gorgeous man made thing I have ever seen. Sounds sappy, doesn't it? I know. I am hooked. So when you go to Prague and find yourself in the throngs at the top of the hour ... Stick so around once everyone has left and step a little closer. Check out the lines, the fluidity, the colors. The name date mechanism is pretty cool too."

So we went into the tower. With the beautifull winter sun, it was a great climb upstairs, with a good view over the city. It looked so nice. We spend 30 minutes up and looked to everything. Up to tower you will find all sorts of signs with information about tourits attractions in the city. Which you can also spot from the tower. The climb itself is very easy.

Sit at a table in one of the outdoor cafes that line the square, have a beer or wine, and in the course of an hour you will see people from every locale and walk of life and their actions will either fascinate you or make you cry. From this square you can spend a day roaming down all the pedestrian only side streets of old town. The clock seems to still be the focal point but if you really want aview of it you need to get in line in front of it no less then 15 minutes ahead of time. ."

First part can be reached by large gently rising stairs (up 3 floors I think) and then once ticket validated there is a ramp that goes around the lift shaft although at the end there is a tight spiral staircase to negotiate).

This area is usually very crowded but views from the top of the tower are spectacular and the famous clock worth seeing. We comically kept missing the clock show by a few minutes but finally timed it right. The skeleton representing death nods his head and two other figures shake theirs.Very quickly over so you must stake out a spot relatively close to the clock to see properly. We had a city tour with a guide who offered to take us on a tour of the underground below Town Hall. We were not sure but were very glad that we did. The floor of the underground space was actually once the street in medieval times. Then the buildings were raised due to flooding."

If you happen to pass by a the top of the hour (e.g. 12:00 or 4:00), there is a little show put on by the figures around the clock. It's not amazing but it is enjoyable. The crowds can get overwhelming around that time though.I would recommend getting out your travel book/guide while waiting for the clock to strike the top of the hour and read about the history of the tower and the meaning behind each detail. It's very interesting.If you wish to go to the top of the tower, you can purchase tickets at the base of the tower. When you initially go in, there are stairs (or an elevator) which take you to the first floor and there you exit to the left and climb more stairs and then a swirling ramp (or wait for the elevator) to the top. The views are spectacular and if you want to go outside be careful because it is very crowded and tight! Regardless, force your away around that entire balcony area because it is worth it! When I went to the top, there was even the option to dress up in medieval garb (for extra cost of course) and there was a man dressed in medieval outfit who was playing a trumpet - announcing the top of the hour when the astronomical clock's show was completed. If you have a young child who is collecting the badges around the city, one of the machines with the badge is at the top of the tower here.One last thing - when you first walk into the lobby and pass the bathrooms (which cost money), instead of going left up the stairs, go to the right. There is a GORGEOUS room that has a million little colored tiles that paints the most beautiful mosaic."

The way the saints come to the door to greet the viewer is something else, although that's not necessarily a good thing, in that the waiting time spent to get to watch the saints and the chiming of the bells is somewhat an anticlimax. My first thought was \"I waited all this time to see THAT?!\" And, truly, for each and every chiming of the clock, a large group of tourists has congregated, upwards of 200 people at one time. I sure hope their experience was different than mine, which was that the clock serves as a tourist trap lure for the surrounding merchants selling their crappy trinkets."

You can, however, spend that one hour exploring the tower, which will probably make for a more meaningful one hour. I didn't do that, and spent the rest of my time exploring the Town Hall - there wasn't much, although there was a Christmas market with interesting stuff on sale (I visited this place on St. Nicholas Day). There is a performance every hour, if I am not mistaken, and in my opinion, the performance was mediocre. So don't come here just for the performance; you just may be sorely disappointed.

Once at the top take your time to walk slowly round savouring the views down and around. Watch the bustling Old Town Square from way up high and then take in the stunning architecture of the various churches, cathedrals, castles and other buildings that feast before your eyes."

Read a little about the clock (like on Wikipedia) before you visit to fully appreciate the symbols and the fact that it was built way before electronics, computers, etc. The clock does attract large crowds, but it's high enough that you shouldn't have trouble seeing it. We didn't have problems with pick-pockets, but our guidebook reminded us that crowded places where everyone is distracted are good opportunities for pick-pockets, so hold your bag close as you enjoy the show.You can go up in the tower of the old town hall and enjoy EXCELLENT 360-degree views of Prague. Prague is so beautiful and fairy-tale-like, especially since it did not suffer bomb damage during WWII.Get your tickets at the base of the tower and then enter around the side. We recommend visiting the tower between the hours because if you go right after the clock show, the line can get long. The tickets were only about $5 US and worth it. The views are excellent, and you can stay as long as you like. I think there were some plaques too that pointed out some landmarks. Bringing a map of the city to compare to the scenery would be another way to enhance your visit at the top.You can take stairs or elevators to the top. The little room at the top has large windows all around, and there is a wrap-around balcony to go out on. The balcony is definitely the best way to enjoy the views, though that it is very narrow - we left our small umbrella stroller in the room."

Take a trip up it at night and look out over all of Prague. Most people took the lift (which I found a bit strange - doesnt this ruin the experience of the clock) so instead, walk it.

This clock is spectacular in Winter and even crowded during. At the time we were there , it was snowing and was so cold but didn't leave us tired to look at it. You can view there many guides from different nationalities that will give you the best information ever and would make you visit the town with its monuments as well a day Kutna Hora 70 km out of Prague.That is a place that you should visit as soon as you get to Prague! :D"

This was one of the more interesting clocks we've encountered around Europe and other areas of the world - the clock striking the hour isn't particularly unique but the statues are fairly different and very cute. However, what was particularly interesting to both of us was the Astronomical clock - even though I'm not nearly as interested in clocks as my husband is, I found it fascinating to see the complexity and beauty of this particular clock tower. And we found the glockenspiel 'show' interesting enough to plan our walking tours so we could see it more than once during our short stay in Prague. We purchased a small book, available in multiple languages, explaining the history and mechanics of the Astronomical Clock - very advanced technology for the times!You can also go up inside the tower in an elevator, which is really worth the small fee they charge - it was very crowded, both outside to watch the hour striking and inside at the top of the tower. We had to wait in line to enter the elevator to go up and again to descend, but it wasn't as annoying as many other crowds, perhaps because it was almost all people who shared a common interest. For the most part, everyone was considerate and even though it was raining during one of the displays, people did their best to hold their umbrellas so they wouldn't block the view of others wanting to see the clock - in some cases, even putting their umbrella away so they wouldn't disturb others. In addition to the entertainment from the clock itself, there are many interesting things in the surrounding square so it's well worth the time to see this and you'll have plenty to keep you occupied while you wait for the clock to strike the hour."

The event is nothing startling, a clock striking the hours and some statues rotating. More interesting is the actual Astronomical part to the clock and the history. The views from the top are worth the climb. Saying that there are not many stairs to climb. There is a ramp going around the inside of the tower to just below the floor of the top level which you then access via a tight spiral staircase. Access is controlled by a green and red light, though some tourists either didn't understand red meant stop and give people from the opposite level priority or were just being ignorant as some tourists are.Once at the top the views are fantastic.On a funny note, we were waiting for the clock to strike when a tourist actually stopped me and asked for the time. I then pointed out the various clocks, thinking to myself, is this location as famous as it is made out to be?"

To get a good look at the clock, which is lovely, aim to avoid anything up to 15 minutes before the hour- the crowd begins to gather early."

The Tower housing the Clock preceded it by about 150 years: the clock itself dates from 1490. The Old Town Hall sufferred massive damage in WWII but, as with so many other things in this beautiful city, the restoration not only of the original but of all the surrounding buildings has been meticulous in restoring the authenticity of the surrounds and the sense that you are experiencing living history. The elaborately gilded and presented Clock parades the 12 Apostles on the hour every hour between 0900 and 2100, so be sure to obtain the best vantage point for your photography before the immense crowds gather to witness this special and unique presentation. Why is it so much better than a similar display in Munich? Because Prague's is also astronomically correct, it has scenes of life in each of the 12 calendar months portrayed in the lower disc, and it has the relevant zodiac sign also highlighted. It is something to behold and, in the splendour of the Old Town Square itself, will create an indelible impression on you. The Tower housing the Clock can also be climbed (fee payable) to give you some truly special views over the Old Town (\"Stare Mesto\")."

Our first time at the clock was at noon and we enjoyed the \"show\", but we did not really think it was a \"must see\". Our second visit to the clock swiftly changed our minds. The hourly \"show\" at the clock is quaint, but the MUST SEE is the view from the top!! If you do nothing else in Prague, you should see the view from the top of the clock. 360 degrees of the city in all it's glory. If you are not into heights, you may find it a bit disturbing as the observation ledge is open with about a waist-high wall. But if you are fine with it, be sure to step out on the corners and look down on the Old Town Square."

Lot's of people for this hourly show but unlike other places in the city where it the crowds impacted your appreciation, someone the crowds here seemed part of the festivity. Watch for wedding parties! Because the clock is in the Town Hall evidently a lot of people go there to be married. We saw four different couples while we waited for the clock!The clock was created in the 14th century but heavily destroyed in WW II so much of the clock today is a reconstruction. The clock keeps time in Bohemian and modern time; shows the times of sunrise and sunset. In the 19th century the circle below shows the signs of the zodiac, scenes from the seasons and a ring of saint's names, one for each day of the year. The show is over very quickly but is fun. Watch the skeleton which represents death; and the doors open above the top ring. After the show the hour is rung but depending upon when you go, the time may be wrong as it doesn't recognize daylight savings time! Be sure to climb the Town Hall Tower as it gives a great view of Old Town and helps orient you to the rest of Prague. The cost is nominal (60 Kc - about $3.00) and can be reached by an entrance to the right of the Astronomical Clock. There is an elevator."

If you want a great view, directly in front of the clock is best to see the full potential. The crowds were not too busy when we went but as people are close together and are watching the clock they can be caught unaware by pickpockets - as always be mindful of your belongings. To go into the town hall, you need to purchase tickets (around 100CZK). This, however, did not allow you admittance to everything and some of the rooms inside needed further payment. In the town hall, you can either walk up the steps or get the lift to the top & see some fantastic views of Prague. If you walk up the steps, there is lots of information about the clock & it's history."

Again, huge crowds made it difficult for those of us who are not tall to see well and to take good photographs, but the experience was certainly entertaining.The guide had already warned us, though, to be careful of pick-pockets in the crowd. Our good guide then purchased tickets for us to ascend the Tower, thankfully by elevator, and the view of Prague's rooftops was wonderful. It was a little scary, though, that some of our group insisted that they could feel the tower swaying under the weight of all the tourists up there!"

The clock tower is just an accident waiting to happen. There is an enclosure on the top with a door that goes out to the 4-sided balcony. You can walk up to the top of the tower or a lift goes right up. This system of human traffic is poorly organised. There is very limited space atop the tower's waiting area but the lift keep sending the crowd up plus those that walk up causing the waiting area to be packed whilst people in the balcony are staying long to take pictures or just pushing to move through. Seriously avoid this place if you have very small children, have difficulty with mobility or is claustrophobic. My experience is in summer where the whole of Prague is besieged by tourists, perhaps it'll be better outside of summer. The view on the top is great but manoeuvrability was so bad we didn't go all around it."

One major plus for the tower is there is a lift to take you to the top! No need to walk up the stairs unless you want to do it! We have been up quite a few towers and cathedral during out trip so getting to the top without the hard effort is pretty refreshing. Once up top, you get a pretty good view of the city. Most of the main buildings in the area are explained on some nice information board on the tower. You will be offered a panaroma map of the area on your way up too. It cost a bit but is a good sourvenir. If you are just after the information of the buildings, then don't bother buying it as the information board offers more info. We spent about 20 minutes up on the tower before coming back down using the stairs which went around the lift. On the way down you get a lot of information about the astronomical clock. Time your visit well so that you can be back down on the hour mark to watch the astronomical clock. We didn't do the museum tour as it needs to be a guided tour and english tours are scheduled on certain hours so check on the time if you plan to visit the museum. Overall, a good place to visit and probably a must see when you are in Prague. Can't really miss it unless you are not in the old town at all as it is right there in the town square!"

On the other hand, many wedding couples took their pictures outside the clock tower with their limousine or beautifully made horse-carriage. It was very unforgettable moment. One recommendation: take city map when you arrive in Prague central station, there's Prague city tour coupons in it. Bring these coupons when you visit the clock tower and old square, the guides usually dressed in yellow t-shirt. They are very knowledgeable, informative, friendly...really worth it."

See if you can see the map of the world. Underneath the clock is a second dial. On the outer rim are 365 names, one for each day of the year. These are the list of names which all Czech people have to choose from when naming their child. If they wish to use a different name then they have to apply. The Czech's also name a birthday and a name day...If you want to know more about the clock, then take a free tour with Keith (green t-shirt) fascinating.Also, view the clock from the top of the tower - well worth itThe view the crowds from one of the cafe's whilst sipping a cocktail or beer - again a completely different perspectiveEnjoy!"

Half of the crowd outside the clock looked like the usual gypsies waiting to prey on wide- eyed, naive tourists.I also took offense when some local schoolchildren shouted out the words:\"ni hao! ni hao!\" to me and my family ... When we responded that we were not Chinese, they retorted :\"well you all look e same to us! \" with a tone notches above sarcasm.We've been to many European cities for the past decades, and it is seldom that we encounter remarks such as these. It is also unfortunate that the next day a cab driver scowled at us and mumbled, \"Asians ... \" (followed by some words in his own language ) . Don't get me wrong though, the attraction itself is charming and so is the rest of the city especially at night but I'm not the first one to think Prague may not be as open or ready to accept ALL tourists just yet."

There are multiple restaurants near the clock and some offer great views of the clock face. One of the main streets into the central square is Prague's version of Rodeo Drive.

But the tour provided excellent insight into the history of the city (as well as into the inner workings of the Astronomical Clock). Best of all, though, and totally unexpected, was the view of Prague from the top of Old Town Hall, especially given its proximity to the awesome (at least from the outside) Tyn Church. We did the last tour of the day, in March, so it was dark by the time we climbed to the top, but the views at night from high up were truly spectacular -- on a par, though from a different location, with the view of the city from the top of the Klementium."

Afterwards we went up the tower and saw beautiful views of Prague. You can either take the lift or stairs up and is well worth the time. Afterwards we got the tour in english of the old town hall. This was awful. The building itself was great but our guide (a blonde girl whos name I cant remember) had awful english and was unable to answer one question the group put to her.

There are also HORDES of tourists that gather out front before the hour to watch it. They are fun to watch too, but make it hard to see the clock if you don't arrive a bit early! Prague overall is a bit touristy, and this scene captures it perfectly, which I actually found a bit off putting.You can go up the clock for a view of Old Town Square. The view is nice, though there are plenty of nice Prague views, and this might not be the best. There's an elevator up, but it's worth it to walk down to see the little clocks and info posted on the walls on the way down.You can also take a tour of Old Town Hall, which was fun and interesting. You get a view of the back of the apostles (in the clock), and learn about the rooms and paintings in the (now unused) town hall. The tour also takes you underground- you learn about the rooms there, which were ground level until they raised the level of the city. It's interesting if you're into that sort of thing.Tickets for the clock are in the tourist booth underneath, or inside if you go up to the entrance (through the Town Hall). Tickets for the town hall tour are also inside, if you go upstairs. Unless you're a student, it's cheaper to buy a combo ticket."

It was very odd. I couldn't see where these wedding parties were entering the tower, so it was like a drive-in chapel or something. Whatever priest or whoever was performing the ceremonies was just crankin' 'em out.I would not suggest getting a meal at the restaurant right in front of the clock tower; it was expensive. If you're looking to secure a seat in front of the clock before it chimes at the top of the hour, just buy a coffee or a Pils (traditional Czech beer) instead of a meal to save money."

It is worth a visit before or after enjoying the astronomical clock. (We did not climb the tower so cannot comment on that.)"

After we\u2019d watched the display and the crowds had dissipated slightly, we decided to use the lift to go up to the top of the Old Town Hall. The view was stunning and stretched far out over Prague. If you are not afraid of heights (there are safety bars above the wall, although it doesn't look like it from below!), it is a must-see and is still one of the most memorable parts of our visit to Prague. We spent quite a while just taking in the sights and only decided to leave when it started to get busy again as it neared the hour. My advice would be, if you are keen to avoid the crowds and mainly want to see the breath-taking views, avoid visiting on the hour, but if you want to see a little part of Prague tradition, get there in time to see the display start!"

Don't worry about getting right at the front of the crowd as you can see the apostles doing their thing as long as you are facing the clock. Our guide for the day, Michael from Sandemans, told us the macabre story of how the maker of this incredible time piece had his eyes and tongue removed so that he wouldn't pass on his clock-making secrets. In turn, he sabotaged his creation by listening to its movement and making it stop for many years. This is just one of the fascinating tales of Prague. Just as fascinating is sitting in the Old Square and people watching - all characters and countries are there. On any given day there could be a pianist playing requests, people making giant bubbles, a cockatoo or two and living statues - together with beggars who seem to have adopted a kind of martyr pose on their knees, their backs bent and their palms upwards - a position they can stay in for hours at a time. Younger visitors will get hussled by guys trying to recruit them for one of Prague's many nightly pub crawls. Eating and drinking close to the Astronomical Clock is not the cheapest choice as it is obviously a readymade tourist trap but it is still worth lingering a while to take it all in. Then meander off to the Jewish Quarter or Charles Bridge."

In summer, there is always an entertainer or event in the main square, and hundreds of shops and pubs line the square and several blocks in every direction. The astronomical clock is the center piece, still working after 300 years. Tourists are everywhere and hard to find a quiet spot, but a walk down a small alley can bring a surprise shop or hidden pub. The walk up to the top of the clock tower is worth the view over the square. Most everything is near here -- the Charles bridge, the Jewish quarter, etc. and the public system of trams and metros make getting to and from here a breeze. I live in the southwest US where we have no public transport system, and even I could figure out how to catch trams and metros in just a single day. We drove to our hotel and left the car there for the whole week while using local transport, which is fast, convenient, and cheap. A 24 hour ticket which lets you use all trams, buses, and metros is 110 kc, or about $6. It's worth saying that Prague is the only European city in the area that was not destroyed in WWII, so all the buildings are just as they were built daring back to 1400's. My last comment is that Prague is a great value for your money. We went to Vienna and have been to Amsterdam and Belgium and we would go back to Prague again given any choice of middle European country, as there is lots to do and see, and food and shops are much cheaper compared to countries using the Euro."

To know more about this Clock, one must spend some money to get a chance to see the inside. In particular, the guided tour will take you back in time layer by layer, century after century. You can see important paintings of Jan Hus (religious leader) at Constance and John Amos Comenius (philosopher). There are also torture equipment, a dungeon, two water tanks, a well which still has water in it, a stone carving dated 1699, etc. All these are history of Prague and shall not be missed if you have time. Beware there are only a very limited number of guided tours everyday. The day I went, there was only 1 English guided tour at 9:30 a.m. for the entire day. If you missed it, you have to wait for another day. Guided tours of other languages on that day included Deutsch at 10 a.m., Cesky at 4:30 p.m., and Francais at 5:00 p.m. Those were all the tours of that day. It is therefore important to plan ahead and determine what you want to see before you go there."

It was installed in 1572 and shows not only the current time, but relates the movement of the planets with the signs of the zodiac. Of course, the main attraction is when, on the hour, bells ring, rooster crows and apostles dance with thousands of tourists watching this little show, rain or shine."

The show little show that occurs on the hour (not sure it occurs on the hour, went a while ago), is again cool but only watch it if you happen to be in the area when it happens, don't wait around for it. I would even suggest going 10-20 minutes after it in peak season, escape some of the crowds).The best part of this attraction is the panoramic view of the city you get from the top of the Town Hall, even on a cloudy day like the day I went up.

Here's a great tip for the clock. Plan to stay for two top of the hours so you can experience once at ground level (large crowds) then immediately go inside and ride the elevator to the top and experience it from atop the tower. Not only is it one of the best views of the city you'll also hear the trumpet play from all four sides which is exactly as they did back in the 1400's. Highly recommend the clock and old town."

Entry is from an adjacent building. Most people prefer to take the elevator so there will probably be a queue leading into the narrow gap leading to the tower. We chose to walk up the ramp and found it easy going (a ramp is certainly easier than hundreds of steps) There is a small spiral staircase at the top of the ramp into the tower (which is monitored by a set of traffic lights to alert the people in the tower that others are on the spiral staircase).The view is quite spectacular - don't miss it!"

Of course, if you climb up there is lot of information to be had on the Old Town Hall and its various historical details. The views from the top is just stunning! You will see the Old Town square and the magical city of Prague from a different viewpoint. You must do it!After you are through, buy an inexpensive ticket of just 60K (discounted as you have done the tower) and take a one hour guided tour to the Town Hall (they do it in English at regular intervals). You will get a different feel about the place and also visit the underground Romanesque Basement, the water wells, prison, and also see the Town Hall rooms which are presently in use for ceremonial occasions, admire the beautiful art works, fireplaces etc. All in a space of entire duration of 2 hours. Trust me, you will come out enriched. Very few people do that, they are just happy with the clock."

We recently visited Prague for a few days, staying right on the old town square which afforded us much time around Orloj, otherwise known as the Astronomical Clock. This is the third oldest (and oldest working) astronomical clock in the world, beautifully situated in the Old Town Square in Prague. The hype about the 15th century Orloj is well-deserved. The clock itself is attractive, photogenic and it is entertaining to watch the 'The Walk of the Apostles' hourly performance while visiting the Astronomical Clock. Crowds gather quite heavily upon the hour to see the show. Crowd gatherings seemed much larger during our recent visit to Prague compared to those in the past, you still have nice vantage points due to the height of the clock face. We did find that this was still possible to visit first thing in the morning when the old town square was clear and have Orloj, all to yourself. That was nice. Another nice way to experience the Astronomical Clock is from Cafe Mozart, which is on the second floor, across from and facing the Clock, affording very nice and unobscured views. Overall, Orloj is one of the two most easily recognisable clocks along with Big Ben in London, in our opinion. It is a very good attraction that is well worth experiencing multiple times when you are visiting Prague. It costs nothing to experience and has a nice history to it as well (Its worth reading up on the history of Orloj before visiting), making this an easy five star attraction in the city of Prague. In addition to seeing Orloj while visiting the Old Town Square, you should also make a bit of time to visit the Church of the Virgin Mary before Tyn, the Church of Saint Nicholas, the Jan Hus monument and you can visit the row of stands that sell sausages, drinks other foods, making this an atmospheric place to spend some time while in Prague."

It is colorful, complex, very close to the ground ( at least the lower dial), and for me, a real icon of the genius of astronomical and zodiacal calculation in the 15th century. The hourly show is cute, and is worth a look, but be forewarned: the \"show\" is quite short."

Be warned, it only lasts a few seconds, and then it is over, and some will be very hard to see as it is up very high. The skeleton rings his bell, the 12 disciples rotate about, and the rooster gives a very sad sounding crow. The trumpeteer then blows his horn. The best part was paying to go to the top, although in busy times, plan on a long wait; took up 45 minutes just to wait in line to get to the top. But the views from up top are great of the city and Tyn Cathedral. If you are there during the top of the hour, you can wave down at the people in the square!"

Be sure to be around just before the hour though since it gets crowded pretty quickly in front of the clock.The 100Kc entrance fee was completely worth it. Even if you're not interested in the history behind the clock and the mechanics of it all, the views from the top of the tower is spectacular. One thing to note though is that the walkway is quite narrow at the top and can be packed with over-excited tourists, so be careful!"

We had the perfect view of the entire display on the hour. We were amazed to hear that there was a real trumpeter at the top of the clock tower, as we had thought it was a recording. That was the cherry on the cake for us. The area does tend to get crowded at the times of the chiming but not so much that your view would be restricted as the clock face is above eye level, so no matter who is in front of you, you will still get a great view. This Astronomical Clock is the third oldest in the world and Prague should be very proud of this amazing structure. There is a lovely atmosphere in this part of town too, very party like and friendly."

The Astronomical Clock is more colorful, looks much more interesting. Few people is interested with its history. Every body is waiting in front of it to see the walk of the apostles and striking of the time. Once they saw the apostles walk, they move away. The same people return to the same spot the next day again again. There is a funny thing which attracts people to this clock. When you visit Prague one should go and see it.

To me it is the main symbol of old Prague and everything that I love about the city. The tower offers good views of the old town and there is a separate, poorly publicised tour, of the underground passages, tunnels, dungeons and old streets that run under the tower and its adjacent buildings. We purchased tickets for the underground tour from a separate agency just off the old square - I don't believe that you can pay for access at the tower itself. The ground level in Prague old town was raised in the Middle Ages after serious flooding. As a consequence when you enter the old buildings you are entering what was originally a first floor room - hence all the old buildings having extensive cellars (their original ground floors). Don't miss the underground trips - they are the best part of the tower visit."

A skeleton figure halfway up the clock structure pulls a chord that rings the bell in the tower. Then two panels slide back and figures representing the twelve apostles rotate past the windows (6 in each) and last of all, a golden cockerel crows, flaps its wings and turns its head. This all lasts about 20 seconds."

There is a lift for those who don't feel able to climb stairs. The stairs aren't too bad to climb, the tower bit is a ramp rather than steps and the very last bit is a spiral staircase which is quite tight but there is a traffic light system to ensure no one else is coming down or up at the same time. The view from the top is brilliant. Looking down on the square is great, the crowd watching the clock look like ants around the chocolate box houses and there are great views of the rest of the city.

Every hour there is a little 'show' at the clock, the skeleton will ring the bell and then there is a kind of rotating figures at the windows for you to see. I heard the guys around there said it last 26 seconds (but I didn't count it though, so it was not confirmed). The show, honestly, didn't have anything special. It is cute to see for you to put a smile and laugh out loud after it finished, but do not expect much. There is a bird's eye view tower at the top at clock. It is worth to see. You can see the town of Prague from that. The view is magnificent and it cost like 50 kc for students discount."

The organisation now is deffinitely better. There are guided tours along all the place - the gothic chapel, historical halls and the cellars, you don't need to read a text any more. The tours are each half an hour and there is a schedule with the languages for all the day. You can enter without any problem, see when there is a tour in your language and there you can organise yourself. Every day languages are Czech, English and French, then you may have a tour in German, Italian, Spanish and other language - depends on a day. In case you don't want to wait for a tour - you can go with a text by yourself without the cellars - that is only with the guide. The tickets are even cheaper - the full price is 100 crowns, combined ticket (halls, underground and tower) is the same - 160 crowns, reductions for students, opencard holders, seniors (over 65 and 75) and a family ticket.Sono qui ad aggiornare la mia precedente recensione - in quanto non mi era piaciuta la traduzione fatta da trip advisor - ora la faccio direttamente io :).Siccome \u00e8 cambiata la gestione al municipio, sono cambiate alcune cose. Per vedere le sale storiche ci sono ora le visite guidate che partono ogni mezz'ora (il prezzo \u00e8 compreso della guida) e ogni mattina ci sta un orario di tutte le lingue in cui si faranno le visite quel giorno. Quindi voi venite, vedete gli orari e potete tranquillamente scegliere in che lingua e a che ora fare la visita e secondo questo vi organizzate la giornata. La visita dura circa 45 min e i costi sono quasi uguali. Il biglietto combinato - le salle, i sotterranei e la torre - costa uguale - 160 corone, il biglieto separato \u00e8 un poco pi\u00f9 economico - 100 corone. Altre riduzioni per gli studenti, bambini, seniori (pi\u00f9 65 e 75 anni) e biglietto famiglia.Le lingue assicurate sono ceco, inglese e francese, poi secondo i giorni fanno cambio tedesco, russo, italiano, spagnolo e altre. Nel caso in cui non vuolete attendere la visita, riceverete il testo e le salle vedete da soli - senza i sotterranei. L\u00ec si pu\u00f2 andare solo con la guida."

It is surrounded by numerous shops and restaurants but I don't recommend most of them since I am sure they are overpriced. Venture into the narrow streets and increase your odds of finding a cheaper, better place. If you are interested in wandering around and getting lost in the old streets of Prague, the Old Town Hall will serve as an excellent reference point for you to get back your bearings. If you based your experience of Prague's Old Town Hall on viewing the 'performance' of the 600-year-old Astronomical Clock, I am almost certain that it will be flat and anti-climatic. But the clock is not what the Old Town Hall is about. It is a busy, crowded and touristy place but like all great squares and plazas in the world, you should not miss it for the incredible atmosphere it generates."

Definitely buy the bread and dunk it in the hot wine. Now, for the clock--I don't get what the fuss is about other than it is a really old cuckoo clock that chimes on the hour (and half with half a performance). Pedestrian traffic stops for the 15 minutes before it sounds and you would think the Pope was approaching with hundreds and thousands of people gawking to get a view (look up people--no need to push to the front). The square is exceptionally lovely at night too."

The views from the top of the Town Hall are amazing and definitely the best way to get a panoramic view of the city, worth the ticket price alone! There is a lift for those who find it hard to negotiate the journey to the top on foot, though it is not really 'stairs', more of a long, continual incline that wraps around the inside of the tower in a big square spiral!The clock was a little disappointing in its simplicity and brevity, it was over before we knew what was happening, but still a nice and quaint little quirk to see while you're there, plus it is free, so who is complaining!?"

You can go inside and climb the steps - or better yet take the elevator - to the top for an amazing view of the city. On your way back down, talk to the friendly attendant and they explain how the clock works and you can pick up a copy of the brochure that explains it for a small price. Don't miss it!"

Our guide for the second part gave the tour in English, Russian and Portugese and was incredibly knowledgable and enthusiastic about the history of these areas.Fascinating history, well conducted tour and very good value."

This clock is one of those crazy intricate clocks that tells you everything from the season to the size of your shoes. The craziest part of it is that is was made in the 1400's! Yes, at the same time that Tamerlane was killing 20 million across Asia, the plague was killing Europeans, Columbus was getting lost in the ocean, and to get around you walked or rode a horse...these folks were creating clocks that were accurate to the tenth of a second. To read all the information on the clock, you need a 15 minute course of instruction or a real thick manual. I like machinery, and this one is pretty cool. Make your way down to the Old Square and watch it on the hour, but beware; everyone else is heading there as well, and it will be packed.

A little boy behind me was crammed into me so many times he was crying.Again, the clock was AMAZING - to think that in the 14th Century (i think) they could have such knowledge of astronomy is just incredible.

If you are there on the hour, you can wave at the tourists below and get a close up view of the trumpeter signalling from the tower. The only downside was a lot of tourist tripe on display & sale; souvenir coins, pay to dress up in costume etc, and the staff seemed to be totally indifferent to visitors and very bored."

Make sure you keep an eye on your personal belongings when you watch the show as people are packed together pretty closely and it would be easy to get a purse or camera lifted. That being said it is worth it to watch the short show and read about how intricate the clock working are."

Beware of the gigantic portions otherwise you will ended up paying more than you expected.

Then, on the hour, the figures begin to move and doors open at the top to display 12 mechanical Apostles (starting with St Peter and ending with Barnabas) who reveal themselves two-by-two to the crowd below. A costumed herald plays a tune from atop the clock tower before he waves cheerfully to the throng below. The hotel directly across the street has a rooftop terrace where you can also watch the show while sipping some of Prague's excellent beer. A must see/must do while in Prague."

The cost was worth it.The clock really is a marvel and when seen with the knowledge of its age and so on can be enjoyed most fully.

My first thing to do having seen it was to buy a souvenir version to take home to join all my other much loved 'unusual' clocks. I loved the hour strike where the figures moved past the windows above it and then a real-life trumpeter played a piece of music. This seemed to be all day and everyday. There seems to be a terrible story behind it all though according to a tour guide, where its inventor was blinded after making it so that he wouldn't be able to build another clock elsewhere."

They will help you if you wish to buy, but will not heckle you. And that makes all the difference.

If you look closely it doesnt just tell the time, but also has the zodiac cycle, the old czech time scale with harvesting cycle, and movements of the sun and the moon. The Apostles come out to greet the crowd every hour and the four figures at the sides of the clock represent Vanity, Greed, Death, and Pleasure - apparently the 4 undesirable qualities during that era. We joined a walking tour starting from the Stare Mesto and our tour guide shared an interesting story about the clock maker as well.

If you happen to be in the Old Town square at the right time, sticking around for a couple of meetings is okay, but I certainly can't recommend hanging out for any period of time just for this. It's very crowded, and the whole thing lasts only a minute or two. A skeleton pulls the chain, ringing the bell; some Apostles come out and a rooster crows. That's about it. However, the view from the tower is great. You buy a ticket at the counter a few doors to the left of the clock. You can then walk to the top, or take the sequence of two elevators.

The view is amazing! Again, go early in the morning as there are less people - probably only 5-10 others when I was there at 10am....I think everyone else was in the crowd downstairs waiting for the clock to do its thing at 10am!"

This was great to watch and really interesting as there seems to be a set of traditional wedding photos in Czech Republic that have to be taken (there were brides walking about everywhere!).We were given a tip that the view from the town hall tower is good, but they charge 110 czk just to get to the top of the tower, we were told to go to the Hotel U Prince which is just behind the town hall, go to the lift press the button for the top floor (scenic view) and have a drink there where the view is just as good if not better (and less than 110 czk)"

Thankfully no tall buildings have been allowed to be built otherwise this historic place would not be so enjoyable. There are two separate lifts - best to get them both as the steps are quite steep and narrow in places. Mind you if you go up the stairs there are lots of informative displays. The astronomical clock is set into the tower and is free to anyone who is passing. It is beautiful but when it strikes on the hour it is extra entertainment. Go early to avoid the crowds. It gets really busy from 11:00 am onwards. As others have said it is the audience that is more interesting than the clock as it strikes.

The city hall was good, but the catcombs tour under the city hall was great. If showed how Prague many years back was a city around 10 feet lower and due to floooding by the Vltava river time and again, the city kept rising.

Being pushed and shoved in the midst of so many people, while trying not to lose my children is nerve wracking. The clock and tower are wonderful. The workmanship is impeccable. The story behind the clock and how the clock maker's eyes were plucked out so he could not create another one for another king, was sad. If you really NEED to see the clock move when it strikes the hour, there is a little outdoor cafe directly in front of the tower. Go in and have lunch, grab a table on the outside patio. Enjoy from there and don't get shoved all around while you stare up at the tower."

When you get to the top there's a narrow walkway round the edge where two people can squeeze past each other (just) so it can get a little claustrophobic and it does prevent wheelchair users from getting round, so they'll be confined to the room at the top.As for the display on the hour, as I put above, it's fun, it's an impressive achievement based on the age of the clock and it's an important bit of Prague"

You can walk all the way around the top of the tower, so you get a 360-degree view of the city and you can get some great pictures. If you time your visit near the top of the hour, make sure to stay out of the way of the trumpeter. You're going to be at Old Town Square at some point on your visit, so plan an extra 30 minutes and make the trip to the top of the tower while you're there."

Before we reached the old town hall we had seen numerous photographs in the guide books, but attractive though they are they do not do this ancient structure justice. The clock is a riot of colour, and although the symbols are generally recognisable, they did not facilitate the telling of the time! But who cares, it was just gorgeous. The Old Town Hall is a typical medieval tall building with a tower on top, and a walkway for the public around it. The interaction of the trumpeter and the crowd up in the tower, caused much laughter amongst the crown in the street below as the trumpeter had difficulty finding a spot to sound the trumpet, at our 2pm sighting. He then had to go round to the next side of the tower, and repeat the process! He is colourfully dressed and well worth seeing. best to see him on a dry day, though, as your heads are tilted upwards for a few minutes."

In hearing about it ahead of time, I thought: Yes, whatever, so it chimes and something comes out and goes back in. Haven\u2019t I seen that just once or twice before? We bought The New Guide to Prague from a street vendor only to find out from our guide the next day that it was a ten-year old edition. Not to worry, the mechanisms of the clock have not changed since 1410 when it was built. Yes, you read that year correctly. It was astounding. A death skeleton pulls a cord, making the clock chime, he turns an hour-glass slowly over and over to signal the passing of another hour of our lives. He\u2019s in company with vanity, greed and gluttony of pleasure. Several of the disciples traipse across two open windows above the clock and above them still, at the height of the tower, a trumpeter outfitted in A Knight\u2019s Tale fashion tops off the hour with a tune. Everyone applauds and in that moment we are all united as people enjoying a show always are\u2014together in time for thirty seconds."

Large crowds gather every hour to hear the chimes and see the 12 apostles march through the trap door. It is an imposing clock - one of the oldest and most elaborate astronomical clocks ever built . It's history can be traced from 1410 when first constructed. The clock faced a great number of breakdowns over the centuries. In 1490 a craftsman named Hanus Carolinum worked on the clock. Legend has it that fear of him replicating it, led to him being blinded! He is said to have thrown himself into the mechanism to destroy his work. It was repaired periodically through history in 1787 by watchmaker Jan Landesberg, In 1805, and in 1860 went through major renovation. It was seriously damaged in 1945 during the war and then it was only on 1st July 1948 that the bells were chiming again. I truly enjoyed the music it made...and would recommend a visit - if only for the history in which it is steeped!"

The Astronomical clock in old town Prague is the oldest such clock in the world, built back in the fifteenth century and has functioned on and off through the centuries, today it is functional and has been so for quite a few years. Appearance-wise, it is a masterpiece and in such a a beautiful, restored condition. One can look at it for hours, studying all the details, statues, drawings, colors, and definitely in trying to understand the mechanics and how it functions. Also at the hour the Clock chimes and a procession of the statues comes in and out of the windows, as well as a skeleton statue that rings the bell.Once there the visitor should definitely go up the clock tower, it is quite a hike on a narrow stairscase, but the 360 degree views of the whole city is worth climbing every step. If you are into photography, the views will offer some great pictures. I climbed up in the afternoon and the place was packed, so give yourself about 30-60 minutes if you plan to take some good pictures and to take in the views. Now I wonder how it might have looked at night...There is no fee to see the clock, but there is a small one to go up the tower.The clock is situated at the opening of Prague's town center, so once done with this attraction one can explore the rest of the beauty that old town has to offer."

The square that houses the famous Astronomical Clock is always busy, packed for the hourly mechanical display of marching Apostles and full of eateries of every imaginable quality. To be honest, the clock is no big deal. A lone trumpeter blows a few notes on the hourly striking to add a touch of drama. He'd need to plummet to the ground to make much of an impact.

There's some pseudo-cuckoo clock action going on and some trumpets playing. Of course, see it at least once. During the time I was in Prague in the same area, it gets tiring seeing it so many times. It's also pleasant to take pictures when it's in-between hours so there's not so much crowd.The Old town Hall Tower, even though you have to pay (4.25 euro), gives a good view of the whole vicinity.

The statues of the Apostles appear at the doorways above the clock, with all twelve presented every hour. After the clock chimes and the figures move, a trumpeter appears at the very top of the clock and trumpets over the crowd. Be warned that while this is a not to be missed sight, Pick Pockets know that unsuspecting tourists will have their attention diverted and their eyes upward and not on each other. Watch your bags, purses and wallets here!"

The rooster crows and moves, the skeleton and the Merchant also move and, through the windows, one can see a procession of the Apostles move. The guide explained that the skeleton represents Death and it is telling the Merchant that it will soon be his time and the Merchant shakes his head because he does not want to agree."

I was only in Prague for a few days to attend a conference and as soon as I could leave I took the underground train to Old Town square. The astronomical clock intrigued me as I studied some of its background beforehand. At 12 o'clock of each hour the clock goes through a ritual of movement of the figurines on the clock, where each of them has a meaning and a trumpet is blown to end it off. Masses of people gather in front of the clock in anticipation of the clock 'coming alive' and the last movement ends at 21:00 every day. There is so much more to see and experience on the Square and surroundings, lots of curio shops, even the informal market and the Jewish area, all within walking distance.Worthwhile to spend money on a short tour with a travel guide who gives you background on all the places they take you to, most of the tours include a trip on the river. The popular tourist areas of PRAGUE is so beautiful, generally restaurants are a bit expensive though."

And it's really old.But don't expect fireworks. Matter of fact, when the cock finally croaks out his last crow, you might wonder if you've missed something.But you're there for the spectacle, and the wonder at how old this thing is, how it's evolved through the centuries, how it survived WWII (actually, it didn't), and just how the heck did they make all those parts move in sync.And if you're there in winter, find a table at one of the sidewalk cafes (propane heaters and blankets provided), grab a cup of hot chocolate and watch the show.By the way, if you need to know what time it is, don't forget your watch as this clock is truly an \"astronomical\" clock. No hour hands. But it will tell you sunrise and sunset, and the phase of the moon, and the day of the month, and the signs of the zodiac, and just exactly where the sun is in it's path around the earth ... Wait a minute. What!? Yep, it's that old, before Copernicus had persuaded us otherwise."

Each hour, the clock will strike and there will someone at the tower who would blow the trumpet. Best time to take photos is during the daytime as there is not much light around at night. Read up the history of the clock to appreciate more of the clock as there was a time when the clock was 'cursed' by the one of the makers whose eyes were blinded so that he cannot make the same clock else."

It's just a path that go's up not really stairs. You have a great view over the old town square and over prague. A real must. When the clock strikes it is very crowded.

It also stays open quite late, so if you're looking for something to do in the evening this is a possibility. If you choose to take the staircase you can also read the display placards, which will tell you more about the history of the tower and the clock than you will find in the guidebook.

One secret that many people don't know about is that you can climb to the top of the tower just to the right of the clock. It is VERY worth the view. You can see much of Prague from the top and if you are a photographer, this is a must. The area is swamped by tourists and while in the past year I have been there in March and in December/January, there were a LOT of tourists. I cannot imagine what summers are like.

After that that was it. Then there is the Christmas market. Must try - mulled wine. The hot dog that I had was average but enough to keep you warm during winter. There's a Tourist Information Centre just next to the Astronomical Cloak. There are flyers that give you ideas of what to do and see in Prague.

            "review": "This clever 600-year-old clock tower is the natural heart of Prague. This astronomical clock, built in 1410, is surprisingly colorful, and with multiple moving hands and rings, you can spend several minutes deciphering everything it's trying to tell you, from the time of day, to the phase of the moon, to the current sign of the Zodiac. It's set in the side of a marvelous stone tower, and this building epitomizes the Old World charm I was delighted to see in Prague. It stands in Old Town Square, which is the heart of historic Prague, and the plaza is large enough that you'll always find a place to stand for a good view, despite the crowds.Every hour on the hour, the clock puts on a show: statues of the twelve Apostles emerge from its doors, two at a time, before turning and reentering the tower. At the same time, four other statues (always visible on the exterior) shake; I like to think that they're trembling in fear at the emergence of the Apostles, because those four statues symbolize various sins and evils. From left to right, they represent vanity, greed, death, and lust. This show is quite brief, even when accompanied by the bell chimes, so the city has hired a trumpeter in medieval garb to sound a flourish at its conclusion, giving the tourists a bit more showmanship. The locals say that all tourists should come here twice: once to watch the clock show, then once to watch the crowds watching the clock show, with the inevitable look of disappointment at its rapid conclusion. However, I watched it a couple more times after that as well, marveling at the engineering skill that allowed people hundreds of years ago to construct a mechanism I'd be hard-pressed to replicate today.There is no fee to look at the building and clock from the outside, though there is a small fee to go up to the top of the tower. The nearest public bathrooms, which charge a nominal fee, are inside the tourist center that's located just to the left of the base of the clock tower. There are many cafes and street food vendors in the square in case you want food or drink while waiting for the top of the hour."

Many people had told us to be sure to see the clock on the hour, well there is too much hype around the hourly \"attraction\". On each hour, figurines of the 12 disciples appear through two windows of the tower... I was expecting more after all of the talk. If you miss the hour, don't worry about it."

The crypt area is interesting and generally closed except when accompanied with a tour guide. We didn't know about the tour until we asked about seeing the crypt and then learned about the tour with the guide. It was worth seeing and fun. When you tour the old town hall you can also see the inside workings of the astronomical clock and get a close up view of the figures of the apostles that appear on the hour. The astronomical clock is fun and fascinating. On the hour, the tourists gather to watch the clock's operations. The figures on the front of the clock move their heads, the skeleton turns the hourglass upside down and the doors on the top by the gold rooster open and the apostle figures parade by the opened doors. It goes quickly. Because of all the warnings of pickpockets, I kept my hands in my pockets on my wallet and our money. We didn't have a problem but it pays to be safe."

Also, the Czech website for the clock has phenomenal pictures: http://www.orloj600let.cz/.The clock is part of the Old Town Square and most tourists stop by St Nicholas church there. And they notice the numerous beautiful buildings from the Habsburg rule. The square and the clock tower really are gorgeous. But I think that a lot of people pass by the Jan Hus memorial, and that's a real shame. Jan Hus was burned for heresy against the Catholic church, for such things as suggesting Mass should be given in local language, rather than just Latin. He has become a powerful figure for the Czech people, representing strength during times of oppression (and goodness knows that the Czech people have needed such a symbol!). My favorite part of the memorial is the hooded crouched figure on the far right. His hand tells such a story!"

One has to marvel at the skills of the people who built this clock which is after centuries of working still running and running well. Take some time to find out for yourself what the different scales and pictures mean and what it is. It is also displaying some figures at 12 with the skeleton as the last.2) The old town hall which can be seen from the inside giving a good impression of how rich and splendid Prague had been under Habsburgian rule. Also a lot to see here in the details3) The tower of the old town hall which gives a great view of the old town (and the crowds who want to have a look at the clock). From here you can actually plan your vsit around. There is an elevator, but I recommend walking you see more of 2) if you do so. 2 and 3 have a fee, 1 is free."

As seams to by typical in Prague, there were many rude pushy German tourists elbowing their way through without regard for anybody else. There were no one way signs, so people shoved and pushed from all angles. Having said that, I would have recommended the tower if I hadn't gone up Petrin tower the following morning. For the same price, the views were just as spectacular, but it much less crowded."

Astronomical Clock (Orloj) consists of three parts: the astronomical disks representing position of the Sun and the Moon in the sky;\" Course of Apostles \"with mechanical figures of apostles; a dial with the medallions representing months. Clocks look tremendous. Many tourists are going to look and listen to each hour their work. Having heard to time we have taken a walk on the center of Prague and have come once again to a town hall (Old Town City Hall). In the top part Orloj there are two big windows, closed \u0448\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043a\u0430\u043c\u0438.

Kept watching the door and nothing was coming out then seconds before it was all over I saw the aposotles going around inside the tower. There are two small blue doors at the top of the clock face, one on each side. These doors slide open and the figures are inside the tower and move past those windows. It does go fast! so know what your looking for and at. We saw the clock go off countless times after that during our 2 1/2 days in Prague and it never failed to give us a good laugh."

It's too bad that the Town Hall and the Clock are lumped together in one entry here because I found the Town Hall way more interesting than the overhyped clock. The Town Hall consists of a central building with some neat rooms, a cellar with a lot of history and a tower that has probably the best view in the city. Normally I try not to use guided tours, but the (free) ones here are useful because you won't understand it otherwise (especially the cellar).This building is a little complex, but this is how you should do it. Go to the tower itself and buy a ticket, then go into the main building and go to the second floor to buy tickets to the town hall. If you have a tower ticket you will get a discount. Ask what time the tours start so you can plan accordingly. If you have lots of time (ie, 30 minutes+) then go up the tower and come back down for the tour. Otherwise you can just kill some time for it to start.Tip: Don't sit at the nearby cafe waiting for the clock. Problem is that hoards of people will just stand infront of you and your great seated spot won't see anything at all!"

The square is dominated by the twin gothic towers of The Church of Our Lady before Tyn and the Old Town City Hall with the astronomical clock. Both are beautiful buildings. When the clock strike the hour, death in the form of a skeleton rings a bell and figures of the apostles appear at windows in the face of the tower. It can be a bit of an anticlimax for many people (the common question heard is \"Is that it?\") so I wouldn't advise waiting for it. You can also climb the tower of the City hall and get a good view over the square and the rooftops of Prague. There are plenty of places to have a drink and eat in the square but cheaper alternatives can be found away from the square."

After a climb to the top you are rewarded by 360 degree views of Prague, the likes of which I have not found elsewhere in the city. It is higher than both of the Charles Bridge Towers so if you only climb one tower, make it this one!You can take in the views from a walkway around the outside of the tower at the very top, or if you are a little timid when it comes to heights, you can stand behind glass from inside and still enjoy the sights whilst feeling a little more secure. The climb to the top is long, however there are lifts at all stages should you wish to use them, so even those with limited mobility will be fine.The Astronomical Clock (on the outside of the tower) is also worth a look. Parts of it date back to 1410 and every hour on the hour you can hear the skeleton ring the bell and watch the twelve apostles parade before two little windows. There are always huge crowds at the bottom watching this and it really will not be the most amazing thing you see on you trip, but if you are visiting Prague you will visit the Old Town Square, so why not stop and look? The clock is very accurate so you don\u2019t need to stand and wait for 10 or 20 minutes.There are various galleries inside the Old Town Hall and these cost a little more than the basic ticket price to climb the tower.
