It's hot in Bali so you know you're going to be hot. Take lots of water with you although there is a spot to get water about 1/2 way to Karsa. Beautiful views, some shade although not much. I'd do it again in a heartbeat!"

Walking out of town back home the scenery was picturesque pretty quickly and we soon ended up wandering in between the rice paddies.As we were going quite a bit further than just the walk, we ended up getting caught in a massive downpour - thankfully just as we arrived at a little stall outside the Payogan temple. Fortunately they had a roof and a cold Bintang so the day was saved!"

There are also many varieties of butterflies, quite a few birds species, and a few nice warungs/cafes en route."

I was staying at top end of Ubud and it took me 1 hour from villa to top of ridge (and I passed everyone else on the trail I walk at a decent speed) I stopped at karsa cafe at the top- beautiful views and great for resting and having a drink after the walk up. But terrible service and a basic cafe with no internal plumbing and really rough kitchen, I wouldn't want to try and eat here but getting a juice was fine. I sat up top level for breeze and view or you can sit downstairs for the lily ponds, both lovely. Then walk back down and back to villa also took me an hour. I did it between 4-6pm roughly, sun setting while walking back down, home before dark, wasn't too hot, do early or late in the day for sure. Also there is a really rough village at the top with dogs roaming everywhere and people sitting there saying hi as you walk by. You can keep walking too, on and on, to more villages, but I was tired."

The walk is quite short (1.5 km) and is makable for everybody with normal fitness level. It is recommended to do it in the morning because is is cooler. There is not much shade on this walk. However I did it at noon in the hottest time and it was still ok. Don't miss it. It's easy to do by your own, no guide is needed. Don't miss the Karsa Cafe (after 2km) at the end of the walk. It offers beautiful views!It's also very nice to go even further. There are many very beautiful rice paddies further on."

The trek is comfortable for all ages & can be interesting if done either early morning at 6 am & evening at 5 pm to avoid the scorching Sunshine. The growling Campuhan river flowing through the gorge & the lovely rice terraces make it an interesting activity. You can also visit the Spa for foot massage on the way."

If you struggle with walking in the heat it is best to do this walk ealier in the morning or later in the afternoon around sunset.

Quite a number of people were walking and jogging both ways! We ambled along the paved track stopping frequently to take photos or revel in the beauty of the countryside! We took about two hours to complete the walk one way but that was at an extremely slow pace. Take water and don't forget your hat. We only had sandles as footwear and they were fine."

You can eat and have a drink at the cafe at the end, but you should taxi or walk back the way you came, dont bother walking the round trip back to Ubud, too much traffic and steep hills"

Many people came here to do that, but of course some tourist don't want to walk that far. Best time to go is after rain, but be careful because it's slippery when we go up to the hill.

We were warm before we even started and should have taken more water than we did as well as hats. The walk has some steeper sections but well pathed and the views along the way quite beautiful. We met a local man on the path and stopped for a chat. He was very informative and didnt try and sell us anything. He walks the path as a health/spiritual thing regularly. The cafes and restaurants at the end made the walk even more enjoyable as did the artists shops. We returned on foot, but you can hire a taxi to take you back to Ubud if you are footsore etc. I rate the walk as Well worth the effort."

My husband and I hiked up all the way about a mile past Karsa cafe/spa and back. It is a pretty long and tedious trek with a steep incline in some areas but my husband and I both made it as amateur inexperienced hikers. Just be sure to bring water, sunscreen, comfortable shoes, sunglasses and a hat. It was definitely a must see for the incredible views. There were not too many people and at times we were on parts of the trail by ourselves. The trail is defined well with stairs (although steep) and concrete walkways."

After 2 km there is famous Karsa Cafe for break and you will see some village houses mainly Painters. We stopped a little early to have coconut water, not for those who have knee problems and path is bit rough but scenery is worth .While coming back either you turn back from Karsa cafe, walk much further which finally goes to Ubud palace or knock the door of local villager as what we did.

The walk is beautiful, you are literally walking (the wide and safe) ridge between 2 rivers and the views are stunning. It took about half an hour at most to on a relaxed pace to get to Karsa Kafe. The walk isn't hard but the uphill parts in the heat tested my breathing for sure! We had a couple of juices at Karsa Kafe with a gorgeous view of locals working the rice paddies and then walked back. We loved this walk, again we found it on Almost Landing who have a great guide of how to find the walk itself. (Walk west along Jl Raya Ubud until the end of the shops, it runs downhill with high walls and lovely hanging tree's, you then see a sign for Iba Warwick Hotel/Villas, turn in there. Just in front of you is a small sign that says \"going to the hill\", follow the arrow to the left and walk down the hill.

There was a coffe place tha looked very nice and different, i think the name is Karsa, and every guide will tell you to stop at this.

Perfect way to ground yourself after a long flight and a welcome relief from busy central Ubud. Following the loop back into town can be a bit tricky and there are some steep inclines along narrow roads with blind curves - a little too close to oncoming scooters and cars. You can follow the walk halfway and then turn and come back to avoid the busier roads. Doing this walk early in the day is recommended - we started at 9:00am and it was already almost too warm. There are many areas with no shade and it is HOT! You can stop for refreshments at a few cafes along the way but bring plenty of water. The loop took the full three hours."

Surrounded by nature with beautiful views, you pass a few homes and a couple of places selling paintings, then you happen across Karsa Kafe.....This restaurant is built of wood on wooden stilts, surrounded by koi lakes with lotus and lilies. It is absolutely stunning, and such a nice place to stop for a refreshing drink, or lunch. I think they would pick you up for evening meal from your hotel, which if we'd had time, we would have done for sure."

Campuhan Ridge Walk starts right behind the beautiful Parahyangan Jagat Payogan Agung Gunung Lebah temple, some 200m from the bridge over Campuhan river. It goes up the ridge, through rice fields (these are not terraces though, but rather huge rice meadows). The path is hardened (concrete and concrete slabs), so high walking shoes are not absolutely required (although advised).After some 1.5 km the path changes into an asphalt road and approaches a hamlet with a few farm houses, restaurants, hostels and a small temple. Then the road seems to continue into more inhabited areas (although we came back, so I cannot really tell).For the first 1.5 km there is no protection from the sun and no drinkable water, so bring your own water, and on a sunny day get some protection from the sunburn.The view in the fields is gorgeous, especially close to sunset, when the shadows are long and all the ridges and gorges on both sides of the walk are beautifully exposed.If you intend to return to Ubud center, the easiest way is to return the same path you just walked. You may also get a lift in the villages ahead, but it is quite a distance by car/bike (the road goes far around the rice field before it returns to Ubud)."

The rice fields were beautiful (so beautiful we actually felt we didn't need to go to the famous Tegalalang terrace.) Quite easy to get lost after the main ridge, but finding our way back was half the fun!"

Walk was fairly easy,!with some nice opportunities for photos especially with the sun just coming up. Not too many people about walked through the village at the top which was nice we were too early for the cafe robe open but stop there for a drink of water and some photos, lovely. The only thing that spoilt it for me was that a lot of the vegetation along the path most of of it actually was weed. Someone one day will need to do some weed control or the beautiful Ubud will be ruined not just by commercialism but by weed.!it is sad to see such beautiful surrounding getting overtaken by weed. With all the environmentally friendly people living in the area someone should start a Landcare group if not one already."

Stunning views and an easy path make it a great thing to do. We stayed in Como by Ubud and waited until the clouds came in before walking down to the start of the ridge and then walking to Karsa and back before returning to the hotel. I've seen this described as a trek but i'm not so sure! It was a comfortable walk for me and my wife (30 & 31) but as it's hot in Bali you will need some water. Including a drink and relax at Karsa I would allow around 2 hours to complete this as on the way in we grabbed loads of photos and looked at locals shops, rice fields and paintings. On the way back we didn't stop and it took about 20-25 minutes to get back to the roadside! Don't get a guide, it's free and easy to complete. Well worth doing!"

There are not a lot of signs on the main road (west on the main road where the palace meets Monkey Forest Road) As you walk left at the top of Monkey Forest Road maybe 100 meters or so before the bridge, before the covered area of the road it is on the right hand side of the road. No signs to say though, just an \"Ibah\" hotel sign, so you head down to the left on that short road, maybe 50 meters, (Ibah on the right) then take the stairs down to your right. There is a moto parking area on the left just before the stairs on the right. The first thing you will walk by on your left is a temple... the road/trail becomes paved in stone or concrete the further you go down the trail. There are many rice fields and and open grassy areas. Many hillside villas along the way, many galleries and homestays as well. It was a nice walk not so far from the town, but less crowded for sure."

There is little to no shade along the path so sunblock and a hat would be helpful. The walk itself is not hard. There are a few small hills but I didn't find it challenging. The stone path can be a little problematic. I have small feet so I felt at times like I was playing leap frog in order to not trip between pavers. There is a spa along the way called Karsa Spa. It's rated number one in Ubud. Make sure to book appointments ahead of time. They seem to always be booked. I had a foot reflexology and it was very good. Definitely released some blockages. I felt it immediately. There is also the Karsa Cafe right in front of the spa. I grabbed a drink and s snack before my treatment. It was nice to cool down and relax before I checked in at the spa."

A look to the left at the river crossing will provide you with a view of two converging rivers, which is considered very holy. After crossing the river follow the paved walk-way which takes you up hill where you will find yourself on the ridge between the two rivers. By continuing your walk for about two kilometres you will find a lovely warung for a meal and or a drink. You may decide to return to Ubud via the ridge way or continue on to take a left turn at the road. This will take you to a good bit of exercise as you climb the hill, where once at the crest you follow the road to the left. At the T junction turn left again and follow the road back into Ubud. Stop at a warung for another drink or hail a taxi for the three kilometre drive back to the Ubud markets. Enjoy the walk while enjoying the views."

You can either start near the bridge at Campuan down the hill from Ubud or at the other end at the village of Bangkiang Sidem (tell the taxi driver that or Klub Kokos). If you start at Bangkiang Sidem it is basically all down hill and will take you no more than 30 minutes moving quickly. But if you are fit or take your time you can start at Campuan and either do (1) the round trip - once you get to the top I would recommend you walk on at least one km and have a drink at Karsa Kafe which has fish ponds and which are fun for children OR (2) keep going and walk all the way back to Ubud via Lungsiakan and Payogan - turn left at the first road to the left 1km after Karsa Kafe and continue to the main road where you turn left and which leads all the way back to Ubud via Campuan. Be aware that option 2 has a very steep hill of some few hundred meters. Walking quickly and being fit the round trip from Campuan to Campuan will take 1 1/2 hours but there are lots of places to stop and look at such as art galleries and cafes so I would allow 3 hours. The walk on the ridge gets very hot after 11 as the grass on each side of the track holds the heat. The locals clean up rubbish on ridge walk so it is remarkably clear of rubbish compared to elsewhere so please help them by not littering. There are blue coloured rubbish bins at different points on the ridge walk."

We did the walk along Camphuan Ridge around 09:30am - it wasnt overly hot and in fact had a heavy shower along the way which was actually really nice. The walk to the Kasa Cafe and Spa is only a couple of Km and pretty easygoing. The scenery for the first 2/3 is very beautiful, peaceful and relaxing and then you hit a village along with roadside artists selling their \"original\" works. There were some lovely artworks and we purchased one of some Koi which we hadnt seen anywhere else before. I was really impressed with one artist Wayan Rana whose work was really beautiful, he does painting classes there also and though there are similarities in the painting you see his stand out as pretty exceptional. Once you get close to the Kasa Cafe there are motorcycles and cars so the ambience changes somewhat. Still a really nice walk though - can be a little tricky finding the entrance/start of the walk - its about 800m or so past the Royal Palace - directly opposite the On The Bridge Restaurant"

Views over tropical forest, rice terraces etc. (Although nowhere near as spectacular as the jatiluwih rice fields it's still off road and away from the noise of central ubud). However, when you get to Klub kolos, which is a nice cafe with views of the rice terrace it's time to turn back and come back the way you came. You will have had a nice walk. If you carry on to sangingan then you will be hugging the side of a small road as lots of scooters and motorbikes speed past at 90 miles an hour constantly beeping their horns at you and at each other. After the stress of this you will have to do the last 5k of this loop down the Jl Raya Sanggingan, which is a really busy, noisy, dirty main road. I have no idea why the lonely planet map out this route but don't waste your time on it. You will end up tired and stressed and dizzy from the petrol fumes and the only thing you will be able to hear is the constant 'beep Beep' of aggressive Balinese scooter drivers."

Also, the longer walk apparently goes via a lot of roads eventually, and not through the lovely fields/ridge. The views were nice, but nothing we hadn't seen before. It was a good walk and not too taxing, nevertheless we were quite warm when we reached Karsa Kafe at the short-walk turn-around point. We went in August and left Ubud at around 11am.

I started around 9am hoping to avoid the worst of the heat but that didn't last long. I had the path to myself for 80% of the time, encountering just a few school kids in the way. You can definitely go at your own pace and make this as short or as long as you want. I did end the trek at Karsa Spa, which I highly recommend as a way to cool off. Again there was hardly anyone there and you feel like you have the place/rice fields to yourself. It's just a simple, but very peaceful walk, and I loved the fact that it was hidden in plain sight i.e. tucked away just at the brink of town. Highly recommend."

Not as scenic on the return loop, mainly following the road, but we enjoyed it for a good long walk. Take note that if you do have the lonely planet guide, it will tell you to cut into the rice paddies on the way back at Mozaic restaurant, however this is an error, it actually cuts in higher up the road. There is a sign at Mozaic restaurant alerting walkers to this error. Highly recommend Karsa cafe for a drink or breakfast at the top of the ridge, good food, toilets, spa and scenic views."

The sparse crowds and the aesthetically rich vistas remind one of why people from around the world come to Bali. The trail starts at the historical origin of Ubud, the confluence (or Campuhan) of the Wos Rivers."

I had no idea there was somewhere like this a simple walk from the main city of Ubud, but a roomie in my hostel told me about it and I had to see it for myself. The walk itself along the ridge to the Karsa Kafe (one way) probably took less than half an hour, so I went a bit further up the road (which I recommend if you want to see how people really live in Bali). The view from the Karsa Kafe was also really nice, and I stopped there for a drink before heading back into town. If you are considering this walk, don't hesitate!"

The entrance is up on the left hand side from Bridges restaurant, about 150 metres walking back towards central Ubud. Look for the small sign providing directions. The walk is best done earlier in the morning as it has little shade at the beginning of the walk which is mostly dirt track. However there are paved pathways and sealed roads along the way. The walk is dotted with artisans and small Warungs (cafe) all spruiking their wares and the vistas with the more popular views have larger premises for the discerning visitor seeking refreshment. The prices are reasonable and would recommend a fresh coconut for refreshment from the Warungs."

Cute to see young school-age couples just enjoying the views and hanging out too even if it made me feel old! I highly recommend doing this short walk to blow the cobwebs away. It wasn't easy to find the start. If you are coming from the palace direction and you get to the bridge over the valley you've gone too far. Just ask a local to help."

What used to be a sleepy little village is now becoming a conglomeration of buildings aimed at the tourist industry. I guess you can't blame them for trying to cash in, but let's hope they don't end up ruining the very thing people used to go there for. Having said that, the ridge itself is still beautiful, albeit now starting to be overlooked all the way along by developments along the next ridge. Whereas we used to be almost the only ones walking the ridge once upon a time, now there is a continuous stream of people walking along, often in groups, and they will push you off the pathway if you let them. We are glad we saw it when we did, and have the memories of it before it fell victim to over popularity."

Its a fairly casual walk of about 2 km, average incline to begin then it flattens out. Walked as far as Karsa Cafe (seems like the best place to stop, nice views over a picturesque rice field) and then turned back.This walk is probably better for exercise than it is for sightseeing and photos, but its a good option for those who don't want to spend money on overpriced rice field tours. Along the path is engraved the businesses who have donated to its building and how much they donated- might be a good way to seek out the scrupulous tourism vendors in town!"

On the walk back, consider stopping at the first artist gallery on the right. It has beautiful, very cheap art work created by the most lovely man (I forgot his name). I had unwittingly given him $150 rather than the required $100 for the 3 pieces I bought. I would not have realised this as the notes were stuck together, but he unhesitatingly returned the extra $50 when he realised I'd given him too much. How many people would do that?!"

It was a little confusing though we eventually found the right road which was busy/loud. There is a fantastic gelato shop - Gaya Gelato which is 100% worth a stop, though you wouldn't be missing much if you simply turned around at the north end of the ridge walk to return to Ubud.Bottom line: If you have 2-3 hours (or more) and want to see some rice terraces, this is a great option right out of Ubud. There are certainly more expansive and beautiful rice terraces (e.g. tegalalang) that I would recommend if your stay is short."

As you come to the end of the walk, and reach the artists' homes and villas, don't turn back, go beyond Lokha Ubud and see the rice fields spreading on either side of the road that takes you north towards Tegalalang.

But the views are nothing too wonderful, and all too soon the paved track turns into a road lined with painters houses and showrooms. We walked as far as Karsa Cafe, and wanted to book in for a spa later, but the spa is not open until 10 am, and nobody was around, so wandered back down to our hotel in town. All up just over an hour wander. Do early in the morning for a cooler walk."

With beautiful views of the river valley, forests and the rice fields, its a wonderful way to explore the quiet countryside on the outskirts of Ubud town. You'll also encounter plenty of friendly locals on their evening walk. Make sure you carry a camera for some great photos.Tips: 1. To reach the ridge, walk west of Ubud market, until you reach Ibah hotel, where you'll find a road leading you downhill. 2. The ridge is at its coolest early in the morning or late evenings and takes around 1.5-2 hours depending on your stamina and the duration of your break.3. The slope is gentle, but it can get hot and sweaty after a while, so its best to carry a water bottle along. 4. If you have time for a break, you can stop at Karsa Cafe, which overlooks the surrounding rice fields. Refresh yourself with fruits or tender coconut water and then return down the same trail."

Nice to see he rice fields but nothing special, buildings being built so wouldn't be surprised if the rice terraces slowly start to decrease. We started about 9:30am and it wasn't busy saw about 10 people along the route. Easy walk flat surface after the few steps at the beginning. Wasn't the best bike route, lots of parts we had to carry the bikes up stairs and push up hills but coming back to ubud was all down hill so not actually a great deal of cycling.

We did this walk in the afternoon, which was a great time to do it, the afternoon light was golden and very atmospheric. It took us a bit to establish where the walk actually started from ('near the bridge' was all we kept getting told) but figured it all out after watching a wedding party descending one afternoon while we were having afternoon tea overlooking the ridgeline at one of the nearby restaurants. Requires some level of fitness to complete this walk, I wouldn't want a bad knee or be in a wheelchair or on crutches, but you can manage it at an easy pace with average fitness. Not a very wide path and quite a few people were tackling it on mountain bikes, and a lot of the local lads (soccer team??) were using it as a training run, meaning we had sweaty puffing teenagers constantly overtaking us. But their enthusiasm was admirable, if puzzling as it was quite hot up there! Lots of swaying grass and views either side of the ridgeline where there are very steep descents to the rivers below. Glimpses of rice terraces and resorts dotted along the opposite sides of the valleys and the walk brings you up to a village and temple which is the point at which we got lost and ended up going north a little far and nearly walking to Taro! So a 45 min walk turned out to be a 2 1/2 hour one and I think we walked the entire length of Ubud and then some. Came back down into Ubud via Jalan Ubud in the dark pretending we weren't scared of the local dogs which all seem to have woken and taken up purposeful and slightly menacing poses outside their residences. Learn't if we didn't eyeball them, they were cool with us. Just a word of warning about the 'footpaths' all around Bail- they frequently have their tops missing meaning if you are strolling along in the dark not watching where you are putting your feet, you could wind up stepping into a very deep hole where a paver has been removed. Given there are large drains running under these paths I don't think this would feel too good. And there isn't much lighting in these parts at night. So best if you do this walk, turn around and walk back down when you get up to the little village. And allow a couple of hours to complete it leisurely."

The get on the ridge, you have to climb a steep bath in the beginning but from there on the walk is rather easy. It takes about 35 min to get from Ibah hotel to the nice Karsa Cafe (a common stop). Along the way, you can see the Ubud valley and many rice fields. What we liked in particular was the fact that this nature walk was located so closely to the main hectic center of Ubud. It's almost unbelievable that you can find rest so close. When we were alking there, we passed a couple of other tourists but it never felt crowded. Highly recommended when in Ubud!"

Best to go early in the morning or later in the afternoon so it's not too hot.You can get a driver to drop you off at the village at the top,That way you then walk mainly down hill, ending up down the bottom near by Bridges restaurant. Or if starting by Bridges you can get a driver at the village. It is a extremely hilly and twisting road from the village out to the main road with no footpaths. There is a hotel at the top of the walk or Jungle fish restaurant (a it further on) where you can hire towels and pay to use their swimming pools. There is a nice spa and cafe at Kafe at the top of the walk.We have gone from walking this pretty trail to seeing it now, slowly being commersalized.Get the walking and enjoy it before it's all gone!"

Breakfast at the Karsa caf\u00e9 at the end is a must and if you are tired taxi back to Ubud is 100k. We were quite refreshed after breakfast and decided to walk back.

Be ware that the trail is quite exposed and you won't get much relief from the sun. Go early or late in the day."

A pleasant walk for exercise and some small rice paddy views, you can get up close and really see the rice growing. Some warungs to sit in and rest or fancier cafes and some art shops. Seems to be a few villas in the area now, tastefully done though. It is a nice walk but don't think you will be alone in the 'woods' I did manage to find several quiet spots by wandering thru the grass and had an hour to contemplate my belly button all by myself on the ridge. If you want to see a bit of rural life but not comfortable walking too far from the beaten path this is a good place to see some local life. The path is paved and in good condition, go slow up the hill, take water and rest when required. You will be back in the hotel pool in a few hours anyway. Enjoy."

I couldn't sleep that well so got up relatively early and started from my hotel about 7:30 am for the ridge walk.I was on the south side of Ubud and walked through the mostly closed city to the trail head. It was a little tough to find. It is a split off the main road and is actually a set of stairs doing down on the right side. At first there were ominous signs that seemed to be some sort of danger or keep out and a price listed. I think it was a notice for fining polluters on the trail. There were plenty of trash cans on the way to toss out water bottles along the hike.It isn't very arduous but does start relatively steep. Really quickly you are suddenly in a Bali ridge looking across valleys on both sides and suddenly the city is gone. That was the coolest part.At the top there are several shops, food stops etc. There were artists selling supposed original works. The works were original at the first stop. Later I saw the exact same pieces over and over again. Three different galleries proclaimed their stuff was shown in town. The exact copy cat pieces. There was however one artist that seemed legit but his art was selling for $300+ which was WAAYY outside my budget. Even had a piece he claimed was $10,000 (us dollars btw).I stopped at two of the cafe's at the top of the hill for coffee and waters. I opted to continue the loop that went left and back to the city. No sidewalk. I ended up walking along a very busy street but did see a lot of interesting things such as some crazy small statues that littered outside some homes, A guy invited me inside his gated yard to check out his statue collection. Had a brief conversation with a laundry lady. One sad part was crossing some of the bridges when you look down a deep ravine into thick lush jungle and small river the view is destroyed by trash, full on garbage bags, at the bottom. It is obviously a normal thing as full garbage bags were stuck in trees a hundred feet from the bottom of the ravine. Incredibly unfortunate.There weren't that many people on the trail at that time in the morning. Some some locals doing their running workouts. At the top many tourists came in by motor scooters.The good part to this being the first day for me in Ubud was at the end as I came into the city I was more than ready for lunch and seeing how different the town was before opening and in full swing approaching lunch time.I definitely recommend this as a good morning routine. If you get on trail just before sunrise you can definitely be back to a nearby hotel for breakfast if you want.The trail isn't that difficult but do have some water with you. If you happen to not take any there will be water available at the top for a reasonable price."

We had not done this walk on previous visits to Ubud and the first attempt resulted in an extraordinary change of plans which resulted in us being taken to a once in 50 years temple ceremony outside Ubud - that is another story.The walk commences off Jl Raya Ubud near the old Royal Palace and temple close to the Campuhan River. The initial part of the walk is quite steep as you make your way up the walls of the river gorge to the ridge between the two branches of the river. Once on the ridge which continues to slope upwards you are in rice paddies and also can look into the gorges of the two ranches of the river. The views are superb and you can see the scale of the massive torist developments taking place in the Ubud area from here. Along the path are various art studios, health spas, massage etc venues - also a range of small Warungs (local cafes) where you can purchase drinks (fresh coconut juice from a coconut is really nice) and light snacks, You need to keep a look-out for motor scooters and motorbikes as this is quite a busy trtack. Also it is a popular track for cyclists on rented cycles. We walked to the village at the top of the track. The walk back downhill was much easier. This a really nice way to see the traditional side of this area. The views are lovely and the walk is not too taxing. Highly recommended activity"

Pizza restaurant I hear you say, yes, at the northern end there are a number of artists making and selling their works in small shops/sheds, so it's culminated in the more commercial caf\u00e9/bar/pizza restaurant. This should give you an indication that you are not really trekking through the wilds in some remote part of Ubud! Anyway, keep going and enjoy the local scenery.Tip: by starting at the Northern end you are walking south back to Ubud. If you intend to walk all the way, and start at the Southern end, you will walk up (mostly up hill) and back (mostly down hill). Of course depends on your energy levels!If you want to limit your walk, start at the Southern end, over the river, past the temple and up the hill to the ridge, and then return. This means you won't see the artists/more commercial part of the walk.

The path is well paced so you can wear sandals or cloth shoes.If you want a quieter walk, take the road before (xx) and stop at Cafe Pomegranate.

We went a bit further north than I expected before we could head down across the river. We past another group of walkers going up the steep hill on the other side of the river and they also had a copy of the Lonely Planet guide in their hands so we weren't the only ones following the long path.Following the road down the western side of the river goes through shops and houses and isn't as picturesque as the walk along the ridge but it did show us a bit more of the Bali culture.It took us about 45 minutes to do the 2km to the Karsa Kafe and about 1 hour and 50 minutes to do the 6.3km back to the starting point following the track around."

This walk helped me forgive the hoards of tourists before me for bringing Ralph Lauren to Indonesia. It starts inconspicuously enough ducking past a swish resort, then follows a quick sharp climb to get you on to the ridge. The views are great and it only takes an hour or so to get a feel for normality in the locals way of life - which is what I wanted. I couldn't for the life of me find the left turn that the lonely planet points out to make this a circular route and now wasn't the time to earn that long awaited duke of Edinburgh award cutting my way through palm in 35 degrees.

I would not recommend heading out at sunset as it gets very dark quickly and the mosquitoes can be relentless. A cab is a safer way to return after dark."

You cannot miss it from Temple Etiquette at the very start because there is a signboard indicates how long does it take. Thanks to this instruction, the winding path along the ridge leads us to the village where you can find the studios of some artists at the end of your tour. Greenery woods, high-top trees, wild grass along the path with not much of a breeze are scarcely found in sardine-packed Ubud . Unfortunately some buildings are underway at the very end near the village, in the near future, I think, it would be more commercial than nowadays. Don't forget to bring a bottle of water as well as your camera, take a shot before the whole area is dying out."

This walk takes you past a temple and alongside a river before heading up into an open area with lovely 360 degree views and then into a small village with many artists displaying their goods alongside the road. There is a restaurant / cafe towards the end of the walk with a lovely pond and a great spot to stop for a drink and a chance to cool down. There is little protection from the sun so this walk is best done in the early morning / late afternoon. Fairly easy walking."

Because of the heat I would recommend only trekking up the ridge near sunrise or sunset. It's a thin path that also can get quite busy with cyclists and walking tourists so be patient and take your time! The first bit is uphill but then it flattens out. We entered near the Warwick hotel and they had signs you could follow to get to the ridge walk."

It is lovely and one of my favorite spots. On a clear day you can see a mountain range that starts with Batu Karu over near Bedugul. Though there is more development than there use to be, you can still enjoy the very best Bali has to offer. Rice fields, coconut palms, mountains, ducks feasting in the rice fields, and beautiful Balinese people. Karsa Spa is also here and it's a real treat. But book in advance, it's always busy. I take an umbrella, there's virtually no shade. And a small bottle of water."

The path itself is paved but tends to be overgrown in many places so single file required at times. If you take your hat, sunscreen and water you will be rewarded with some exercise (the first bit is basically up hill all the way) and great views away from the hustle and bustle of the town...allow a leisurely hour to hour and half for the return trip but try to allow more and stay for a drink at the Karsa Cafe - which i consider to be the turning back point for Ubud (after a few cold drinks of course). For the feint hearted, a taxi back from Karsa Cafe is IDR100K."

The start was nice as we stopped at The Eggman's shop - wooden eggs and paintings. Wayan Rana was great to talk to and has an incredibly photogenic face! He reminded me of Yoda!!! The walk to Ubud is mostly - do the math if you walk from Ubud, I.e., it's uphill! But the views were very interesting capturing vistas of major construction in the adjacent valley rims. No question that Ubud is growing kind of happy and sad at the same time. Once done with the walk (perhaps more like a stroll) you end at a Hindu temple followed by steps up past a school to a main drag. Take a left and walk through a forest (not the Monkey Forest) about a kilometer to Monkey Forest Road and the Ubud Central Market."

It does look nice, but with little to no shading, you would be hot and sweaty from this. There were a few local natives on this path, and even they were sweating quite a bit!If you happen to go to the Karsa Spa (which we were doing), then this walk would make sense for you."

We were able to fit this walk in at sunrise one morning, which would definitely suggest (probably also really great at sunset) as it was quiet and cool.It's easy to find on your own - especially as Karsa Kafe have put up a little sign showing the way - so not sure I would book a guided tour for this. We took the path that drops down from the main road towards the river, a little concrete bridge over the river and then the path winds around past the stunning Pura Gunung Lebah temple. Just past this your walk up a little slope and through the trees and bushes and suddenly the whole stunning valley is there in front of you! We walked along the ridge and then back to our starting point which gave us double the treat because we were able to see the ridge from both directions. There is also a great artist living along this walk who creates miniature paintings and painted wooden eggs if you're looking for something unique and affordable.It's amazing to realise that you're barely minutes out of the busier part of Ubud, and the scenery along the ridge is really beautiful and SO green! Despite all the walking we had been doing during our holiday, we appreciated this chance to walk in nature amongst the tall grass fields.We also went up along the nearby path towards Sari Organik after this, which is a different but also beautiful walk amongst working rice paddies."

Then we came to the point where it turned into a proper road. So we weren't sure whether to go off to one of the little paths between rice fields or carry on the road. We picked the road and walked until another junction and turned left. Then the walk got really tough. It was going down at first and then you had to go back up a steep hill to reach a temple. By the map that we followed from Lonely Planet, I felt that we followed it correctly and met all the meeting points but still not convinced it was right the whole way. If you don't fancy a tough walk, I would turn around once you see the main road. But if you do fancy it, its good, do it. You also walk past the typical Balinese town streets where you can have a better look at everything. Its worth it! It took us around 2 hours."

But on Campuhan Ridge, you can escape the hubbub of town and experience the peace and tranquility of rural Bali.Walking from town, it can be hard to find the start of the Campuhan Ridge trail \u2013 if memory serves me correctly, if you climb down the steep path that runs alongside a stone bridge that crosses the river, you'll easily find the pathway. If you end up walking over the stone bridge, turn back because you've gone too far! The trail is popular with tourists so, if in doubt, just follow the crowds...Once you're on the trail, the Campuhan Ridge path is easy to follow, and winds through luscious paddy fields, small villages and remote farmsteads. If you follow the path it eventually loops back into Ubud town \u2013 but be aware that this is a long and exhausting walk in the Balinese sun, there are some steep hills to climb, and when you're walking on the road you need to be careful of oncoming traffic (especially overloaded motorbikes).But if you have time to kill in Ubud and want to see what life is like outside the town centre, the Campuhan Ridge Walk is a fun and rewarding way to escape the urban buzz."

The area provides a great retreat from the more hectic southern parts of the island, but this trail presents an even more pristine outback to escape from the contemporary boutique, guesthouse and restaurant-lined Jalan Raya Ubud. While the hike lets you enjoy cool fresh air and probably the most gorgeous hillside vista in the region, it also allows you to shed off some calories too with its nine-kilometre hill track.Getting to the starting point is relatively easy. Those staying at the Warwick Ibah Luxury Villas and Spa have the best starting point to the Campuhan Ridge Walk, as the main access is a concrete path just down from this boutique hotel\u2019s main entrance. Smaller letterings under the signage of the Warwick Ibah, bears \u201cGoing to The Hill\u201d with an arrow pointing left, and as soon as you take on this path, the verdant surroundings of the Campuhan Valley immediately come to sight, lined by dense tropical foliage."

Our Starting point was by the Gunung Lebah temple. The start point is sign posted by the Ibah Hotel. The Ridge walk is actually 9 kilometers long from start to finish, and is not a circular route. The day we made arrangements to do the walk it rained heavily so we decided only to do a section of the walk. However it was a peaceful walk, and offers wonderful natural views. It is a good idea to do the walk early morning or late afternoon, as there is very little shade to be had, also a good idea to take a hat and plenty of water. The path is quite clear and a lot is on a narrow block pathway,though sensible footwear is also worth remembering. The ridge is set between two rivers, and offers wonderful views of the valleys below and beyond. The path does lead up into a village so you an get refreshments if you need them. You get to see dramatic landscapes with rice terraces and small villages of yesteryear. A great form of escapism."

Tjampuhan trek started from Ibah Warwick resort, from down town Ubud on the way to Kedewatan. A downward pass to the river sent us under the bridge crossing Wos/Oos/Tjampuhan river. Following the bridge is steps leading to Gunung Lebah temple, one of the temple built by Rishi Markandya, Balinese explorer that searched for the sacred light in this island. Towering pagoda resembling Mount Meru, the axis mundi in Hindu mythology and high stone walls is the highlight of this Pura Gunung Lebah. Behind the temple is hills, resorts, river and private houses. A slow walk on the track passing hills and tall grasses for an hour is a quiet walking meditation. At the end of the track is a village that house many small and private resorts, private houses and cafes. A famous Karsa caf\u00e9 is a good spot to rest the feet while enjoying the rice terraces. Karsa caf\u00e9 provides international food with decent quality. Beyond this caf\u00e9, the walk is actually not enjoyable, going to Keliki, Kedewatan and back to the town. Karsa provides a shuttle back to Ubud town, or you need to get a taxi, which is not easy. This trek can be accessed by bicycle.

In fact, if you can, do the walk early in the day to avoid the hottest time. My hot tip is to book yourself in for a massage at Karsa Spa as a reward for the end of your walk. It's located just past the village at the end of the walk. It's in a stunning location - small spa huts surrounded by ponds filled with water lillies, overlooking ride fields. Before you enjoy your massage though, enjoy a fresh juice from the Karsa cafe just next door. Then walk back down the ridge into town refreshed and relaxed! NB. The walk is not strenuous, but due to the humidity it can be challenging, especially going uphill. It is paved the whole way."

There is scooter and car parking facility before the walk, Campuhan ridge walk is not all that well sign posted, but ask the near by tourist office for directions. There are few steps to reach the walk so getting there with prams and push chairs will not be easy, but I did see few brave young couples with their prams. Once you are up on the paved stone path way it is glorious green scenery all around. There is small cafe's selling tender coconut water, coffee, ice creams etc on the way. It is a long walk of 6 km, so go there early in the morning, take some rain protection if weather forecast is rain."

It gets quite hot so mornign or evening might be best, plus sunrise and sunset views are nice here. Therer are some shops and places to have a meal if you wish. Its a lovely way to kill soem time on the cheap while getting some exercise. If you wander further up into the villages you can get an idea of ordinary life. Most of the dogs were quite nice but be cautious as there is the odd less friendly one but usually only when with their owner"

Turn in as if you're going to the hotel, but go down the (steep) hill to the left. There you can park a bike. There will be a sign for the walk and directing you to Karsa Kafe. That hill is the steepest of all the walk. Go down the steps to the right of the bridge, follow them along the temple wall then to the right and up the hill again, you have started the walk!It is paved and kept in good condition, but be aware there is little shade, so a hat and water are good to have with you. About 3/4 of the way to the cafe it changes to gravel, as you pass by a number of art stores. Karsa Kafe is recognisable by the three huts on the left hand side of the road. You can continue past this or use it as a good marker to break before heading back.A pretty day walk, great for how simple it is to walk from the centre of Ubud straight to it."

Eat some of the local stuff. I had a lovely rest in one of them and enjoyed an ice tea and some local food for 10,000!!! I reckon I saw some Europeans that walked the whole way and they looked as though they had participated in a mud wrestling competition. They passed me when I was having a Bintang in a small shop on the way back. I love European mud wrestling but that's another review isn't it?"

We walked in the early AM, for both the heat factor (less) and the photo factor (sunrise golden hour). We would walk to the Karsa Cafe for an expresso then return to our hotel. Maybe a 5 KM roundtrip, time about 1 1/2 hours and we are older and leisure walkers. The path is well marked and in decent condition as paver stones are used on the hilly sections. There are steps and some steep sections, however a short taxi ride to the village end of the trail would allow someone of less mobility to enjoy the ridge view with minimal walking. The entrance is located off the entrance way to the Ibah Resort, maybe 30 meters from the JL Raya Road (and about an 800 meter walk west of the Ubud Palace area). There is a mini mart near the main road for hydration supplies. The entrance is signed with small placards and easy to find. There is no parking at the 'trailhead' that I could see. The walk follows the ridge, then a track thru some artist shops, warungs, and lodgings to a small village. As noted the walk to Karsa Cafe and return was plenty for our morning exercise. On the weekend was more people, the weekdays practically enjoyed to ourselves in the early (6:30AM-ish start time). A nice walk and quick, quiet getaway from Ubud's sometime noisy and crowded streets. Enjoy."

I recommend doing this in a weekday because at the weekends it is packed with local and foreign tourists so you cannot feel the peaceful atmosphere. after 2km there is a great cafe&Spa so no need to worry about being tired...."

It is up a steep rough road for 100m usually where building materials are sorted then a marked paved track wide enough for scooters only, after another 100m opens out onto the paddy fields and a different world. Just keep going you will have paddy fields and coconut palms on either side and lots of places to eat and drink on the trackside. Enjoy it's magical."

Walking together with your lover at the Campuhan Ridge Walk is one of the examples. It allows you not just to enjoy cool fresh air and breathtaking hillside vista, but also helps you to burn off some calories. This nine kilometers walking trek is a perfect combination of romantic, exotic and refreshment \u2013 something that you need to level up the attachment with your lover. Located not far from central Ubud, this tropical area is surrounded by nothing but an undulating sea of green, covered in tall reed grass. It also provides heaps of meditation spots overlooking the gorgeous fields. The sun in Bali is intense these days, even in the morning or afternoon, so you may want to pull out an umbrella to your lover on rice paddy walks. Ignore other joggers/walkers around you, as when you are in love the whole world belongs to you both."

It winds its way past temple, through tall grass, along the ridge of the river valley, rice paddies and villages. We walked another 2 km past the cafe and realised we must have missed the loop road back to Ubud. No signs we could see past the cafe so you might like to plan ahead with a better map than we had. No problems though as we simply turned around and retraced our steps back to the bridge. I'm so glad we walked the extra distance as we had the best views of rice paddies being tended by farmers with the vista of the mountains in the distance.

We did this and despite the fact that the steep hills between the villages at the end almost did us in, we really enjoyed it all in the quiet of the morning. Don't recommend doing this after 10am as it would be really hot and humid work. Definitely take water and sunscreen. To find the start of the walk go to the campuhan bridge on the opposite side to bridges restaurant, as you face the temple, the stairs are to your right next to the school ...these take you to the riverbed where you will need to cross the river...the day we did it there was a makeshift bamboo bridge in place to help us do this. Once you cross over, take the steps up to the temple, then turn right and a sharp left before the tarred pathway starts - almost a u turn back on yourself to find the path up the ridge.

It is a well maintained trail.The walk can be accessed from Ubud and Penestenan. It starts near the bridge in Ubud, goes alongside a temple before the steep ascent to the ridge. You can continue on the trail at the end of the ridge to a small village of artists where there are a few cafes. At this point we turned around and walked back.As most of the ridge is in full view of the sun. I would recommend walking this trek in the early morning as it can be quite hot if walked at midday.There is no fee for this walk."

Start early, like at 6am. The villages were nice, we stopped and had refreshing drinks at the top before walking back. But the fields were completely dormant, not very green, nothing special at all."

I was about to do the walk in thongs but the hotel administrator advised me against that (so glad he did).Ubud (Bali in general with the exception of Kintamani) is pretty hot and humid, if you are not used to the heat, sweat will be your enemy number one taking a big toll on your water reserve that has to be replenish constantly.The footpath is pretty good in general, concrete for most parts and there will be lots of places where to stop to buy some food if you are really hungry."

This is the start of the Ridge Walk. It's really picturesque past green luscious fields, temples and local villages. You will get a sense of how peaceful Ubud is. It's hot so make sure you bring water or there are shops along the way to purchase drinks. When you get to Karsa Cafe, stop for a drink and a meal. It's worth it. And if you keen keep going for another 6km and it will take you back to Ubud. We turned around from Karsa Cafe and walked back to Warwick Ibah, a 25 minute brisk walk easy. We would do this walk everyday if we lived here."

It's a pretty easy little hike/walk--except for a section or two it is not terribly steep and the path is paved with stone tiles. It was a beautiful escape from the bustle and bules of Ubud. I went at noon so it was pretty hot and there's not much overhead cover on the walk (so wear sunblock if you burn), but it wasn't unbearable and the occasional breezes along the ridge offered amazing relief. There weren't a ton of other tourists on the walk and I'd say of the people there it was about equal parts Indonesians and foreigners (so a plus if you're a little tired of the foreigner-saturated streets of Ubud).The views are incredible and definitely worth the visit. At the end there are some resorts and cafes. If you bring a swim suit I think you can take a dip in one of the resort pools. I wish I had! I also met some Indonesians along the way and made some new friends! Overall, this walk is worth it for those who want a quick respite from the bustle of Ubud"

It's not clearly signed, though I followed Lonely Planet's Campuan Ridge Walk guide which actually guides you along the ridge starting by Warwick Ibah Luxury Villas on Jl Raya Ubud, and then on past the village of Bangkiang Sidem and doing a full loop back down Jl Raya Sanggingan. The walk in the Lonely Planet guide book is around 8.5km (3.5 hours) - starting and ending at Ubud Palace - and is definitely worth a look, as it gives you a chance to view the ridge, as well as taking you through a few of the smaller, traditional villages before looping back around. I went mid-day, so it was insanely hot, but that also meant that there were very few other tourists along the route which meant I got to really enjoy the stunning surrounds with a feeling of tranquility Take water with you!"

I always stop off for coffee of coconut water at the Karsa Cafe, which is doing so well, it's added an extra floor and a spa on its premises over the last 4 years. It's a fairly easy walk, so you can wear you regular running shoes, hiking gear not required.

After a couple of kilometres, you enter an artists village with several cafes, not open the early hours we walked through. The pathway becomes a road, with increasing traffic. Taking the first main left, you can follow the road around to the west, north and up a steep hill, west again then a long south stretch back to Ubud. About 6km all up. If I were to do it again, I would return along the ridge path once you reached the road, as walking on the road (no footpath) with busy traffic is not very relaxing!"

Very close to town and an easy incline, so this is accessible to small children and the less fit. I go before sunrise and have the place to myself as the light creates its magic on the jungled river valley, the traditional hillside terrace houses, the rows of volcanoes to the west, and the majestic Mt. Agung rising from the sun. I could go every morning and not get tired of these views 5*+"

Located a little bit outside of Ubud Central. If you got lost just ask a nice and helpful Balinese people and they will help you to find the way.The best time to go there are between 5 - 7am. During that time the air was so fresh, cool and calming. After that time it is a little hotter. If i am not mistaken, the ruote was about 3km from end to end. Must try!"

They are truly majestic. You pass many little artist studios where paintings are displayed. Towards the end of the first section you come to a wonderful little lotus cafe.

Due to a bit of a misunderstanding with the quick drawing the guys at my guest house gave me, I ended up on a 17km trek instead of the usual 6km (there & back) or so of this walk - but in the end it was great (Ubud - Sebali - Keliki - Tegalalang - Ubud). There is another 'rice field walk' very nearby, which is the one they meant, & after the start you continued walking & turning right until you came back to town. So after having a look around the temple & under the bridge, I found this walk that looked great, and headed off (thinking it was the other small 'loop' one). It continues on for about 2.5km or so along the ridge & offers some pretty good views of the Ubud area. Most people apparently walk back after reaching the little shops/art galleries & caf\u00e9. Assuming there was more to this track until I turn back into town (there were probably another dozen or so walkers I encountered upto Keliki village), I continued on, eventually coming to lots of rice fields with ducks & field workers. There is one area near Sebali village where you can walk through the rice fields & view how the irrigation works & see what the field workers are doing - it's a 10,000 IRD donation which goes towards the maintenance costs of running of the irrigation system. A number of spots in the area there are 'transport' guys who will drive you back to Ubud via Tegalalang if it gets too hot & sweaty & tiring. There are little shops in each village to sit & have a cool drink in the shade. There is a spectacular bridge crossing in the jungle at Keliki village heading toward Tegalalang with a massive drop to the river running below. When you get into Tegalalang, Jalan Tegalalang features lots of shops for arts & crafts all the way back to Ubud. Take your time & allow 5-6 hours for the whole walk. Lots to see, interesting interaction with friendly locals. Make sure you have a hat, water & good walking shoes. A great walk & great day :)"

The signs say 2km to the recommended half way point - the Karsa cafe - but you can continue further onto the village from here.We went in the morning to avoid the midday heat. It was a beautiful morning and thoroughly enjoyed the walk. Stopping at the cafe, sitting by the lotus pond, drinking a coconut overlooking the rice fields."

Take your time as there are some steps and challenging slopes along the way, stop as often as needed to rest, enjoy the views and share the ridge with hikers and joggers. It is a perfect place to visit early in the day. I highly recommend exploring all area's small roads, walks, each and every one. You will be able to discover so much more than what one can see from main roads! Hills, deep ravines, ridges around Ubud are stunning!"

It has beautiful scenery but I wouldn't recommend such place for the faint hearted. It's an uphill road on the first 500-700m (approximately). It was tiring but definitely great for those who love to walk or jog. Be careful of people doing their runs there. It was quite a bit crowded when we came, because it was nearing the sunset time.Tiring but worth the tiredness :)"

Walking amongst lush green fields, with beautiful views and sounds of river flowing, the campuhan ridge walk is certainly not to be missed while one is in Ubud. Starts near the Ibah Hotel, the the walk is roughly 2-4 Kms, and could take varying amounts of time depending upon how frequently you stop on the way. Be sure to start early morning, as the temperature is low, and your'e likely to catch the sunrise. Check out Kasra Cafe on the way for breakfast."

The first 1km or so is nice, walking along the ridge, with the rice fields either side, and the river below. However, after this time, the walk becomes a dusty road with scooters and the occasional vehicle and a few little souvenir and art shops along the way - no different than any other outlying road in Ubud. The cafe at around the 2.5km mark, Karsa Cafe, was ok, but pretty poor food (at least what I had). I didn't go past the cafe, but I believe the walk continues and is quite nice past that point. Overall, a nice enough walk, and worth doing, but don't expect breath taking views. Though to be fair, mid October was a little late for the rice to be at its green best. Definitely go early morning or evening to avoid the sun."

There was a snack and drink vendor at the top when we went by but not guarantees. It is a nice climb up to the top and seems to serve as a \"Lovers Lane\" to young people the sit together and giggle and take selfies among the flowers and foliage. It was an enjoyable climb that got our heart rates going. There is a nice restaurant at the top that looked like a great place to have a drink. My guess is it was about a 2 mile roundtrip depending how far you go up. You pass through villages, rice fields, past banana trees and get more of a birds eye view of the rice fields across the river. Definitely worth the trip."

The walk starts at the Ibah hotel and is well signed to the Karsa Kafe & Spa, however this is not the only caf\u00e9 that you can stop at on the way up. The path is good and has a few steps in places, but on the whole is not overly steep.We did stop at the Karsa Kafe as it is about 2km into the walk plus the reviews were quite good. It's here that you need to make your choice, walk back the way you came or continue through two villages to make it a circular route, another 6km, we continued on.The route is not hard to follow but as you have already reached the Kafe they have stopped the signage, but if you take one of their cards the route is on the back (see photo). As you can see it is all Tarmac road from Karsa however the route to Payogan drops you into the valley which also means you have to climb back out. This is a steep road but has places to rest on the way up. None of the roads have pavements (sidewalks) until you get to the Fly Caf\u00e9. We stopped here and at some of the shops before getting back to the start so I am unable to give an approximation on the time it takes.Try not to start the walk in the heat of the day as there is very limited shade on the way up, there is good shade if you choose to do the circular walk all the way to the Fly caf\u00e9 from the Karsa Kafe."

The entire trek goes on for about 9km and some tour companies offer a guided walk, however, I decided to only trek as far as the Karsa caf\u00e9 and then turn back. That would roughly be about a 3.5km walk to and fro. As the weather tends to warm up in the day, you should try to start as early as possible, anytime from 7am so it's cooler. There is no shelter along the way so bring your sunblock, water and cover your shoulders if don't want to get burned. There are a few steep slopes but nothing too difficult. Views are great along the ridge, with beautiful valleys and padi fields on both sides of the ridge. You can definitely do this without a guide but if you prefer to do a longer trek and have someone provide you with the local cultural tidbits and history, then joining a walking tour would be the way to go."

At the end Jln Raya Ubud, we walked down a long shady sloping road which had few vehicles at that time. Finally reached Ibah Resort & from there, directions to the ridge are quite clear. We walked down the path, crossed the bridge over the river, peaceful surroundings, past the temple on our left & headed uphill. On the ridge, we were greeted with unblocked views of the surrounding areas, with nice villas on hill slopes on both sides of the valleys. We stood among a large field of lallang & the ground was dry. It was getting hot at around 930am. We did not complete the walk & only took some photos around the first knoll. There were local children playing in the area & several joggers past us by. Will return & explore the ridge more when we have more time."

It starts at a beautiful temple and from there, after a very brief stretch of walking through tall grass and shrubbery (several minutes at most), the view opens up magnificently. Valleys, palms, buildings cut into the ridge, beautiful architecture, artists' shops, and then the lovely Karsa Cafe. The hike can be intense because there's not a lot of shade but there are some shaded areas to take a break if you need to. There's a lot of up hill walking and several high steps here and there as well. But if you are prepared - hat, sunscreen, cool clothing, practical shoes (leave your flip flops at home), and lots of water, you will make it to Karsa Cafe unscathed where you can relax in their beautiful cafe with its lotus pond and huts over the water or on the terrace/deck seating area. Walking back is pretty much downhill and is just as lovely because you are seeing the beautiful views from a different angle. Anyone who has said the views are lacking must have been walking with their heads down. It is truly a beautiful walk."

After having seen the busy Ubud with alllllllllll the motorbikes and cars, it was time to get our walking shoes on and do the Campuhan Ridge Walk. We love to hike and after reading the reviews here on TA, we are looking forward to this hike. What worrried us beforehand was how to follow the right track. A lot of reviews here are giving advice on which path to follow and where to turn left or right. For us it was simple... if you stand in front of the IBAH Hotel, walk past the time and simply follow the Campuhan signs (perhaps these are new). Or follow the tourists because the reputation of the track is well known now so you won't be alone. The walk itself is lovely and easy to make. I bet you can even do it on flip flops. Disappointing was the length of the \"good part\" of the hike, which was rather short. Before we knew it, we were at the Karsa Cafe / Spa and from there, it gets uninteresting really quick. I can totally relate to the ones saying \"turn around and walk back to where you came from!\". The second part of the track is not only boring but also a bit dangerous, walking next to a busy road with almost no room to walk. It really takes away A LOT from the scenery you saw only minutes ago. So indeed... believe me... turn around and stay with the good memories. Only reason we decided to go further is because we wanted to do the Sungai Ayung Valley walk, since this walk wasn't that tiresome.\u00a0Anyway, a nice and quick way to get away from the Ubud madness without needing a driver. Unfortunately, the walk is short since the second part is not recommended. Also, the scenery is nice but nothing compared to sightings like Mayong village, Segumpul waterfalls or Jatiluwih. We didn't stop at Karsa Cafe but the view looked lovely from there. We did try to get a massage but that was only possible three weeks from now haha. Now THAT is a succesful business!Enjoy the walk guys!"

If you decide to start later just know that it will be hotter and more humid. There and back is about 6kms and if you are lucky enough to book in advance you can get a massage at the Karsa Spa. If you can't get a booking for a spa treatment then I would highly recommend for you to ask if they are available to do a foot reflexology massage. Take some water, wear sunscreen and enjoy the view"

            "review": "Delightful escape from Ubud traffic. Campuan walk is a delight, and not too tough, with beautiful views opening at every turn. Being a walking track only (though we did see mountain bikes this trip) it is way more pleasant and less challenging than many other Ubud walks which take in roads which can be quite dangerous and noisy. I agree with other reviewers, early morning and late afternoon are the only times to do it pleasantly as there is little shade for much of the way. If you are doing it in late afternoon I would recommend a torch as the latter parts around the temple are deep in shade and could be quite difficult to negotiate if dark. The Karsa Cafe along the walk is beautiful. We have been coming here for many years and it has developed into a cafe with an interesting menu, gorgeous presentation and amazing setting. Don't miss it. So if you are looking for rice paddies, good food, a gorgeous temple and lovely little shops along the way I would thoroughly recommend the Campuan Ridge walk."

This walk is a probably better for someone who is steady on their feet as some of the ground is broken up and in other places there are flag stones but there are gaps between them making them easy to catch toes on! They are maintaining the path so in a few months will be smoother and suitable for all.The walk looks a bit dull to start with but persevere as when up on the ridge you will be glad you did. It's beautiful at any time of the day but it does get very hot up there so better to start as early as you can. At an average walking pace you could do this in an hour and half return. Don't forget to stop by the Karsa caf\u00e9 as you pass. If you can only do one walk, do the rice fields over this one as that is exceptional."

Next time I think we will start at Cafe Karsa and do the downhill walk back to Ubud, think this will be more enjoyable and less tiring!

At the end of the walk there is a small friendly village with a picturesque cafe over looking the rice fields. We sat upstairs and had fresh juices and banana pancakes, everything was delicious!

The views all along the Campuhan Ridge walk are beautiful, and the beauty of this walk is that it is very comfortable to do from the town centre, and yet it seems so removed from the hustle and bustle of the town. Best done either early in the morning, before the heat of the day, or later in the afternoon. There are little warungs along the way where you can bargain for souvenirs, or just enjoy looking at the variety of local arts and crafts. You can buy water along the way, but it's best to set off with some when you go. Most people with a reasonable level of fitness can easily manage this walk, but there are some steps involved and some rough sections where a less able bodied person might struggle. It is a wonderful way to conveniently get a little glimpse of the 'real' Bali."

There are a few cafes and Warungs along the way and a small selection of artists studios that sell paintings and silver ware. Make sure you visit the egg painting studios that are a true delight.

Cafes at the top, though prices are more than double what you normally get at one of the nice cafe (can't remember the name but it starts with K). Eg coke cost 20,000 idr when usually its between 5000-8000. Though that cafe has a nice view so my husband just bought coke so we could take pictures there.We didn't finish the walk from end to end because it would prolly have take 3hours or more to walk all the way and back. We turned back.Nice view of rice terraces and the surroundings but I wouldn't say its fantastic or anything. "

The walk is truly a ridge walk as its at the top of two meadows so you get to admire great views from both sides. Near the end of the walk there are a few nice patios to eat or drink at. If youre into a fancier meal/cocktails, you will come across a massive place on the left with little huts built over a small river - it was really nice. Also, you can even hike through some of the rice terraces as well.Overall, im really happy that we did this hike, it was one of the most memorable adventures in Ubod."

On the walk we saw harmonious grass, bamboo and wild flower hill near and far on the lest and right of the man made trail. My 70 yo mom walked with us all the way. There is a village at the end of teh trail and it lead to a road where car can pass, that's where we make our turn. I recommend a stop at \"Rare Angon\", a simple art painting gallery that has some umbrella seated spot for us to enjoy young coconut. Inside the gallery I saw some spectacular art painting by the owner. it is a pity that due to financial situation he has to take in some other cheap art painting to help his selling. His is the detailed traditional painting....so amazing. I too grinned, and reviewing in TA make me grin again...I salute this Trail and the painter....."

There are yoga classes in the morning that also look amazing."

Start your hike at Ibah hotel, after 30-40 mins you will reach Karsa Cafe and Spa. I opted for a 4h spa treatment which was the best I ever had and priced verrrry reasonably. Make sure your treatment includes a flower bath and do make a reservation in advance :-). After the treatment I would suggest walking the same way back ( the other way includes roads i.s.o. rice fields) or taking a taxi to Ubud. Try to schedule the walk in the morning as it becomes very hot in the afternoon."

They were just much simpler. There are a ton of shops all along but I didn't feel bothered by eager shopkeepers at all. The roads weren't in the best condition when I went and it was a little annoying sharing the road with cars and scooters.I probably walked two miles and then stopped because there didn't seem to be much else but if you're looking for a nice walk/hike, this seems to be the place!Also there was massive cow poo on the road so be careful not to step on it!"

Bring a book there and you can easily kill an entire afternoon.Thankfully the walk was 5mins away from our villa by foot, as I would've been a little disappointed had I paid for a taxi or spent a lot of time traveling there."

Although we had bought The Lonely Planet book two months ago, it turns out that it is not the current edition. Hopefully the new edition has been amended."

One tip -- A local guy advised me to come back early in the morning after seeing the Ubud market. That way, you get to see locals sell produce - a less touristy market! - and take in the early morning beauty of the Campuhan walk. Just remember to bring mosquito repellents!"

The Campuhan ridge walk is a good way to see the nature and local life around Ubud, away from the crowd. Around 30mn for a one-way walk from the big bridge of Ubud near the stunning temple of Gunung Lebah Pura, all the way up up to the Campuhan hill surrounded by the two Woss rivers. The walk ends on the top of the hill in the small and friendly village of Bangkiang Sidem. There are a few hotels and restaurants on the Campuhan hill with views on preserved ricefields or Woss river valleys where to get lunch, snacks, refresments, massages and even some paintings or arcrafts. The Lokha Ubud hotel is located on the east side of the Campuhan hill near the east Woss river. However, the access on foot is not that easy. Sunset Hill Boutique bed & breakfast is located on the west side of the hill with a nice view of the Woss \"Kawan\" river valley (east), just at the beginning of the village if you come from Ubud.I recommend to do the walk at morning, before 11:00 AM or after 17:00 PM to avoid the heat and to get the best light for your pictures. Prefer sport/walking shoes to flip flops as the walk is going up on stairs and paved road. You can see some bicycle and guided tours around but I think there is no need of any guide or operator to go there."

We started our walk around 7 a.m. and noticed that there was a beautiful temple with no tourists in it, Pura Gunung Lebah. It was lovely to see the picturesque countryside while enjoying the lack of other tourists as compared with other places. We passed by a mother hen and her chicks, a gushing river, an almost fluorescent snail, watched nectar eating birds flying and a duck leading her troop to walk between paddy stalks. The initial part of the walk was slightly steep but the rest of the walk was a breeze. Beautiful views of the ravine and paddy fields. We passed by 2 art galleries and a massage parlour, and a few hotels along the way. We had a lovely drink at Karsa Kafe and spent nearly 2 hours just soaking in the scenery, whilst listening to the sounds of trickling water. Karsa Kafe is definitely a must visit at the end of the walk. We ended up booking ourselves into a guesthouse along this walk and loved every moment of our stay there (waking up to the sight of the ravine, coconut trees and paddy field was just remarkable). We walked back the same way that we came as our car was parked there. The walk is closed from 6.30 p.m. onwards as they are afraid that people might stray from the path or encounter snakes (rest assured we saw none during our walk). At nights, we could see fireflies hovering above the paddy fields. This is definitely a gem."

The idea of the walk is that it goes in a loop but walking on after our stop at the cafe we found that the path back to Ubud was on a busy road a local told us it would take at least and hour and a half we decided to turn back towards the cafe and take the route we had come along via the ridge. We did feel that in places the walk was very isolated and on the way I had mentioned to my husband that if I was a single woman I would not want to do this walk alone. On our return journey there was a local man, just hanging around on the ridge, who took a photo of us and then seemed to be texting, as we carried on walking we turned the corner to face three men with jackets on, hoods up coming towards us which immediately struck me as odd as it was such a warm and humid day, luckily some people unconnected to these men also came around the bend. I felt I needed to share this experience as we were genuinely frightened."

You'll pass a temple and lush rice terraces, and if you go far enough (past Karsa Kafe), you might even see men \"herding\" ducks (trying to get them to cross the road), which is pretty adorable and entertaining. Definitely worth checking out and easy to find just beyond Ibah Hotel (on the way out of town/away from the Palace)."

It is peaceful, scenic and just the right length if you are not looking for a trek. We didn't go to the cafe that advertises breakfast at the end. Instead we walked back and had breakfast in Ubud. There was plenty of time to do that. I wouldn't rate it as the most spectacular thing I have ever seen but it was scenic, enjoyable and a lovely thing to do first thing in the morning."

Try and plan your walk early to avoid the heat of the day. If you like the idea of the massage do book ahead as word has got out about how wonderful their spa is. Enjoy a lazy lunch after your massage and take a gentle stroll back to Ubud. You will not be disappointed!"

You eventually reach a main road and turn down left to return to Ubud. The road can be busy and runs through villages and rice fields at each side.

It seemed quite far away and we are not walking slowly ! The terrain is up and down .. And also there are many small lizards along the way . After the grassland portion , there are some small private art painters with their small shop selling beautiful paintings .. I bought 2 pretty little paintings - slightly smaller than A4 size (rp 50,000 each only) ^^ she told me that her paintings sells at downtown Ubud art galleries for 3 times the price here!

Still, it was alright. Never had I thought a walk among the weeds would be a No.1 but it was.The sunset was not spectacular that day, but one could wait for it at the end of the Walk Ridge. There are a few shops along the way, plus a few guesthouses/hotels. And houses. And dogs that growled at me. Thank goodness I had my selfie stick to use to scare off the threatening dogs. That really spoiled my walk.There were local lovers/couples along the way, sitting at the walk, near the starting point. Perhaps at those few steps, the place was calmer. The villagers should really do something about those dogs."

Very easy to locate, head for Bridges Restaurant (which is by the large bridge itself), opposite side of the road, slope down and plenty of signs - easy to see A4 size, \"This way trekking Campuhan Ridge, \"Karsa Kafe\" 2 kilometres\" and others advertising villas - really cannot miss the route. Fair bit of rubbish especially at the start - I think locals may use as a cut-through to get to the main road at the far end of the ridge. Lush valley on the right and views over to different styles of accommodation. Fields on the left, slighted elevated that give way to views of new properties being built, all interesting. More of a pleasant amble than a hearty walk really. Started walk about 3 pm in month of May and heat not a problem, as fairly short walk, depending on your pace and stopping / starting. Somebody selling drinks along the way. A few 'shops' along the way - two in particular, right hand side of path, lady selling drawings & paintings that she and members of her family had made (pictures of herons landing, which you can see for yourself when the herons return from the rice fields to Petulu Village at approx. 5 pm). Further along, on left hand side, a very nice elderly gentleman selling hand-painted eggs - we watched as he painted the intricate designs. The smaller sized eggs were approx \u00a34.00 sterling, an amazing amount of work for such a small price, a nice memento.It is worth carrying on walking past the Karsa Kafe as interesting views and local life to see, admiring the ladies carrying large pots of sand and soil on their heads to a new villa being built. The Karsa kafe is worth stopping at for a drink to admire the beautiful views over the rice fields. Service fairly slow and not particularly clean tables, cushions that you sit on could do with renewing or washing. The Ridge is worth the walk, but when crowded perhaps not quite the same atmosphere. Lots of locals use the route as a kind of park, and sit on the ground in groups."

A little hard to find, just make sure you enter at the Ibah hotel sign and head left down the hill. There are a few small signs pointing the way labelled 'Campuhan Ridge Walk' but they are only A4 size so you have to look for them. My advice would be to do it early morning before it gets too hot or too busy, we set off at 7am and found this to be ideal. Great view of the rice paddies and the lush forest, plus you get to glimpse various resorts tucked away on the hillside along with coconut palms. You absolutely must stop at Kafe Karsa on the hill top, a beautiful location with individual shacks floating on a lily pond where you can sit and eat breakfast."

I started early at around 7:00 am, it was a bit chilly at that time so it was refreshing to walk that early. I like the galleries along the street, I thought they were charming. There are new structures being erected in the area so it sort of losing it's village feel. Anyway, it is still worth visiting to get some exercise.

For the lazy ones, I suggest to get dropped off at Bangkiang Sidem early in the morning, to start walking downhills. Have a first cup of coffee in the caf\u00e9 on the right, with magnificent view. Keep walking downhills easily and finish by having a delicious lunch at Murni's Warung down at the river bridge. You will do it over and again every time you come back to Bali..."

The walk takes you alongside a nice temple and uphill towards the ridge. The view there is great and is a great way to get out of the noisy city for a moment. But that's about all. There are a lot of nice sceneries around Ubud, probably even with less tourists crossing you way. And don't bother the LP loop walk as moslty, you walk around streets avoiding bumping into motor bikes or cars. The art galeries and restarants towards the end of the loop can be visited seperately..The best way to do the ridge walk might be to reserve a spa treatment on in the really good Karsa's and get there by walking. As said, the first 20 minutes of the walk are well worth the time, but don't plan your afternoon around this activity."

Based on the fact that this is the number one activity listed on Tripadvisor, I kept mentioning to our driver/guide that we would like to walk on the ridge. Being Balinese, he was of course gracious and said it was a place young teenage couples went for a romantic date. We did the walk in the late afternoon after visiting the monkey forest. It is an okay walk (not a hike) with views on both sides of the ridge filled with teenage couples who were stopping along the way. Nothing spectacular, worn tourist trail with litter, and kind of a let down - saw much more beautiful scenery driving through the nearby countryside or stopping at the rice terraces. Takes a quick 10-15 minutes to complete the 2 km ending at Karsa's cafe. Wouldn't plan my day around this activity."

We know that we don't have enough physical stamina to go all the way to the top :D.The track itself is in good condition, and already paved by cement. But please make sure that you're in good healthy condition, since the track is incline all the way.During the walk, your eyes and mind will be refreshed, looking at green valley and paddy field.

However, curiosity got the best of us after finding out Pura Gunung Lebah was closed to visitors. The weather (10AM in April) made the uphill portion rather unpleasant, but the anticipation of \"the gorgeous view\" at the top kept us going until you realize you are not at the tallest or the prettiest peak. After that the only motivation was getting to the Kafe for hydration. We took transport (100K rupiah in the Kafe's menu) back to central Ubud. Save your time/energy/water for other places, unless you want to feel betrayed by the inflated reviews."

Its about a 3km walk to the Karsa Kafe point.From there you can turn around and go back to Ubud that way OR do a 6km loop to get back.

Kaspa Kafe looked amazing and worth doing the walk out and back to have that as your reward. I had hoped to see wildlife on the walk but spotted only one fat gecko.

It has changed a little in 25 years, but the beauty has remained the same.You can make it as long or short as you want. It is beautiful going both ways, and seems different, so you can just go as far as you want and reverse it. It is a good idea to do it at sunrise, or sunset, or on a cloudy day, cause it can get very warm. Worth stopping in at Karsa cafe and/or their spa if it is open. One of the best restaurant settings in a place where their is plenty of competition.It really is something to make a definite, even if you are only in Ubud a short time."

The views along the walk to both the Eadt and West are great, but the pathway is sorely in need of maintenance. The path is supposed to be about 1.5 metres wide (four paving stones) along its entire length, but has become so overgrown that much of the oath is now only two paving stones wide and some sections are down to just one paving stone in width. There is also one short section where a small land slip has covered the paving entirely.The other thing to be aware of is that there is not much shade along the top of the ridge, so it's a hot walk. Also there is nowhere at all sit comfortably along the length of the wal (that is there are no path side seats) but there are a few spots where you can sit on the ground if you really need to.We ran into some mountain bikers on one of the steeper parts of the path and had we not been able to see them coming down might have had trouble getting out of their way.Do, all up, it's a good walk if you are young and fit, but not do much if you if you don't fit into that description."

It is mostly uphill, around 2.5 km, until you reach Kafe Karsa (took us about 40 mins).We stopped our walk at the cafe, had a Banana smoothie (cost IDR 35k) and fresh Coconut water (cost IDR 35k), also clicked a couple of pics as the view of the water lilies and rice paddies was amazing. Downhill was much easier while returning back. Be alert as you may find some chameleons or lizards crossing your way, especially in wet season."

It is a 2km walk to a charming cafe in the rice fields. It is suggested that you return back down the walking track ( which unusually is paved with pavers, so quite safe and negotiable on the steady slopes). I decided to continue north - without a map of course - I discovered Lonely Planet has a map of the walk. I continued through paddies, a little artist village - complete with the usual gallery-workshops along the way. I turned left along a narrow road/track (sealed and used by enless motor scooters) and found myself on a major road (for Bali) through a valley, over a bridge and up a very steep incline (where the police were helping extract a large truck that had gone over the steep edge). I continued on through some small villages - met a few local dogs - and eventually followed my way back to Ubud central. It felt like a long way - and the map says I did over 8 km in the heat and high humidity/light rain - and loved it."

I wasn't that impressed with the food at Kafe Karsa buthte setting is lovely. There is a little art shop in the village where an elderly gentleman paints eggs and sells paintings. He's a good sort - no pressure and fair prices. A little further down the track is the Maryana art 'gallery'. They tried to sell me a painting for $650 USD that the fellow who paints eggs was selling for 400,000 RPH (about 40 AUD or 30 USD). So avoid being scammed and buy from the gentleman who sells painted eggs. I actually walked for about another 30 mins after I found the village - the road passes rice paddies and then swings up a gentle incline past some fairly impressive dwellings and temples."

The stone lined path runs between the green grass and rice fields with plenty of good places to stop and snap a good photo. Best of all, it's free! If you walk all the way to the top there are some nice cafes to stop at and get a drink the walk isn't challenging at all. No difficult hills or anything like that involved. I had a lot of fun looking around and moving at my own pace while getting lots of nice photos. Campuhan ridge walk is definitely with a visit if you have some time in Ubud!"

It has been on my to do list ever since.I've start my walk from Sri Bungalow at Monkey Forest Road, walk towards Ubud market, turn right at the traffic light and continue to walk straight until you arrived at Warwick Ibah. Here you will see the signage to Campuhan Walk. Follow the direction on the signage, walk downhill and you'll see a bridge and a temple, continue to walk through the small lane. This is where you'll start your trekking through the beautiful green landscape. It is advisable to start you walk early in the morning as there is not much shade once you're on top of the hill or you may also bring umbrella or wear hat. Continue to walk until you see another signage to Karsa Caf\u00e9. Once you see the this signage it is the end of the hill walk and a start of another amazing beautiful green landscape. From here you will walk through some resort, locals shop selling handicrafts and rice terrace.You may stop at Karsa Caf\u00e9 for a Spa after the long walk or just have a drink or a bite. If you start your walk early in the morning you may see some locals farmer working in the field and get a chance to experience harvesting it with them. To go back to town area, you may walk back towards where you start or you may also get help from the staff at Karsa Caf\u00e9 to help you to get a taxi (we got lucky as there's a driver who sent their customer to have a Spa and we've paid him to sent us back to our hotel while waiting for them to finish). It took less than 30 minutes to drive back.I highly recommended this walk. The rice field is not as spectacular as Tegalalang but it is still worth it especially for those who really like to see nature vs the hustle bustle tourist area/ attraction."

We left early in the morning to beat the heat, and even though it was a cloudy, cool day, we still worked up a sweat as there is a lot of up and down. Other reviews say it isn't very long, but it was long enough for us in this kind of weather, taking about an hour for the round trip. The scenery is lovely - the black and gold temple at the beginning, the bright green rice fields, the water lillies at the end in the cafe pond. There were also a few local children playing and chatting amongst themselves. It seems they also like the tranquility and views."

I randomly found this on TripAdvisor while looking for an activity to kill time for a couple of hours in Ubud and I am so glad that I found this! The scenery along the walk was so green and peaceful, which really was a nice break away from the hustle and bustle of Ubud downtown.The most important thing about this walk is to start EARLY in the morning. We went a little before 10am and it was already scorching hot and there are no shades! Start at Ibah Hotel, walk around the walls of the temple and you'll see the walkway. It can get a little hilly at times but it's a pretty easy stroll throughout (I can't run a full mile without taking a break, to give you an idea). I saw some people walking in flip-flops but sneakers are recommended. Wear a hat, bring a bottle of water and don't miss this beautiful walk. Not to be missed!"

This ridge is only a short(20 minute) walk from the centre of town and is well worth the effort.Covered in savannah grass it give a a high point with lovely views especially near sunset. Sadly uncontrolled development nearby is beginning to encroach and it would be a great pity if this little oasis of vegetation and its view were lost."

Get your driver to meet you at Kafe Karsa or double back to Ibag Hotel. Do not walk north from Kafe Karsa to the main road, it is tiring and traffic danger.2) The ridge view is good. The rice terrace view at Kafe Karsa is spectacular. Bring some money and relax with a fruit juice at the cafe. Take photos of the terrace rice fields and buy some feed for the fish in the ponds.3) Many galleries along the walk. A few opens late in the morning.4) The walk is paved with concrete most of the way. Safety was not an issue. A few morning joggers were present.Con :1) The ridge walk is exposed. Do not walk later in the morning (when it is sunny and humid) or when it is about to rain.Will definitely do the early morning walk again. Most recommended for early morning walks."

We started early morning, around 6am and parked our scooter just at the entrance to Ibah hotel. There is a short walk through construction and junk before the walk commences and the breathtaking views are visible. We got to the top and wanted to walk to the cafe at the top with a beautiful lilly pond surrounding but realised there were dogs all over the place, where Balinese people all have dogs for security at their homes. Many of these dogs wander around and we are not the biggest fans of unleashed dogs! Eventually we made it to the rice fields and the cafe overlooking, where we had delicious fresh iced juices. This was a great way to start the day and by the time we made it back to the hotel, the heat was becoming unbearable, so an early start is essential while the air is fresh and cool."

At the end of the path there's a cafe where you can relax & enjoy fresh coconut or your morning tea.

Having said that, the sky was a little cloudy so it was a really pleasant walk. It depends on which side of the ridge you start the walk - most guide books will advise you to start from the majestic Pura Gunung Lebah temple next to the Hotel Warwick Ibah entrance. We actually started the walk from the other end as we were visiting a friend's villa (Villa Amala) that was situated only 5-10 min drive away. From that point, we walked to the temple start point of the ridge walk. It is more of a down hill walk this way! Overall, an enjoyable experience!"

The Karsa Spa website has very good directions with photos - check this out if you are planing to take the hike.The start is quite steep but easy enough with a basic level of fitness and there are plenty of spots to stop and get your breath and take some stunning photos. I only saw a handful of other walkers on my way and it was very peaceful.The walk to Karsa Spa and Karsa Kafe took around 30 minutes. It gets hot every quickly, as I had a 10am spa booking at Karsa Spa I started the walk at 9am. Taking the walk earlier is recommended.Karsa Kafe is a good place to stop and have a drink and something to eat - basic menu but very nice location to sit in a hut over the fish pond and cool down. Karsa Spa was also amazing - book in advance if you want to go here!You can complete the loop back around to Ubud but this is around 6km and it is not as nice as the start of the walk. I would recommend either walking back down the way you came which will mostly be downhill so much easier or get transport by car as I did. Karsa Kafe offer transport back to Ubud town centre for 100k."

It was difficult to find the entrance off the main road, and they I walked by a school and temple with no signs telling me which way to go as the road spit into several directions. Once I finally got on the right path it was a scenic walk. However I found that it's just a one way direction because at the end you end up on a public road but stop at the restaurant/massage place to get some fresh juice and free wifi. Be sure to bring water with you."

Just down the road from where I was staying, I packed up my trainers to visit this beautiful escape from the hustle and bustle of Ubud town. The ridge walk is magical as you pass the temple and the locals...then it's complete silence as you venture out in the ridge walk for hours...the view left and right is lush greenery, local homes, palm trees, rice fields....shame about the garbage being tossed around but what to do. The fresh air and excellent uphill workout while soaking in earthy sights made for this long day of pure bliss. Pack your trainers and enjoy this free solo trek for the soul!"

Bought lonely planet guide expecting it to be useful.Set off from palace and flowed the route, greatly helped by some posters put up by an enterprising cafe, after about 3km we reached the wonderful cafe had a drink and a snack. All great, cafe had wonderful views and friendly staff, set off for the second part described by lonely planet and walk deteriorated rapidly. Joined roads dodged traffic and eventually (4 sweaty boring km later) reached the point where lonely planet said to turn off to see more wonderful views only to find a sign saying \"this is private road guide book got it wrong\". Lost interest had an ice cream a delightful Italian restaurant and took a taxi back to hotel.Lonely planet guide now in the bin, why don't the writers actually \"walk the walk\" suspect they do it in a bar in Kuta.My advice - Go to the cafe (has upstairs viewing tables) relax and go back the way you came and don't waste money on the lonely planet guide, you can get 2 good meals for the price of it when you're here, much better value."

One of the posts on this website was helpful in finding the start of the path (follow a path on the right by the bridge just before you enter the temple). We walked the 2km as expected from other reviews to the rice padi where we thought the scenic walk would start, however we got immediately list and ended up having to walk a couple of hours back to ubud on main roads (some of which had good shops on it).Basically this walk is ok, it could just do with better instructions being clear it ends at the rice padi or telling people where the path through the padi is."

We decided to attack this walk early and left our hotel at about 6am it took us about 15 mins to get to the temple to start the trek. Now as it was nice and cool the the start of the walk did not hurt too much even though it is all up hill for the start once you reach the middle of the trek you realise why u chose to do the walk well worth it. It took us about 45 mins from the temple to the kasar cafe and had banana pancakes to fuel up for the walk home. All up set aside at least 3 hours if you are walking from accom based in the centre of ubud."

Beginning: TempleMiddle: TrailEnd: A road with some small artwork shops and a couple of places to eat and drink. There are also some rice paddies and terraces a few minutes walk down the road.Finding the Trail Entrance: Find the Ibah Resort, enter the driveway and continue to the left of the sign, go down a really steep hill (pass the school), take the lower path to the right, follow it past the temple and up to the ridge.Trail: Some of it is dirt, but most of it is stonework and the end of it turns into a road. It\u2019s mostly an uphill walk until the end where it becomes a road but it\u2019s nothing difficult. The trail was shorter than we thought it\u2019d be.When to Go: The earlier the better! I would suggest starting sometime before 9am when it\u2019s a little cooler and there\u2019s less people. It gets hot and humid very fast so bring something to drink or get something at the end of the trail at Karsa Kafe. The Kafe is right next to some beautiful rice terraces and a good place to relax before heading back.Temple: There is a temple at the beginning of the trail but when we went in mid-September the temple was inaccessible due to restoration. We were a little disappointed that we couldn\u2019t walk around the temple but they appear to be doing a lot of work on it and it\u2019s going to look fantastic when they\u2019re done.Notes/Tips: Don\u2019t forget to put on some sunscreen."

There is no off route. You can walk further towards some rice fields and turn back. Or... Answer the local that yells taxi and he will drive you back to Ubud via a different route. Highly recommended walk if you have a couple of hours to spare. If you just want to see rice fields its better to go north in Ubud and at the center road head west (or a bit more north and then west).

The beginning is just down the hill from Ibah (?) Hotel.. continue to ask the locals about the Campuhan Ridge Trek and they should point you in the direction. Might be better off asking where the hotel is though, since it is more well known.Walk in the morning! Definitely broke a sweat, but anyone should be able to do this. Not too challenging. Karsa Kafe at the top is a must. Beautiful views and great spot to cool down. Also, some amazing artwork in the last shack before Karsa Kafe on the left. The man is cute and SO nice.. we didn't bring enough money to buy one of his wooden painted eggs, but really wish we did. Would have made for a great souvenir!"

Best rice paddie walk (or equivalient with the walk to Sari Organik). Stop at Karsa Kafe at the end for the most superb drink ever - Lime and Honey juice - and I cannot recommend the foot massage enough - the full hour - then get transport back to Ubud.

The walking path is well marked just go left at the gate to the Ibah Hotel then keep right past the temple. It is fairly well sign posted. The walk itself isn't very difficult and starts with an uphill portion before evening out. I stated walking at about 615am and it took about 30 minutes to get to the Karsa Kafe before I turned around. This ended up being a good decision as I was the only one on the trail. Other tourists looked like they had started around 7am and I counted about 10 people as I headed back. I can't comment on the cafe itself as it was closed when I got there. I also had to call my hotel to send a taxi as I wasn't able to find one on the way back. All in all a good little walk that I would recommend as a good way to start your day!"

I did this walk a few weeks ago, early in the morning so the weather was fine and there were hardly any people on the trail, which made a huge difference. The road part from the Palace to the Hotel turn off was ok as i browsed through the shop windows and traffic was minimal. From there i thoroughly enjoyed going down to the river then up an incline to be met by stunning views and fields of tall grass either side of the track. Some of the galleries and craft workshops were already open, including a sweet lady hand painting eggs, which was fun to watch. I stopped off at the beautiful cafe on the left for a drink and the views from here are equally as beautiful. However, after a kilometre further than this point, i turned left and the road became more like a race track than an amble through the Ubud countryside. I always walk against the flow of traffic but even so I had some very near misses, mostly from kids on scooters and tourist cars. As my walk progressed i started to enjoy it less and by the time i reached the main road the traffic was horrendous. A great walk and some lovely old temples but the experience was hampered somewhat by the traffic."

We walked to the top of the hill, with early morning light and cool fresh breezes. The early time is also peaceful with very few people out and about. I think this walk in the middle of the day would be too hot, as there are no trees for shade. We stopped at a couple artists' shops and decided at the top not to make the big loop, but to come back the same way we came. Lots of work taking place at the Tjampuhan Temple at the beginning of the route. Take water, camera and all your senses. A beautiful journey."

If you are getting tired of all the traffic of central Ubud, this makes a nice walk on the ridge between two river valleys which then transitions into an area of scenic rice fields (to the west of the more extensive area of rice fields just north of Jl. Raya in central Ubud). On this walk in the countryside, we saw people tending to their daily business working in the fields, cleaning up their yards, smiling and waving hello. On our visit, there were two large dumptrucks of youngsters (yes, that\u2019s how they were transported) on a work crew.If you are walking with children, I strongly recommend that you end your walk and return back at around the Karsa Kafe/Art Gallery/Spa overlooking the beautiful rice terraces about a mile along the walk, as there is not much \u201cnature\u201d walk after that and you will begin competing with vehicles on a side road with many turns, dips and switchbacks and a continual stream of vehicles until you get to the main street heading into Ubud and then sidewalks again (with marginally safer walking, but again, not much nature). The Kafe makes for a great break, though. We sipped cool drinks in a shaded bungalow overlooking the rice fields, and you could even have a spa treatment there if you desire. The drinks were enough for us. Very beautiful, relaxing location.Just the same, it is a nice walk if you are looking to escape the urban core, but while the guidebooks tend to make everything seem essential, don't fret if you don't get the chance to do it."

            "review": "Guidebooks are wrong - try this. By doing 2 prongs of the poorly mapped walk you get the best and avoid the worst. We did the whole walk from both sides and here's there real scoop. Only the Campuhan River side of the walk starting at the Ibah luxury villas near the under reconstruction Pura Gunung Lebah temple is well marked. This path is mostly easy walking on pavers through some picturesque elevations. Go through a small town, don't miss the egg painter who willingly posed for pictures. Farmers were doing the pre-planting plowing of a rice field right by the road with fascinating rotary paddles on tractor-type equipment - in bare feet no less. Note the walk has become a road at this point. Strongly recommend to stop at the Karsa Kafe. Sweet little place with thatched huts over fish pond for dining and snacks. You'll need refreshment at this point and it's quiet, delicious and with a lovely view, much nicer than the guide books list. It's open only tip sunset. Again I recommend -stop the walk at this point, because just past it, the walk turns left and joins a well-trafficked road that goes up and down, up and down, sharply and at quite some distance. No longer such fun; when hot and really tired you join the so-called top of the loop in really busy traffic villages. From this point on it's heavy traffic and joins the main road back into Ubud. If you go left at the T in the road you miss all the rice fields on this side. Better to have reversed direction at the Karsa Kafe. And then if you want the very best rice fields experience try the other side of the mapped walk. Go uphill just past the delightful Hotel Tjampuhan (hope you're staying there), and ascend the approx. 100 steps on the other side of the road. There's a car/scooter/guide rental in the narrow opening, but the steps are clearly visible and there is no other similar. Cross carefully in heavy traffic. Once at the top of the steps you begin to descend the next ravine (surprise, surprise), passing by accommodations, scooter traffic and small shops. Do not on any account miss the gallery of I Wayan Karja, a contemporary abstract painter with international reputation. We bought a painting. The sealed narrow road proceeds down to the river and up again to Penestanan village. Turn right at the T (regular traffic road), but shortly it will turn left and then right and you'll be in the midst of real rice fields, not just a view. Almost no one was on these narrow (1 foot wide in some places) paths, and it was a treat. Just keep going on the paths by the side of the field ditches; you can't go any other way. The weather was partly cloudy, or else it could have been a hot, killer walk at midday. That means go early unless it's overcast. There were ducks doing their eating job of bugs and leftover rice after harvest as well as new construction of what looked like some interesting houses. Eventually you come out on a paved road near the Ubud Padi resort and you're done with rice fields. Up one more steep hill and you come out on that main road (there's a small Ubud Padi sign if you need to reverse course) where a right turn will take you back in high traffic to the main Ubud street. The street does take a right turn and then starts descending. Sidewalks are narrow, irregularly lumpy, with holes, trash and construction materials. If you're tired now, try to find a taxi, because it's a significant walk past the Neka Museum and Bintang supermarket downhill and back up into the main tourist area."

Easy to follow directions and the first 3km were quite beautiful although steep in places - through alang alang grass with fantastic views on both sides, through a small settlement, to the rice fields which were at different stages of planting and growth. Karsa Cafe well worth a stop as fantastic views, reasonable prices and the cleanest general toilet visited for a while! TURN AROUND when you get to the main road not far past the cafe unless you then want to walk another 6 km (seemed much longer) through the villages of Payogan and Lungsiakan back into Ubud from the north along roads many without pavements, quite steep in places and busy with bikes and cars. - an experience my husband and son weren't too happy about - adventurous but not overly scenic and it then leads you back into Ubud over the Campuhan Bridge. Met others on route complaining about the extended circular walk - think carefully!Would have given it a 5 for the first 3km and a 3 for the remainder so 4 overall."

Ubud is my favorite place on Bali, and if I go again I would choose to stay in Ubud rather than the coast and explore the rest of the island from there.Atmosphere is much more relaxing than on the coast and everything is at walking distance.There are some wonderful walks to take to see the rice fields and surrounding area, with Campuhan ridge being just one of them. Apart for the ridge, on the main street (Jl Raya Ubud) you will see on the right side a small sign \u201eto the rice fields\u201c indicating that you should enter a narrow space between a restaurant and another building to follow some narrow path passing peoples laundry \u2013 GO for it, it really leads to wonderful rice fields.Main market is also worth a visit since the prices are lower than on the coast.In the evening we went for a puppet show which is held in one hotel at the entrance to Ubud. It is touristy but personally worth a visit (show is in Baliese but you get a description in English before the show to know what the story is about).There is plenty of home-stays to rent and we found it to be a great and cheep way to stay in Ubud."

It has a concrete pathway, which is very rare in Bali.The walk takes about 4 hours starting from Ubud Palace and offers beautiful sights. It is almost impossible to get lost, since there is only one way to go. It seems that it hasn't been discovered yet by the mass tourists, which makes the connection with nature even greater. In the middle of the walk, there is a nice little village with some caf\u00e9s offering beautiful sights on the rice fields.If you have a half day in Ubud and you wish to see some of the surrounding views and natural sights, don't hesitate and do the Campuhan Ridge Walk!"

Finding it may be a problem for some but those who rent a scooter and move around Bali will probably have seen the temple under construction that marks the start of the trail. Especially people who go to Naughty Nuri's ribs. There are signs marking the start of the trail but nothing much after a few km. As it was getting dark, we turned around at the caf\u00e9 at the Padi fields, so not too sure how much further the trail goes on for. Perhaps someone should make a sign indicating the map of the trail.Yes, it shows a completely different side of the touristy, noisy, crowded central Ubud. That's why we strongly suggest all visitors to Ubud to walk this trail to see the beauty of the countryside.We discovered that on a Sat afternoon / evening, Ubud teenagers use the area as a park to get out and enjoy nature. Its nice and windy there. So do try out this walk, its not tough. You don't need walking shoes, special gear or anything like that. The local kids run up and down in flip flops."

My companion didn't want to come and it was raining that day but I went anyway, by myself, in the rain, leaving our villa at 7am. Lucky it was warm! IThe start of the walk isn't very encouraging, it starts beside a hotel (Hotel Ibah), then you walk down a laneway-type thing , past a school, then you sort of hop off the laneway and follow a sign. You go past a temple and then the trail starts. It's quite odd that it's paved, I thought. Despite being so close to bustling Ubud, I saw only one other person the whole time, and he was on his way to work in a rice paddy. The mist made the lush jungle look even more mysterious and I could hear the river. There are houses in the distances and working rice paddies. You come to a small village, with the obligatory art shop, then keep going to Kafe Karsa, which is about 2.4 km from the start. I stopped here. At first it looked like it wasn't open as there seem to be construction works going on but out the back was open so I stopped for a coffee. Big mistake! Coffee like gritty dirt and no amount of sugar or milk could save it! Apparently most people then turn around and head back but I kept going. Through another small village, then onto a road which apparently led back to Ubud. I was told it was another 8 km to Ubud so I decided to have a crack at it, walking along a road with no footpath, with people commuting to work and school. No tourists. Uphills and downhills. I made it about 4 km then gave in and a nice man in another village told me his son would dink me back into Ubud so for $AUD2 I jumped on and had a lovely ride back.This walk isn't one of the \"must do\" walks of the world but it is lovely and surprisingly quiet and private. It's not a difficult walk but the path can be a bit slippery in the wet. For something different, this is a lovely walk. Go early before it's too hot."

At a certain point we asked our way back to Campuhan and the Balinese people were really friendly to give us the right directions to the small road to Campuhan, along the river and a lot of rice fields. When you follow this road you can park your scooter there and walk the ridges on foot. Great views along the way. Some of the best rice fields we've seen in Bali!"

However, only a block off the main road, little gems like the Campuhan Ridge Walk await. The scenery is fantastic; however, it is easy to imagine that there will be less scenery with all the construction that is ongoing in the area surrounding the ridge. You can access the ridge walk by following Jalan Raya Ubud from the Ubud Market past the Museum Puri Lukisan until you reach the Ibah Villas. Follow the paved road down the hill and across the river to access the ridge walk."

They're very cheap compared with similar works that you may find in the centre of Ubud, and you now that you're supporting the actual artist.If you find the walk back down too much of an effort, you can always phone a taxi at the top to take you back to the centre of Ubud for about AU$10.

Rather than be put off by seeing local teenagers there, as commented on by another writer, we found it so interesting to see them enjoying themselves and we found them friendly. We also enjoyed meeting a very talented and renowned local artist in one house on the road, who delicately paints wooden \"eggs\" which were extremely cheaply priced, but there was no selling pressure at all. He also teaches local kids how to paint and a couple were there at the time, learning from him.

We kept going as we wanted to do the whole walk, but it is not well posted. After the shops, you take the first street on the left, and follow the traffic.

It begins a short walk from the main Monkey Forrest strip - a few kilometers from anywhere. (I would assume if you're looking for a walk to do, then you'd probably be happy to walk to the start of the track!) The track winds its way through some beautiful fields with a lovely view on either side. Young local teenagers use the track as a rare chance for private canoodling which is really sweet - maybe keep that vibe as you stroll through and keep the loud tourist chatter to a minimum! At the end of the track is a beautiful cafe (Karsa Kafe) where you can lie down and rest your legs before heading back. Fine for beginners, oldies, anyone with two legs I would think. Some hills and stairs yes, but plenty of spots to rest if you need. Early morning or on a cloudy day would be recommended as there's not a lot of relief from the sun."

I often go beyond Karsa Cafe and go into town. The rice paddies become more amazing. I often see people wearing sandals and flip-flops - and dresses - well I do not recommend these fashion statements. Wear some light hiking (or running) shoes and bring water and a camera. Some people just enjoy the views and do some meditation which I love seeing. It is a great place to do a small picnic as well. Sometimes a trail's purpose is not to look for another spa or to look for shops that are ubiquitous in Ubud. For me, this trail is to appreciate the beauty of Ubud."

Stop and take a look and all the detailed work that is going on; we were lucky to meet a young gentleman who explained to us what was being done. It turned out that he is a member of the royal family.The hike is pleasant and not strenuous. At one point you will see small shops. One shop is run by a miniature style painter, Wayan Rana; ranapainter@yahoo.com. He offers lessons in his studio.

While the town is lovely, it's hard to get a sense of what else Ubud has to offer and this walk shows you just how beautiful the area is. The walk is not too difficult but I'd recommend running shoes and a lot of sunscreen as there's not much shade. The scenery is stunning and the cafe at the end of the walk is one of the most beautiful, serene places I've ever been and the prices are very reasonable. The one complaint I have is that it was very difficult to find the start of the walk. If looking for walking directions from the town to the start of the hike be sure to use the \"driving directions\" instead of \"walking directions\" on Google maps. The walking directions takes you through fields and private property while the driving directions offer a direct and easy route to the start. This walk can't be missed - the views are stunning!"

You'll find a little sign starting at a little bridge that takes you past an old temple that is being rebuilt (as of May 2014).It's an easy, short walk on paved footpaths. The first half is a gentle uphill climb and brings you high up so that you're overlooking the hills and the luxury resorts built into them. It's very grassy and green, with lots of wildlife. Look out for the fascinating grasshoppers with yellow spotted wings and orange striped bodies, dragonflies and the numerous reptilian friends scurrying about.After that the path widens, and the terrain changes to that of rice field terraces. It's very lush and green. However, you will also encounter some vehicles and pass by villas, art shops, guesthouses, spas and cafes. It was a little bit too touristy for me.It gets really hot from about 9ish. You'll also get more people with children, who can be noisy. If you want some peace and more manageable temperatures, go early at the crack of dawn. Bring sunscreen, water and your camera. You don't even need serious trekking shoes - I went in flip flops."

I set out in the early morning to avoid the heat but found that the walk disappointing. The first part of the walk was through some fields, on top of the ridge but instead of feeling secluded, all I could see were big mansions / hotels being build on the opposite side. Future along the walk we came to a nice dirt road that had small shops along the side and further yet we reached a small cafe that was nice and relaxing. We had a good breakfast and cooled down. We weren't too sure whether the walk continued or not (we had walked 2km so far) so we asked some people if we should continue. They said that it was best to turn around and walk back the way be came as there was nothing past the cafe other than rice fields etc. They also mentioned that to do the round trip would also take a long time. So we turned back. I wouldn't do this walk again. Unfortunately for me there was nothing really exciting to see."

Caf\u00e9 is perfect spot to stop grab a cool drink, revive and head back. Much quicker getting back as its mostly downhill!! There are some steps at the beginning and some hills to climb but there is a path to follow. Don't be persuaded to take bikes unless you want to lug them up all the stairs. Plus the path is uneven in places and cobbled - not ideal for bikes really. Its a lovely relaxing walk with lots of signs to follow to the caf\u00e9. Head to the Ibah Hotel and when you enter the driveway veer left down the hill and take the track to the RHS of the bridge. You will walk past a temple under construction and up you go!!"

You end up back on the main road but much further up. Take a guide for the second part though, as the route through the paddies was not intuitive and there are no signs. Enjoy."

We chose to walk the 5 mile option and we really enjoyed it, the best part of the walk is going up to the ridge as the surroundings are stunning and the sound of the two rivers either side is very relaxing. When you get to the village you come across a restaurant called Kake Kafe and the views are great and your bamboo seats are on top of a pond which was nice. Then from there you walk around roads and some of then are steep and you finish you walk thinking you have walked a long way which was good for us.

The Ridge walk in Ubud is a treasure - enter from the Ibah Hotel sign on the right of Jalan Raya somewhat before the Campuan Bridge, coming from Ubud. The path leads you over a river and then you'll come to the Campuan - Campuhan, Campuan, Champuan, Tjampuan!!! Ridge... there are about 6 spellings but don't let that put you off!) A breathtaking open space, you are walking along the top of a mounded hill with a path along the top, surrounded by swaying green alang-alang grass - the kind of grass used for thatching rooves here - sometimes you'll even see a local harvesting it. The walk through nature is lovely and takes about 45 minutes to the end of the ridge - take a hat/sunscreen/water... on arriving at the far end, walk a little further to pass small painting, craft and egg-painting stores, to find at last a cafe with a lovely view of ricefields, and small bales (thatched open wall 'houses') arranged over a lotus pond full of large carp that have the unusual habit of flinging themselves out of the water to slither across the top of the lotus leaves, looking for insects (maybe they were just hungry that day!)You can walk back to Ubud via the road but that involves a very steep hill..or better, catch a motor bike ride back along the road from someone at the cafe (then you'll see what's involved!). Or of course, you can simply walk back along the ridge. To walk there and back with a short stop at the cafe, you need about 2 hours. When you get back, you could pop into the Ibah hotel to see their lovely spherical flower sculpture in the reception made from frangipanis (plumeria) and maybe have a drink in the pretty grounds. Alternatively pop over the road to Murni's Warung for lunch or dinner - lovely river views, and a very hip bar with a giant metal ganesha.or cross the bridge, to Bridges restaurant, more upmarket and a truly lovely inspiring and delicious venue for a meal."

The first part was very rural and serene. There's a guy with a little shop where the trails join. We had fresh coconut milk for a cheap price; was very refreshing. Campuhan Ridge is getting quite commercial at the southern end with many reastsurants and art studios (great art but not cheap). We were 'bailed up' by an old woman picking rice who posed for a photo then 'demanded' payment (ohh dear). Wonderful photo opportunities abound. "

Either way, do this early in the morning because much of it is unshaded. A much more beautiful walk can be had on the way to Sari Organik.

For some reason I had expected it to be much longer and I was surprised that half of the walk was along a quiet road with some hotels and artist studios. Out of loyalty to Kafe Karsa posting good signs along the way we stopped there for some young coconut but we could have stopped at a few other nice looking places along the way. Lovely lotuses at the Kafe which were nice to see as the ones in town had been washed away by strong rain. We were happy to buy some art directly from one of the artists as we wandered back. We met a lot of hot, over-dressed Indonesian studentsin their uniforms planning picnics along the ridge, so it is best to go early before the sun starts beating down and the humidity rises. It was also interesting to watch workers carving parts of the renovated temple as we were leaving. As Ubud could benefit from a pedestrian zone, this was a welcome change from much of the traffic. I wouldn't rate it as the number one attraction in Ubud though, as the Legong dances at the Palace and the wonderful museums definitely rate higher in my books."

My word of advice is to turn around at the cafe. After that there isn't much, and the constant motor bikes and territorial dogs can be a hassle. Certainly it's a recommendation of a way to spend a morning in Ubud. Directions: walk west from the Palace until you reach Ibah Hotel. It's impossible to miss. Walk into the Ibah and follow signs for the hill. Once you're on the path, walk straight until you reach the cafe at the top. Turn around there."

There is some nice scenery but not the stunning countryside I was hoping for and there was lots of walking past houses.We found the walk ok - there are a couple of useful signs for it near the Ibah hotel - and set off uphill. The immediate scenery was very nice of rice paddies and palm trees as we walked uphill. As the gradient became gentler we could soon see lots of smart houses so we didn't quite feel like we were away in the countryside. Also I think we must have missed the paths off down to the river that others have talked of.After just a few hundred metres the lovely scenery was blocked from view as we walked past various houses, some under construction, and the path became a dirt track road. We continued past lots more houses and shops/galleries selling paintings until we found the signposted Karsa Kafe, which was nice and sold lovely cold drinks.We then made the mistake of not turning back. This was our mistake as we hasn't read the reviews fully before doing this walk. The locals assured us we would get to Ubud if we followed the road then turned left. Following the road took us past more houses and the left turn took us onto a tarmacked road which went on and on with no pavement or footpath to turn off onto and regular traffic. Eventually we got a taxi as I hate walking along roads and it was another good 5km until we were back in Ubud! Clearly this was our fault but I'm writing here to warn others.So, if you turnaround at the cafe this is a nice walk but I wouldn't say spectacular."

It's not a particularly difficult walk, but is very warm and very humid. We had expected to feel rapturous along the ridge, but frankly, it was so-so. . . We had hoped for rice fields, but most of the ridge walk is simply past distant houses, with an occasional view of people collecting grass for thatching. The little Warung near the end of the 3 km walk was a lovely respite, though, featuring a breezy, cool interior and lovely drinks (our friends had mango lasses, which looked excellent and very refreshing.) A better walk, by far, is the shorter and slightly easier walk to Sari Organik. The entrance to this walk is about 100 m BEFORE you get to the Campuhan walk entrance at the Ibah Hotel. Look for the small brown sign pointing up a steep driveway (along with about 10 other similarly small signs!), with a tourist shack on your immediate right as you begin the climb. The Sari walk takes you mostly through peaceful, quiet rice fields, where you get to see rice farmers and organic farmers quietly plying their trade. Stop for a drink or meal at Sari Organik, a small and pleasant restaurant with spectacular rice field views. And don't forget to visit their nearby organic farm, which supplies the restaurant!"

It was a lot easier to find than most people make it out to be, starting off 5 minutes away from the main road (just spot that Ibah sign and you are set - look up some info online or ask people for directions if you are really lost). The walk itself is easy on the body as long as you bring some drinkable water with you and / or go in the morning (which I recommend for various reasons : it makes it feel more like an adventure, the air is fresher, and you are more likely to be by yourself - by noon the path is going to be packed with tourists, which is especially going to suck if you plan on taking photos). The scenery is beautiful, the feeling of isolation is great, the cliff section is really peaceful, then the village section is a nice change of pace and the local artists and craftmen will show you genuine interest (a commendable feat if you consider how many tourists they probably see walk by daily) and have a lot of intriguing work to show. We reached Karsa Kafe, rested some, had some fine hot drinks in a peaceful environment, fed the fish around the huts (an attraction worth the extra money in my opinion, it was surprisingly fun) then walked back the way we came seeing as lots of people had told us that it was the best way to do it, as the walk apparently only gets less interesting after that section. Round trip took us maybe 1,5 hour in total. We went at about 10 in the morning and already crossed paths with several groups of tourists on the way back. That walk was one of my fondest memories in wonderful Ubud, experience it while it lasts - I do not like the look of those new houses and buildings in construction nearby."

We managed to get completely lost but passed several locals, all more than happy to point us in the right direction and tell us about the area and their work their. Aside from the breathtaking wildlife and views, this is really what made it so special. One man even invited us to sit in his garden and drink coconut milk with him, he got the coconut fresh from the free we were sitting by!Worth considering before setting off. We ended up on some very small, long grass tracks and on both days we went walking we saw a snake. We had flip flops on which was probably not the best idea. If I'm lucky enough to return to Ubud one day I would definitely pack more sturdy foot ware. Having said that, we just made sure to stamp as we walked and it really wasn't a problem."

While the former are best experienced at Kuta and Nusa Dua, the latter is present is superlative measures at Ubud. And in Ubud, you'd be hard-pressed to find a better place than Campuhan Ridge walk for the same.What it is: A walk across the rice plains, taking in a few art galleries, cafes and stuff along the way. Soak in the sights. They're gorgeous. Miles and miles of rice fields. You'll see their unique irrigation and step farming as well as tons of trees.How difficult is it?: Quite easy. Walk leisurely, this sort of thing shouldn't be rushed.When should you do it? Either early morning or in the evening, pre-sunset. Warning: If you're going in the evening, beware of kids on scooters returning from school, and plan to finish the walk before 6 because it gets dark otherwise and it's not exactly a well-lit route. Start at 3 or 4.On the way: There are many art cafes with some lovely little paintings you can pick up (bargain!) and an awesome cafe where you can pick up small eats, coconuts and of course, the ubiquitous Bintang! They have lovely seating surrounded by water with fish. You shouldn't miss it! The cafe is called Karsa Kafe.What to bring: Walking shoes and a camera.Beware: Of stray dogs. Not as friendly as some of the ones you might be used to. Just stay out of their way. Don't approach to pat them or anything. We actually wandered around and got a little lost - thankfully we were able to get ourselves to a little shop which called a taxi and we were ferried back :-) So don't be shy to ask for directions.All-in-all, a must-do if you're in Ubud (which is a must-do if you're in Bali!)"

Also, it had quite a few very nice Cafes overlooking the rice-fields directly, and no big construction going on. If I had to choose just one, I would choose the rice-field path.

I wasn't bothered by mosquitoes during the walk but as soon as I stopped for a drink, they started buzzing around me. I suggest bringing a mozzie repellent just in case. Kids above 10 years of age should be ok but it could still be a challenge for them if they do not appreciate the views or do not enjoy walking. Great for those who enjoy trekking."

We both had Mango Lassis' and agreed they were the best and freshest we had tasted throughout our travels. The views along the Campuhan Trail and on the ridge are spectacular. It really was amazing how we could simply turn off of the main road in Ubud and all of a sudden we were immersed in the country side with some the most breath-taking views on both sides of us.

Went out to higher grounds on the left, and emerged into an even better landscape. Followed the trail met some locals, and along the way there's lots of cafe's warungs for stop and rest. Cant resist my self for a stop and some drinks. Nice drinks but don't put your expectation too high on the food. Check the price before sitting. The view and scene is worth a stop for a short break.

At the moment the large temple at Campuan is undergoing renovations/extensions so be careful as you go past some of the track is missing. I would advise everyone to do this walk before there is too much more building in the area by foreigners. Enjoy it while you can. Another recommendation is that, if you do want to stop for a cool drink, and you probably will, stop at one of the smaller shops on the way. By doing so you will pay half the price than at the cafe with the three thatched huts. The views thee are great, the food a bit expensive, but they have certainly learned how to hike up the price of drinks"

This walk was historically a inspiration for early artists in Ubud and remains one of the most spectacular ways to see a little of Ubud outside of the hassle of Monkey Forest Road. It is a easy walk from the top of the ridge down to the bottom but only takes a round trip of 40 minutes at a easy stroll. The hardest bit is the walk out of the river end but that soon makes way to a ridge top walk where you can see down to the river verges on both sides. I recommend making your way up to the Kokos Hotel for a refreshing drink before returning to the bottom again. You can park your scooters or car off the road at the bottom of the walk below the Ibah Resort lower car park entrance."

We had to ask a few people along the way which way to go you get to a sharp fork on the trail which almost doubles back on itself on the other side of the irrigation channel, cross over the channel to head back to the main road direction rather than continuing up the valley.

The road winds around the village and be warned that its a steep slope of about 400m stretch (way steeper than the ridge). Nothing much to see with the usual shops along the road.

This year I finally made it, and felt quite proud when I got back to my room in Penestanan. You start from the temple that's way down below the Campuhan Bridge. They're renovating, and it's a bit hard to find the path, but someone will help. Then it's a long slow climb up through fields of elephant grass, used for thatching. It's immediately beautiful, as you walk through a sea of bright green with views across the ravines on both sides of the ridge. The path is paved with bricks most of the way, with the odd patch of dirt road. It's rather up and down, but not too demanding. Best to set out early though, before it gets too hot. Eventually you will come out onto the road from Payogan to Keliki village, which is narrow and quite busy...it's safer to walk on the right, facing on-coming traffic. The hardest part of this 8km trek was the steep dip down to the river and the really long climb back up the other side...I'm sure it was further up than down! I was offered a motorbike ride, but declined. My 64-year-old body relishes a challenge, and I am so aware that slow and steady wins the race. From the top of the hill, it's still quite a way into Ubud, and since it's all on the road, I think that when I do this hike again, I'll just walk to the end of the ridge and back. I\u2019d always heard that being up there was outstandingly beautiful, and now I know that it\u2019s true."

They are also building a spa which has started operating from one of their villas. I got caught in the rain so went for a massage to kill some time. It was awesome!

You walk up along a narrow ridge right between two rivers and there's long green grass all around. Across the river on one side are some buildings, but the other side is completely empty with rice paddies in the distance. A must-see."

Besides the first part that is the hill to get to the ridge the rest is an easy going, paved path.We left early (6.30 a.m) to beat the heat & was glad we did. The only thing was once we got past Karasa Kafe we didn't quite know how much further to go, as our hotel told the track just leads to villages. But it becomes quite a main tarred road, so after 1/2 hour of that we turned around & headed back. Enjoyable & would do on regular basis but like a previous reviewer said if looking for rice paddy walk go up to Jalan Kajeng, my favorite sunrise walk ."

It is easy on the feet, with a paved track and not too many stairs to walk up and down. Half decent shoes will do the trick. The views are quite breathtaking and also walking through the villages makes you feel as if you are seeing the \"real\" Bali. There was one very steep hill on the road back into Ubud so beware! On the way back into Ubud there are many shops and restaurants to break the journey. Recommend this hike if you are even semi fit, just take your time and enjoy what is has to offer."

He ended dropping us a 10 minute walk from Karsa Kafe. This meant our walk was mostly down hill and got a lovely breeze on us. We also didn't have to walk on the busy road into the track. Although the walk was shortened it allowed us more time to stop and enjoy our surrounds. A drink and feeding the fish at Karsa Kafe was lovely then we ventured on looking at some local craft and paintings. The ridge walk was absolutely stunning,so many locals to stop and chat to along the way and many young couples sneaking a kiss in the shade but still very quiet and secluded. The main development we noticed was the development before the bridge. Remember just keep going straight ahead then follow the path until you reach the bridge."

If you like easy hiking this is definitely worth doing, an easy 2 hour or so walk close to the west-side of Ubud's centre - see my map in the attached photos. You see some wonderful countryside and best of all visit the very lovely Karsa Kafe for lunch as a reward for your efforts, under an hour from the main road.Start from the Ibah Hotel (see my pics) on the west side of Ubud centre, go down the steep pathway to the river on the left-hand fork, follow the sign over the bridge/river and then walk up the path (its a bit scruffy to begin with, but gets better as you climb higher up)It then opens up to the ridge and the views are just great, see my pics. About a kilometre or so in you'll see the Karsa Kafe on your left, stop here for lunch, it has really good cooking! Top price for a dish is R35,000 (approx GBP \u00a32.30 !) - note it closes by 4-5pm.If you continue the walk to the main road after the cafe, about 10-15 mins, then this is the end; note that there are some lovely terraced rice fields to the left side. Then turn round and return to Ubud on the same trail. Enjoy!"

The trail is really hidden from the main road but it could find it, you're in for a treat!Unfortunately there's not enough information, nor you could google map it. Hence, I've drawn up a map so with the \"walkthrough\" you won't be constantly doubting you we're on the right path like I did.When you're strolling west coming downhill from Jalanraya Ubud, look for a big stone signage: Ibah Suites, Restaurants & Spa. Look closer and the little signage pointing towards the hill is actually hidden underneath Ibah's menu! Follow the steep trail downhill, walk cross the bridge, it will lead you to a temple. You cannot enter its main yard as it is under renovation. Outside the temple towards the end of the trail there're steps taking you down to the river which is also worth a visit. The ACTUAL campuhan trail, however, starts before the bridge on your right. The alternative trail will take you around via the side of the temple on your and roaring river on your right. Do be cautious of the condition of the trail due to the on-going construction, it get slippery after rain or simply obstructed by construction materials.If you're able to walk around the temple side you will immediately see a stretch of grey brick road laid in front of you. Follow the (grey) brick road and you're on your way to the lush Emerald City!Do:Allow yourself half a day to explore the trail;Wear comfortable clothing, a good pair of walking/running shoes;Bring a bottle of water;Observe the local weather come rain or shine because you will be fully exposed to it throughout the entire walk;Use sunscreen, insect repellent and etc;Pace yourself - the trail spans 3km (to the peak) and 7km (full circuit);Bring camera - every scenery is wallpaper worthy!"

It's on a driveway on the right hand side after a downward incline on the road that's flanked with stone walls (if you see Murni's Warung on the left, you've passed it and need to back track about 50m). This walk is great in the early mornings or whenever the sun isn't blazing. Wear track shoes - inclines can be steep at points. Love the view from the top of the ridge and Karsa Kafe with its views across verdant paddy fields. We thumbed a lift from some farmers/workers in a truck heading back towards Ubud afterwards. Everyone in the villages is really friendly. Give yourself a good 4 hours for this walk."

Walking from Ubud out towards Cafe Karsa the path ends in a set of steps and a few houses. Or at least it does at the moment. In 2013 a huge 43 roomed hotel plus chalets and spas is due to open and the entrance road will be between these houses and Cafe Karsa - so the cafe Karsa is doomed as a quiet, rice field retreat. To accomodate this development an enormous section of the rice terraces in the valley have been gouged out.

Walk until you see Ibah Spa on your right. Turn right and there will be a sign pointing you to the 'Walk to the Hill' or something like that. Just follow that signs and you will find the trail easily. There are some shops and cafes on the way in case you get hungry/thirsty. We just brought our own water bottles and snacks so we didn't visit any of the cafes. I don't recommend going in the middle of the day because there is no shade and it gets very hot.

Walked to our resort - Payogan Resort and Spa."

Ubud central is now a busy hectic place but 5 minutes from the centre of town you can find a wonderful walk up through alleyway and then amongst rice and vegetable fields. Views of the distant Agung Volcanoe could just be seen on the day we walked. A stop off at the rrganic farm for a fresh fruit juice or bite to eat is also good. It was disappointing to see however the large excavation occuring on the side of the valley for more massive resorts :-("

I personally didn't find the walk or slopes challenging (and I'm not that fit!); more that the heat from the afternoon sun was trying. But still we eventually came upon a rest stop cafe which had huts by the paddy fields and cold drinks. Wonderful adventure!"

This walk is one of the better around Ubud, and takes you past one of the larger and older Temples in the area at the meeting of the rivers. The views along the ridge are absolutely stunning. The walk will also take you through a traditional village, and there are plenty of small art galleries along the way. I suggest wearing running shoes or sturdy footwear as the roadway is very rough, the trail is steep, and can be a bit treacherous and slippery when wet."

From Ubud Town it is a gentle walk up but then just walking along the top of the ridge. The countryside of rice terraces are absolutely gorgeous. I took many photos of panoramic style. There are heaps of small family run galleries to look through. About 1/3 through there is a guy who was selling fresh coconuts to drink. Once on the other side of the ridge there is a section where you walk along the road lined with shops. In this section we had the most magnificent shaved icecreams at a pink shop called Eses - apparently it is a Japanese style icecream but it was just fabulous. After the partial road walk you cut back into the rice paddies just past Mozaic restaurant or at least that is what the Lonely Planet book says. There were about four families also walking around near the Mozaic restaurant trying to find where you cut back into the rice paddies but no one could find the track again. Several of the taxi drivers said it is because its not there any more due to development of hotels, at first we thought this was a way to get us into a taxi but alas I now think it is very true that the development of hotels has taken away the last part of this great walk.Well worth the walk - I loved it.Lou"

Once at the top, we stopped for a beer and a rest at the little bar/cafe that overlooks the rice paddies. It has a lovely breeze which was great after the warm walk up the hill. (They also offer a lift back to town for anyone who can't face the 3km walk back.)The walk is steep in places but it's paved and there are trees at the top to shelter from the sun."

            "review": "Beautiful rice field walk, plus art galleries and good food. We were staying in the village of Penestenan and accessed the Campuhan ridge by climbing up the hill to a swanky hotel on the side of the river gorge. There we turned left following the \u201cUp the Hill\u201d sign, and snaked our way up and along a small paved cement path into the hills. The path travels up and along a ridge between two river gorges, one side of which is planted with rice and the other with villas and hotels terraced down to the riverbed. After a walk of half an hour or so we reached a small village at the crest of the hill, seemingly every house of which belonged to artists and all selling paintings, carvings, and drawings from their home galleries (as well as renting bikes, motorbikes, etc). Some of these places were very elaborate and also contained rental units; others were much more modest in scale. As we walked along we could hear the hordes of ducks honking in the fields as they nosed in the cut rice for critters to eat. We\u2019d worked up a sweat from our climb and so stopped at one small home and gallery for a beer and to admire the view. While there, we had a look at all the paintings on display and decided to purchase one small painting on canvas of a barong dance and a stylised drawing of three figures dancing. Prices for the paintings here are incredibly inexpensive and if we had untold funds and untold room in the bags, we would probably have bought more. Further along the path we came to a newly-opened cafe situated in a lotus pond with a view over rice terraces, a perfect spot for lunch, after which we continued through more artists\u2019 villages and onto a main road. I had thought that this particular path returned via a loop to town but it became increasingly obvious as we went further along that it did not. Several cycle tour groups had passed us on the way and, luckily, one small group was just loading up the bikes to return to Ubud as we approached. After inquiring about how far the road went, and realising that, at 20 km, it was too far to finish that day, we asked for a lift back to Penestanan which they were kind enough to give us at no charge \u2013 huzzah! This walk is highly recommended. The rice fields in Bali are the most incredible bright green that I\u2019ve ever seen. And the contrast between the green of the fields, the darker green of the palm trees, and the blue of the sky is magical.

            "review": "A Beautiful Walk in a Beautiful Place. Many people come to Ubud for the cultural activities that abound there, and the art that spills out onto every street. It's probably the best place in Bali, especially if you're not particularly into the beach scene. Walking around Ubud and ducking into quaint shops, bargaining at the pasar- village market, having a stroll through the Monkey Forest, and visiting the palace and many temples are wonderful experiences. However, they almost all pale in comparison to the wonderful experience of taking a walk on the Campuhan Ridge in the early morning. This walk starts in \"downtown\" Ubud and takes you along the ridge that begins at the confluence of the Wus 1 and Wus 2 streams. In fact, Campuhan means to mix- so where the waters mix, or meet. It's a slightly steep climb at the beginning but should not be a challenge for most people. Quickly you are up on top of the ridge that separates the two streams of Wus and you are greeted with beautiful views across both canyons. The only downside is having to look at all the expensive villa hotels clinging to the west side of the walk. Huge ugly satellite dishes- so satellite tv can be received by the villas- are not nice to look at no matter where you're at. However, the east side view is beautiful as you look across to the terraced rice fields. The ridge walk itself is not in the rice fields but through the tall grasses that the Balinese often use to make alang alang, the thatched roofs you see on their temples and homes. If you're lucky to have clear view you 'll have a chance to see Mount Agung off to the east and other mountains in the central part of Bali to the west. However, even if you don't have those views you will have the memories of a spectacular walk in a beautiful place to take home with you and keep forever."
