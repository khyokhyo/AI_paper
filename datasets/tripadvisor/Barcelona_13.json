Compared to the first there were many more stalls open and less people also, both of which allowed a better appreciation of the work and effort that must go into setting up the stalls. It makes Selfridges food hall in London look like a second rate untidy mess. This is how to present food, some of the fruit stalls were extraordinarily laid out with fabulous displays of colour and layer upon layer of magnificent huge voluptuous fruit and veg. The amount of different empanadas on sale was amazing too, and its almost impossible not to buy something no matter how determined you are. I doubt there are many bargains to be had, but who cares when it all looks so magnificent. The only irritant is the amount of dumb tourists doing nothing but waving selfie sticks and their cameras around and who clearly have no intention of buying anything...oh well"

This is a pretty awesome place to grab some excellent fruit, fresh seafood, or amazing candy. There are several vendors that are set up for you to try and buy some of the locals best. I wouldn't say this is a tourist destination must see, but we really recommend visiting the Mercat"

We have a very good market in Adelaide which is a major tourist attraction but this really tops it."

In one case you can find all fresh food, sea food, also small snacks, bars and restaurants. For sea food trenders it's very nice. Recommended, to have afternoon, there's many exotics fruits that sells in plates, papaya, cocus, inoa, ananas and it can be a real good snack meal mid day."

Many stalls selling the same or very similar products. Fruit salads, fresh juices, nuts, fresh meat and seafood etc. Great atmosphere and good for spending 30 odd minutes if you do t plan to eat there. If you are one of the lucky ones to find seating around one of the bars serving mainly seafood then lunch is worth it. We ended up spending 30 euros for a plate of scallops (3 in total) with a mushroom mix which was very tasty and a grilled sea bream that was delicious. As the bars were very busy they were only serving part of their menu of main courses only which was a shame. Customer service was rushed but still friendly compared to the U.K. Don't buy the coconut for drinking as it's a rip-off. We paid 1.50 Euros for 4 small sips."

The only thing I didnt like is that it was very very crouded, full of tourists, locals and vendedors and I felt little pressure because I had to watch on my bag whole time.

Go hungry, there are so many small eateries within and around the market that you will find something that makes you happy. The fresh fruit juices are definitely a highlight. For 1-2 Euros you can have a glass of blueberry coconut juice or mango orange juice, or one of the countless other creations for sale. There are stalls selling candy, dried fruit and nuts, fresh fruit, vegetables, and seafood, including Bacalao.It is less crazy in the back of the market, which is also where you can find a food kiosk with organic vegetarian food and a felafel stand. If the weather is nice, make your purchase and head out the back where you can find places to sit and eat your delicious food. Definitely bring your camera, your appetite and your patience. Enjoy!"

Then when the market appears just off the busy street, there is a sense of something even bigger. The market is a sheltered area of stalls squeezed together just for the purpose of stimulating all the senses. Even before you can see it, the aromas make your stomach growl, but then the distracting blur of shapes and colors, combined with the din of buyers and sellers can be off putting. The abundant choices of fresh foods and drink can be overwhelming, especially when it becomes necessary to compete at a counter for a purchase. We took our time and wandered and looked before choosing our treats. Inevitably prosciutto was involved, along with fresh seafood, cheeses and eventually churros. Most stalls do not have a place to sit, however, by strolling behind the market, we discovered a \"park\" area with benches, also at a premium. It was a great place to savor our picnic, and found it so relaxing, we decided to purchase yet another local beer.This is a great place to eat, people watch and become absorbed in a local tradition.HINT: It is easy to point to something interesting and new in order to experience a novel treat."

I estimate 30% fruit and juice stands, 30% meat-cold cut-cheese stands, 20% eateries, and the rest splits among produces, meat, fish, sundries, and others.It's comparable to the Los Angeles Central Market on Broadway. It has the same vibe but just more crowded and offering different type of food. The main difference comes from the type of foods available. Cured meats, cheeses, and sundries make up the major offerings here. The meat and sea foods are much more fresh and less \"produced\" here than USA."

Me and my boyfriend bought some lovely fresh fruit juices for a euro each even though theyre 2 euros at the entrance to the market. I also got a crab claw and calamari kebab which was quite pricy at 6 euros fof 4 items but still nice. My boyfriend had a lovely chicken wrap bought from a popular stall right at the bottom on the left hand side of the market! Would recommend going here at about 2pm although it was still pretty busy."

You can even buy tripe if that's your thing. There are plenty of tapas bars around as well, most seating approx 10 people so you might have to wait.

It is a very busy market and i would recommend trying to avoid the normal peak times, The cured meat pots you could buy for 3 euros and carry around with bread stick were amazing and the olives were outlandish. We tried the fruit juices at a couple of different stalls, One was very good the other poor. It is definatly an experiance for anyone who enjoys spanish food, The spice stalls were a particular highlight for me.9"

The market is crowded, even close to closing time. There is a huge variety of things to look at and buy and eat. I had a fresh papaya and coconut juice and also had some dragon fruit while walking around. My husband and I also decided to eat at a seafood counter for some tapas and they did not disappoint! We had 4 dishes there and all were tasty and affordable. My only wish was that there was somewhere to use the bathroom in the market - if there was, I never found it. I would have spent longer there if there had been but when nature calls, you have to answer! As previously noted, I wish I had returned here daily for a fresh fruit juice.

The station is right next to the entrance to La Boqueria. We've went there on a Saturday, tha place was packed, like all markets are on a Saturday, but I suppose it's like that every other day. The crowd, however, doesn't bother you, you just go with the flow, and have plenty of time and space to explore each food stand. Fresh meet, ham, prosciutto, fish, fruits and vegetables, spices from all around the region are there for you to have a sample and buy. A big hit are freshly squeezed fruit juices that cost around 1-2\u20ac and keep you going. What I strongly recommend is that you have lunch there. There are a lot of stands that are actually little restaurants. Prepare to wait for a seat for about 10 minutes since it's very popular. In some you have to wait in line, in some it's who spots a free sit first. The cuisine is Spanish and Catalonian, it's delicious and the prices vary but are very reasonable. I'm definitely returning there when I go back to Barcelona again."

Why, we were only showed a food menu because by the time we got our bill which was a small bottle of wine and two beers and some disgusting food we were very suprised. I will mention this at the last bit latter. Ordered some drinks and a pepperoni bacon pizza and a hamburger. Finally got our drinks, they were cold... Good start. Our meal arrived, looked ok, had a bite, noooo it was so wrong, no flavour, too much cheese, not cooked enough, bun was stale and no sauce or butter on bun. I had to ask where we were. Seriously this was not a good meal. Went to toilet and on the back of the door was a message scrawled on to say the drinks were over priced.... Finished our meal and asked for Bill. While we waited we noticed a Couple who was siting next to us and they left, this was when we really decided to write about this place here. They were walking down the last of the steps when we noticed they had left there wallet sitting on the table and the waiter was watching them leave as he hovered over there wallet.

Such an interesting and vibrant place, noisy (in a good way), full of energy, crowded with people and numerous shops. It is a paradise for foodies as there are so many food choices, from fresh fruit and vegetables, to candies, chocolates, ice cream, pastries, to raw bacon and ham, to fried/grilled sea food and meat dishes ........ My family and I planned to have dinner there, but changed our mind as it was too hot a day for outside eating and the dishes seemed to be quite heavy. Instead, we just bought fresh peaches and cherries and pastry."

The fabulous Boqueria Market has drool-worthy displays of fruit, vegetables, seafood, candy and so much more! Officially known as Mercat de Sant Josep de la Boqueria, there have been historical mentions of this public market since the 1200\u2019s and I can see why it\u2019s still around! My husband was obsessed with the Spanish oysters (which are super pricey), and all of the tapas options throughout. You can order a snack to-go, or sit at one of the bars to enjoy a meal. Either way, make sure to get there early, as the good stuff will go in the AM! (Note: we originally tried to go on a holiday and it was closed! Be sure to check your dates and local holidays before planning a visit.)"

If you're staying locally in an AirBNB place and plan to cook a meal or two, this is the place to buy your products. They have everything for sale....I mean everything. It's a large market that sells uncooked items, as well as cooked ones. There's also multiple tapas bars contained within the market.As tourist heavy as it is, I highly recommend it. Even if it's to just take a walk through it and buy yourself a juice or small sandwich. Don't leave Las Ramblas without stopping in."

Sure at certain times it's packed and one therefore have the impression it's touristy. But if you get there in time (morning) you can avoid the big crowd and stroll through the aisles more relaxed and absorb the spanish lifestyle. In fact I remember those times when my grandma went to the market bought fresh ingredients and we enjoyed superb meals. Anyway, it is interesting to see and you can spend a few hours trying to get see all vendors and their offer. Especially should you decide to enjoy a meal with one of the multiple bars there. Again, we agree compared to non-touristy places the prices may be higher, but for once and having the opportunity to grasp the special atmosphere, one can spend a few \u20ac more.Highly recommended are the fresh juices. Multiple vendors have fruits & juices, so don't go for the first you walk by. Stroll around and check out the offerings of the others. There is a vast of combinations of mixtures to choose from and they do differ from vendor to vendor. Prices for a juice range from \u20ac 1.00 - 2.00 and the fruit boxes are available from \u20ac 1. Careful not all juices are natural.Personally I was disappointed to realize that the bars offering tapas is limited. Furthermore the bars having tapas have a small selection of tapas. And at some bars the staff tries to talk you into pricy tasting dishes. Best is to study the menu and be determined towards them. There are also restaurants to the side of the market, but in my opinion you are better-off pick a bar in the market as you can watch them preparing your food."

Needless to say our eyes were bigger than our stomachs but everything we had was delicious. We took our little smorgasbord outside and had ourselves a little picnic right in the middle of Las Ramblas. It was very fun. Also a great place for souvenirs for your foodie friends (or yourself).

Enjoy your visit to Mercat de Sant Josep de la Boqueria, But be sure that you will pay at least 30% more any other place out of the La Rambla area.For example if you decided to eat there a mix seafood dish for 2 persons you will pay about 60 euros that costs about 40 euros at the port restaurants \"which also considered as touristic restaurants prices\""

Charming market, very peaceful, unlike markets you visit in touristic cities where vendors shove and shout for your attention or even grab you! This is a lovely , colourful market, easy to walk through as it is not too big, very well maintained and clean despite the fact that they sell seafood! You will also find veggies here, meat, tapas, a chocolatier, tapas bar, a fantastic crepe place, fresh juices and fruits,what a delight after long walks on the streets!"

Try and go early as it gets silly busy later on....(not good for anyone who is claustrophobic) I strongly recommend visiting the market while you are hungry, so many delicious things to eat (even for a pair of fussy vegetarians) lots of meat free empanadas, potato dishes, pastries and gorgeous fresh fruit juices and pots. The sight of the meat and fish wasn't pleasant for us, but it's all to one side so easily avoided. There is a vegan falafel bar on one side of the market which was surprising! Photographers will have a dream as the colours and arrangements of food are so lovely - especially the fruits and juices!"

Little side street off La Rambla leads to this sprawling , fantastic place, selling meat, fish, nuts, cakes and deli food, all under one roof. Each stall selling something wonderful, with places to sit and eat and have a drink, from Spanish fare to fish and chips. Stalls piled high with macaroons and cakes, clothes, everything. Try and buy from the stalls at the back, the ones at the front are more pricey, aimed at the tourists, but the back stalls are cheaper yet the best quality."

At one moment 2 ladies tried to keep on pushing to go past me (it was very crowded), and i saw the 1st lady wearing a scarf on her right hand. Next thing I knew my boyfriends' mini bag (on the side of his shorts) had been opened. The 2nd lady (also wearing a scarf on her right hand) then tried to reach the opened mini bag, trying to get something from inside. I grabbed the womans shoulder and moved her to the side making her stop what she was doing. Luckily, my boyfriend didn't put anything (variables) on the mini bag apart from his cigars and lighter.It may be not a big deal, but the fact that the mini bag was really small and nowhere to be seen they still find opportunities just to get your stuffs.Apart from this, i really love the market. Food and drinks are awesome!!"

Our older one learned about all types of seafood! We couldn't get enough of the amazing assortment of juices and shakes. We tried a few! (Tip: keep going to the back areas because the vendors sell theirs for 1 euro instead of 2 euros near the front)La Boqueria is a vision. A colourful, stunning display of food (that we wish we could take home and cook. everything looked so fresh! )We ate pizza, crepes, empanadas and had the best fried artichoke with chiperones (baby calamari) at this bar/counter in the market where they were quite nice to children. They gave them a lolly as we left:-) so of course they were impressed! We spent about two hours eating and wandering around the market, (always be mindful of your belongings) and we couldn't be happier. It was a great way to spend a morning there with kids!"

On foot is accessible from other metro stations and bus stops. A great variety of local products, vegetables, fruits, fish and meats is available for the visitors. Small restaurants and tapas bars are also available and is recommended to spend some time there, try out some fresh fish maybe. The place is too crowdy though, be careful for your bags and maybe you shouldn't try out the fresh juices. During the last years the fresh juice thing has become so popular and if you have tried it before you will understand that the quality was lost, the juices aren't really fresh. Pick up some fresh fruits by yourself instead from the stalls!"

Full of vendor stalls selling vegetables, fresh fruits, fish & seafood, meat, and tapas bars. It is a full working market so don't expect it to be super clean. It smells like a fresh market. You will find lots of tourists and locals alike. You can get a cup of freshly squeezed juice for 1-2 Euros. You can sit down at a tapas bar and have lunch or a snack. It is not cheap, as the price tag is similar to that of a full service restaurant. Lunch for two ran about 60 Euros. But the experience of full sight and smell of this market is worth it. The Spanish ham, roasted green peppers (not hot) with sea salt, olives, sardines are all excellent. We went there once on our own, and a second time with a cooking class chef buying ingredients for our paella class."

Cons: expensive, crowded, unpleasant smells. We purchased a very small bag of chocolates and almost fainted when she rang it up ($15) but we also purchased a box of fresh delicious strawberries for only 1 euro. I suppose the moral of the story is to ask prices first. Worth a quick look if you're a foodie. In the middle of Las Rambles. Prices at a little grocery store 1/2 block behind the market are MUCH more affordable with excellent quality."

I went there by myself as my friends work in Barcelona and told me to hit this place up for fresh food.Well, I had a \u20ac2.50 (2,50 \u20ac) Sangria there and it about put me on the floor. Seriously, it was delicious, but I had to find a place to go and sit after because I was lit up. My Barcelona friends laughed at me. They called me a lightweight, but I am not. I drink IPA's back in San Diego, CA, but hardly any wine.I went back another day and asked the guy what was in it besides wine and fruit and he would not tell me. He said, \"We have the best sangria here at the market.\" I have to agree with him. Another example --Don't judge a book by its cover!I think it had just the right amount of brandy or some other liquor in it to hit me so fast.If you think this place is like Pike Place Market in Seattle you may be right but this place is on steroids in a good way. Maybe it is smaller in area size or the same, maybe, but it is dense with an array of food displays. It is a dizzying array of lunch counters, mini restaurants, and bakeries, etc. around every twist and turn. It is like a cool maze. I went there several times and I know the places I like, but I am always seeing interesting entertainment on my way there.Go early (8am-10am or so) and avoid the crowds is my best advice or go later in the afternoon. It's entertaining to walk around and gaze at the tremendous amounts of diverse selections of food displayed and there are places to eat there too. Be prepared to do some serious walking.You must try the best sangria (and patatas braves, very inexpensive too! I bought some Spanish Smoked Sweet Paprika also known as Pimenton de la Vera, Dulce to bring back to the US. It is a popular ingredient in many Mediterranean recipes. This stuff is excellent for a salmon fish rub recipe. Bon App\u00e9tit"

If you're looking for a venue in Barcelona to try the variety of local food and delicious delicacies Barcelona has to offer, then look no further than the Mercat de Sant Joseph de la Boqueria. A classic market with a huge variety of food on offer and a must if you're visiting Barcelona. It's cheap, busy and has so much delicious food to choose from you won't leave hungry or disappointed! My recommendations - the Catalan speciality store and any of the cured meat stores"

The colourful and often mouth-watering displays of spices, cured meats, fruit and veg, seafood, sweets and every other commodity imaginable create a photographer's paradise. Interspersed with these stalls are bars, cafes and restaurants offering everything from great coffee to full-blown meals and the wonderful aromas certainly tempt the speculative shopper. A lunch sitting at one of these counters can be a great experience, not only for the taste buds but for the sheer vivacity and bustle of the setting.Some tips:- Try the fruit licquados which are delicious, smoothie-like drinks made from fresh fruit. They come in a hundred kaleidoscopic varieties and are cheaper, healthier, more refreshing and a lot tastier than a bottle of carbonated drink.- Choose your moment. It can get extremely busy and crowded, especially around meal times, and getting a seat at a popular eatery can be a challenge.- Buy edible gifts to take home here. I think the fact that things are a little pricier than elsewhere is more than compensated for by the sheer concentration of quality gifts all under one roof.A must."

The average quality is very high and the prices are not exaggerated, even though you can easily find cheaper stuff elsewhere. The place is very touristic and crowdy, even on Monday when half of the shops are closed. If you like to go shopping food and trying different typical Spanish dishes, it is definitely worth a visit. You have to put a little effort in the communications as most of the merchants don't speak a word of English, but they do their best to understand the request."

Pretty much anything you could want you will find at the Boqueria. While there we tried many different fruits, candies and hams.

You can get a delicious reasonably priced lunch or take food home: roasted nuts of every variety, exotic fruits, freshly squeezed juices, cured meats, really good cheeses, freshly cooked seafood, candies etc etc etc. Some places have seats, but most likely you will be standing. The only real negative is the pushy vendors that borderline harass you to buy and have no patience for your picture-taking. My experience would've been greatly improved of they had been a little more easygoing and less annoying."

Pretty sure there are lots of \"special deals\" for tourists. One bargain hunter tip: if your kids like real fruit smoothies, hit the market about 15-30 min before it closes in the evening. The fruit stands are trying to get rid of all their smoothies and you can usually get deals like 2 smoothies for \u20ac2. Interesting market to see. Don't plan to shop there for your produce and fresh food, unless you don't care about prices."

Market is great because you can see the food you want, and point to what you want (at most shops)Any other place along Las Ramblas will either cost a lot or have a great deal but poor food. La Boqueria is a fun market, with probably over 30 vendors, with all different kinds of food and drinks, including desserts. It's fun to just walk around and look, but way better to buy a few interesting things to snack on. Problem is most places here at La Boqueria don't have seats, so you would need to buy and then go find a place to eat if it's anything more than finger food. Much of the food = snacks, not a full hot meal, but a few places do cook and serve it hot. Almost always crowded, but that is half the fun."

I was walking down Las Ramblas when I saw little ladies with basket full of produces, chesses, eggs, meats and more. I walked down from where they were coming from and I saw this huge market full of life\u2026people and food. I visited three times and enjoyed a variety of foods every time.I was lucky enough to meet some members of the association responsible for the market. There are mostly traders and experts in their fields. The result of this is that you would eat high quality and mostly locally grown foods!! In La Boqueria you can buy fresh items to cook with it, or you can simply eat there. The small stands offers, over 300 of them, offers a series of pastries, candies, cut up fresh fruits, sausages, sandwiches, tapas and drinks! The prices are reasonable as this is a locally visited market. Actually I did not see to many tourists. I bought some candy, a cup full of fresh fruit, ice cream and tapas. I spent about 12 euros\u2019. I recommend that you walked around and take in the vendors, the people and the whole daily activity. You can stop and sit and drink a refreshing drink and eat something delicious, such as a ham sandwich. Or walk into one of the many restaurants and bars inside the Market. There are many of them ready to serve!La Boqueria is located within Las Ramblas 91 08001, Barcelona. Wear good shoes and walk slowly. I am sharing another fact with you. This market was once a convent. The Convent of San Jose was founded in 1586\u2026not sure when it became a market. See? You can find out when the convent became a market\u2026and let me know.Please be aware of your surrounding. Though the people are friendly and I suggest that you practice Spanish, this is an easy place for pickpockets. Meanwhile all these talking about food reminded me I bought a book in a bookstand in the market and I am just might cook some tapas today! Happy Eating!"

The monastery at Montserrat. Parc Guell. And la Boqueria market. Its among the best in the world for meat fish and vegetables. It is jammed with locals and tourists from early morning till it closes late afternoon and in addition to the stalls selling produce there are many of restaurant/bars serving some of the best food you'll find in the city. Grab a free stool at the counter of any of them and either point at what you want or check out the menu. It's like sitting at the chefs table and all the food is cooked right in front of you. Razor clams, mixed vegetables, deep fried baby calamari and the sweetest freshest anchovies you'll ever eat, mixed seafood plates with giant prawns and crayfish, they are all amazing. With a couple of glasses of wine and beer (ice cold Estrella) each at 2.50 euros a glass expect to spend around 15-30 euros a head. Two I'd recommend. Bar Clemens's towards the back of the market. And Bar Ramblero to your left as you enter the market from La Rambla. They open around 9 am and close around 8 30 pm so good for a meal any time and perfect for non European jet lagged passengers!"

It is really a feast to the eyes and stomach as a reviewer writes. The colors, freshness of the foods take your mind away. There are many corners to taste what you see. It is crowded though. If you want to enjoy you have to give time and wander around. Prices are moderate. I strongly recommend to all Barcelona visitors."

Also fresh fish and seafood galore. The vast market is divided into various sections with stalls of same ilk side by side. There are huge varieties of fresh fruit and vegetables (some of them I had never seen before), cheeses, poultry, meat and fish.

What's not to like about this marvelous market stacked with fresh food to get your mouth watering, your stomach churning and your eyes feasting on all the delicacies available, with enough variety to satiate even the most pedantic vegetarian or pescetarian who in turn will be glad they paid it a visit. However, if your someone like me, a total carnivore, then you won't be disappointed either, as there are a great selection of meats to choose from as well. The market is vibrant and busy at all times, with plenty of people savouring their favourite dishes at different bars around the market. If you are thirsty, juice bars abound and if you have a sweet tooth, make sure you visit the dentist after you have gorged yourself on all of the naughtiness that is available to you, all of it tempting you into sinning. Were I Catholic, I think I would have to spend a week in the confessional. Since our Hotel was just two minutes walk from the market, we visited it twice daily, because all our hedonistic food needs could be met without having to go anywhere else. This market should be avoided at all costs if you are on a diet, because you simply cannot walk through it without giving way to temptation. Moreover, you won't break the bank if you do indulge yourself a little, as an excellent meal can be had for as little as seven euros. The food is superb, the atmosphere sparkling and the wine delicious. It is like having 50 restaurants at your fingertips and after tramping around the streets of the Gothic quarter, this is definitely a place to contemplate visiting if you can stand the hustle and bustle. I don't mind gorging myself in surroundings that are packed out with other people enjoying their food too, and it simply adds to the charm and character that is uniquely Barcelona"

Price to quality of items sold; 6/10, though it's tourist-centric-market, prices of fresh fruits/juice and stalls selling food are still lower than other places so this is definitely the choice breakfast/brunch place to fully charge your body for the sight seeing and shopping ahead of you.Reach before 10am; Walk to inner quieter stalls and you will be rewarded with \u20ac1 fruit juice and yes that's the same as the \u20ac2 or \u20ac1.5(most stalls) from the other stalls.

The quality and the variety of food is incredible- beautifully fresh and sparkling fish and seafood, tumbling piles of perfect fruit and vegetable, any cut of meat or offal you could want, bread, spices, nuts, juices and you can stop for a lolly, a cornet of jamon or sit down to a delicious tapas and a drink. All this and just off the Ramblas, it could not be more central. Just wonderful. I cannot recommend it highly enough"

There are booths galore serving fresh & local meats, cheeses, fruits (whole and in ready-to-eat portions) and juices--all at alarmingly low prices. Also some booths sold olives and olive oil. I even spotted a nacho bar! Makes for a very inexpensive snack in the middle of the day, or you can shop around and make a meal out of the various foods. Some booths have seating where you can enjoy a meal. Begins to close down around 5pm although some took their time closing as people were still eating."

A lot of fruit salad and juice bars seem to attract a lot of tourists. I purchased a bag of sweetened almonds and it was 55 euros/kg and afterwads walked down aisle to go deeper into the market and saw the same stuff sold at 38 euros/kg. I mean, sure I'm on vacation and all but nobody likes the feeling of getting ripped off, right?

There is skmething for everyone, lots of cones of food, kebabs of chirozos and jambon, temperus of fish, patties you name it you csn find it here, i spent a small fortune here buying bits and pieces. Make sure you Ask the price first as i found the nut and marzipan stalls just give you a bag and even a small amount csme to nearly 40 euros. We purchased a couple of bottles of fine wine and they ship it directly home. I cannot put into words how amazing this place is, put it on your list. Restuarants around it are very reasonably priced for city centre"

It really is an experience of sights and smells of a huge range of produce! Why oh why does the UK having nothing like this?! We loved ambling around and picking up tasty treats to eat on the hoof.

The fresh fruit smoothies are a main attraction, but to be honest all the fresh fruit and veg makes you want to try everything. Just don't buy from the shops anywhere near the entrance because you can get the same stuff for cheaper if you go further in. PS: If you like cooking and appreciate exotic ingredients, make sure you buy some saffron in these markets. Because its produced in Spain its dirt cheap here, however make sure you shop around and get the cheapest price from one of the smaller stands further in."

Immediately at the ground level, u will see this market entrance. There r many good eateries near the end of the market. We thought we should try fresh seafood here but they have all sorts of tapas too. For those who had meal here, the recipe will allow free access to the clean toilet (or \u20ac1 each). We tried cups of fresh cut fruits too. When we went back the next day before 9am, many stalls were just starting to display their produce. Its quite interesting to see how much attention & details they paid to the layout & display!"

We bought small containers of fresh fruit at one of the fruit stands for 1.5 euros....which we really enjoyed, as we did not get a lot of fresh fruit in Spain. I think you could eat anywhere in this market, and have a fun time. It is very busy at lunch time, so wander around until you find seats at one of the counters.....I do think the further back you go into the market, the better are the prices.

We had fish for lunch perched on a high stool at one of the stalls inside the market. Yes, the prices were a little high ( depending on your budget) but I would say it was worth it as the prawns we had, amongst other things were delicious.

About a third of the stalls were closed, first disappointment, despite the stated opening hours. Second problem was the narrow gaps between the stalls force you to squeeze past each other, which is irritating after 5 mins. Thirdly I was very underwhelmed by the produce, we threw away our fresh fruit drinks they were revolting and the pies were half cooked half stone cold so ditto. The tapas stalls were daft prices, and cramped seating if you could find anywhere to sit at all. Chilii lovers will adore it, as will fish lovers who are very well catered for. Apart from that I wouldn't bother. There are so many fabulous things to do in Barcelona why waste time on a very cramped market?"

To purchase you'll be given a bag and some forceps as it is generally by weight. Most vendors wear gloves - keep an eye out.My favourite would be the icecream stands however. Gorgeous mounds of cheesecake Oreo or even avocado icecream.A lovely place to while away a few hours"

The market was very busy, with beautifully arranged food items (fruits, veggies, chocolates, candy, etc.). There were many restaurants so you have lots of options for a hot meal - various types of cuisine (Spanish, Asian, Italian, etc.). I eat at Bar Bouqeria - simple, tasty meal of grilled chicken and potatoes.There is limited seating at certain restaurants (stools), but if you can't find seats, there is an open-air seating area to the right of the covered market.

It was a fascinating array of vendors offering local edibles - all of it displayed beautifully. Lots of little eateries at the back where you can enjoy some of the local treats. The atmosphere here is really exhilarating!"

One example is the chocolate stall that is charging \u20ac76/Kg which is three times the prices of a high end chocolate shop in our local town at home. If you want to mingle with the locals there are better options such as the Mercat de Santa Caterina which is about 10 minutes walk away down some lovely back streets. However if it's choice you want at any price then this is probably the place to be."

Two of them were closed and the third was okay but a little difficult to order. You had to ask for the food and I didn't know what to ask for. I ate something but later somebody sat next to me (he'd been there before) and was offered a completely new dish. The market also sells fruits, ham, seafood, meat etc. however the prices are higher as one would expect in a tourist area. Stalls were also not welcoming of photographers. It is a must see but I preferred the local Caterina market (also in the old district) instead. It's not as rustic looking but people were friendly and they had great prices and services on olives and cheese for my train trip. Markets are closed on Sunday."

However, there are some better selections and flavour combinations in the center for sure. Beware that this market is very busy and is considered to be a popular place for pick pockets to hang out.

Incredible place, makes the walk through La Ramblas almost bearable."

Try to avoid visiting during the lunch hour (between 1:00 and 3:00pm) as it is incredibly busy, but remember that it closes at 8pm so don't count on grabbing dinner there. It is also closed on Sunday and on most holidays so be careful as there are many holidays in Barcelona. The stalls at the front entrance are over-priced, but you can find more reasonable prices as you go further inside. Whenever we are in the area, we stop into La Boqueria to grab a cup of fresh juice for 1\u20ac, so many flavours to choose from. We enjoy walking around the stalls and trying all different types of food. Great fun!"

You can walk through this market and guaranteed you will be amazed by the variety of fruits, breads, meats cheeses, sweets!!

It doesn't have many places to sit and eat like San Miguel market in Madrid does, most of the things are buy and go. Not good for people who don't like crowds. You must try the freshly squeezed juices and the chocolate covered strawberry skewers. We had lunch at Cinco Jotas to get away from the crowds, it's located in the perimeter of the market.

We have been planning with my boyfriend to just see La Boqueria once for breakfast and to get the vibe, but since the first moment we entered, we came back for breakfast every single day of our 4 days stay. The very first day we just went through the whole market (its not huuuge, you can go through, check the prices and then decide). For example the juices at the entrance are 1,5 or 2 \u20ac per one while in the end on the left side from the entrance you have a stand with fruits and those same juices for only 1 \u20ac each, so we went there even 2x a day to have a juice and enjoy the atmosphere in a shadow in bench behind Boqueria. The first day we have had some fried sea food for 5 \u20ac, you pay for that 15 \u20ac in restaurants and also bacalao croqueta (bomb) second day we had meat pie and the last die we had tortilla for 3 \u20ac which was a huuuuge piece for 2 people and we couldnt even finish almost. The place is crowded, but it depends when you come there. First and second day we were there about 11 am - 1 pm, it was thursday and friday and it was full, but you could make it... and the last day saturday we were there at 8:30.. completely empty, just the owners preparing the stands, everything totally fresh and like 10 tourists. So dont be lazy and go there early in the morning :)"

Also the tapas stalls inside the market looked incredible - except lines were so long we didn't even bother trying."

To get to the market make a turn on the central Rambles avenue near the Liceu metro station into a small passage that will bring you to an enclave with large rows of goods. The variety of things on sale, the colors and the overall hubbub of the boqueria is an experience in itself. We spent about 30 minutes simply roaming in the lines of stands gazing at the abundance of diversity that is on offer: fresh fruit salads in adorable cups standing next to a stand with mouth-washing pastries, freshly caught seafood and fish on ice, huge jamon legs hanging from the ceiling nearby, plants and flowers, meat, colorful spices in jars and bags of different sizes, anyhow, the list can go on endlessly..! And thankfully the rows are encircled with small cozy cafes where you can get tapas snacks, a refreshment or a paella in case you get tired of the hustle and bustle."

I suggest you get there around 8 am. You can watch the many merchants set up and that is an experience by itself. Before the locals and tourists alike flood in. Watch them how the set up the fish stalls and the colourful vegetables and fruits. See a master butcher carve a ham leg or arrange the different cuts of meat would get your taste buds going. Started with a coffee and a croissant from Pinotxo or try the Xuxo for a more local tasty dessert. Then decided to have breakfast at El Quim from the many reviews I saw in TA. And they didn't disappoint. Although pricier than what you would think of a market food place it's worth it. The baby squid omelette is amazing and so are the croquettes. The place started to get busy around 9/9:30. And places were becoming limited, I guess would be hard to get a place around 10 onward. But The Mercat Sant Josep was a highlight of my trip."

From the main entrance, walk towards the seafood section and make a right turn when you reach the end of the seafood section, you will find this stall which is manned by a friendly lady. I bought from Saffron here and it was reasonably priced. I am not a saffron expert but the saffron sold by the lady was of a deep red and had lovely aroma."

Try the fruit drinks available from several stands - I can recommend the kiwi and coconut combo. Also saw strawberries dipped in white chocolate which looked tempting. The butchers display unusual cuts, the fish stalls are a work of art as are the ranges of fruits, nuts and sweets. Easily accessible from La Rambla."

As a foodie, I didn't recognize any food as being very unique or with any local flare... although there were 2-3 small, crowded bars that only had enough seating for 10 people. Otherwise it's just a place for locals to buy fresh produce, meat, and seafood for the locals. Definitely not the place to buy food souvenirs or have an eclectic meal."

Many things offered are so clearly aimed at tourists (said as a compliment) and the only problem here would be the crowds of visitors (was not too bad in February). Take your time to walk around and above all, be polite, greet the sellers if you want to buy and try to say some words in Catalan or Spanish ( just Hola or Bon dia is enough for a start) and you will be welcomed. They are proud business person to be respected for their high quality offerings, not apes in a zoo.There are other food markets in central Barcelona if you want to chat a bit and buy high quality local produce with no crowds, but admittedly, the Mercat de Sant Josep is the most spectacular."

There are plenty of places to eat at in the market, but be wary; the prices are probably double what you could expect to pay in tapas bars elsewhere. For example, we saw gambas for \u20ac18."

The restaurant bar <Kiosko International> had a revamp last year and updated their kitchen and seating arrangement. The food is still exceptional. Everything is on view so you needn't worry about speaking Spanish, just point. Both the wine and beer are good. What you may not see if their steak. For me, although this is primaririly a fish restaurant the steak is the best in Barcelona. Have a plate of simple mixed mushrooms, a steak and a beer or some red wine and you will be in heaven. If you have time walk around the fish circle in the middle of the market. and watch the fishmongers deterity when cutting and skinning the fish. It is an art form. Don't waste money on buying the pots of fresh fruit which is a new tourist gimmick. Just feast with your eyes."

Never saw anything like that before.Now I am living in Barcelona with my beloved wife. We do not make shopping at Mercado San Josep because we live in central city and have the Santa Catarina Market (Mercado de Santa Catarina) nearby and with better prices. We also use to have lunch there every sunday, eating perfect spanish or chinese dishes that are perfect, just perfect. At good prices too.But San Josep is still the same, one of the most beautiful places to buy fresh vegetables and fruits, that I can say.Some day I will go and try its cuisine (cuinas, in Catalan), hoping it's as good as the fresh food they sell and as good as the dihes you can eat from Cuinas Santa Catarina.If you come to Barna, you must visit San Josep!"

You will meet real life on the market, people from Barcelona and from other countries, meat, fish, fruit, vegetables, spices and much more. You can find something to taste or eat on a spot, from fresh fruit to snacks of all kinds. Vendors are very friendly, they know how to communicate, how to make jokes. And, this is not a spot for big tourist groups walking behind their guide as behind a guru. One of the rare problems there are bad, artificial lights; they change colors of food and many nice things seem to be artificial. A bench here and there for a rest can be helpful."

I have never seen so many different fish and other seafood and so rare products like persebes (goose barnacles), sea urchins, and huge scampi etc. everything is super fresh. Coming to Barcelona better rent a flat with a kitchen instead of hotel and you can go to that or other market - buy some fresh fish or seafood and cook it at home, like we do.

However this was my first visit to the market so I have to judge it as we saw now as opposed what it may have once been. We like to visit markets when we travel as we feel that a real market gives you an idea of what the people who live in buy and eat. This market has the feel of a real market. No souvenirs. No little dolls. No shirts and rugs. Just food. Food to take home and food to eat on site. The day we visited it was crowded with people who were buying groceries and eating at the food stands. Lots of tourists wandering around the market but also lots of locals buying stuff to take home to eat.The place may not be as good as it used to be but it was certainly the best shopping experience on La Ramblas. One of the questions asked when you write a review is if whether the attraction is a good rainy day experience. It did rail and it was."

This is a market that has a history dating back to when this was a area that was the heart of the city in the 1800's and eventually became an enclosed market in the 1900's.You can sample some of the best dried meats and the fish is beyond fresh. A great way to spend a few hours and it is within a five minute walk of great shopping center."

The market is filled with everything from fruits to fresh seafood to meats to tapas bars. There is scattered stands that sell fresh juices and fruits, I recommend going to the back of the market because they tend to be cheaper, especially at the end of the day. I don't recommend coming here to eat Tapas though, since it is so touristy it is very expensive to sit down at one of the bars and eat. If you like Pinterest this is your heaven, its is filled with crafty foods and snacks. To read more about my trip in Barcelona check out my blog weeksatatime.com !"

I like much fresh juices and fresh fruits, wonderful. - The fruit and vegetable section was spectacular and very colourful. - The fish market, everything is \"today fresh\" and the varieties were amazing. There was seafood I had never seen before, you can also find salt fish. - Poultry, meat and cheese of all variety. - Dried fruits, nuts, sweets, and more and more. - Also you can find a lot of small caf\u00e9 and restaurant section (on foot) serving sandwiches, snacks especially sea food or whatever you may like.. Enjoy ... - I enjoyed much watching trading between vendors and clients, it was wonderful as people from everywhere in the world are there. - You can go there by metro to the Catalunya station and enjoy a nice walk of 10 minutes to the market on your wright .... Or the metro to Liceu station and go back 2 minutes on your left ......- Never miss this carnival ....."

It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re hungry or not, when you\u2019ll see the displays in the market, you\u2019ll have the urge to buy something, to eat something, to drink something, and when you\u2019ll wake up finally, you already stuffed yourself. After some tempting seafood, some have to try a little Jamon Iberico Bellota, even not to mention a few slices of chorizo or maybe in the reverse order. Of course a meal isn\u2019t a meal without some finishing slices of cheeses and beautiful ripe fruit. I always could resist the temptation, so I just checked desserts. But then tomorrow! I\u2019ll be back and a girl can be weak sometimes. Now, only a big glass of fresh fruit juice and I\u2019ll be satisfied. This market is a place where you can spend hours, and even if you don\u2019t eat, it\u2019s an entertainment.If you\u2019re after some \u201cproper \u201cmeal, first try to go to El Quim. It used to be extremely busy.The reason is the extremely delicious food.Once, when after some serious waiting you're able to sit down, try several dishes. It isn't cheap,but you won't mind the bill. Ramblero is the second choice, if you haven't the slightest chance to sit down at El Quim, but be prepared to spend there 20-40 euros per person."

We were told that you should start toward the back of the market because the front shops are a little more expensive. By the time we got there in the late afternoon, a lot of the fish markets were already closed for the day but it was cool to see such a big fresh market. We walked through looking for a snack and treats and went to a nut/dried fruit stand back by the WC. They are very nice about letting you sample something before your purchase but be very specific about how much you want because they are not shy about giving you a huge scoop of something very expensive as you pay by the kilo. The dried peaches and strawberries were out favorite since they tasted like eating chewy fruit snacks. The nuts were also delicious but pretty pricey. We tried a sandwich on a baguette from a bakery which was very delicious and cheap, wrapped so cute by the employee. We also enjoyed Patatas Bravas (fried potatoes with spicy ketchup) at a little place that also sold very delicious Samosas. It's a fun cool place to go check out, wish we could have enjoyed more of the local offerings. We'll be back!!"

Although according to some locals the market has become oriented to cater to the tourists, this still has a great selection of all you need to create food masterpieces AND some great places to sample good local food. Even though touristy, this is still a place where locals and restaurants come to shop. For a meal, I can recommend Barcentral on the right side about half way down for great seafood (not cheap, but really good!). Several good gelato and chocolate places. If you want to buy nuts and/or dried fruits, wander around a bit and ask for samples before settling--there are many vendors and some seem to have better products than others. If you like almonds, try the \"marconas\" a fatter, buttery almond that I haven't seen in the States. The Boqueria Market is right off Las Ramblas. As in any crowded environment, be mindful that there are folks in the crowd who want to lighten the load of your wallet or purse. Be mindful and stow your valuables in a safe place and you'll be just fine."

I love markets and food and have very low requirements for food to be deemed edible but a lot of the juices etc. In the market looked old as did all of the pastry and snack-like food stalls. Pretty much everything was prepared at some other point.... I saw the saddest chips under a hot lamp I think I will ever see! Which was disappointing as I was looking forward to trying some new food. Saw a stall packing undrinkable juices away so I guess they make a few days appearances before being scraped. The restaurants were popular and looked fresh so that's your best bet. Looks wise, it's interesting if a bit repetitive in its catering to tourists. If you don't have time you haven't missed much."

Set roughly half way along Ramblas make the effort to walk across the road and enter the market through the iron gated entrance and take your time to allow your senses to take in the abundance of colours, scents, tastes on display and a great opportunity for some excellent photos too. Be sure to walk around the edges where there are a number of small coffee houses and restaurants running alongside the main market. For us the highlight was the amazing \"chili\" fruit and veg stall where the colours on display were superb and the hanging assortment of chili eye opening; closely followed by the array of sweets on a stall near the entrance. There are numerous stalls with benches available to sit and taste the food on display, including salads; pasta; sandwiches; meats; sushi and likewise with drinks too. This is a free attraction where tourists mingle with locals and you get a feeling of what life is like living in a busy city centre. You can spend 15 minutes or a few hours if eating or drinking and is a step away from the main tourist traps and the fact it is different makes it a location well worth a visit, we loved it."

It's not a market that doesn't keep up with the times. All the produce is of high quality and is beautifully displayed too.The marzipan creations are incredible... the japanese themed ones this time very colourful and atttractive to see. Also the breakfast in a paper cone was a hoot we thought. If you love sweets/chocolate it's an ideal place to browse!You are spoilt for choice re the hams, salamis, cheeses to chose from.You would be hard pressed to think of something not available at this market.It is always crowded but, in October, not as crowded as at peak times so you do get to see everything quite clearly.I'd recommend going there definitely!"

I've been to markets like this before but I'm just not impressed by it. Because it's located right in the center of all the tourist activities, I think it's one of the reasons some of the prices weren't as I expected it to be. You can find some good deals but they are mostly priced for the suckered tourists. Also, markets like these usually provide samples...but none here. I guess you can ask each one of them but all the vendors seemed too busy to assist you.If you don't know what you want to eat, come here so you have a variety of options. There are tons of meat vendors, fruit stands, breads, a descent seafood section, and bit of everything else in between. There arent very many sit down bars and if you find one, it's super crowded with limited seating. So you literally have to stand behind someone eating and watch them uncomfortably consume their meals while you stare at them. But even the food they serve you are not that well priced. For a market like this in a non tourist area, you'd spend at least half of what they would charge here. So yes, you come for the experience but be mindful of the prices so you don't hurt your wallet too much. And be ready to fight the crowds."

This is definitely a thriving \"real\" market which is frequented by chefs and other locals. You can also have some exceptional food if you look for some of the bars and other small eateries (well past the entrance).

However, it was hell getting seats at the bar as pushy people come and just grab the seats as they become vacant, regardless of how long we had been waiting there being no order.If you like markets, then go.

In the end, we just had to make do with the little that we could see through the mass of people and then struggle to make our way out to the exit.

The choices are incredible, something for everyone. Fresh fruit smoothies, delicious crepes (one of the stalls that offer crepes, the chef is known for his entertainment value, as well as the delicious crepes, offering many types - and they are good) Also be sure to check out the baked goods, tapas, fresh vegetables, fruits, cheeses, spices, prepared foods, seafood, meats, candy of all varieties - the list goes on and on. You name it, they seem to have it. It was great place to stop in for a quick tapas, or breakfast or light snack. But the locals shop here also for their seafood, meat, spices, vegetables, fruits. It was great fun, prices of course are excellent. This was our second time to Barcelona and we headed right to this market. It is great for both locals and tourists alike, because of all the food offerings, price, quality and great presentation. A must see. If you don't like the crowds when traveling, travel during a quieter time of year. I would visit this place time and again. And we did. It is worth checking out."

And for fruit candy lovers they had one stand that was just selling loose candy. So this market is really a treat for eye. It is also interesting to go to see the fish counter since Barcelona is big seafood port. They have the freshest fish over here.

La Boqueria Mercat (Market) is one of the few must visit top gems in Barcelona, or if you have not been to the La Boqueria Mercat, your Barcelona trip wouldn't have been completed meaningfully. For the fact that Barcelona is an extremely touristy city with over 180million tourists per year flocking into Barcelona, sad to say that the chances of getting a good tapas of fresh seafood is very unlikely in this city.If not the Galician seafood that you are looking for, La Boqueria Mercat has some of the best Spanish seafood that you can ever find in the entire Barcelona city itself. The food there may be a little bit more costly than the outside restaurant, but the freshness of the seafood and the ambience of the market will certainly justify the sum that you are going to pay. There were many more other stalls selling fresh fruits, veg, meats, spices and local delicacies, or I mustn't forget to mention that this is the right place for you to hunt the best Spanish Jamon (ham). Spanish or in Barcelona city ppl don't practice giving free sample, you have to pay a small fee to buy their ready cut Jamon in a paper cup so that you will know which is the Jamon that you like best to buy.There are just so much more to see in this place from the smells of the food, the colour of the fresh produce and may be also the basic culture of the Spanish way of life if not the authentic one.

It all looks great, and it tastes good too!Generally if you go in to the market further than just the entrance, the prices get lower.It's busier in the weekends, but also more booths are open.. Some close during the week."

The entrance of the market was obviously full of tourists, but \"deeper\" inside the place it wasn't so crowded.

We did find scallops, but they cost 10euro for 4 individual scallops..I've never bought them before but it seemed expensive to me.There were many meat stands, but they were also quite expensive. We bought what we had intended to buy, but it didn't cost any less than a good meal at a restaurant would have cost.It is interesting to walk through the stalls though, and they sell some ready to eat food which looked very appealing."

It was very crowded, which is normal for being so close to La Rambla. We got the fish very cheap, but we also got to try some raw oysters and bought some sausages to bring home. All in all, it is a very happy and lively place and I think it is definitley worth a visit."

The fresh food and produce plus tons of excellent hams You can grab tons of little bits from most of the stalls for a few euros. I suggest you go early verses later in the day as some of the stalls close down. We went at 5:30pm and many had closed but still we were overwhelmed with all the amazing food. Highly recommend the El Rambulera. Fresh seafood and good prices. Be careful though to not over order. The staff will help you get a bar stool but will quickly show you the lobster that you should buy!"

I got there at 12noon and waited a minute for a seat at Pinotxo Bar near the front. Sat in front of the fresh langoustine (small lobster) still alive! Not for long! I ordered chickpeas and grilled langoustine. The waiter said this was a good 'breakfast\"! After dropping into a liquid, I guess anaesthetises it, it is covered in the grill for a few minutes then cut in half for final grill. Meantime the chickpeas came and were so tasty. The langoustine was perfection. Use your fingers! They give you a wipe. Other food selections seemed just as good! Mushrooms, grilled peppers, ox tail stew, sausages, steak. No real menu just ask! Walking around I could sample Spanish ham with or without chips. Fresh dates with chocolate or nuts. I then found the oyster man and had the largest, sweetest oysters for 2.50\u20ac each. Fresh fruit in cups and juices are everywhere as are fresh made icy poles. Try the fig juice it is quite nice. Wandering the stalls is fascinating. It can be crowded around entrance stalls but most people seem to do a few at the front and leave. Don't get that! So push past and visit stalls in the middle and back. More sit down eateries at back! Think I will go for \"breakfast\" again tomorrow! Enjoy!"

We went to most of the markets in the guide books. However there are larger markets elsewhere in other places in the world like Hong Kong etc.The variety in here is staggering but the smells can be quite off-putting. There are a couple of flies, fruit flies and one wasp that we spotted. Lots of litter on the floor too with lots of wet/damp puddles and ditches. Be careful with your step & there are plenty of pickpocketers around for sure. It is definitely not the worse market I've been too and there are plenty of them elsewhere in the world which are worse and offends your nose!The food can be quite cheap if you want to walk around and have a sample of some jamon, fruit, cheese, bread, sweets etc. We bought two burritos which were bloody awful. I guess its just luck. The juices look refreshing and are only 1euro each.We shopped around a fair bit looking for the best price for chorizos and iberico de bellota etc. We bought a fair bit of iberico de bellotta in the form of ham, sausages, chorizos etc. I didn't get any manxego though as I was afraid that it would stink up my luggage bagsThe fresh produce like vegetables, fish and meat, eggs and cheese looked really good and I wished that we were self-catering at times during the holiday so that we could buy and cook up the fresh seafood.We walked past the market a couple of times, and alot of the stalls were actually shut on National Day of Catalonia."

Seriously delicious, functional food!Throughout the market you'll find an almost unlimited range of sweets, treats, meats, cheeses, juices, smoothies, pastries, chocolate, hams, etc. etc. with only a few repetitions from stall to stall. One of our favourites was the variety of coconut blend juices. Situated directly on La Rambla, you'd be mad not to go here at least once!"

The problem is that it is so packed with tourists that a lot of local shoppers do not go there anymore as they have to fight their way through hoards of people taking photos but not buying anything other than a tub of prepared fruit or a fresh juice. If you go to the Boqueria, I would try to go very early in the morning and avoid weekends if possible. The history of the market is very interesting and its worth reading about it before you go. Top tip - look up and see the columns and high ceilings around the perimeter of the market. It was built to match the Placa Real so wander down the Ramblas after you finish in the market and go to the Placa Real to see how it was meant to look."

The market caters primarily for tourists. Most stalls offer small \"take-away\" servings of their particular fare (fruits, juice/smoothies, pasteries, meats, seafood, etc.). Some stalls even have a dining counter and some high stools, but I didn't try those (too crowded and I don't like being jostled while I eat). Some stalls (meats, fish) cater for the more serious cooks.It's well worth visiting La Boqueria. Make sure you have, say, 20 euros in 1 and 2 euro coins as most of the fare is in the 1 to 5 euro range, and I didn't see many signs indicating that credit cards were welcome.The main inconvenience of La Boqueria is the crowds - it's a victim of its own success. However, this is just a nuissance, and I did not have any unpleasant experiences (pick-pockets, etc.). But people in wheel chairs, or parents pushing buggies, seemed to be having a tough time getting through the crowds. One other issue is that I couldn't find rest rooms within the market.Finally, for the food lovers, La Boqueria is not the only such market in Barcelona. The Mercat de Sant Antoni is about 15 minutes west of La Boqueria and is bigger, but it is currently closed for renovations."

It is a big market that sells everything you can think of. Fruits, vegetables, meats, cheeses, sweets, cured meats, seafood, tapas, etc. My husband and I made sure that we saw every stall inside the market. It is crowded inside, no surprises there. Be weary of your belongings. We met a man who works there, who comes from the same country as us, and warned us about pickpockets. Thank goodness we didn't become a pickpocket victim. Going back to the market, it does become a bit repetitive, another meat stall, another fruit stall, another seafood stall. The tapas stalls seemed very popular. We didn't get to try them though. My husband and I bought fresh cut fruits and fresh fruit juices - there are lots of them. Go for a walk and compare prices because others are more expensive. There is also a lolly store which was just pleasing to the eyes. By the time you pick what you want to buy though, it becomes overwhelming because there are just way too many options. Definitely a must go if you are in Barcelona. Oh and you need to pay 50cents to use the toilets."

It is nice and people from Barcelona we love it but it is fully crowded of tourists making photos and buying nothing. people working there are a little bit tires of the people walking around and making them feel like animals in the zoo. The nice think about the place is the old tradition and ambience there. the building is also pretty old ald well conserved. If you go there please buy something and walk arround but dont block the corridors too much. The nice thing is that you can find almost every thing you can imagine. Aniways when you find the insects shop keep in mind that it was opened as a weird thing for making jokes or surprise your friends...we do not eat and have never eaten insects in Spain. ( Im not sure if it is still open because I did not see it when I was there for the last time). Spetially recomended from my side are the dry mushroms shop (if you like cooking you will love them). Also very good the vegetables and fruits. Do not buy the exotic fruits, they are very expensive and normally not mature and not typical from spain (again another thing that they included for courious people). If you like cooking or you are a foodie this is a total must. If you are not interested in cooking or food just walk arround for a minute is enough!"

The way they make all the produce shine is outstanding, the seafood is the freshest you'll ever lay eyes on. This place literally has EVERYTHING, from vegetables all the way to cake decorations and gummy bears, I recommend going there to anyone who's visiting Barcelona."

We bought a few for a couple euros and snacked on these delicious snacks as we walked around wide-eyed looking at the huge variety of foods. We returned another couple of times, and tried the fresh fruit, the smoothies, some sandwiches, nuts, candy, chocolate, and so much more. This is another absolute must do if you are in Barcelona for a decent stretch of time. You can have a full meal made of a variety of different foods and snacks for only 10 euros as you walk through. Just pay attention to the prices, as you walk through you'll likely find the same thing, or a better/bigger version for a cheaper price. The meat cones for example- further back in the labyrinth of vendors we found another meat vendor selling larger cones for cheaper. Pretty much any food you can think of is sold here, this market was truly a fantastic experience."

Plus, it was hot in the midday and there's nowhere to sit. There are chairs, but they're for surrounding restaurants. So we gave up and found a restaurant.A few days later, we tried again. There are many, many vendors of anything you want: meat, juice, nuts, fruit, seafood. We picked up some juice and pastries. We didn't go in hungry this time, so that was good. And, of course, we didn't leave hungry, because there is, quite literally, everything here you would want to eat. Lucky for us, we stayed just off La Rambla, not far away, so we were able to wander in and out.When you're on La Rambla, use your walk to hit any of the neighboring sights: Barri Gotic, the beach, or La Boqueria. The market is an experience you can't miss when you're in Barcelona."

If you go deeper into the market, you find better deals on the same fruit, fish or meats. We had some wonderful chocolate covered strawberries on a stick for 2 euros.

Depending on what you order, the price can range from 20 to 40 euros for two so it may not be exactly cheap. We loaded up on spices to bring home (Morilla dried fruit stall), and also tried their cherries, strawberries and heirloom tomatoes which were in season. There's also saffron to buy, and Spanish bomba rice to make your paellas (which I cannot buy at home!) and of course, loads of jamon and chorizo. Also bought my nut candy from a stall there."

Do not confuse with a flea market, the only thing you will find here is Food and Drinks. Also this is a pickpocket heaven so please be mindful of your belongings while strolling through the market.

Second time we went we actually sat at a booth/bar and had some seafood and beer, I can't remember the name but it was towards the back. It was a really fun and happening place. I must stay it is by no means inexpensive, my husband and son shared a seafood platter which was probably $30 us and I had a small shrimp plate that was probably $20.

The fruits are cut and sold in these gobelets which are then left behind under stalls or accumulating in the garbages.

The way the food is laid out is an art form with different colors and shapes making up different pictures. You can get fresh fruit and vegetables (love their idea of fast food - fruit in a container already cut up and ready to eat on the run), delicious smoothies, very fresh fish and meats and food already made up and ready to take with you (more fast food: Iberian ham twirled onto a stick). Leave a lot of time to go stall to stall and do not be dissuaded by the seeming chaos - it is part of the charming experience. We bought some saffron and small sachets of olive oil to take home which were very well received. We found a sandwich stall with delicious treats for lunch.

This was undoubtedly once a tremendous place to shop - and there are still areas, particularly the fresh fish stalls, where there is incredible variety and quality, and tremendous knowledge and skills (filleting) by the vendors. But what is it with the profusion of stalls selling cheap smoothies to tourists? These are the people taking selfies in front of a water-melon and willing to spend no more than a euro on a nasty watered down fruit confection. No wonder they ban tour groups of more than 15 on Friday and Saturday until after 3pm. Pity the old ladies who come daily for the freshest of produce and have to squeeze past obese camera toting (nationality deleted) who couldn't tell a pomegranate from a guava. Some reviewers have said that prices are sky- high because of the tourists. Not so, some prices are high because of QUALITY ! For people used to buying a bucket of buffalo wings (whatever they are) for $5 it may seem obscene to pay \u20ac195 a kilo for ham aged for 5 years from an acorn fed hog but that is because the Spanish don't expect to sit down and eat a kilo all to themselves smothered in mayonnaise in something called a submarine sandwich. This is a great market being sullied by people who don't actually come to buy the food ! My advice would be to come here as early as you can, keep your sense of humour, try to speak Spanish, however badly, and compare prices - there is choice, exercise it. Even haggling is acceptable."

Catalonian towns grow around their markets and la Boqueria provides a daily service to the locals and a great treat for tourists. It has existed in one form or another since the 12 Century. You walk into the market, off the Ramblas, and are greeted by the sights and smells of the most fabulous chocolates and candies. Barcelona is famous for its sweets. Right beside the glistening sweets are stands with fresh fruits and freshly squeezed juices ($1-2). Along the sides of the market are the cheese vendors, selling fresh slices of manchiego cheese. Along the outside flanks of the market, are the meat/ham vendors. Fish vendors are also placed along the back flanks. This represents some thoughtful placement so that you are not bombarded with strong tasting foods as you walk down the centre isles. There are one or two cafes at the back, tapas bars, as well as bakeries selling local bread and pastries. You could easily eat a full breakfast or lunch at the Boqueria and be full for the day. The market opens around 8 and it is best to get there early for great selections and less picture taking crowds."

I personally tried two types of fresh fruit juice and two small sandwiches (olive and chicken and olive and salmon). The food is cheaper, likely fresher, and the experience is better than you could get at a restaurant. If you didn't go to eat, enjoy perusing the stalls, being awe-struck at all of the colors, and get lost in the scents and sights of the food. But, I bet that once you're there, you'll just have to try something. What I had here was by far my best meal in Barcelona."

I DID go to the wonderful Santa Caterina market and was delighted by it.Then, a few weeks ago I found myself in Barcelona for a day, and decided that I would stroll down the Ramblas and drop in on, among other places, La Boqueria. As I walked towards it, turning right off Las Ramblas, I could already see the seething crowds outside slowly making their way in to an even more crowded interior.The place is fantastic, just as most people write. The displays alone are startlingly beautiful, from fruits and veggies to seafood to meats and cheeses. And there are several places at which one can sit down on a bar stool and eat to one's heart's content. There is no doubt that La Boqueria is one of the best of its kind, anywhere.But I just couldn't take the crowds! Trying to make my way down the center aisle was almost impossible, and almost everywhere else the same was true. Only at some of the very edges could one collect oneself, not be constantly jostled, frankly - have a good time. This may just be me, as certainly many WERE having a good time. I had for a while the goal of getting a seat at one of the bars, where there would not be much room but where I'd at least have a little personal space and maybe be able to eat. But it became clear that the people who had claimed a bar stool were not easily going to give it up. I DID get through all the main sections, and again, it's extraordinary. But as I wrote in another review of Barcelona, on Las Ramblas, \"the people were packed so tight that the sardines were gloating!\" I was there on a weekday afternoon in early May - what must it be like in high season?You'll go, of course you'll go, as I did, and you'll enjoy it - if only La Boqueria could manage crowd control!"

Just watch for pickpockets on la rambla - busy place, loads of tourists, fertile grounds for robbers! (luckily we weren't robbed, just watch your stuff! :-)"

The trip would have been incomplete without walking through the many food stalls. This is the place to go for all kinds of unusual foods to take home as souvenirs. They also had many exotic fruits, seafood, nuts, mushrooms, and even hot pepper sauces. I bought some mango juice which was very refreshing. I was tempted to buy the fruit cups which looked very good. I wish I had done that.The best time to go is in the morning (before lunch). There are tons of people there all day long. It may be difficult for some people who don't like to be in large crowds of people. It can be a mad house. Make sure you guard your belongings. We were told that pickpocketing is very high in the market, but that happens everywhere. Don't let it hinder your experience. Just enjoy it."

We bought some cherries from her and while those on display looked fresh and bright, she gave us the ones that were wilting."

Walk down Las Ramblas, enter and experience the crush of people, sights, smells, and sounds. Enjoyable? Not terribly.Interesting? Not really - unless you are new to European markets.Best market? Not really -high prices, tight quarters, etc. There are other markets in the area which are more pleasant, offer similar products, and are actually enjoyable to walk through. However - if you ant lots of people, and noise, waits for a stool at a tapas counter, high prices - this is your place.I prefer to see it - understand the nature of the place - leave with my wallet still intact - and go to other locations for a better experience. Best deal is to go an hour or so before closing and buy a fruitcup or a smoothie made from the day's fruit that didn't sell - good deal.Worth seeing - nothing else."

We managed to wander around with a buggy + two children. Even my older fussy eater enjoyed the superb smoothies and meaty sticks.

Walked in to this market out of curiousity when I was taking a stroll, but it turned into one of my highlights of the trips.It's great to see markets like this, as they are few and far between where I live, and there was a huge variety of items available to buy and browse. Although I was unable to purchase any of the fresh meat available (I was staying in a hotel without cooking facilities and was unable to transport any back on the flight) it all looked very appetising, and if I was to stay somewhere where I could have cooked it I would have bought food from here for every meal.As well as the meat and fish on offer, there are also spices, nuts, sweets, alcohol, chocolates and many other things available to buy.As a side note, I was warned that pickpockets are quite active in the market, and although I didn't experience it it is worthing paying close attention your belongings whilst browsing. And also, although most stall owners do not have a problem with it there are certain stalls where they do not appreciate tourists taking photos of their stalls, but these are usually identifiable by the warning signs within the stalls."

I opted for a Burrito with fish and seafood with salad and mayonnaise to take away 4.50\u20ac and my partner had a mushroom Tortilla (huge portion) with salad 3.50\u20ac, from different stalls both very fresh and tasty. If we had been more hungry we would have sat down and tried the fish stew as it looked very good. All the stalls were being frequented by local purchasers.

Seabon would have hardly been able to contain his excitement if he had been faced with this stall in La Boqueria market, which sells not just chocolate products, and nutty products, but also dried fruits. \"Sick,\" he might say, \"those dried kiwis look delicious.\" With this in mind, my companion and I decided to purchase a small handful of these green, gellatinous delicacies. After resolving a minor price dispute with the serving staff, whose service had been otherwise exemplary (a bag for buying the sweets had been thrust into our hands before we had even shown an interest in the stall - how did they know that the thing we had been searching for was the very dried kiwi fruit displayed at their very stall?), we were soon biting in to the most exquisite dried kiwi, flavored with the slightest hint of fish, presumably due to the kiwi fruit's prolonged exposure to the fishy air of La Boqueria market. Certainly worth trying, if you haven't already!"

You can learn a lot about a culture by visiting their old public markets. This is no exception. When you walk in you realize this is not for the faint of heart. There is hustle and bustle everywhere. The vendors and visitors intermingle and play a game of bumper cars (w/o the car) on the isles. The strong smells are everywhere, from the very pleasant smell of the hams, chorizos and fruits to the pungent smell of the fish and seafood. The fish are right out in front and center as are all of the products. Some defy description. There is one fish (rape in Spanish, Monkfish in English) which may be the ugliest fish I have ever seen. Not even a mother could love this fish. It is used a lot in fish stews because it lends a deep strong flavor. I loved walking among the many selections, and was almost awe struck by the sheer volume of options. It is almost like hawkers all vying for your attention. I was taking pictures as if they were an attraction. The stands each specialize in one area, such as the one that has the embutidos (charcuterie), or the one that has fritos. The selection of hams and varieties of sausages is mind boggling. I noted that my senses were getting a workout, but my wife said that she was in sensory overload. I wound up tasting many of the offerings but going across the side street to appease my wife, for a delectable ice cream and coffee. If you go midday it is basically shutting down, so go early. It is well worth it to experience."

One of our favourites was the sample sticks of different varities of meat for 1\u20ac. Despite the fact that the market was full of tourists, walking through the market made you feel like a local. We definitely would go back here if we are ever in Barcelona again."

They're pricy but - for example - the paella is cooked with shellfish fresh out of the water; really tasty. Was quite surprised that mine had octopus in it but was cooked just right - it wasn't as tough as when I've had it elsewhere, was definitely more meaty and flavoursome. At \u20ac20 or more a pop, mind you, you'd expect it to be good. We picked up a few of the fruit smoothies on the way out, as a desert. They were grand too."

This was the first market we visited while in Spain and I was blown away- it was huge and the stands offered an impressive variety of things being sold. We stopped at one of the surrounding restaurants facing the market for a very expensive drink. I get the feeling that most things in this market are much more expensive than in other markets due to the fame. Overall the experience was pleasant, and if I were on limited time and in the area or in a group that was stopping on La Rambla I would definitely go again. However, if you are spending more than a day or so in Barcelona, I would highly recommend the Santa Caterina Market near the Cathedral (which should also absolutely be on your list). Santa Caterina has all the hustle and bustle of la Boqueria but without the tourist trap feel."

Cheap too! This is a one stop shop (or market, rather). Honestly. It's right on La Ramblas so super easy to find and is a great place to stop by to grab some breakfast or lunch. I would recommend heading there in the mornings as after noon it gets very busy and hard to move around. A great thing to do is to head down there and stock up on picnic style foods (we went for fruits, juices, baguettes, jamon and cheese, then head to the beach or the park and enjoy a picnic! Ideal!

After a good feed a great and cost effective glass of wine and one of the wine cellars. Far cheaper than La Rambles main stretch and this is where the locals will eat & drink so you know you're not eating at a commercial outlet.You will kick yourself if you discover this place on the last day of your holiday. Get there from day one and you'll certainly will be satisfied!"

We weren't hungry, so we did not buy anything to eat or drink, but I feasted on all of the lovely stalls visually and took a TON of photos. It is so different from what we are used to here in the States. Around every corner was a new discovery, and I wished we were not passing through on our way to another destination. I would have loved to buy some things and COOK... Still regretting not buying the 5 grams of Saffron for 15 euros. I did buy some chocolates that were to die for. Even if you don't really want to eat, take a trip through this place and see the things they have. They cater to the tourist crowd, so there are a lot of things in handy packaging to go... Still wish I would have tried one of the fresh made juices for 1 euro... they looked delish. We skipped it last time we were here 10 years ago... I should have listened to my husband then and gone in... It was a real treat!"

Best yet, the Boqueria is indoors, organized, polite and clean. Pathways are wide; vendors helpful . . . not always the case in these places.

Some stalls are beautifully decorated, we just could not resist not to stop and see stuff they sell. We had fun looking at all sorts of food and bought quite a lot because the food there looks really fresh and yummy. Food is great but not cheap."

Vibrant and bustling with an array of produce (and people!), sample the many good things Spain has to offer and bring some home (if you can). Enjoyed some good jamon iberico, bacalao, manchego and bought spices, olive oil, etc. Just make sure to keep your belongings close to you as you go around."

The market (and arguably Barcelona's foremost tourist landmark), La Boqueria, opens up to Las Ramblas and is a great walk-thru and place to buy all sorts of food stuff, from raw to cooked, from sweet to savory, from aged to fresh, from pungent to fragrant. Very crowded when we visited at 9 AM. Sit down at any of the dining stalls and simply point to something that looks good. Vendor samples are offered. Items are pricier at the entrance. A lot of pigs have sacrificed many legs to provide all this enjoyment. Literally, a feast for your eyes and belly!"

I was not surprised, everything I heard was true and I was very excited to be in the market. The colors and flavors were so vibrant and inviting that I felt I didn't want to leave. Prices are a bit high, but where else other than in La Boqueria, would I find the same food? I looked at all the curiosities, like the percebes, the pitahaya roja, took a lot of pictures, but I also tasted an incredible amount of food. I liked the Jamon Ib\u00e9rico and I really enjoyed the various icecream. What a treat !!! Food prepared at the various bars is delicious, there are many varieties of tapas and finger food, the choice is infinite, but the ordering boards and menus are all in Spanish. The market is not so loud, I expected it worse, since I have visited other markets in the world and often I had to leave because of the noises. At La Boqueria I felt at ease, people are friendly and answered all my questions in Spanish, most of them don't speak English, be prepared. Be also very careful of your belongings, it is a place frequented by a lot of tourists and as in all markets, unfortunate opportunities are around the corner. Nothing happened to me, but I am always well aware of my surroundings. Valentina Interior Designer"

I had heard so much about the Market both good and bad so I wanted to form my own opinion.I didn't need anything from the Market which helps if you just want to observe the bustle of the market place and look at the produce. I ended up wandering around for a couple of hours!In that time I bought some great sweet smoked Paprika, a quantity of as it tuned out excellent Sobrasada ( I sampled some different qualities on some bread offered by the stall holder until I settled on a premium product made from Iberican Black Pig and top quality Paprika. It was just great). Maybe because of the nice manner of the stall holder, I also purchased some cured Iberican black pig Jamon and two Manchego cheeses in different states of maturity (again I tried quite a few chunks too). All this was wrapped up really well so I could take it home. The stall name I don't remember but it is in a relatively quieter part of the market. I don't know how cheaply I could have purchased this produce elsewhere but I do know looking at the airport Duty Free prices, I was more than satisfied with my impromptu purchases, as were my family at home in Wales!I sat down at one of the stooled Tapas bars and had a beer and some grilled octopus, bread and olive oil, it was delicious and yes a bit pricey for a \"market stall\" but I guess they pay big Euros for the space. All I can say is I didn't come to Barcelona to moan about anything and everything, I came to enjoy it and I must say I did enjoyed my couple of hours and didn't feel ripped off as some have commented.I will pay La Boqueria another visit and will certainly go and stock up on few of its tasty products again soon."

Great to pop in for a snack, meal, stock up on supplies or get your fruit fix.Located just of La Rambla the crowd and your nose will lead you there.The stalls are filled with every type of fresh food you need. Seafood. fresh fruit, smoothes, juice, lollies, nuts, pre made meals and tapas bars. Do your self a favour and pop in for a visit. If i was in Barcelona for more than a day I would have had lunch here. The food is clearly fresh and priced well.Tip head in deeper tot he markets the smoothes and juices are a bit cheaper."

It dates to the year 1217 when farmers sold their produce on the outskirts of the old gated city. Today\u2019s vendors artfully arrange their goods, a feast for the eyes to tempt the belly. Each vendor has its specialty. Spices sold by the kilogram. Eggs sized from tiny quail eggs to softball-sized emu. Iberian ham stalls where the butchers patiently explained the origins of the much-coveted pork while carving paper-thin slices. Pate stands. Beautifully packaged salt flavored with provencal herbs or chilis or lemon. And of course more veg and fruit stands than you could count.For more: http://grassrootsgardening.net/2014/11/02/la-boqueria/"

I've been to \"EATALY\" in NYC, and it is large and interesting and fun - with a definite \"Madison Avenue\" marketing atmosphere to it. Not to be missed for Foodies. I fell in love with the more modest sized Mercado de San Miguel in Madrid and wanted to buy one of everything I saw. They seemed to specialize in Tapas ('taste-sized' servings of delicious appetizers, etc) and I was very impressed with how beautifully the food was displayed and how wonderful it all tasted. Not to be missed by anyone!!Now I have visited Mercat La Boqueria and it is amazing. DON\"T LET THE ENTRANCE from Las Ramblas scare you off. The entrance is small and constantly looks mobbed with people and one would think that it is equally mobbed inside. Not so! The inside is almost cavernous and once you get past the tiny entrance there is much more room and you don't feel uncomfortably crowded. The selection of foods (including Tapas) is amazing! The stalls are artistically and creatively decorated, and it is kind of a combination of all the other three markets put together. I ate there 4 times in 6 days and can't wait to get back.

Vendors of all types in every direction and as far as the eye could see. This place has everything you could possibly want to find in a market. We bought a small cone of Serrano ham (awesome) to nibble on while we walked around the market. A little later we bought a large cup of fresh cut (to order) fruit from one of the incredibly colourful vendor stands...walked a bit more...found a 12 seat lunch bar specializing in seafood...tried the grilled calamari, fried/breaded smelt...fresh oysters and a few glasses of real cold Cava to complete the meal. We came upon a candy vendor and bought several fresh made (awesome) nougat bars to bring back for friends and colleagues in Canada. On our way back to La Rambla we bought a couple of tasty glazed, pear pastries and espressos for our walk across La Rambla and into Barri Gotic.

Today we bought food there twice, and both times in was inedible. The first time we bought some fresh figs at a stall. They had started fermenting, and I ended up not being able to eat them, and trough them out. In the afteroon we went back there to get a snack. We bought some fruit cups and some hard salami. The hard salami was OK at best, and the fruit cups turned out to have fuit in them that had probably been cut up many days ago. Again ended up throwing out most of it. What a waste. Not going back there."

The only complain i have is that they were not cooked in grill but on that big flat iron surfaces that some times the restaurants call grill. Maybe the market regulations do not allow grill, but i would prefer that. It would have been much better. Anyway it was very good and friendly atmosphere and the food was tasty. I would recommend it."

We did our research and this bar was rated as the best tapas bar in Barcelona. We didn't quite believe it but we changed our mind after eating there. Fabulous hot tapas and easily the best we had in Barcelona. Must-try dishes include grilled squid and beans, juicy lamb/deer skew, grilled sweet pepper salad. We ordered around 5-6 dishes and every single dish was phenomenal. Brunch at El Pinotxo tapas bar: 30 euros/person (including wine, 5-6 dishes)Cherries: 2-4 euros/kgSpanish Ham: from 18 euro/kg and above. The darker the ham looks, the better quality and more expensive. Venders sell air-tight packs of ham that you can purchase and bring home. We were told the air-tight ham would last for 3 months. Put the air-tight ham packs in the fridge (not freezer) as soon as you get home."

My favorite was a Greek stall that sold the most DELICIOUS kalamata olives and stuffed peppers I've ever tasted. It also serves all kinds of Greek snacks from savory pastries to baklava. I also loved the turron stall, and I stocked up on delicious turrons from there. Keep in mind though that the market is always EXTREMELY busy and bustling with tourists. It is also NOT for those who care too much about hygiene. But if you can get over those 2 things and fully immerse yourself in the market, all your senses will be rewarded."

We had a tortilla wrapped 'come' of 3 fish fingers and rubbery squid rings for 4.50\u20ac which wasn't great but the stall on the edge selling falafel was nice. The market authority should install a few benches as nowhere to sit (sit on the ground round the back of the market and get told off) except for perching on some low doorway steps. But I assume the restaurants around the edge would not like for tourists to be able to buy takeaway and sit while eating it.

Set up in little stalls food is displayed wonderfully. The smells (sometimes of fish) wash over you like you are in a sea of flavors. I saw the largest shrimp that i have ever seen! (must have been 12 inches long) Also the Jamon is to die for. I would recommend this to anyone who is visiting Barcelona. Of course be careful with your wears as this is a high pick pocket area."

La Boqueria is predominantly a food market, which serves up some of the freshest fruits, vegetables, meats and seafood that Barcelona has to offer. It\u2019s a great place to catch a bite after sightseeing while people watching and soaking up Barcelona\u2019s lively atmosphere. We visited in winter and the market was buzzing with locals and tourists. We highly recommends a visit to the seafood stall in the left hand corner after the main entrance, which serves up delicious grilled seafood. You will know which one it is because it is completely PACKED! Overall, the Spanish know how to do food well!For more photos, please check out our travel blog:http://www.wanderlustchronicles.com.au/#!La-Boqueria-MarketsBarcelona-SPAIN/c1ljw/DED69DC0-049A-44DF-9D1E-00B954F404DF"

We spotted an organic take-out place in the far corner and after perusing through the rest of the market came back for a delicious vegetarian meal (10 euro) that easily served two. Be aware that there are not many places to sit yourself or your food down so most people that we observed, including us, found an out-of-the-way corner or leaned against a building and ate standing up."

Popular with tourists it seems but met heaps of local people there too, particularly eating at the tapas bars/counters. They told us to pay good attention to our bags to avoid pickpockets which is probably good advice for shopping in most markets in the world. The tapas places are really popular so getting seating is quite hard but worth it.In the market there's an amazing choice of real fruit juices which were all delicious (and we didn't get a dodgy tummy from them - had six diff flavours over four days from different stalls). They make quite a sight - all the different vibrant colours.The bacalao empenadas were a winner, thin pastry, not overfilled but full of flavour. Also the various seafood dishes we chose -mariscos salpicon etc, also fried cod on sticks - all fresh and tasty and available to buy 'para llevar' - to take-away, in plastic containers.We got into the habit of buying bits and pieces from the different vendors - nuts, olives, bread, ham, seafood etc and head off for a city picnic but learned early on that there are few places to sit and enjoy a picnic so headed up to Montjuic and found plenty of places up there, even picnic tables (situated just back from the Olympic swimming pool). Air was cooler and breezy and views are great.Even if you don't go to buy, the fresh seafood area is worth seeing - great variety of fresh seafood and really clean and tidy.Unfortunately there weren't many rubbish bins around so there were quite a few plastic fruit juice cups left here and there but no doubt they all get swept up at the end of the day."

This was a must see on our recent trip to Barcelona .Coincidentally we had just seen Masterchef and they had bought the contestants here so we just had to come .The vibrant colours and smells hit you as soon as you walk through the gates !!I have to say this was one of the nicest and best laid out markets I've ever been to and the range of foods on sale is awesome . The fish section and of course the Iberian hams have to be seen to be believed .Everything is well set out and the foods you can buy ready to eat from some of the vendors are ace . We particularly enjoyed the myriad of fresh fruit juices and the freshly made crepe stall has to be tried - killer emmental and Serrano ham crepe - delicious . Followed by deep fried prawns ( gambas ) and Iberian ham !!Very busy and does get quite crowded so watch your pockets but if you like your food then you must not miss this place !Wicked !!"

So many colors! The rows are filled with so much fruit and spices and meats and cheeses. There are a lot of tapas bars but good luck finding a seat. It's a very great market to buy produce and meat. I bought a cup of fruit for 1.5e. I came back again the next day and found myself with a delicious strawberry coconut kiwi smoothie. This place is an awesome experience and aesthetically pleasing."

Admittedly, the guide books didn't really rave about this market but I feel they overlooked one of the real gems of the city. Appealing to all your senses of sight, smell and taste, La Boqueria was a kaleidoscope of everything food. Since I was not a big fan of the restaurant food in Barcelona (mainly tapas, cured meats and paella), La Boqueria had everything under the sun in terms of food: fresh fruit juices, fruit cups, baked goods, chocolates, pizzas, sandwiches and nuts. It is definitely a must see and must eat!"

When you get there, you will notice difference prices, most of them at 1.50. However, if you walk around and deeper into the market, you'll find juices for just one Euro!

There's something for everyone in the market! Fresh fruit and vegetables, meat and fish, delightful chocolates and candies or even fresh smoothies and fruit juices. Definitely explore throughout before making your first purchases as we discovered things were cheaper deeper into the market vs at the entryway. It can be busy, but well worth the time to wander around and explore especially if you are staying in Barcelona several days as you will find many provisions to tide you over between meals."

It's easy to locate; approx 350 meters on the left side of La Ramblas Boulevard from the Columbus statue on the water front.You can't miss it with it's steady flow of people flowing from the various entrances.Even if you have just eaten you will not be able to resist a little something from this food treasure trove. Be it a handful of juicy plump cherries, strawberries, a fresh crunchy apple, peaches or apricots. Maybe a cup of fresh pieces of coconut or one of those delicious fruit smoothies. Actually the chocolates, No the sweeties. Gosh! look at that ice cream it's irresistible. Help me here! there are far too many choices. And we have not even looked at the savouries yet!So don't eat before your visit as many of the market stalls that sell fresh produce will also provide a small dining area, e.g. fresh fish and vegetables or maybe some cured ham and breads, etc. If you wander back into the market there are many choices of something sweet to compliment your meal. The flavours and quality of everything is second to none.If you're on a self catering holiday, there is an abundance of fresh meat, fish, chickens, vegetables, oils herbs and spices. Don't forget your Shopping Trolley!So if you want to be well satiated and uplifted this market is for you! I hope you enjoy my video of the many choices available.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NXQSff6dxU"

It's a great place to stop for a snack or to take something back to your hotel room. We returned there everyday during our stay in Barcelona!However, you should be aware that is very crowded, so watch your bags! Also I found it to be overpriced and not always great value for the money, for instance, the fruit juices at the stalls were not that tasty as it seems like they added too much water in them, and they serve you microwave reheated tapas so when it comes to microwaved French fries it gives a poor result in the end.My advice: visit the whole market before you buy something because prices can vary a lot between the stalls for the same product, and more generally avoid the stalls located at the entrance aisle and go inside the market around the central aisle instead."

Saturday was fantastic, Sunday closed and Monday great but many fish stalls shut (no fishing on weekends so no fresh fish Mondays!).The colours are incredible, the stall holders competing visually with each other for your business. The noise is great, everyone talking, stall holders shouting.The smells tell you where you at anytime, fish, spice, fruit, tapas, coffee. Close your eyes and guess.The tastes are great, a good place for breakfast and to start the day before it gets too hot. The tapas bars are fantastic and you can eat anything that you can see around you. Prices are reasonable and the service quick.We were under whelmed by Las Ramblas, felt it held little originality but the Mercat de Sant Josep de la Boqueria was excellent.

The market is not far from the mid point of Las Ramblas and has a slightly ominous entrance with several additional alleyway entrances but you absolutely must walk through the entirety of the market and experience some of the truly eclectic vendor offerings. This isn't to say the entire market is unique, as you will see more than your fair share of fruit/smoothie stalls. But deeper within the market are some really unique sandwich vendors and some truly colorful specialty stands, in addition to fresh seafood and produce stands. Several sit-down tapas restaurants are toward the back, and the market itself is lined with a wide variety of restaurants and cafes. The vendors are reasonably accommodating of tourists snapping photos, but some of the vendors that rely on locals won't hesitate to shoo you along. Highly recommend getting some of the ham offerings and trying some of the fruit stands. Some very interesting candy offerings can be found near the center. When in doubt for the tapas vendors, I'd assume the more patrons the better a location. And if you do wander through the market, be sure to stop by Rita Blue (http://www.ritablue.com/) for perhaps the best sangria you'll have in Barcelona!!"

Incredibly high-quality ingredients are a revelation and the very best thing to do is to go there with a day's worth of menus planned, and to shop accordingly. Everyone is so helpful and will work to understand exactly what you need and ...with good humor and patience.The market is usually mobbed all day long, EXCEPT early in the morning when it opens; go then, to have the full market experience without the crowds. Don't expect to bargain; these are the best ingredients int he world, and the merchants know it. Paying the full price is part of the way you say \"thank you\" for bringing theses wonderful foodstuffs to the market at the PEAK of perfection. It is a virtual explosion of color,m smells, flavors, and people!Step off la Rambla long enough to gasp."

No matter if you want to have lunch, buy a snack to enjoy back at the hotel or even to bring back home with you, whether you're looking for an edible souvenir, or just for an amazingly colorful photographic opportunity, the Mercat de Sant Josep de la Boqueria is definitely the place for you!It's colorful, it's loud, it's crowded, but it is, without a doubt, a place that you won't forget visiting in Barcelona.We went there on my Birthday and ate at El Quim de la Boqueria, after which we wondered through the market, picking up fruits we had never tried before, from a stand selling halved fruits from Thailand, that were shrink wrapped and came with a plastic spoon, so that you could eat them straight away.Grab one of the delicious, freshly squeezed juices - there are SO MANY options to choose from, and you know that what you are getting is 100% natural and good for you.We also stopped at a confectionery stand called Ramona where we were handed a bag to mix and choose any of the delicious candy that caught our eye. It was difficult to actually stop ourselves from buying just about everything they had on display, as it all smelled so yummy and sweet, and looked irresistible. Word of caution for future buyers, though - while the fruit-shaped marzipan looks very nice, the taste isn't all that memorable, so, perhaps buy one just to try it out, and stick to the numerous types of chocolates they sell, as those are really good and worth the money!Definitely come here ready to buy a few things, and make sure to bring your camera! The Mercat de Sant Josep de la Boqueria is not to be missed!"

Not every stall was open for business (some of the fresh fish/seafood stalls were closed), but it was easier to walk around and see all the different arrays of food categories on display. The market is a few steps off Las Ramblas...easy to find and to walk through. It is indoors and reminded me of markets we have visited in other major cities (smaller but similar to Mahane Yehuda Market in Jerusalem). We had thought to find a place to sit and have a snack and people watch. But, there are few places to sit and none were conducive to people watching. Planning to have breakfast, lunch, or dinner here would be very limited in terms of choices to sit and enjoy the food. Sit down eating is not the purpose of this market. As a tourist sight...if you just want to see it...go at on off time, walk through, see the displays, buy a snack or two to eat while walking and head back out to Las Ramblas."

The market can get pretty crowded so keep your personal belongings close to you. It is very easy to get distracted here. You'll find yourself admiring (and drooling) at sight of the colorful and creative displays of food from the fruits, nuts, spices, smoothies, jamon to the fresh seafood. Prices vary and because this is a tourist attraction it can be pricey. If you are a foodie and/or a photo buff, this is a place not to be missed.

Sit-down food bars serving freshly cooked dishes cluster around the edges of the market. The market is a heady mix of sights, sounds, people - photographic opportunities abound around every corner. The downside is that it becomes very, very crowded by midday. It seems likely that the main business is tourist driven, and prices are accordingly higher. Be also aware of your personal belongings - although we didn't personally witness any problems, it would seem wise to be extremely alert amidst the throngs. We never bought any fresh produce from this market, and based on the items we compared, prices were higher than elsewhere. Best time to visit is early in the morning, before the crowds arrive, though once when we walked there at 8 am, many of the stalls were not quite yet functioning."

Yet, it's from 1840, and the iron structure represents a time on the architecture, and that is very pretty. It's well organized, the fruits and vegetables are beautiful and have great flavors, specially in the spring-summer time. But it's kind of expensive, comparing to other places where you can buy fruits and vegetables, because it's considered a tourist attraction. The points of sale at the entrance are the most expensive. If you have a low budget, try to enter inside and find another points of sale that are less exposed. Quality is guaranteed, except for the fruit juices. Fruit juices in all the points of sale are a big attraction for tourists, because they are refreshing and have beautiful colors. But if you are used to drink natural fruit juices, you'll find that those glasses are filled with water and sugar, while the fruit is only a little part of it. But if you're used to drink soft drinks, packaged, bought at the supermarket, maybe you'll not find any difference. There are lots lots lots lots of tourists there, specially at summer, so be patient to walk on crowd and take care with your belongings."

Best fish stalls I have ever seen, bustling busy customers, most discerning and buying fresh each day for their own tables.

Do not go there if you're hungry and don't plan to buy anything, because you will leave with 6 or 7 different bags of products and eat everything in a public park nearby, I guarantee it.The market is very popular, in may (which is not the high season), it was pretty much crowded to the point of no return, if you stop walking, everyone behind you has to stop too. But it's a festival of colors, smells, noises and tastes that will leave you hungry. From fresh fruits, fresh juices, hams, cheeses, spanish food, sweets, pastries and colored peppers hanging from the stalls, it's a heaven for foodies.Be careful though, it's the perfect place for pickpockets and some merchants are abusing the credulity of tourists by selling sub-part products at a higher cost than their neighbors simply because they're located near the entrance or on the central aisle. Definitely visit the whole thing before buying anything, prices can double between two stalls."

Delicacies such as Iberian Ham is easy to find elsewhere, and much cheaper too. Canned goods are better be purchased from small supermarkets.

I was put off at first by the scrum of tourists at the entrance of the market all taking photos and rudely not asking permission - these have to be the most photographed stalls and stall holders in the world. When I got through the scrum I found the fish and meat area and the stalls were beautiful with a huge variety of produce - if only we had markets like this in the UK. I would have liked to try the tapas here but the cafes were all so busy I decided to go elsewhere. I thought the stall holders were very tolerant and still managed a smile and a geeting."

It's good because it has some of the best food in Barca. An oyster bar that serves the freshest for 1-2 E each, a taco bar, a place that does mushrooms and snails, many seafood places with seafood so fresh that it is still wiggling on the ice. It's also a veggie, meat, olive, condiment, and ethnic food market. I love seafood so I went there several days to view the mariscos. Everything was in abundance: tuna, swordfish, bonito, 8-10 different mollusks, crawdads, lobsters, shrimps-all strictly fresh. I love uni-which is the eggs of sea urchin. It's a japanese delicacy and found in many sushi restaurants. I found fresh-caught sea urchin for 10E per kilo-about 12 pieces. I'd never done this before, but I took the kilo of urchins back to my hotel room and broke them open, scoped out the uni, and ate it with a cold glass of Spanish sauvignon blanc; delicioso. I went online to figure out how to extract the delicate private parts, and not having the recommended scissors, I used the blunt end of a spoon to open the creatures and the spoon part to literally \"spoon out\" the eggs. Fabulous. You MUST see this market-maybe not the sea urchins."

You will be strolling along La Rambla sometime during your visit in Barcelona so do yourself a favor and drop into this amazing market. It is on the west side of the promenade just north of the mid-way point. We stayed nearby at the Hotel Montecarlo a couple of block north of La Boqueria; the market was our first stop in Barcelona after we had checked in and freshened up.There has been a market on this site since about 1200, making La Boqueria over 800 years old. It was originally just outside the old city's defensive walls that ran along where La Rambla now lies. It has been an open air market for most of its existence, the current metal roof having been built 100 years ago in 1914. This is a working market catering to the locals and to the restaurants of the area. Meat, vegetables, fruit, seafood stalls are scattered all around. There are bakeries and sweet stalls. It is a bustling place especially at the La Rambla entrance and a little further in. If you go deeper into the market you will leave most of the crowd behind. There are lots of fresh seafood stands offering the maritime bounty of the nearby Mediterranean. Several specialized in salted cod, bacalao, a staple of Catalan cuisine. Fresh meat products were on display, of course, including innards such as lungs, liver, brain, spleen, intestines. The main meat attractions, however, were the jam\u00f3n and assorted sausage products.As with most attractions a guided visit can only enhance the experience and visiting La Boqueria with a chef would be the way to go; learning about the ingredients, which to buy and why, then using them in the kitchen. The Boqueria has its own culinary school. We took a session with Barcelona Cooking and had a lot of fun; unfortunately our schedule did not permit our joining the morning session which included the Boqueria tour before.The next best thing - or better yet - is to eat at one of the numerous dining establishments scattered around the market. Bar Pinotxo came well-recommended and it is ideally located near the entrance. Both these factors, however, ensured that the seats were continually occupied and we eventually gave up waiting. We continued exploring the market and came upon Bar Central La Boqueria along the main central passageway on the other side of the market. It specialized in seafood tapas and it was great.Definitely visit Mercat La Boqueria when in Barcelona"

I've been in Barcelona on 29th of december for 5 days with friends.We unfortunately always eat at fast foods and when by chance I saw this place I decided with my friend to eat here something! The atmosphere was really nice and the food was good! THE FRUIT MILKSHAKES WERE DELICIOUS !!!!!!! The banquets were colored, things were all fresh and natural!!REALLY NICE! If I go again to Barcelona I'll certainly come back here!"

Loads of options in terms of food, but try to go deeper into the market for better value, as some of the stalls placed at the entrance charges double the value! Also be watchful of your belongings. I would recommend splurging less here if you are keen on visiting the Mercado San Miguel in Madrid - prices are much more reasonable there! Otherwise, this place is perfect for all the adventurous foodies."

However, that would mean missing out on an enjoyable wander through the place and the opportunity to marvel at the seafood in particular. The food - especially the smaller portions that tourists are likely to buy - are not exactly cheap but it still gives plenty of pleasure to munch away while soaking up the atmosphere. We ate at the large seafood bar/restaurant in the market itself - rather than the restaurant dotted around the edge - which was excellent quality with the food cooked to perfection."

We've been shopping at this market since we arrived in Barcelona six weeks ago, and it is always such fun to wander around and see all the fruits, veggies, layers and layers of chocolates in every size and shape, stalls devoted to shellfish or to pork, fowl or beef or innards (some I still can't identify!), cheeses to please every palate, fresh eggs from every type of fowl in all colors and sizes....you can just spend an entire afternoon wandering around here. There is even several tapas bars at the back serving up yummy things all lined up in dishes from which to choose. A warning, tho...the stalls in the front where you enter are pricier than the ones at the back; some stalls don't indicate the price of their things and this is where you get burned. For one unpriced breast of chicken, I ended up paying $7/lb., for one tiny mini-cantaloupe, $8, and for 4 small country link sausages, the insane price of $10.I saw one of my favorite fruits from years when I sailed alone in the Pacific down the Southern Hemisphere, a guanabana, and luckily asked the price before telling him to put it in the bag -- $80! When I challenged him, he said, \"Well, it comes from Columbia! The price of the voyage is more than the worth of the fruit.\"Still, it's fun to shop here and I've just got to remember to ask \"how much\" before I buy!We also like to go to the Santa Caterina Market which is smaller, has fairer prices and is not filled with tourists altho it does close at 3:30pm."

This market is similar to all of the other large city markets throughout Spain and is really nothing special but is kind of interesting. About half of the people visiting the market are tourist and the other half are locals shopping for food and it does get very crowded. The market is interesting to just watch the locals buying food and seeing all the different types of food for sale.

My wife and I were in Barcelona for a few days before our cruise and we had read about the market in the Rick Steves Barcelona Book (and we had seen it mentioned in his TV episode on Barcelona). This place is a cornucopia of everything edible. You don't want to rush your visit, just take your time walking up and down the aisles in (both east and west and then take the north and south ones to make sure you see every bit of it). We decided to get the makings for sandwiches and other treats, plus a bottle of wine, and took everything back to our hotel. Howevrer, you can definitely order something at one of the many sit down or stand up counters and eat there. You can buy prepared sandwiches or even get something to order. The vendors with dozens of different types of olives (many stuffed with rather exotic ingredients) and the many different types of fresh mushrooms were really unique. You will also see all types of meats and seafood offered for sale here. While it can be a little bit hard to find (there are no highly visible signs on the Las Ramblas to show you the way), I highly recommend this market for a visit whether you intend to sample their wares or not. (We asked for directions from a local who didn't speak much English but was very friendly and helpful.) This market is one of the best you will see anywhere in the world."

I found the stall owners both helpful and polite and didn't find the produce over priced at all. However judging by some of the reviews I have read people have lost the art of being able to ask for a price before purchasing which I am sure helps. A lovely market to wander around if you are into food."

We are lunch at one of the food stalls at the fringe of the market - of course, we ordered seafood Paella.

I am sure the FDA would shut it done within minutes but apparently it works for the Europeans. It was a fun experience and one I would repeat"

Unfortunately my friend and I only had a few hours in Barcelona, we discovered this Market as we walked up Las Rambla from where the coach dropped us off on Ronda Litoral. What a mesmerising sight, we found the Chocolate stall and had great difficulty in leaving again. It has everything, brilliantly coloured fresh fruit, vegetables, fish and meats (Try the freshly made fruit smoothies) Make a picnic and take it with you as you walk through this wonderful city."

The beauty of food is the highlight of this amazing market - anything and everything, beautifully displayed - only the freshest and most gorgeous abounds here. Avoid the crepe guy - He has displays of crepes, but what you actually get is his ego as he prepares the crepe and a result with no taste that contains half the ingredients he shows in his display. GO FURTHER into the heart of the market to the Kiosko Universal, a square bar set up inside of which is all the action: cooking, preparing, etc. Adorning the counters of the bar are trays of some of the most gorgeous mushrooms - 0-12 varieties, waiting to be saut\u00e9ed to perfection with Spanish olive oil and garlic...and a splash of sea salt - (Salteado setas) ummmmmmmmmmmmmm......we also had a plate of roasted vegetables (surtido verduras), equally superb......and a plate of grilled gambas (shrimp) - big ad beauty! With 2 beers from the tap, total cost only 40 Euros! Outrageously cheap for such quality! I was tempted to return again and again, forgetting there was so much more to see (and eat) in Barcelona!"

Fresh fruit, vegetables, meats, poultry, fish and shellfish, eggs, cheeses, a plethora of mushrooms, a wine shop, candies and chocolate, you name it, La Boqueria has it, including a couple of tapas stalls where you can sit at the counter (if you can find a spot) to enjoy tasty bits of finger food with a copa de cava, de vino, or a glass of beer, or even a cup of coffee.The colors, the textures, the smells, the sounds, everything is boisterous, extravagant, and cheerful. It is worth a visit just to immerse yourself in this sensory extravaganza. Bring your camera! (Although some stall owners have a \"No foto\" sign.)Another excellent way to enjoy this wonderful market, is to go to buy some bread, some cheese, some jam\u00f3n (dried cured ham) and other delicacies, along with a bottle of good Spanish wine and find yourself a spot for a picnic, or eat back in your hotel room.An unforgetful experience!"

FANTASTIC!. as a professional chef who has been involved in every aspect of the food & beverage/hospitality business i have spent a lot of time shopping both professionally and as a home cook in many fresh markets, Mercat de Sant Josep de la Boqueria is the best so far. they all have that hustle and bustle, they are all a riot of colors, aromas and sounds, but this one seems to raise the bar to a higher level ... the fact that it is near the ocean and has not only the standards fruits, veggies, dairy/cheese, meats and poultry that so many others do, for me, however, the abundance of fresh fish and seafood is what sets this market above and beyond so many others ... in my 2 weeks touring Barca i returned to this market several times. i ate there 3 times (Kiosko Universal), and shopped there every visit ... where else can you get \"ice cream cones\" filled with Iberian ham? LOL ... the spices i bought and took home with me will not only compliment the foods i will be cooking, but they will help me to remember and relish the hours spent in Mercat de Sant Josep de la Boqueria ... i am a foodie who sets aside most of my travel budget for food and i willingly far exceeded what i thought i would be spending in Barca. to be able to purchase goods that cost 3, 4 or 5 times as much at home, and have them be so fresh too, was a major highlight of my trip to this market ... to be able to sit in my room, after going to this market, while working online (someone has to pay for these trips LOL) and enjoy the local food at a cheaper price was also a pleasure ... although some of the folks in the market seem a bit weary of tourists, most know they are a big part of their business and so they are very cheerful and helpful. not everyone speaks English but all you need to do is point at what you want, they put it on the scale until you say stop, and its a done deal ... its also one of the best photo-ops you will ever encounter."

We observed one couple who had the right idea: they purchased a fresh baked baguette, then went to an adjacent stand and bought some fresh cut jamon, followed up by a bottle of local red wine that they purchased from another nearby stall. It was obvious that they were ready for a simple yet fresh lunch.We ate at one of the food stalls located inside the Boqueria where we indulged on succulent fresh grilled seafood: calamari, mussels, clams and a variety of other seafood.It was obvious that the vendors here take great pride and care as each stall was clean, and their food items carefully stacked and placed with great precision. We also found some lovely gifts for friends at this vast market-so a trip here can eliminate some gift shopping for you as well.The bottom line: Take an hour of your time when strolling down Las Ramblas and visit the market Boqueria, peruse the vendors and their well-stocked stalls, and grab a quick bite to satisfy your appetite. The choices are endless and you will not go away disappointed!"

My vibrant memories of shopping at (and simply experiencing) this once-superb market were dismissed this time around as a result of several dishonest (or simply greedy) purveyors who charge travelers much higher prices than they charge non-travelers. The days of La Boqueria offering good value are gone. Best tips: Entirely avoid the merchants by the main entrance, and instead do all your shopping deeper inside. Never purchase from a vendor whose prices are not displayed. Skip prepackaged items, or candies that look handmade or artisanal but are not. Better yet, skip La Boqueria entirely, and hit one of the city's many other fresh markets, where value is great and travelers are not disrespected by being misled or overcharged."

If you go a little later in the day you might hit a bargain of buy one, get one half off. The fruit cups we purchased that way, just head further back in the market for these finds."

These are more expensive than those sold in the interior stalls.)Pinotxo, a well-acclaimed food sanctuary just to the right upon entering La Boqueria, was closed for renovation when we were there last week of August/first week of September so my husband and I checked-out Kiosko Universal for breakfast. This is an equally very well-rated resto/bar - at the corner as you turn left upon entering the market. One must try their grilled seafood mix of shrimps, navajas (razor clams) and almejas (clams)!Only in La Boqueria have we seen such wide variety of meat of all kinds and forms - errrr... at times gross too, like Criadillas Ternero (bulls' testicles) and Conill Tendre (conejo tierno or skinned whole rabbit, lamb's head and all types of entrails!Fruits and fresh seafood were also aplenty!

The tapas bars seem to be crowded all the time but you just have to bide your time and grab any seats as they become available. Most of the vendors do speak a little English but worst case scenario, just point to what you want or ask the local sitting next to you!!! :) If the tapas bars are not your style, there are plenty of restaurants surrounding the market.If you love taking pictures as I do, then this is definitely a place not to be missed. The stall selling all kinds of sweets, in particular, lends itself to many a colourful photo, as you would have no doubt seen already.It can get very crowded though so once again, please be careful of your belongings.This market was my absolute favourite part of Barcelona and I'd strongly recommend that you do not leave Barcelona without visiting this market at least once.

It's nice and colorful, but I cannot see the excitement (or attraction) in looking at regular, run-of-the-mill and very expensive meat, fish and fruit stands that sell the exact same things. Would definitely give it a miss, unless you seriously like to tick things and say you've been. It also seems like the perfect place for pick-pocketing so be ware..."

And every time i tasted 2+ different juices. Simply impossible to resist the variety of colors. So delicious and cheap. Just 1-1.5\u20ac The sellers are honest. The price sign was a bit confusing that I thought the berry juice was 1.5\u20ac, but the owner returned me 50 cent coin immediately. Quite impressive considering all the notorious barcelona thief/ scam warnings on the internet !"

I had a seafood grill in one the food stands and it was delicious and affordable at $35 Euro with beer for two. I had a wonderful conversation with a young couple from Germany. A fresh juice for $1.50 was also wonderful. They take pride in their presentation and cleanliness. I wish I lived there so I could come daily to buy fresh fish and vegetables, cheeses and fruits, wines and candies, spices and herbs. Just be careful of petty thieves looking for a distracted tourist. Never let your bag or wallet out of your sight. Keep your bag on your lap and your wallet (and valuables) in a front pocket, never in a backpack, and never hang your bag on the back of a chair anywhere."

There is fresh fruit, candy, chocolate, nuts, fresh fruit juice, etc. I did not walk through all of La Boqueria due to the smell of the meat (I'm a vegetarian) so I can not comment on that part. Don't be afraid to walk through and compare prices as some vendors sell their items for 2 euro more than other sellers do in the back. I enjoyed a pineapple and coconut smoothie mix for 1.50 euro and I wish I could have one right now. It was absolutely delicious! This really is a must see. This is located along La Rambla.

I nibbled on anchovy wrapped olives, fresh fruit smoothies, fresh manchego and some tapas with rose at the Bar Pinotxo - open air tapas bar on the edge of the market. When I go back with someone (I was alone) I will definitely go back, stock up on snacks and drinks and find somewhere in a square nearby for a picnic. This market was full of fresh everything, bright colors, amazing smells and friendly shopkeepers. Definitely my favorite attraction in all of Barcelona!

On the following words I'll try to give a faithful description of that rich history as we understand it. Where this market comes from is uncertain, what we are sure of is that it was born as a travelling market, placed in the Ramblas of Barcelona. La Rambla acquired growing importance as a pedestrian lane, and the market was set in the best place to attract the large numbers of passers-by and local inhabitants. Its location was threatened many times. In Catalunya, towns and cities have been founded around markets and the same rings true for La Boqueria. It originated as an open-air market, in front of one of the gates of the old city wall (Pla de la Boqueria) where fruit and vegetable traders from local towns and farms nearby would sell their products. The spaces inside the city at that time were too small to establish a big market of the current Boqueria kind and it was necessary to set them outside the walls. http://andreroque.photoshelter.com/search?I_DSC=barcelona&I_SDATE[MM]=&I_SDATE[DD]=DD&I_SDATE[YYYY]=YYYY&I_EDATE[MM]=&I_EDATE[DD]=DD&I_EDATE[YYYY]=YYYY&I_CITY=&I_STATE=&I_COUNTRY_ISO=&I_ORIENTATION=&I_IS_RELEASED=&I_IS_PRELEASED=&_CB_I_PR=t&_CB_I_PU=t&_CB_I_RF=t&_CB_I_RM=t&I_SORT=RANK&I_DSC_AND=t&V_ID=&G_ID=&C_ID=&_ACT=search"

It was so tempting to buy things but realistically when you're a tourist there is only so much of this type of stuff you can buy which is unfortunate because everything looked delicious! However, there are also lots of small restaurants lining the aisles and streets around the Boqueria you can stop and eat at. I would definitely recommend this to anyone traveling to Barcelona. It is something to see! On a side note, everyone had told us to be careful of pick pockets here - we personally had no problems but I would pass this tip along just in case as it can get very crowded and I can see how easily it could happen."

Until recently, the Spice MArket in Istanbul, St. Lawrence in Toronto, Granville Island (Vancouver) and Pike Place (Seattle) were on the top of my list; now there's another at the top of that list: I\u2019ve seen La Boqueria in a couple of Travel Channel shows, and it didn\u2019t disappoint. It\u2019s been here since around 1840 (with some modifications since) but the market itself dates back to the 12th century in this spot, in one form or another\u2026 It\u2019s very crowded (so hold on to your valuables) but definitely worth a walk through. There\u2019s also a couple excellent tapas places within; we didn\u2019t get to try them this time around, but looked delicious: El Quim de la Boqueria (I hear it\u2019s hit or miss depending on how busy they are, but general reviews are very positive), Bar Pinotxo, Bar Boqueria, or Kiosko Universal. They are all good, overpriced (this is a prime tourist spot, after all), but offer an authentic on-the-go breakfast/lunch experience. If you don\u2019t want to sit, grab a jam\u00f3n cornet from any of the butcher shops, or a refreshing fruit smoothie from the fruit vendors.For a few cool pics and a full account of the experience, check out my trip report:http://disdatdudder.blogspot.com/2013/08/barcelona-2013-part-2.html"

Made me wonder if what I was drinking didn't come out of a commercially-made aseptic container somewhere in the back. A whole cup of dragon fruit juice for only 1 Euro? Really? How'd they do that?Tip: if visiting around closing time, some vendors will \"bundle\" their products at discounted prices. We got some juices, fruit salads and calzone pizzas at super cheap prices during closing."

The quality is excellent and depending on the stall, you can also have a lot of information on the products and their difference. You can even try a few sample first before buying... I had a small kitchen in my room so i went a few times to buy cheese, ham, bread, sausage, chorizo...I tried several things and receive great information as well. The Iberico ham even if it is pricey was much more affordable than in restaurant. In the market, you are also sure of the quality since it is packed in your face...I felt that in restaurant, a lot of the time, the iberico ham could have been some cheaper mass produce stuff...Since it is known, cited in every guide book and right off the ramblas, it can also be very crowded especially at the end of the afternoon or beginning of evening. I usually went in the morning. Less, crowded, more time to look and asked questions... A bit ''safer'' as well i imagine..."

I visited twice and just love going to every stall and pick up something interesting or try a local flavor...I understand tourist are being warned of pickpockets, hmm myself and spouse are pretty careful and keep things close, so its really safe."

So many vendors to choose from selling similar items. Always packed. If you love jamon iberico then you need to stop by here; it's sliced fresh straight from the pig's leg. Stopping by near closing time will likely allow you to take advantage of the fruit vendors trying to sell off the their remaining daily inventory."

There are hot foods, tapas bars, dried fruits, gourmet chocolates, oils... The list is endless. There are great photo opportunities - stall owners were happy for us to snap some photos - we tried to buy something from the stall or ask first though to be polite. Watch your bags here - we had no trouble but you will be in close quarters with many others. It's closed all day on Sundays. Metro stop 'Liceau' is directly outside the markets. We bought a variety of goods (not cheap but delicious) and had a picnic near the Olympic stadium."

A real feast for the eyes, as well as an education in what parts of animal bodies can be eaten (referring to the offal stalls). The market gets very crowded and you need to be aware of pick pockets. We visited at about 11am on a Monday morning in June, to find the market was closed; don't know why this was and there were disappointed crowds of people arriving. We went back the following day.Tip: pick up a pastry for breakfast or a sandwich for snack / lunch from the bakery stall \"Forn de Betlem\" left from centre towards the back of the market. Really fresh and tasty, at a fraction of the price of hotel food. We also stopped off on our way home, instead of buying food at the airport."

If you want more to eat, there are tapas bars inside the market, but the stools were full and very crowded when we were there. Around the outside are restaurants where you can go, but they tend to be on the pricey side because of the location.Looking at the meat counters is an education in itself. We saw stalls selling heads (complete with eyes), tongues, feet, and every other organ possible. We saw a few things that I have never seen sold before. That is what makes exploring different cultures interesting.The market is very crowded in the morning, but more is available then. In the late afternoon, prices drop on many of the fresh items like juice because they must sell it. Any time you go, it is worth a visit. I loved it!"

And that's a good sign! Countless vegetables and meats can be found. Fish, spices, sweets, desserts and much more. Some stalls sell Tapas and / or meals. We enjoyed very much the \"Universal\" (see my review), with great great seafood! And then there's the butchery \"Can Vila\" ... specialized on Ham (Jamon). We tried a package of the 5 year old Iberico for 150 Euro/kg. Just great....hard to describe....like candy...but it's meat! You really could spend hours strolling around here....looking at things...trying things. It's also a great bad-weather option because the whole market is covered with a massive roof.If you're into food, then this market is a MUST! We loved it....Wanna know more about my trips?

Actually they are great marketing lessons! Whenever I go I alsways end up with unexpected shrimp or cod...\"look at those shrimp my dear you have never eaten such fresh fish... so how many do you want?\". Just a few tips: Avoid going there on Monday (not a good day for fresh fish); If you are a REAL early bird hit there at 6-8am (in weekdays) and see the last uploading and market arrivals and the workers of the neighbourhood having breakfast. I insist not to do that on weekends because the experience turns into being surrounded by drunk tourists and party teens! Schedule: MONDAY-SATURDAY 08am to 8:30pmSubway: Green Line to LICEU -also walkable 5minutes from Pla\u00e7a Catalunya (down on your right).Did you know? Until a few years ago there used to be an amazing shop with deep fried in chocolate...insects!! Wonder why they closed...History: It started as an open-air market, in front of one of the gates of the old city wall (Pla de la Boqueria) where fruit and vegetable traders from local towns and farms near by would sell their products."

And lots of tasters in the cakes and bread stalls.Very busy but great atmosphere and we went every day for a smoothie.dont miss this!"

An appetite. A pair of comfortable shoes. Plan to stay in the area at least for the afternoon. Preferably the whole day. Plop down at any one of the many zinc-topped bar/cafes, and enjoy the fresh tapas offered with the vino regional or a copa de cava. We only had forty-five minutes, hardly enough to savor all this market, over 700 years old! had to offer, and yet, we loaded up on some jamon iberica y chorizos (get them vaccum packed and wrap them tight in your check-in bags and pray the dogs don't sniff them out in US Customs!!) and savored a plate of tapas with a vino tinto regional before our group headed off to the Gothic section across from la Rambla. Since this is a very touristy part of town, make sure you keep your cards and cash securely hidden. You are packed cheek to jowl with everybody. Be prepared to make a Anglophile friend or two; I got an invitation to stay in a house in Montserrat after a couple noticed my NYT crossword puzzle and let me practice my Spanish in exchange for some English. You will never want to go home again after seeing this wonderful place and meeting the friendly people. We are already planning the trip back."

Las Ramblas is the pedestrian shopping area that runs through the center of downtown Barecelona, between Barri G\u00f2tic and the Christopher Columbus Monument. If you walk down Las Ramblas, you will see the netrance to the huge farmers market called La Rambla de Sant Josep Boqueria. Any tale of roaming around Barcelona must include a stop for snacks at the La Rambla de Sant Josep Boqueria which was definitely open for business two weeks before Christmas.This is quite a bit more than just a street market (it won the prize for the best market in the world, awarded by the World Markets Congress held in 2005 in Washington DC.) so you find fruit and meat and nuts and candies and drink and spices and things you never imagined might be edible in December.Even early in the day in the winter, the crowds were growing and the lines were long.The many fruit vendors were irresistable, especially the row of berry sellers with their luscious wares set out in small serving trays, with personalized forks, clearly just waiting to be eaten by hungry tourists. Everything was delicious, affordable and beautifully presented."

We enjoy cooking and enjoy shopping the unfamiliar markets when we travel. The hard part is that we have to purchase in very small quantities compared to at home. The market stalls are very well suited for buying a couple hundred grams of this-and-that, although they would, of course, prefer to sell by the kilo. On Saturday afternoon, we were aware that grocery stores are all closed on Sunday, so we made a point of heading out to the Boqueria to shop for paella makings. We purchased a small package of spice mix, a tiny box of saffron, 200 grams of rice and half a kilo of shrimp at various market stalls. A friend of the lady who sells spice advised in halting English that chicken, rabbit and seafood are correct for paella, but chorizo is not used here. Chorizo is, surprisingly, an Iberian (not Mexican) type sausage. It's clear that regional differences will occur, and our version will feature chorizo, as we like that in our Jambalya at home. The merchants are putting their leftover fish back on ice and shuttering their stalls by 4 pm, despite the big crowds of shoppers blocking all aisles.The market sells hundreds of species of fish, some of which we have photographed while scuba diving, so it looks gruesome to see pitiful dead cuttlefish, octopus, squid, piles of little whelks, wild-eyed fin fish. The skinned rabbits and lamb heads, with eyeballs and teeth, perfectly white and no plaque, piglets with eyes decently closed, dead chickens with legs, heads and beaks, all hard to look at. More cheerful are the brightly colored fruits and vegetables and candy."

In the heart of the city, just right in the middle of La Rambla, huge market with all kinds of fresh food, inclusing mariscos and fish, all kinds of jamon and chorizos, fruits and veggies and sweeeets. Huge variet of fresh juices, hand made chocolate, you can have lunch there or buy some food for take away. Under the outer collonnade an excellent wine shop where also the glass of cava or wine can be tried (for-2-3 euro per glass). A must see, but watch for your staff and beware of pick pockets. Crowdy.

We visited early morning to watch the choreographed setup madness, during the day and in the evening/late afternoon for the shutdown to get an overall sense of the rhythm of the market. Organized madness sums it up. There seems to be more tourist wandering taking photo's than locals shopping for produce, yet most goods are sold daily and restocked the following morning. A must see but some of the smaller Mercat's might give a more traditional experience. Almost a victim of too many tourist, I am sure that the vendors must be tired of people taking up space taking pictures but buying nothing, though to their credit they seem to be good nature about it."

The little \u201cUniversal\u201d kiosk left entrance from La Rambla of Boqueria market is as good as it gets for seafood. Every dish is fresh and simple, and unpretentiously tasty. I ordered the mixed mushrooms, razor clams, mixed seafood plate and squid and patates fritas. The dishes were all \u00e1 la minute and sprinkled in a pre-prepared sauce of olive oil, garlic, lemon, parsley and salt and pepper. And it needed nothing more. The mixed mushrooms were incredible with a flaked salt.The razor clams were a delight. The squid was meaty and tender, without that chewiness and the chips weren't crisp but amazingly tasty soaked with olive oil and garlic, which was surprisingly delicious. You cannot reserve a table or a chair at the bar. You have to go up to the cashier and give him your name and the number of people and then wait till your name is called out. People don't miss out on that."

In fact it is a beautiful fruit and veg market and a fish and meat market all in one. The stalls are well established and all around the edge are cafes etc. My students spent a lot of their time at the ice cream parlour just as you enter, through the fabulous gates eating some amazing flavours of ice cream such as Kinder Surprise. There were some bargains to be had and if you went into the middle the prices were much cheaper. The fruit and the fresh juices were amazing. The colours and atmosphere were marvellous and we even saw some street performers too. We were warned about pickpockets but kept a tight hold of our bags and had no problems at all.

In this covered market place you can find everything, from exotic fruits to any edible fish you can imagine. The place is buzzing on Saturday because locals go there to buy fish for their weekend paella! If you like markets, this is the place to visit.It is not only what you can find but also how it is presented. The presentation at every stand is like a piece of art and a heaven for photographers.If you are lucky enough to find a spot at one of the counters selling freshly fried or grilled fish then your visit will have been complete.

But I know that a lot of tourists like the Hispanic food. The Barcelona\u2019s food is something special, something Catalunic and exquisite. Like to try? At the center of Ramblas, just near the Liceu Opera house you can easily find La Boqueria Market, the legend of the city. It\u2019s not just a market, it\u2019s like an colorful explosion, like the endless festival of Catalunian food and taste. In several years they will celebrate 800th anniversary, but of course through the history it was many different markets on this spot, the largest was built by 1843 and the metal roof that still exist was constructed in 1914. Local people told me that even Gaudi the Great was a frequent client here, may be looking at something here he got inspiration\u2026 It\u2019s open from 8 AM to 8 PM, but don\u2019t come here on Sunday, the place is closed. Could you imagine the store which offers about 30 kinds of olives? You could find it here and the name of the place is Graus Conserves. Our hotel manager told me: if you are in La Boqueria and want to taste our specials, go there in the evening, ask for jamon Serrano (special sort of ham) or maybe you can afford our good and expensive wines\u2026 I followed his advice and my impression is unforgettable. They have several bars and cafes, and I met there tourists who first got some food, some meals and then just sat there watching curious food lovers. If you are in Barcelona I highly recommend La Boqueria. See me pictures and do not forget the place of a special local pride.alftul"

Fortunately, I had some time before my flight the day I left--the only open space on the itinerary.It was interesting to be there just as the market was opening because not only did it give me an opportunity to see the market vendors setting up, it also meant that there weren't any crowds. Though there were some shoppers getting an early start on the day's supplies. I have the feeling that the place gets very crowded during the day.The selection of food is amazing and runs the gamut from fish, game and vegetables to caviar, cheese and baked goods to mushrooms, nuts and candy. The food looked very fresh and the market was very clean.There -is- one thing to be aware of, though, if you are at all squeamish about where food comes from (which I'm not). Some of the stalls sell whole game or poultry, extremities still attached. Others sell animal parts that one normally doesn't see in supermarkets, like ham with the hoof still attached or sheep's heads. Come to think of it, I don't know that I've seen that in any of the farmer's stalls at the Byward Market here...There are several restaurants/caf\u00e9s/bars inside the market as well as all the food stalls, but since I didn't try any of them, I cannot comment on them. I did stop at a restaurant that was under the portico of the building between the market and the Ramblas for churros and caf\u00e9 con leche. And the slightly surly Barcelona waiter experience."

After we visited Mercado de Triana in Seville, that market has nothing over this one off of Las Ramblas. This one was bigger and had more varieties.We got there near closing time and some places were already closed. We bought reduced price fruit juices that were refreshing after our walk from La Paral-lel to Las Ramblas via Carrer Nou del la Rambla. This place was brimming with a myriad of colors, with all kinds of meat, seafood (some of it were alive), sweets, fruits, and vegetables. The selection of sweets was amazing. If I were into chocolate, I would have a hard time to choose.We had hoped to come back another day to explore further, especially the places that were closed, but we never did. However, we were glad that we fit it in."

The Mercat de Sant Josep de la Boqueria, more commonly just referred to as La Boqueria, is something that I wish I could put on a freighter and ship back to the U.S., lock, stock and barrel. What do you want? Meat, Fish, Vegetables, Fruit, Eggs, Grains, Tea, Anything??? There are more varieties of more delicious looking, and tasting specimens of each of the foregoing, that you simply don't know what to try next. There are breads, there are hams, there are oils, there is cheese, there is some of just about every fresh food you could dream of, and then some.The displays make it look as if they were built by Hollywood, but they are real, as is every item that you are looking at. After seeing just some of the meat vendors, selling ham for up to 200 Euros a kilo, I knew I better go back and do some studying before I bought anything. The Serrano ham that we see here in the U.S., which is on par with some of the Italian prosciuttos, is the equivalent of Boar's Head over there, meaning common \"ham.\" Real ham is Jamon Iberico, and then it gets complicated from there. The best of the hams are Jamon Iberico de Bellota, which are pigs that freely roam forests, and whose entire diet consists of acorns (bellotas) which help give the meat its particularly intense flavor. Then you have the Pata Negra, meaning \"black-hooved\" pigs, considered by many to be the best among the best, and the only real top flight hams come from the rear legs of the pigs, the \"jamons,\" while the front legs are referred to as the \"paletas.\" Then there are the slicing angles from each ham, from the front, the top, the side, etc., each priced accordingly. Finally, you get the top-named producers, whose hams are sold by name, such as \"Five Js\", which are DOC name controlled by the Government and EU. These hams, which are aged for 3-4 years, can run over $100/lb. U.S. or 200 Euros/kg.But there is more than just ham. You can sit down and eat a crepe being made in front of you, have a sandwich at the small cafes that line the outer walls inside the market, while you try to figure out what you want to buy.If you read any of my reviews, you will note that I am a big fan of shopping locally for food wherever I go, and I love to take picnic lunches along with me when I go exploring, so that I can find some beautiful, interesting or scenic spot to sit down, get some rest, maybe drink a beer or some wine, depending on what country I am in, usually toting along my trusty little collapsible lightweight cooler, to carry my lunch and some water for the day. Most days I would head to La Boqueria and stock up on some amazing bread, meat, cheese, smoked fish, fresh fruit, and stock my hotel fridge and plan the lunch for the day. It beats the prices that you would pay in any restaurant for the quality you are getting and you get to decide exactly where and when you want to eat. Enjoy."

Convenient location (metro station Liceu, or you can drop by there just walking along la Rambla) and a huge selection of food made us return there over and over again. Fresh vegetables, fruits, exotic fruits, catalan chocolate, traditional almond dessert torrons in any form imaginable, fresh seafood, jamons, various types of Spanish sausages, fresh juice, tea, wines, pies - you name it! Besides, there are several open-counter cafes that serve seafood (they cook them fresh right in front of you) with reasonable prices. Once we had to wait for 10-15 minutes to get two seats but it was worth the wait. We ordered a plate of seafood assortment and it was delicious. I also like the way they sell some fruits, like pitahaya or pineapple, already cut open with a spoon, but even if the fruit you'd like to eat right now is not cut open, you can always ask a seller to cut it and give you a spoon. Actually you can just tour around the market trying everything on your way, it turned out to be so much fun! The atmosphere is really friendly and there are so many things to try.. so I suggest that you fit several visits to the market in your itinerary, you won't regret it."

Like all markets it has everything you need to have a banquet, but disposed beautifully in the stands. Take your camera, because you will want to record this experience. You can also sit in one of the Bars and have some tapas and drink cava. A Barcelona trip can be exhausting, because you can walk everywhere and here is the place to rest. Just a tip, go round noon or 13h. The spanish usually have lunch later, so you wont get the crowd."

Market itself is very interesting with so many different kinds of vegetable, meat and fishery products, but one unfortunate experience in this market totally ruined our day in Barcelona. I bought 1 piece of fried fish ball at the fish shop called Marisc Nineta. Fish ball was 1.5 Euro and I gave the shopkeeper 20 Euro. She asked me whether I have smaller changes, but unfortunately i didn't. Then she quickly folded 5 Euro bill into small piece in order to disguise as 10 Euro bill and gave me back 8.5 Euro instead of 18.5 Euro! Realizing that i got a wrong amount, i kindly pointed out to the shopkeeper and asked her to give me 18.5 euro. She refused claiming that it was 10 Euro that i gave her. The attitude of shopkeepers was so rude, and when i tried to take a photo of the nameplate of this shop, they were shouting at me. So be careful when you shop at Marisc Nineta, especially if you look like an easy target: naive looking foreign tourist who don't speak Spanish. Barcelona is such a nice city, but one greedy person can destroy your whole experience."

Paradise for Jamon lovers, after some grueling effort, i found 50grams is my perfect single portion, there are so many to try that isn't available in the states and much cheaper. I gravitate towards the smaller owner operated stalls, found Mateo's to be a great one, tried both of their Jamon bellotas, Salamanca and 5j both incredible(just in my head but 5j taste better in barcelona than in US). Saw many people at the popular tapas bar in the front of the market, so I squeeze in too, but killed it for me when i order a hot chocolate and got a store bought glass bottle that he heated up with the milk steamer....a tiny dish of salty callos(tripe) was 6euros. The next visit, I headed inside to a small cafe counter in the middle of the market, Cafe Sant Josep, the people running it are very charming have been working there for 30-40 years, while i was there I only saw elderly regulars stop by for coffee and snack. Great coffee and wonderful callos for about half the price of the stall in the front and tastier too! It was much more enjoyable at Cafe Sant Josef after that another visit to Mateo's."

There were a few what we considered to be proper meat and vegetable stalls, but when we stopped to look at the tripe stall as our 7 year old wanted to know what it was, where it came from etc... the old guy threw his toys out the pram and signalled for us to get away from the stall, thankfully the lady at the pig stall was much more pleasant.

There are lots of stands selling fruit from beautiful displays, plus meat and fish sellers stands selling a variety of interesting products. It costs nothing to look around, but if you're feeling adventurous make a purchase! It is a bit cramped, and like on La Rambla, watch out for pickpockets."

A complete farmer's/fishermens market containing the freshest and best of everything the lands of Catalonia and seas of the Mediterranean can provide. Best if all, it keeps with its food market intent, unlike the markets of Rome or those of the United States that seem to be turning into half flea market, souvenir, rag and trinket shops. The eyes of the fish glisten with freshness, so fresh I even saw a couple of them move. Most of the vegetables are local as are the cheeses and many of the meats. I had no trouble not only locating fresh seafood, but also being the adventurous cook that I am; I was delighted with the availability of fresh suckling pig and rabbit as well. Keep in mind, this isn't Spain, it's Catalonia as many of the vendors are quick to point out."

Spanish olives and olive oil of almost every variety are also readily available (although the Olive store in El Born has a better selection of oil) and vac-sealed for travel. We brought several of these home. Then there's jam\u00f3n - Spanish cured ham that I cannot get enough of, bacalao - the local variation of salt cod, piles of slippery fresh fish and seafood, all kinds of cheese, foie gras, produce, etc. There are also many, many tourists. It's a wonder that the market survives, but many vendors either ship outside of the market or have a chain or shops, or prepare snacks for the visitors, so I'm sure that helps. We visited several other markets in Barcelona and found them to be more pleasant to shop in, but they lack the diversity and splendour of the Boqueria."

The amount of fresh food (breads, meats, vegetables, fruits, juices, fish) is amazing. Most vendors sell foods to eat on the spot. We ate here twice for lunch. Both times my husband had fresh sushi that the vendor was cutting up on the spot. The pieces of sashimi were very large and extremely fresh and very well priced for the amount (7EU). My husband paid with 10EU and told the vendor to keep the change since he couldn't believe the high quality of the fish and this meal couldn't have been touched in NYC for under $25-$40...he thought 10EU was a steal!! I had a fresh skewer of Iberian ham for 1EU and it was amazing!!! The Catalans really take their Iberian ham serious!!! The flavor proves it!! Another day i had a fresh crepe made with serrano ham, mushrooms, carmelized onions, spinach and cheese. It was very large and definitely fresh (the vendor made it to order in front of me) and a value at $7.50EU. The fresh juices are plentiful and quite exoctic combinations. I would highly suggest stopping here early in the morning to look around and have and early lunch...later in the day is packed and stuffy!!!"

They have fulltime staff maintaining them. We travel with three small kids, so these things are important! :-). If you buy something or eat in the market, the washroom is free. Otherwise, it's one euro. So that's the deal on the washroom for all you folks that travel with small kids that only give you 3 minutes notice that they're about to pee their pants!"

On one morning there was a full tuna (they are pretty big!) being expertly dressed and the following day it was a swordfish.

Smell the flavours, enjoy the taste...And few small restaurants at the sides ...or enjoy a glass of wine and see the atmosphere from a different point of view. A must see .."

Some stalls have been in the same family for generations. Go early, say 10:00-12:00, but not too early or only about half the stalls will be open. By mid-afternoon the place will be so crowded you can barely move. Also has cafes and restaurants where you can have breakfast or lunch. Definitely worth a visit."

The market has an almost endless variety of stalls, featuring fruit, produce, seafood, cheeses, spices, and on and on. There's also stalls that prepare food. I had an excellent pasta primavera for lunch one day, and a really good slice of pizza at a different stall the next day. There's also a few tapas bars, regular bars and wine stores within the market. You could easily spend hours there.A couple of tips: It's popular with both locals and tourists, so be prepared for crowds. We were staying at Hotel Bagues a block away, so if it was too crowded we'd just come back later. Another tip is to avoid the restaurants that have tables around the perimeter of the market. These are just the back entrance to restaurants that front onto La Rambla. So you get La Rambla quality (low) and prices (high). Stick to places within the market itself; there's an enormous amount of choices there."

My first stop is a fruit stand located on the last isle on the right side, they have fresh fruit and delicious juices, the perfect treat to start out the day. The juices are 1\u20ac, get fresh fruit and not the stuff in a cup, they will cut it open for you and give you a fork or spoon to eat it. After that I always go for a sandwich with jam\u00f3n ib\u00e9rico, there is a few good places on the left side after the fish stands, they are around 2\u20ac and you can pick your ham.If you go in the early afternoon or for lunch I would recommend trying the paella, the fish is fresh and they prepare the dish in front of you, so much cheaper than in most of the restaurants and the atmosphere is just great."

We had no real need to buy anything as we were hotel based but enjoyed the experience nonetheless.We stopped at one of the seafood stalls for a bite to eat (from memory it was called Bar Central, situated opposite the entrance to the market office). We had to wait around 10 mins for seats but it wasn't a problem as we got to have a good look at the food on offer. We had the most delicious seafood platter with a plate of grilled veg and a couple of beers to wash it all down. Tasty food and a great experience overall.We also grabbed one of the fruit smoothies on our way round which were lovely for only 1euro.Good place to grab supplies for a picnic."

Fresh fruit and fish ensure the little cooked food stalls inside (and the 2 restaurants just outside the back door of the market) are filled with locals at lunch time, grabbing a variety of great value lunches for under 10 euros.Well worth a visit, but do go early, as it closes for siesta and re-opens for afternoon and evening trade. The best place to find on day 1, if renting an apartment in Barcelona. My best buy: A string of bright red dried chilli peppers, at 6 euros, which cheers up my kitchen and reminds me of sunnier climes when I'm home."

In other words, you'll see what you see in any market, what I see at least once a week in Fairway in NYC, but more cramped due to the throngs of tourists that are there to gawk but not to purchase anything other than, sometimes, the fruit juices (they are very good, indeed) or the containers with cut fruit (first rate) to eat in the Ramblas. And both you can buy in many other places that are not the hassle and waste of time that Boqueria has become over time. I think that you still should go and walk past all the stalls, if the hordes don't trample over you in the attempt, and exit at the other end and discover a beautiful courtyard with interesting architecture and restaurants."

We expected stores to be closed on the Sunday even though their economy would probably benefit from businesses being more accessible especially with so many tourists around, but we were really surprised when they were again closed on the Monday for what we discovered (too late) was the Second Easter holiday.We had not seen this mentioned in any guide books and there were no signs in stores and large markets such as this, advising of this holiday. Even the large El Corte Ingl\u00e9s store off Placa Catalunya was closed and there were no signs advising of the reason why.As a result all the shopping we did was either at small corner stores that were open and the duty free shop at the airport on the day we left."

Everything tasted wonderful! We ate most of it by hand which felt so rustic and old world. I recommend experiencing Boqueria no other way!Downside is it supposedly closes at 5pm which is sad cause it would make for a really great night market.Undoubtedly one of our favorite experiences in Europe. Once is not enough."

Main things that seemed different were (possibly to do with when we went) many meat vendors were closed, though a number of the seafood vendors were still open (with interesting things to see ... I didn't know people eat barnacles?)Beautiful displays of fruit though no little flat peaches that I saw in Summer, many years before.Beautiful displays of candied fruits and chocolates.Many different kind of juices but of the 4 or 5 I tried, they all made me wonder if they were made partially or entirely from cordials or other liquids which weren't fresh juices (it could be the time of year or the mixtures I'd picked)Nuts on display too :)I recommend the dried peaches there :)My girlfriend loved it (so did I). She took some beautiful photos :) :) :) We went back more than once and if we'd stayed in Barcelona longer than a few days (we could've if we had more time and given the option) we would've gone back even more times :)"

The market can be traced back to 1217 as an open air market. With years of development, it now has the metal roof since 1914.We all need to eat and finding food becomes more critical when you are travelling. Most of the time, it is not that easy to find a place that provides all kinds of food under one roof. La Boqueria is a unique place that not only has more food than you can imagine, but also is right in the center of the city. You can take the metro to the Liceu station (L3) and walk to this famous market. It sells hams (jam\u00f3n), fruits, meats, sausages, vegetables, fish, nuts and fresh juices. You can also buy tapas and other local food for lunch, and it is cheaper than you can get in the restaurants.This colorful market place will be in our memory for a long time. It is a place that you have to visit when in Barcelona. I bet you will go to La Boqueria not once, but many times if you stay in Barcelona for awhile."

There are bars where you can have tapas & wine. As a tourist, you can save money by eating in this market. Food is fantastic at an affordable price.

First impressions were good just looking at the vast array of fresh fruit, veg, and seafood etc, on offer. It was a joy to see oranges twice the size as i get back home, not to mention the prawns. Walking around we found it to be a bit chaotic at times due to the hundreds of tourists taking pictures and so on, a fact that wasn't lost on the traders and locals who tended to scowl at you at times, including one grumpy trader who proceeded to barge his way through the crowds with his barrow narrowly missing my legs, but did knock other tourists flying without as much as a sorry. That aside we enjoyed the fresh fruit juices 3 Euros for 2, the fast food outlets were tasty and cheap too, in fact it passed an hour or so looking at the amazing array of seafood some which was still twitching and winking at you now thats what i call fresh.! Yes i would say this is a definite visit just to see how the other half lives, the plus side here is it's free to enter and you can taste and buy just about anything that walks, swims, crawls, or fly's..The downside is the traders are not the friendliest I've met on my travels around the World and are pretty dour in my opinion and a smile here and there wouldn't have gone amiss, but if you love fruit, seafood, & chocolate then this is the place for you, and wait until you see and try the strawberries on offer pure joy i kid you not..."

It's fascinating to watch little old grandmas wield massive cleavers and hack the heads off of fish that are bigger than any I've ever seen! The variety of skinned rabbits and sheeps' heads with their eyeballs still in is...well...gross. But you can't stop looking! LOL. It makes me realize how far removed we are in the USA from where our food originates. This was the first place I got up the courage to attempt a little Spanish. With mostly hand gestures, I managed to procure just a slice of local manchego cheese and a slice of the famous jabon ham. For less than two Euros, my husband and I had an absolutely delicious snack. We also bought a fruit called a \"cherimoya,\" which I'd read about in a kid's magazine. It is very hard to ship and only grows in a few spots on the planet, Barcelona being one of them. You slice it open and eat it with a spoon, and it's creamy and sweet, like ice cream. What a great experience!"

You should wander throughout the whole complex, I'd be surprised if you don't see something for the first time after making it through - whether its Emu and Ostrich eggs or some unidentifiable sea creature. These are the ingredients- the flavors- that make up one of the world's most celebrated cuisines. It's hard walking through and not imagining what you'd cook (or would like to eat) later that day.The eating establishments within the market are all well regarded, and you will eat well there, though you will pay extra for the experience. Additionally, though this is a market, it may not be the most economical place to pick up goods to take home like saffron. Be sure to shop around within Barcelona before you commit to anything."

Had high hopes that La Bourgueria would be a world-class market, but it didn't stack up to markets in San Lorenzo in Florence, Santa Fe, NM, Portobello Road London fruit and Veg, the Ferry Building in San Francisco-- to name a few. I rated this good because of presentation and the fabulous modernist arch at the market's entry. The food is a sumptuous array, gorgeously arranged, but every stall offers the same goods. There was little variety within each class of food. Boring and over-priced with one exception: the fish looked translucent, plump fresh, but as a traveler I couldn't sample. Vendors are not simpatico as they tend to be in most markets. Very few offer samples. If we were purchasing a 90-euro ham, we would have been treated differently; in most markets that doesn't matter. You can ask questions and expect friendly responses without a purchase. Beware of hand-sliced Serrano ham. Ours was very tough. Try to sample first. Watch out with cheeses. They sell come sheep cheeses as Manchego that is some other kind (not bad, but not Manchego). Just outside the market to the right are a few produce vendors who don't have prime market real estate but whose goods are fresher and better value. The bread at the one bakery stand (near outside vendors off to the right) is outstanding and well-priced sandwiches. We got better value in the supermarkets, which are wonderful. Went to a few as we had a car. Staff in each one spoke no English but bent over backwards to help us. In Barcelona you must go to city outskirts. Pre-sliced Serrano ham was moist and delicious. Manchego was a bargain at about $3 a pound. (1/3 of a kilo?) Great for gifts like wine, olive oil, chocolate and cheese. Might not be able to get the ham on the plane because of agriculture laws. There's some way to do it, but we didn't check. The restaurants inside the market looked promising but even off season we couldn't get close to counter. Crowds 3 and 4 deep hover over diners--unlike Florence where the market restaurants frequented by tourists and locals have one line. Same great noisy energy level but without ravenous folks leaning over your shoulder while you're eating."

The first day we settled for some apricots and walnuts from one of the front stalls for our bike ride. We returned the next day to sit at one of the surrounding cafes for a coffee and quick bite for breakfast. If you happen to have the patience or good timing....grab a stool at one of the cafes towards the back of the market. These are really prime people watching spots!"

This is a great place to see all kids of local produce, some exotic, others slightly more familiar. Of course, everything is ultra-fresh (and very often alive).The little eateries offer some seating (get ready for a substantial wait) but most people just do take-away, carrying around their little trays and dishes as they browse through the market or venture into the streets of the city. The best time to visit is around lunch time.Nibbling your way through La Boqueria is the real way to taste Barcelona\u2019s food \u2013 you can meet lots of interesting locals who aggregate here eagerly, and at the same time stay very close to the center of the movida.After visiting La Boqueria we regretted we were staying at a hotel instead of renting an apartment \u2013 it would have been so fun to shop at La Boqueria and cook on our own!"

It is obviously a touristy place but it is well worth a visit. Unlike the other restaurants in this area which seem to focus on serving expensive meals to ingenuous tourists, in La Boquer\u00eda you will find a nice variety of fresh tasty products. Therefore it is probably the best place in La Rambla area to have a decent meal. Even so, the best thing about this market is its\u2019 own atmosphere. The merchants are friendly and you can even try to bargain for your favorite snack. I was lucky enough to buy six juices for two Euros at a stand about to close.Summing up I would say that instead of expecting an exotic place filled with unknown products, one should prepare himself to visit a large traditional market. It is a fact that all products available at La boquer\u00eda can be found somewhere else (and even cheaper!) but you won\u00b4t find many places with the same atmosphere."

I am 55 and been coming to Barcelona for 3 decades so I've picked up a few tips along the way. I give la boqueria 3 stars simply as it really is a must see - an institution on the Ramblas, and the iron architecture is superb.However here are some drawbacks for you:1. It's s rip off. The prices are sky high for a market - especially on the stalls nearest the front. If you must buy here go to the rear.2. It's really hard work; the crowds are immense. because of this you MUST watch your pockets and bags, and don't leave that $1000 Nikon swinging round your neck as the thieves carry blades to cut the straps3. Avoid on Spanish public holidays - it's chockaThere's a much better alternative. Go to the Mercat Santa Caterina - it's about 120 meters from the Gothic Cathedral, other side of Via Laetania....you can see its coloured wavy roof from the Cathedral square. See my photos.This modern building is stunning, there are no crowds, the prices are much better and it's more a locals' market than a tourist trap. And they've even built in roman remains in the same building.From here it's also an easy 5 minute walk to the Picasso Museumenjoy both."

Not just for show, the locals actually shop here, so watching is an adventure in itself.(Crowded, so watch your belongings too.)This market also has a roof, so you can still enjoy it if it rains - and keeps the hot sun off in the summer.A couple tips: The food and juice booths near the front and outside are a bit more expensive than those deeper into the market - but they're also a little more well known. (location, location, location)If you're purchasing seafood to cook yourself, go early in the day - the fresh stuff goes fast.We ate lunch here twice while visiting. Found a small seafood dinner all the way in the back that was fantastic! Many locals were there as well, always a good sign. We love fresh seafood, and we were NOT disappointed, great food and not overpriced.If you want baby octopus for lunch go early - it sells out very quickly. :-)"

Barcelona - Late breakfast and lunch inside the Mercat de Sant Josep de la Boqueria, in Las Ramblas. Anyone who has been to La Boqueria knows it is a gigantic, genuine riotous feast for the senses, almost an overwhelming display of the finest, freshest foodstuffs anywhere. I had never seen anything quite like it. Scattered throughout the market are more than a few places to sit down on a stool and eat, and we chose two during our visit: Pinotxo and Kiosko Universal. Both were just terrific, with fresh cooked small dishes (including some wonderful lamb skewers, gambas, and clams suggested by the wonderfully friendly owner/host/head waiter Juanito Bayen in a vest and bow tie, at the former; and razor clams, wild mushrooms, and a great grilled sole at the latter) and good cava! We would return!"

This was a great place to just wander about and let the colors, sights, sounds, and particularly near the meat/seafood stands - smells - overwhelm your senses. I had never seen such monstrous or colorful displays of fruits, veggies, candy, dried chilies and sausages, or fresh seafood in my life. A photographer could get lost finding interesting shots here and nobody seemed to mind us photographing their goods (as long as we didn't get in the way of serious shoppers). To boot, we scored an excellent deal on fresh cut fruit as it was the end of the day and the vendors were trying to unload food that might otherwise get thrown out. Don't be afraid to haggle - we ended up with boxes of fresh mango, papaya, strawberries, melon and coconut for just 3 euros. I loved the variety of cheeses being sold - though I don't think we got nearly as good a deal at that stand, the kindly vendors did give us several free samples so we could select just the right cheese to go with our meal. This did seem like an ideal location for pick-pockets so keep your valuables sealed up and secured. Also it was packed and some of the aisles were quite narrow which may be troublesome if you have a stroller or wheelchair."

We were flabbergasted to see all the good fresh juices, fish, meats, sweets, spices and the most amazing fruit. We just love sea food and had we been in a self catering cottage we would definitely have bought some. There is so much to buy that it is rather difficult deciding what you really want to eat. Everything is so beautifully arranged and the colours very inviting. One can easily spend a lot of money in a couple of minutes. I would recommend going to the market early as we found it very busy round lunch time. I would also recommend a quick walk through the market as prices vary and then one also has an idea what is available in this huge market.Do not miss it ....... You will LOVE IT!!!!!"

Many places have overpriced food, awful service and turist traps (such as surprises in the bill). Particularly avoid Bar Central, where I was told by the bartender to leave my seat after having waited more than 40 minutes for it, simply because she wanted other people to sit there and they had just arrived at that moment! When questioned she yelled \u201cThis is my place so I can do what I want\u201d. Look at her picture menacing us with a nife to leave....

The prices do seem to be higher at the front of the market so if you are looking to buy head further back.I've been to other Spanish markets in Madrid, Valencia, Bilbao and Malaga and this is by far the largest with the widest amount of choice. It is probably also the most touristy though and this is probably reflected in the prices and the feeling that there are far few locals shopping in there than the other markets.We've sat at the bars and had breakfast and would recommend this as well.Overall it is a must visit if you like your food and the choice is unbelievable."

Because all the tours, tourists and photographers tend to congregate in the front, making it impossible to maneuver. One STEAL inside the mercat, for sure is the zumo's (fresh juices). 2+ euro out in the regular commerce, Mercat sells the deliciously freshly squeezed addictive and refreshing concoctions for 1.5 euros. Now if you MUST shop, take the metro over to Mercat San Antoni - locals, locals, locals, and far cheaper goodies than Boqueria, and another people watching, more \"real populos\" feel to it."

My advice is go before 9:00 in the morning. It gets very busy later in the day, and it is harder to get around and you are a greater risk of having your pocket picked. I found the vendors more interested in talking before the crowds got to busy. Lunch at El Quim is definitly a good idea. He has a stall located fairly centrally in the market, and the food was great...albeit priced in line with what tourists will pay. Go with the lower priced dishes and forgo the more highly priced menu items. You'll have a great time."

It was founded around 1200 AD.It is surprising just about anything, from a rich range and finishing with a huge number of visitors, most of which are not typical consumers, but rather come here to enjoy the great atmosphere and to capture on camera the beauty of the local stalls.Just think, every day the market goes up to 27 000 kinds of products. If you compare this market with European counterparts, the nearest worthy competitor will be only in Paris, even though prices are considerably higher.The market is open daily, except Sunday. Its doors are open from seven in the morning, but most sellers start their work after eight hours.Its convenient location (near the central streets of La Rambla) makes it extremely convenient to visit. It is perfect for breakfast, enjoy the taste of exotic juices, and taste the local variety of donuts (churros).Huge selection of various fruit platter will delight you with its low price and freshness.The market occupies an area of \u200b\u200babout 1600 m \u00b2. Market building was built of steel and glass, decorated with mosaic elements.Often, the local products are packaged in such a way that the pass is almost impossible.You can also use the services of local eating houses, where you will cook almost anything that can be found on the market. This may be a fish and meat, and seafood. It all depends on your desire.Special pride of Spain is the jamon. If you prefer, you immediately it narezhut. Sliced \u200b\u200bjamon is a whole show, usually, the seller receives from this particular pleasure."

La Bouqueria Market is a great place to shop if you are staying in an apartment in Barcelona for the duration of your stay. It is crowded on weekends so weekdays is preferable.

Go early in the morning. Avoid the time when tourists jam the aisles and turn into a real nuisance. Be considerate; people work there and work hard so that you can marvel at all the amazingly array of fresh produce, all of the highest quality. My suggestion, as a Barcelona Tour Guide, is go with as purpose. Shop. Have breakfast or lunch in any of the several excellent bars you'll find inside. Forget about \"Pinotxo\", the one you see on your right as you the market from the Ramblas. The little and always cramped place has become so popular that now everything in the menu is over-priced and the service is terrible. Most importantly, visit this market ONLY if you don't have the time to visit others. Mercat de la Llibertat, in the barrio de Gracia, is another lovely and less known - and like Boqueria, Modernist period. Right next to it, outside thre premises, you have the bar La Pubilla. This is one place you cannot miss if you are looking for place to have a proper bite. The chef there manages to produce the most outstanding food for a bargain price!"

Sure, markets similar to this exist in the U.S., but I have never seen the variety - including tripe and sheep heads with eyeballs! It is packed in there, so watch your belongings. You will get jostled.We loved the variety and prices of the fresh fruit and went back several times just for that."

As we stepped inside we immediately noticed the fresh scents and deep colours of the fruit and vegetables - and the sheer size of them compared with what we usually buy in the supermarket at home! Further inside, in separate sections, are stalls selling fresh (still moving!) seafood, meats, cheeses, chocolate, sweets and spices. We visited twice: lunchtime and late afternoon the following day. Both times the market was bustling with tourists and locals. We sampled strawberry juice ( 1 euro) and a packed fruit salad (2 euros) and both tasted just as fresh as they looked.This is soooo worth a visit - it doesn't cost anything to enter and look around, and it's an easy detour when you visit the Ramblas!"

In here, you\u2019ll find a sea of colorful stalls, so even if you don\u2019t plan on buying anything, it\u2019s still a great place to go, although I recommend you take your time and enjoy the little bars. If you plan on buying anything else, take the time to check the prices at the other stalls, as they may vary a bit."

Breakfast every morning here (the bread feels like it\u2019s out of the oven straight into our mouths) is a must. La Boqueria\u2019s best feature may be its huge fresh Seafood Section. However, other food items are also available. For example: many kiosks sell typical Catalan and Spanish foods, including famous Iberian hams.This is one of my favourite places in Barcelona.

Am a fan of local farmers' markets anyway, but this place has so much character, not to mention an amazing selection of what's local and fresh, that it's worth a visit even if you're not doing your grocery shopping. With the added attraction of stands that serve prepared food as well as beer and wine, this is your meal and entertainment all in one. Don't just pass through the front near Ramblas, if you wander further back, you find better prices and more local flavor. Also, after finding fresh produce missing from many restaurant menus, this was paradise!"

The food is good, but the problem is he charges exorbitant prices! We ordered prawns (or gambas) and had to pay 17 Euros for 4 medium-sized prawns. The same story with the calamares...........People sitting next to us were shocked to see the bill, and they queried Juan. He simply ignored themBe aware: The price board is hidden high up the ceiling behind bottles of wine. These are not the prices of a full meal, but of a small portion (tapas)"

The juices are great though - try the coconut and mango! Open 8am-8pm, Mercat de la Boqueria is a great place to get your picnic ingredients. Every day for 8 days myself and my husband bought a big loaf of baker's bread, 100g of jamon serrano, 2 peaches and 6 figs for less than \u00a310, which set us up for breakfast and lunch. The only negative was that some stalls were closed for the 'vacaciones' - native Barcelonians tend to escape the city in August due to the heat!

The smells of meat, cheese, fish and fruit makes you really believe you are in a market of style. And you are - big time! My biggest regreat is that we lived in a hotelroom and not an apartment as I would have loved to be able to buy alot of special goods.Our favourite was the fruitshakes that are sold at almost every fruitvendor stand. For 1,50 Euro you get a cup of your favorite fruits mixed. My personal favorite is the fresa/coco (strawberry/coconut). The only downside to this is that the vendors are very often stressed and therefor seem a bit tired and cranky."

For those who aren't aware, it's a tapas bar in the Boqueria Market. I would guess that it fits about 15 people and there are usually a few small groups of people waiting. We were lucky enough to get seats the first time we came... we were greeted by the man himself who suggested we take the chick peas and the baby squids. The chick peas were excellent and had a \"familiar\" taste that was easy to enjoy. The baby squids, perfectly cooked, were served with beans. The flavour of the dish was good and it actually grows on you (well, me, at least). We were so impressed by the experience that we went back after 2 days. The place was very busy and were afraid we wouldn't get a seat. Mr. Pinotxo recognized us and informed us that a specific group of people were ending their meal soon and that the spot would be ours. This second time around, we also had the baby squid but we took the beef stew (they were out of chick peas). Both dishes were amazing once again. We then proceeded to ordering desert which was some kind of \"flanc\"-type dish made with cheese. He also included two extra pieces of desert, compliments of the house. ALL deserts were fabulous. It was a perfect end to a vacation in Barcelona.It's normal to be confused when you first get there, especially when you have to fight for a seat. We had no idea as to what they served and how much it cost. Even after our second visit, we didn't know much more. The idea is to talk it out.. even though not everyone is perfectly fluent in english, they are extremely helpful.This place is a MUST."

After we booked our trip to Barcelona I looked for places to eat and I found that everybody recommends this market because one can find good food at good prices. We went there as soon as we arrived for lunch and bought a juice first (2.50 euro) and then waited to get a seat at a food bar situated at the back of the market. Since it was crowded and all the names were in catalan we just ordered two plates of baby octopus and a glass of sangria each. My husband got also bacalau (cod) fritters which came two on a plate. Sangria came from a big plastic container and the glass size was on the small size. The octopuss came only with a small piece of bread and a wedge of lemon and it was delicious. The cod fritters had pieces of cod and were great. The bill at the end was 47 euro and I can hardly call theis reasonable or cheap for a market. The market was very crowded and we had to watch our pockets.We bought two chocolate truffles (2 euro each, of normal size) which were nice visual but below average taste. I considered them a ripoff in the end. One of the mornings we got each a fruit salad that was nice and fresh for 2 or 2.50 euro.If you visit Barcelona you shoul definitly go to the Mercat de la Boqueria at least for the visual effect but don't expect to eat cheap as is suggested in reviews."

The displays of fruit and sweets are bright and colourful and the fish market is amusing. However, this is the place where I felt most at risk in Barcelona, it is a very tight space and you can feel claustrophobic and at risk of pickpockets. We did purchase some of the fruits annd sweets and found that the fruit wasn't as tasty as it looked and the sweets (pick and mix) were very highly priced. A small bag can cost about 17 euros!! I also thought that there wasn't as large a range of stalls as I would have hoped for. There was alot of the same stalls repeated and no bread or pastry stalls. The best value item was the fruit juices at 1 euro."

The lively atmosphere and the fresh fruits, dried fruits , fruit juices, sandwiches, nuts , cheese, seafood , meat ( fresh and cured ) , bread and pastries displayed in this market are breathtaking. I had read a lot and seen a lot of the Mercat in travel programmes prior to the trip and was worried that I had my expectations set too high. I am happy to report that it exceeded my expectations! The Mercat despite its tourist crowd ( the prices are not rock bottom) is still frequented by locals and is still retains its Spanish vibe.Pinotxo BarHence when you sit for your breakfast at Pinotxo Bar ( the first bar to your right at the entrance of the Mercat ) for example, you will be brushing shoulders with the locals who are having a quick coffee with Spanish pastries or sausages before rushing off to work. You will also meet Mr Pinotxo who beside making very good coffee is an institution himself. He was very friendly and this was apparent although he did not speak much English . The food was simply heaven.El Quim De La BoqueriaThe other unforgettable meal we had in the Mercat was at El Quim De La Boqueria. After a tiring morning of sight seeing, we went there to look for lunch. We decided to try another tapas bar although Pinotxo was open. We discovered El Quim nestled amongst the meat stalls in the middle of the Mercat. The long queue of locals waiting patiently for a bar stool convinced us to try.We tried dishes which sounded impossible, like baby squids grilled in their ink and some flaked salted fish served on soft scrambled eggs on the suggestion of a new found friend, he himself a restaurant owner from out of town. Everything was fresh and scrumptious. Hardly surprising as the cooks just stepped next door to get the fish , meat and vegetable whenever they ran out!We also had our breakfast at El Quim on our last day in Barcelona which evolved from coffee with churros to a full blown meal as we could not resist the fresh produce !Next door, there is an ice cream stall that sold scrumptious gelatos!Definitely a must for foodies and aspiring cooks!

There are three or four small bars serving food there, but La Boqueria is mainly a food marked, with sections dedicated to fruit, sea food and fish, meat (beware of the offals sold there, if your stomach is weak look away as you risk seeing tongues, sheep heads, cow stomachs etc.), nuts and sweets. I loved the smoothies (but don't buy those by the entrance, those are cheaper but watery, walk two-three rows into the marked to buy real ones, with no water added) and fruit salads. In the afternoon the fruit stalls sell out the salads at reduced prices. Don't buy the chocolates, they are overpriced! The same chocolates, 50% cheaper, are sold all over the town at specialist shops or cafes. Don't visit at lunch time, the marked is horribly overcrowded then. Forget about getting a seat at one of the bars, unless you wait a long time."

Some of the produce stands had blended fruit drinks that were DELICIOUS! Cheapest way to eat in Barcelona, and you get to rub elbows with the locals and soak up atmosphere to boot. One caution, there's VERY few seats and it is considered rude to walk and eat at the same time. So take your food to a bench on Las Ramblas, or stand and eat, using a barrel from the wine shop as a table, like we did."

We wanted somewhere with living objects where we can see moving things, hear and feel the surroundings, smell food, titillate our senses and yet carry a Barcelonian flavour. We found it in St. Josep La Boqueria.La Boqueria was a robust combustion of sounds and colours that lit up our morning. The colourful stalls were classified by categories - fruit, candies, chocolates, nuts, mushrooms, poultry, seafood etc. As you trudged through the scores of stalls, it was impossible not to be impressed by the selections displayed right before your eyes. In my country, no one sells chocolates or gummies in a marketplace and certainly not one that has as much mouthwatering effect as this. A word of warning - in places like these where everything turned out gorgeous on the camera, you might want to prepare an extra battery as more likely than not, you will definitely go trigger-happy! (It will be sad when you find out that you suddenly run out of lithium battery halfway through other places of interest)Since I come from Asia where euros are more than twice my own currency, things are expensive but it did not stop me from buying some chocolates (calculated by weight), trying the freshly squeezed juice to say I've been there and done that!

There must have been every size, shape and color of mushrooms, meats of every kind, exotic fresh fruit (and fresh juices of every variety. I had the fresh-squeezed, iced cold kiwi-mango for about $1.50) and every kind of vegetable imaginable. If you're not into buying, go for the amazing photo ops. It's located at Placa Bouqueria, right off the Las Rumbas. Ask anyone for directions. Then, make sure to walk the medieval section (Barri Gotic) of Barcelona. No cars can be driven there as the streets are quite narrow. It's amazingly beautiful. Again, we stumbled into another great place - Zim. It's small, no tiny is a better word, the proprietor is so hospitable and the wines are fantastic - all small batch wines, carefully selected. Reasonable prices also.We couldn't resist bringing home a bottle by the name of Zorzal."

One of the very coolest things to do in Barcelona, especially if you love food, is to come to this market, a feast for all of the senses. An astounding array of meats, fruits, cheeses, seafood, spices, nuts, wine, oil, and prepared foods to boot. Crazy amounts of color, bring your camera!We had a lunch at the Bar Pinxto, one of the little tapas bars inside the Market, that was highly recommended on many blogs and also on Mario Batali's \"Spain show\". Let me tell you, it was the best food we had in Barcelona, simply unbelievable! There's no menu, you just sit down and point to dishes that other people are eating or that you see behind the glass. But they are all amazing, so you can't go wrong. And you can wash it down with a three Euro glass of Cava. The lunch was kinda pricey, but sooooo worth it. Come to the Boqueria for your souvenir and gift shopping the day you leave. Best of all, stock up on bread, good spanish cheese like Manchego, and some unforgettable Jamon (a nice vendor, and there are about 40 jamon vendors here, you can sample different types to pick your favorite) so that you can make yourself one last awesome spanish meal on the plane ride home!"

On my last day in Barcelona (second trip there in two years) I made the mistake of buying Jamon Serrano and some Lomo at the store that sits directly in the entrance of the Boqueria - on the right hand side as you walk in. The gentleman behind the counter gave me a couple of samples and then vacuum-packed the jamon and lomo I purchased. When I got back to New York City, I found that the jamon (about $40 worth) was so full of gristle and tendon that it was literally not chewable. It was also horribly over salted. I took the lomo to work a couple of days after I got back. The folks I shared it with thought it smelled funny. Now, I've been to Barcelona several times in the last few years. I know the Boqueria is a rip-off to purchase things like olive oil (you'll find the same bottles in El Cortes Ingels for almost half the price). But this was a real shock - to go through what I'm guessing was a bait and switch operation - from a key store in the Boqueria. I ended up throwing out the entire chunk of jamon. It was disgusting and literally inedible. Spain has been hit hard by the worldwide economic recession. But there is no excuse for selling junk like this. I wouldn't take the time to seek out travel boards to warn other customers unless this was truly a situation to avoid at all costs. The sad thing is that a few feet further into the Boqueria, you'll encounter Pinnochio's Bar (Pinoxtle). There you will find some of the best food you can get in the entire city."

This is undeniably an exciting place and a foodie's dream, but understand that as a fixture just steps from Las Ramblas -- the premium tourist promenade in Barcelona -- this market is packed, more expensive than other markets, and the quality of what you purchase may in some instances not be what you would find for a cheaper price in a less touristy part of the city (Gracia, for example, has a few very good markets that are similar to La Boqueria and feel more like authentic Barcelona.) Having said that, you will find all kinds of cool photo ops in La Boqueria -- from the mountain of deep red tomatoes to the lamb's head with the eyes bulging out. It would be crazy to visit Barcelona and not stop by this market -- fight for a seat at one of the stands and order something adventurous. Wash it down with an Estrella, Barcelona's official beer.

It's cool, but after you walk down 3 or 4 aisles, they begin to look the same.There are fruit sellers, nut stands, seafood counters, bakeries, and a few stands I wish we had missed - including some sheep heads and things of that nature! Prices vary slightly between the first stands you see when you enter (more expensive) and when you are deeper into the middle of the market (cheaper). However, the price variation is minimal, perhaps 25 cents difference on a fruit salad.We had a \"picnic\" style lunch, grazing as we wandered down the aisles and snacking on fruits, fresh squeezed juices, nuts, cheese, bread...you'll have plenty to eat for only 10\u20ac. There are also cafes with bar-style seating if you'd like a hot dish prepared for you (more expensive) - some smelled great.We did not spend long here because every fruit stand looked the same as the next (and similar for every seafood stand...). Planning a \"meal\" here made it much more fun, giving you a chance to sample the different foods instead of just browsing.Just a tip: before you enter, put about 10 euro in coins in your pocket in order to easily access to pay for your snacks. La Boqueria is VERY crowded and if you are fiddling with a wallet or purse, you could easily be pickpocketed. Keep one hand in your pocket with the coins and the other hand on your bag."

We agree that La Boqueria is a must visit at least once to see all the variety and magnificent arrays of colours of fruits, vegies, nuts, spices, lollies, fish, meat, etc. However when we do actually buy something we got mixed experience, some taste as good as they looked, some were really dud.The strawberries and watermelons we bought were absolutely delicious, we must have come at the right season for those. The cherries were also pretty good but you do get more of a mix bag, some really good, some not so.Don't expect to get what you see on the displayed stack. They put the perfect looking ones for display and give you something else from a different batch including ones that weren't so good. They're cheeky those sellers. They're there to make money I guess.The fruit bowls are also pretty good way to taste different kinds of fruits, but again they always include some dud ones in the pack. The fruit juices were good but not always.Don't bother with the chocolates stand near the entrance. They charge \u20ac65/kg and the price sign wasn't displayed properly either. We picked only 3 items and was charged over \u20ac7! We didn't end up buying them, but there will be those who get sucked in feeling bad for not paying.There were no real restaurants per se when we were there. Only a bar at the back of the market which seems to always be packed with people and long queues. After waiting a long while for seats, when there were seats vacated, we were rudely told that those are reserved for the staff who at that time hadn't had lunch yet. But they had no courtesy of telling us beforehand and spare us the wait, so we left and never come back.Overall, mixed experience, not always good, but the fruits were pretty good and reasonably priced."

From the moment you enter the market there is much to desire. We ate at one of the lunch counters in the back of the market and enjoyed a great seafood platter. However, be prepared to wait! it is worth it. the famous Pinotxo lunch counter is harder to get a seat at and was always crowded even in november when the number of tourists are smaller. Don't go to a restaurant when you can come here for one of the best lunches Barcelona has to offer."

It actually feels very artistic, with arranging the freshest food in the most aesthetically pleasing way, to appeal to the customer. So I'd recommend a walk through even if you THINK you aren't going to buy anything (but the fresh fruit is so tempting...). Buying fresh healthy food like this is probably why the Catalonians seem so beautiful and healthy themselves!"

La Boqueria is probably one of the most enjoyable and impressive markets we have visited. Focused on food, this market will entice, and possibly assault, one or all of your senses. Through the 100+ stalls, you will see virtually every kind of food stuff know to people. A rainbow of fruit and veggies. Meats of almost any kinds - some of which you will recognize in their natural form. If it comes from the sea and can be eaten, it will probably be found here. I've known about barnacles, but did not know you can eat them. Yup, you can. Spices, prepared foods, nuts, candies, wine, beer and much more. I recommend that everyone visiting Barcelona take some time and visit the market. Sit down at one of the cafes' in the back and have a coffee and some snacks. This market will not only entertain you, but you will probably learn something as well."

The prices are good, the fruit is about average, sometimes below average. However, there are lots of other nice food joints, esp. a seafood stand which was very crowded (avg prices). There's a tapas style restaurant in the back which was good, and the seafood seemed very fresh.All in all, if you're at Ramblas, make a stop. It's not a must-see or must-eat."
