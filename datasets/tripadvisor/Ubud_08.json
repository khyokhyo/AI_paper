However it was lots of fun on the river and our guide H. Ayong was very entertaining and extremely helpful. The scenery is stunning. If you have not done any rafting before I highly recommend doing this - be prepared for a long trek down and 'not quite' as long trek back up."

            "review": "Cheap rafting tour offering a good (but not great) experience. I have rated this tour as Very Good as I think it was more than Average (i.e. three stars) - although four stars is probably generous! We were picked up from our hotel and dropped to the Graha location where you pay for your tour, sign your life away and also there is free water and tea and coffee on offer. We were then kitted out and jumped on a truck to the drop off point. You then take a nice walk through the rice paddies and then begin your descent (via some muddy and uneven steps) to the river. This walk was fine for our group as we were all relatively fit but it would be tricky with young children. However, I was advised by the guide to where my flip flops rather than trainers and, given the mud, this was very bad advice!We were given a short safety briefing on the water's edge and we then set off for our two our tour down the rapids - having not done white water rafting before, I really enjoyed the experience - it is a relatively tame and an enjoyable ride. Our guide was ok - he spoke quite quietly and it was hard to hear his instructions as we rode along. Also, when my husband fell in the water he told was almost reprimanded for 'not being focused' - he certainly wasn't trying to fall in! It made us laugh but could have been a bit harsh for other guests. We stopped on the bank halfway through where locals were selling beer and cans of soft drink and then headed back on the water. After finishing the rafting, we then hiked back up to the top of the trail to where the van was waiting for us - again this is steep hike which might not be good for kids but took our group no more than 10 minutes. We then headed back to base where we were given fresh towels to dry off and plastic bags for wet gear. There were showers and changing rooms but after reading bad reviews of these on here, I didn't venture in. Same goes for the food, we had heard bad things so headed back to Ubud for lunch!Overall we had a good day but there is definitely room for improvement!"

We were splashing water at each other, trying to outrow others, and our guide would sometimes deliberately bump other boats for them to get stuck. The course was great for beginners like me & my friends. There were enough bumps/rapids to keep the ride exciting. I actually fell off the boat but it was all good. I had my floating vest & helmet on so no worries. Hahaha.(Going down to the river & going back up, now that's a different story! EXHAUSTING!)"

The cycling commenced from near the top of the local volcano and was all downhill for about 25km/2.5hours along quiet back roads and paths. A relaxed way to experience the Bali culture and people.Throughly recommended.Small roads are rough and bumpy and paths through paddy fields muddy at times, but I personally enjoyed the experience."

Rapids are not too big, but enough for a few spills & thrills.The Ayu river is busy with lots of companies, but am glad to have chosen Graha - good safety briefing, clear instructions thoughout from the guide, good midway stopping point (take cash!), and delicious meal at the end."

We met a lovely british couple who we shared a boat with.The best part was the company of the other rafters and the guides! We were joined by a massive group of other rafters which made it fun (having friendly competition and immature water/splashing fights during the journey) and the guides were very charismatic. They tried their best to make the ride funny and enjoyable! It was raining the day we did the rafting but the rain made it more fun :)The track of the rafting itself is quite easy with small rapid waves and nothing too intense (if you are looking for an intermediate and more fun/adrenaline rushing rafting, try telega waja!). The worse thing about this was having to climb down massive amounts of steps and at the end having to climb back up to get to the original place. It is quite inconvenient and tiring. Likewise facilities there are average, not the best.But overall I felt the positive points outweigh the negative in my personal opinion."

Our guide made sure we had a safe, enjoyable and memorable trip. The jungle through which we rafted was beautiful, around Ayung River. A word of warning - there are lots of steps down to the river and of course returning back up, which may be difficult for those who are unfit or who have any mobility issues. The showers are very basic as is to be expected perhaps in this kind of activity. I'd advise taking your own soap and shampoo, unless you're fine with the liquid general soap/shampoo they provide. The food for lunch was limited but fine. I hasn't expected a fine dining experience.Would definitely recommend this activity."

Our guide was very nice and funny even though he spoke very basic english. The experience is ok for everybody, even first timers because river Ayung is quite mellow after all and the rapids are doable and not so intense! I suffer cool and humidity so I did everything with trousers and t-shirt (but swimsuit underneath). Be sure you have a change of clothes with you and when you finish they give you towels and plastic bags for your wet clothes. Something I didn't do but I saw others doing it: you can carry you mobile with you (better if you also have a plastic bag) since every guide has an impermeable bag in which you can put the things you want to carry with you during rafting. You generally have a pause in the middle of the road and you mat want to pull your mobile out for some pictures!Ps: we got to Ubud white water with our driver and had lunch before so we got them to lower the price.Mind that they usually make you pay also for transfer and lunch, so if you don't need it...bargain!"

A great tour for the price and it came with a decent buffet lunch. I think Graha launch was the furthest up the river than most rafting tour, which gave us 15 minutes more time on the river. Our guide Marty was great and he allow us to jump in the river just before we reached the waterfall photo stop to cool off."

They had a great time, the guide was good and the rapids (at this time of year) gentle enough for them. However the company and operations themselves were badly organised, especially considering its not cheap. There was a lot of waiting around for the truck to take you to the start of the rafting and pick you up at the end. You have to endure a halfway stop during the rafting where you will be pressure sold overpriced drinks and made to feel guilty that you are not supporting the locals if you don't - considering we had just paid almost $200 to the rafting company we found this a bit rich. Perhaps the rafting company would like to pay its people better. Same problem at the end of the trip when you are pressured into tipping the guide. The changing facilities at the centre were grim and the lunch was almost as grim."

The Graha team was excellent in their preparedness and were friendly and knowledgeable. They come with a deep sense of respect for the river and nature, to this point I observed each of the guides praying to the raft and the river for everyone's safety. They do provide lunch and vegetarian options were good. Be prepared for a good walk and down and up a very large number of stairs to the river. I would highly recommend the trip, it was great day and nice safe adventure for us."

            "review": "Must do in Bali!. White water rafting the Ayung River was one of the highlights of our trip to Bali. We booked with Graha through Panji (of Bali Safest Driver fame), who got us a good price. Graha was late to pick us up (an hour) but it was largely due to inconsiderate guests that the driver had to pick up before us. When our driver did arrive, he was friendly and helpful. The vehicle was clean, comfortable and air-conditioned.When we arrived at Graha there were so many people, the situation seemed quite chaotic. However, our guide, Rico, immediately found us, seated us, and proceeded to kit us out for the rafting, even buckling up our life jackets and helmets for us. Rico was a delight throughout the day - such a rascal! We were lucky to share the raft with three great solo travelers which made the experience all the more memorable.The rafting isn't particularly difficult - I would easily recommend it for families and first-time river rafters. The route is beautiful - lush jungle, ancient reliefs carved out of the cliff faces - and the waterfall was definitely a highlight! Lunch is average but you are welcome to dish up a second plate. For the elderly or infirm - beware. There are a lot of steps on your way down and back up again. We enjoyed the extra bit of exercise, but I imagine it may be a bit too much for some."

However, we could see rubbish and plastic waste all over the river. Funny to ask ourselves why the locals and the companies who use the river for profit don't clean it. Our guide was okay, but every stop he almost forced us to buy him a beer or something from the locals. I understand, the locals depend on that, nevertheless I am keening to help as I want to, and not because someone is forcing myself. A bit annoying this kind of situation when you are on holiday mood. Food in the end was okay, but the staff as well want you to get out as soon as possible."

My boyfriend and I booked a trip through Graha Rafting after we originally booked with Go Voyagin who we waited all day for to pick us up, tried calling, they never even picked up and then tried to put the blame on someone else. So we booked with Graha Rafting through our hotel which worked out perfectly. We had a private driver who even was 15 minutes early and we got a better price. We had a hilarious guide who made sure the trip was extra fun for everyone. All the other rafts were \"enemies\" so as soon as we got close enough we had good fun with water fights and pushed our way ahead. We had a couple of stops along the way like a beautiful waterfall and a small area where you could buy beers and fresh coconuts, there was also a large rock (2 meters high) you could jump off of when everyone cheered you on! Before we got to some of the stops our guide asked us to jump in the water and just float down (refreshing and so much fun!) There was also at some points he just asked us to stand up and try to keep out balance. It wasn't the craziest rapids but with all the beautiful scenery and fun with the other rafts there was never a boring moment!"

Their equipment, life vest, helmet etc was well maintained. not old and mouldy like i always encounter elsewhere. I brought my 60 yr old mum to try out water rafting in Bali, however what we didn't knew was there was gonna be a trek down steep, uneven and slippery steps. As my mother had weak legs, our guide was patient as he held on to my mother from behind and slowly climbed down the 600plus steps with her. The water rafting ride itself is a great experience as there were many rapids along the 12km route. It was fun albeit abit dangerous but once you get the hang of it, it shouldn't be a problem for most people. Even my 60yr old mum gave the thumbs up for it. After the ride, we had to climb back up about 400 steps but this time it was more even. the guide once again patiently held my mother and made their way back up. Always wearing a smile and encouraging her. At no point did he show any displeasure that we were so slow and troublesome. Visited April 2016."

Took part in this mornings white water rafting with Graha Adventure, there were six of us in our party and I won't lie, we were a little nervous as none of us have done this before BUT there was nothing to worry about, we were picked up at our hotels taken to the centre where they issued us with life jackets, safety hats and paddles, there are lockers to put your things in. We were then introduced to our guide 'Alex' then climbed on the back of trucks similar to small army trucks and driven to the top of the ravine, this may sound a little odd but this is a white water rafting adventure, not a soft play centre, we drove for approx 15 mins. There are many steps climbing down to the water but we took it steady and it all added to the adventure.Before we were able to get on the boats Alex gave instructions on how he was going to guide us in the water and what he wanted us to do, which was clear and precise.The rafting was absolutely fantastic we had so much fun, there were a couple of stops to have a quick swim and a longer one where they served drinks, you can pay the ladies there or give it to the guide at the end if you left your money at the start.Alex was a fantastic guide making things interesting and exciting even pointing out points of interest on the way. It poured with rain just after half way but this made things even more exciting.'If your not wet your not having fun' we raced the other boats and everyone joins in having water fights.Again at the end there are loads of steps back up to the top which seem to go on forever but no one is rushed, just take it steady.A short ride back on the truck to the centre, warm clean towels are provided to dry off and a simple but welcome meal is included and water.Photos and videos are taken by a photographer all the way round and can be purchased at very reasonable prices in various formats. This trip was the best thing I've done in Bali !"

It started to rain 2/3 down river which just added to the experience. Stops along the way for photos and drinks. There are lots of steps down and up from the river, but nothing too strenuous if you're in decent shape. Lunch afterwards was simple but tasty, catering for veggies too. One of the many highlights of our trip. Just remember to check out the prices, we were originally quoted 800,000, then offered a 'special price' of 400,000 but actually paid 300,000"

I would definitely not take children under 12. It is very physical and somewhat a dangerous environment for smaller children.There is quite a walk at the start to get to the river, down some fairly steep and not very level steps, you will need to be of fair agility to make it down.The ride along the river is serene and beautiful. There is not a lot of white water but for us it was still fun. We took photo stops at the waterfall and stopped at the obligatory shop where you can buy drinks snacks and souvenirs.There were only 4 of us in our raft plus our guide/instructor. he was very nice and helpful. The rafting itself is hard work, after 2.5 hours I was exhausted. Yes at the end there are stairs, a lot of stairs, stairs that go on forever it seems, probably more so because you are already tired from paddling. You just have to get over it and eventually you will reach the top.There are showers and a feed included in our package. Simple food but tasty after such a workout.Reality is I have no complaints, it was a fun day out. Maybe a little long for me I reckon 1.5 hours would be enough but that is more a general observation than a complaint."

Our hotel's rafting trip was much more expensive, so our driver arranged for us to go rafting with Graha. I thought the price was fair, and it was about a 2 hour float down the river. The intensity of the rafting was great for me. some rapids, but nice floating at other times... What I was not prepared for, or even warned about, was the very steep rugged climb down the mountain to the river where the rafts were waiting, or the many steep steps we had to climb after the rafting trip was over. I wish I would have know about the steep climbs before. May not be suitable for non-athletic people"

As others have mentioned, there is quite a hike down to Ayung River and as each company has its own passageway, Graha's is definitely not the shortest and the tracking down was not quite a walk in the park. However, going up was fine as it was far shorter and there were proper concrete stairs. The bathroom and shower facilities were pretty rudimentary, but as they say, you get what you pay for."

As others have noted, the stairs are pretty arduous, both at the beginning (yes, we worked up a huge sweat going DOWN!) and the end. But we checked out a few other rafting companies' bases, since our hotel was near them, and all of them involved a climb down into the valley and a climb out, so it's not just Graha. If you can't handle a steep descent and a long climb, maybe Ubud rafting isn't for you.Our guide was Agung (like the river), and was fun and hard-working. The river was not too cold and not too fast, fine for a mellow afternoon in Ubud. Good value for money.Lunch at the base at the beginning and end was no great shakes. Buffet dishes of cheap stuff, served up by bored staff. If you're not on the tightest budget imaginable, give the buffet a miss and have a cheap meal at any warung. You'll be happier."

We had so much fun with this and our guide was amazing, though I really really wish they had warned us about the very steep and long descent down big steps to the river. I have a bad knee and was in agony going down the crazy steps let alone back up. If I had of known about this part I probably wouldn't have gone as I spent the day worrying about my knee.Aside from that though all was really good. Our guide was really friendly and helpful and most importantly fun! All the other guides on other boats were fun too and seemed as though everyone was laughing and having a good time.The river itself wasn't too crazy so not a big adrenaline fuelled activity but still flowing enough to be fun and a little rush at times. Scenery along the river was so incredibly beautiful and a highlight of our trip for sure.I did this same thing in Thailand and it was like 20 minutes then over so this was much better going for close to 2 hours I think and also got a Chance to hop out the boat and swim in the river and under waterfalls. Got to stop half way for a drink and to jump off a big rock into the deep part of the river. Also, linch was really nice when we got back.As long as you're okay with the stairs then would definitely recommend."

We took our kids aged 12,14, 16 and they loved it. Safety and paddling gear is all in good order, instructions were clear and the guide made sure we knew what we were doing before we took off. That said, although we did what he told us, he definitely did all the hard work! There are three stops along the way, first to see some amazing rock carvings, then at a waterfall, and lastly at a point where you can have a Bintang or a water/soft drink and a snack if you wish, or jump off some rocks into deep water, or just chill for 10 minutes or so. The guides all have double layer waterproof bags if you want to bring your camera and they are very careful to make sure its securely fastened in the boat while you are rafting.The guides are all young, very fit and strong men with a great sense of fun - NO WET, NO FUN is the slogan. So, prepare to get wet...very, very wet. Either from going over rapids or being splashed by other boats or from your guide steering your boat \"accidentally\" under a waterfall. Excellent!The included lunch at the end was a huge buffet, kids had double helpings, great food and no complaints. The obligatory photographer who captures you is not pushy and the photos are Rp150,000 for everything he takes of your boat (30-50 photos).Only downside was having to walk down a steep hill to reach the river side then all the way back up again at the end of the rafting. It's quite a hike but you can take as long as you need so don't panic (10-20 minutes walk depending on how fit you are). Runners are probably your best footwear option and as the guides have waterproof bags you can wear them for walking then have them put into the bag while you raft. They do hint that you should tip your rafting guide - we gave ours Rp50,000 at the end and he seemed very happy with that.Overall excellent value for money."

Both my partner and I jave been rafting years ago with another company and enjoyed it (cant remember the name wish I did so we could have returned). The rafting itself was ok despite low water levels. The service however was terrible. We arrived to no hello just name date and sign. Then given a jacket, hemlet and paddle. We weren't spoken to or told anything about what was around us and what to expect at the beginning (luckily we have both done it so knew there would be steep steps and were able to handle it) if you had never done rafting you would have left. Our guide pointed the direction we needed to walk and took off. We couldn't see him the whole way down the steep steps. It had been raining so it was slippery god forbid someone had injured themselves because there was no one around. We walked a good 20 minutes just the two of us into what we believed to be the right direction. At the bottom we received a quick briefing. The instructor grunted and seemed like he didn't want to be there and it felt like we were a burden. At the end of the trip he pointed and said to walk back... we didnt see or speak to him again. We trecked back up the stairs to then ride with 15 people in the back of a truck to the base. It was overcrowded and travelling at highspeed in terential rain is more of a thrill than the rafting. We then were served lunch. Average. The other staff were the same no hello.. no how was your trip, no would you like some water ... nothing. They did not speak one word to us despite trying to start conversation. It would have been great to be told about what sights we were seeing and more about the river. I wouldn't recommend this company at all!!!"

I allways try to be open minded when travelling, as things do not allways turn out as expected.I have never done rafting before, so I was really looking forward for a thrill ride!! Unfortunately, very little rain in Bali dec 2015 caused the river to be very slow and our boat got stuck almost on every stone we could spot. Luckily our boat was equipped with a bunch of fun loving people so we kept our spirits up even if we basically had to work our way through the river.A dry river is hard to influence but what could be massively improved is the lack of managing the whole trip. Graha is one of the cheapest rafting company's I could find, and I had great time despite low water in the river. However considering the whole package I do not think I would use their service again, but as the saying goes \"you get what you pay for\"!"

Our head of our boat was Baron, what a character, he added much amusement, the cash of the oar on the water when you are not looking claiming a crocodile, he also splashes you from all angles using his oar. Ok so proceed with the adventure you are not really briefed, be warned its a hike down 40metres into the tropical jungle, awe inspiring, some what tricky in places but well worth the excursion down. Then you reach the lake, we were subjected to the dry rainy spell but still we managed category 2 to 3 in some parts, when the rains come it swells to over cat 5 and sadly we tourist just do not cut it. Plenty of opportunity to stop and swim and marvel in the wonderous fresh water run offs, spring water falls and the likes. Also many stops for beverages, the guide carries a water proof bag so take money and other items. It really is a great adventure, at 60us dollar a head not very cheap but utterly worth it. Once completed be warned that you have to transcend the steps up to street level, and I counted 276 steps, in the heat and humidity a very tall ask given the effort you have just been subjected too, just have a look at the females who work for them, they carry the boats and equipment up the stairs them selves and go back a few times, wow ... Anyway give it a go, excellent family fun, as there was only two of us we had to share with two others but very nice people all the same and we all quickly bonded. Oh by the way a free buffet lunch is thrown in along with coffee and tea before you start and with lunch along with free water, the buffet was great, loads of selections even vegetarian for my son."

The flow of water was slow, the water level was waist deep. Instead of having fun at the rapids, we were stuck half the time at the rapids, and had to dislodge ourselves, due to the dried up river. We had to paddle hard so that we carry enough momentum to not get ourselves stuck at the various section.Even though it affects their business, they should have warned everyone who signed up with them. At its current state, it is nothing more than a grade 1 river. I wouldn't recommend anyone going with them (or any other service provider at Ayung river) until it starts raining in Bali again.The buffet lunch provided at the end of the trip was terrible, houseflies are seen flying around and touching the various dishes.

We were on the river for 2.5 hours and had a nice swim in the clear cool waters. Initially, I was worried I didn't have the right footwear (had sandals on) and went barefoot into the water. The bottom of the river was actually silty, with no sharp rocks.The whole trip, from pickup at the hotel to drop-off, lasted a little less than 5 hours. Lunch was included, but I found the food to be subpar. I should warn that the river is a long trek down, and the way back was quite tiring as well, at least a 20 minute climb up the stairs."

Our guide was very informative and capable and at no stage did we feel uncomfortable on the water. We were a party of 4 (2A,2C) and shared our raft with another couple (6 plus guide per raft). Note that there is a 10-15 min walk down a few hundred steps to the commencement point and the same on completion. It is no big deal just a lot of steps! Rafts and equipment were well maintained and we had no issues. Some wonderful sights on the way down with huge, amazing rock carvings and a waterfall."

            "review": "Water rafting for the first time . We booked the water rafting via our driver and we did not know which operator we will be using until we got there, all we knew beforehand was it's 10km and about 2 hrs on the river. It was our first time and we had great fun. Nokia was our guide and he was good and entertaining. The river was easy to conquer and I would prefer it to be more excited than what it was. Maybe this month with no rain produce a gentle river?The stairs before and after the raft are not easy but still manageable for us (>35 yrs old ladies). Same as what others mentioned, if not for these stairs, this activity is for all ages and physical abilities. If you miss a step and fall on your way to and fro the river, it's going to be difficult to get you back to the main road.Along the river, we saw different starting points for different operators. I wonder if there are different charges for different distance? The last raft we saw was when we were left with 5km to the ending point. That will be too short a distance for that raft then. So make sure you are aware of how long a distance you are getting for the price you are paying when you book.After the rafting, we had cold but refreshing shower, basic but decent lunch buffet. It was nice to dine with a rice padi field view too."

We weren't disappointed very business like set up had us in jackets and helmets on tot the back of a truck to our jump in point. A short walk through rice paddies and yes there were stairs, steep stairs. Half the fun of getting somewhere is the journey. Brecko was our guide - lots of fun, laughing at each other and everyone else. Lots of rafts on the river this only added to the playfulness. we stopped 3 times along the way at the carvings, waterfall and drinks (not part of package). Lots to see along the way we marvelled at some of the rope bridges across the river. We reached our destination and yes there were more stairs - we weren't carrying wet rafts at 65kg on our heads. Back on board the truck where we returned to a warm towel (bliss) change rooms and lunch provided. A fabulous morning out - the hardest part was up the stairs at the end. At the end you can buy CD/DVD of trip up to the individual we bought some photos didn't take our camera with us. Tip you can hire a locker for 50000, guides take waterproof bags for camera stops along the way."

We were kitted out with helmets and vests and piled into the back of a ute to be transported to the river. There was a bit of a walk (including stairs) to the river but easy enough to do in flip flops. We had a water proof camera but otherwise the guides carry a water proof bag which you can put your camera in.We stopped twice along the river where you could go for a swim, jump of rocks or simply grab a drink (no need to bring money with you- you can pay when you return to the start point). The rapids were smallish but still a lot of fun. The rafting lasted just over 2 hours and finished with a walk up a number of stairs! Good exercise for a holiday! And to finish it all off we got water, noodles, fired rice, tofu and chicken for lunch. Fantastic morning!"

A trip which not only is adventurous in every form but also offers you an opportunity to discover a hidden waterfall (which you can literally get off board and stand under for a perfect water massage for your back), breath-taking scenery and wildlife as you are in the midst of a rainforest along this invigorating 10Kms stretch which takes almost 2 hours to complete (with a refreshment break half-way through). A glimpse of the beautiful Blue Javan Kingfisher enlivening ... Our Professional Rafting Guide Sentong sure stimulated and electrified this trip for us!Some tips to note: 1. Don't bother taking your camera as you won't have a chance to shoot and will miss the rapids trying to do so - there are photographers all along the river route to grab the fun which you can purchase later from the kiosks at the reception 2. No Disable Access and be prepared for a racking walk downhill to the Ayung River from drop-off point and then an unsparing 400 steps uphill after the almost 10Kms exhilarant rafting adventure.3. if your tour guide or taxi driver has not arranged a special $$$ price then please bargain by almost 50% from rate card"

It was fun to go under the waterfall. The hardest part of the trip was going down and up the 800 steps to get down to the river. People in our group had difficulty since they were not in shape and just had flip flops on. We wore Keens or sandals with a back strap. The guide carries a dry pack to put all the things you want to take with you but don't want to get wet. Great time and reasonably priced at $55 USD! Worth the money!"

There was quite a steep climb down of about 300 steps to get to the rafts. Some instructions and then we were off. 2 hours on the water, 10 km, fairly mild rapids and a break for a drink and snack half way. A tough 300 step climb at the end. A basic lunch of noodles, chicken and tofu was included back at the top. If it wasn't for the tricky climb to and from the river, I would say this adventure was for anyone."

Half way down I fell and subsequently I broke my foot. At the time I was unaware so my parter carried me down and we did the rafting. I will give the tour guides their dues they were amazing and good at their job. However after being told we would be covered by their insurance and having non medical people poke and prod my now bruised and broken foot while arguing that we needed to go to the hospital with THEIR DRIVER rather than our own after my fianc\u00e9 left me to go to our hotel to get our passports.

Nonetheless it was a pleasant trip-we haggled a street tour agent down to 650,000 IDR for two of us (around \u00a330 for us both) so we couldn't go too far wrong! We were picked up from our hotel, driven to the rafting base, given equipment and a locker our things, and then were driven in an overloaded truck to bear the start point before having to walk a long and fairly strenuous walk down through beautiful jungle scenery to the river valley-over 600 steps. For a relatively fit person this is a nice walk, although it seemed never ending at times...I was only a day or two recovered from a bout of food poisoning and this took it out of me, and for less fit individuals it is quite challenging-and even more so on the way back up!! The guides were all friendly and enthusiastic...although ours didn't know his left from his right (or at least the English confused him many times!) which led to some amusing maneuvers in the raft! The rafting was fun and enjoyable, although not too exciting because of the time of year ...we stopped at a waterfall and enjoyed a swim down some gentle Rapids. Lunch was a nice Indonesian buffet. Overall excellent value for money, a morning well spent and would recommend as long as you don't mind a good bit of exercise before and after your rafting!"

From there onwards, we had to climb down many flight of stairs which were old, muddy, steep & slippery, which took about another 20 mins. I recommend that you wear sport shoes with a good grip, so as to prevent slipping & falling or cutting yourself against the sharp rocks on the ground. I definitely do not recommend this to the elderly or for those with difficulty in mobility. After climbing down the flight of stairs, our energies were already spent. The guide then proceeded to inflate the raft on the spot. We then hopped onto the raft and began our journey. Before we started paddling, the guide taught us how to hold a paddle properly. He gave us clear instructions such as to paddle forward & backwards, and how to jiggle on the raft if it got stuck on the rocks. We listened to his instructions at all times and the guide was always in control of the raft, we felt very safe in his hands. Our guide name is Adi.The journey during the rafting was very fun, some of the water currents were quite strong, it felt like we were in a theme park. The water seemed to be quite shallow, and non of the rocks were sharp (probably eroded by the currents). There were lots of scenic things to be seen. We could see all kinds of plants growing there, they were all so luscious and green. We could see birds swooping down to drink water. They were also aboriginals fishing and washing their clothes in the river, it was pretty amazing. Furthermore, the air there was cool, peaceful and tranquil. The whole rafting journey took about 1 hour from start to finish. In between, there are staff selling cold water/soft drinks/beer on the shore.After the rafting, we had to climb yet another flight of stairs for about 20 mins. We were very tired at that point of time. The guide was very nice (seeing how tired we were) and offered to carry our helmets and life jackets. I later asked the guide how many times he does that in a day, and he said 2 to 3 times. Wow, I barely made it with the 1st time and he has to do it 3 times a day. I later tipped the guide S$10 for taking such good care of us.Overall, it was a good rafting experience. But as mentioned, I do not recommend this to the elderly or people was difficulty in mobility due to the steep & slippery climb down the stairs."

I was a little apprehensive about this excursion, but we booked the Ayung river as it was the least 'rapid' of the 3 rivers and we had our 11 year old daughter with us. It was part of a day trip, so our driver dropped us off, where we collected our helmets, life jackets and paddles. We were then transported to another location by the company where there was a 10 minute walk through paddy fields and then down to the river which included some very steep steps. We were given a briefing down at the riverside on the various instructions the guides would use (including how to tip the guides!). It was approx 2 hours, with a pitstop half way for refreshments (to be purchased). It was an absolute highlight of the holiday and I would do it again in a heartbeat and maybe even go to the next level river. It was thrilling but more than suitable for my daughter. Though after rains, I wouldn't like to say. The views/scenery was spectacular and I grinned from ear to ear the whole way! I would recommend this trip 100%. My daughter loved it and if we'd have had more time, we would have done it again."

The only issue is the way to river: it is a long walk in the rice fields and many many steps that we took to reach the starting point. A bit difficult when you have children's"

Booked my trip thru Bali Taro adventure who use Graha as their rafting companyHaving rafted Grade 5 Rapids before this is a pretty tame experience, river is quite shallow, Rapids quite small and plenty of running over rocks, Wife and I ended up in a boat with 3 others who were clearly just along for the ride (really couldn't put in a good effort of paddling) Road to get to the river is a bit laughable, room for vehicles in a single direction only and wasnt helpful that 5-6 other cars were trying to come the opposite direction, caused about 15 mins delay whilst vehicles organised themselves to make it past.Track down to the river is steep, track back out of the river is shorter but still steep specially after a few hours of compensating for others lack of paddling. Take some cash if you can for a refreshment mid-wayFood at the end was quite nice.Came down with an Ear Infection a day or two after rafting, cant guarantee it was from the water quality of the Ayung river, but seems most likely"

It improved, but sitting around for 30 minutes waiting for transport was a bit sticky and unpleasant. The walk down to the river is interesting to say the least, very glad it wasn't raining. This and the walk back up are the hardest part of the trip they say it's 300 steps but I was too tired to count them The rafting was fantastic, the skipper explained how we should sit and what to do if we came out of the raft. The River was quite low so we got stuck a few times and the skipper was in and out trying to get it free, there are a lot of boats on the river so it gets a bit congested at times.The whole trip takes about 2 hours with a 15 minute refreshment stop, take money if you fancy a cold beer at this point. The views along the river waterfalls cliffs and forest are truly spectacular.In short a great trip good value and great fun with the other 5 people in my boat ."

Yes, the walk down the river was steep but there was no rush. The guides gave a decent instruction and safety briefing, and were very clear about what their commands would be (to people on the raft).I was placed in a raft with three other males, about my size and build, and the Guide. In the first 30 minutes, there was an incident and the Guide managed the situation professionally and calmly. I was suitably impressed.I bought myself, the guide and my shipmates(!) a drink at the half way point and it wasn't cheap. But I was having great fun. Didn't really care. The guides (all of them) worked hard to make sure you were enjoying yourself. Splashing and joking around but it was also obvious they were being vigilant as well.I would now suggest this activity for people with mobility issues, mainly because of the walk down hill at the start of the trip and the walk back up at the end of the trip. The transport from the end of the rafting back to the Depot was great fun- in the back of an open air truck. Lunch was fine. All in all, a great time. I had fantastic fun and would definitely do t again and with this company."

The whole operation is extremely well organized. We got picked up at our hotel, got geared up and assigned to a guide. Nokia, our guide, was funny and easy going, yet always tuned into safety. We experienced an enchanting walk through rice paddies and down ancient stairs to the river. Then, because it was monsoon season, the river was swollen with lots of rapids and charming waterfalls. The spirit on our team and between team was great, with lots of amusing heckling and chanting as we synced the rhythm of our paddling. All in all, the landscape reminded us of part Indiana Jones, part Jurassic Park. At the end of the paddle, a delicious lunch awaited us. It was included in the price. What a nice surprise and experience! Finally, we had booked a half day trip with Graha to go to the Magnificent Beach and Uluwatu Kecac Dance. Our driver and guide was truly amazing. Since it was a Balinese festival day, the traffic was crazy. He realized that we were not going to be able to do all the things we signed up for. Instead, with the consultation of his office, he proposed an alternative program that worked wonderfully for us, and perhaps even better. Kudos to them!"

The guides had us laughing the whole trip with their fun antics. We splashed each other, jumped overboard when safe to do so, paddled into and under waterfalls, swam into & under waterfalls. Sang, chanted & heckled our partner raft. We paddled enough to enjoy but not be exhausted. The walk down to the river was an enjoyable walk thru the rice paddies, the stairs are steep both on the way up & down. The walk up for us in torrential rain was hard work but I LOVED it especially after all the fantastic Balinese meals we have been enjoying. You do need some fitness to do the walk but if you take your time it's ok.The scenery along the river is breath taking, the waterfalls are beautiful, the riverside stone carvings truly beautiful & the rainforest itself is divine. We didn't eat the lunch but most seem to be tucking in just fine. We didn't bother with the drinks riverside but yes you pay for them at premium prices if you need to. Yes the transport is ordinary, it's a small truck but I don't need my whole life sanitised & air conditioned. I enjoyed the back yard boys feel to the whole adventure, this is a Bali experience, I live in Australia where the Health & Safety rules & regulations take away half the fun & most of the adventure. If you want to pay Balinese not western companies and don't need all the creature comforts this is the group to go with."

They could use with another transport vehicle as we were left waiting for a while. Lunch was included which was a surprise. You will get soaked, so take extra clothes. Towels provided as is a drybag. Would be nice for a GoPro user.Be warned. There is a SIGNIFICANT walk down to river from the road and back up again. This is not well publicized and some in our group had trouble with this.

I've now tried both companies and BAT trumps GA by a phenomenal margin (see my review of BAT in Sep 13). My bad experiences with Graha included the shoty reception building on arrival, the old shitbox van that dropped us off and picked us up. The small shop riverside during the rafting selling drinks and food - that was a rip-off! Don't bother buying a thing! And finally the lunch was woeful compared to the table service and variety offered at BAT. This was a recommendation from our villa driver, so fair enough it was worth a try, but do your research, use TripAdvisor or take my word for it, spend the extra cash and go with BAT."

Mid point stop very expensive and they suggest you buy a beer for the guide. Lacking professionalism. If you use this group ensure you have a big hearty breakfast as you will need it.

Then they drive you for about 20 minutes to a place from where you walk down to the river (a bit steep but good steps). The rafting takes about 2 hours with a swim, waterfall and a break for a drink (not included, 20K for a can of soda). There was not so much water in the river so we had to avoid the rocks which was a lot of fun. There are a number of rapids but not so scary (there was a child in another raft which was fine). After getting out you climb up a number of good steps (steep again) and they drive you back to the meeting point for a buffet lunch which was OK.There you can change and shower (towels are provided)Afterwards you can buy a video for 300K or DVD with photo's for 150KPick up and drop of at our hotel was included in the price (we booked through a taxi driver for 350K each which is a lot cheaper than advertised on their brochure USD 69 each)"

Gear was clean and sturdy, lunch was basic but delicious (rice, noodles, veggies, chicken, watermelon, water) and all you can eat. No, their kit and lunch location isn't 5 star, but this is Bali we're talking about and it's perfectly authentic and earthy. Locker with key provided. They'll put your camera or phone in a waterproof bag for safe-keeping if you want to take it along. If you're wearing sandals or flipflops (jandles or thongs for Kiwis and Aussies), they'll tie them up tight at the back of the raft.There are 3 pit stops along the way for taking pics and resting. At one you can buy drinks/snacks, but there was no pressure to buy.ASK FOR ALEX! He was a total blast. He treats your tour like it's the first time he's ever done it - fresh, pumped up, excited - but he's completely experienced. He encourages you to splash others in their rafts and might even splash the people in his own raft from time to time. (\"No wet, no fun. No enemy, no fun!\", as he says.During less rocky parts, you can jump off the raft and swim. At one point, there's even a waterfall.Rapids are enough to be exciting, but quite tame - perfect for a rush while still feeling moderately safe.Pic CD at the end is 150,000 Rp. Video is 300,00 or you can get a package of both for 350,000. I only bought the pics and they let you preview before you buy. They really got some lovely shots - totally worth it.What are you waiting for? Go for it!PS: The walk down to and up from the rapids is a bit of a haul, but doable and I didn't feel unsafe. Have on secure shoes, take your time, use your paddle as walking stick if you need leverage."

You just have to go with the flow. A don't like this. Also the bus that take us to the river was in bad shape. With a lot of oxide and sharp pieces. Fortunately it's only a 5 min ride.

Once in the boat, the safety instructions were given and off we went. It was fantastic fun and our captain made sure we had a great time while working very hard to get us newbies safely through the rapids without mishap and waving at the camera man at the appropriate time. We had a great time \"competing\" with other rafts and a few groups from other companies didn't seem to be having the fun that we were with Graha. Rafting went for 2 hours with a short drink stop half way. Lunch was ok for the price and our hungry tummies appreciated it. Bought the CD & DVD for AUD40 which were better quality than expected. Only bad point was the steps down to the rafts, lots of them(200+), not in very good condition and wouldn't like to tackle them in the rainy season. Steps up were just as many but in much better condition. Our rafts were deflated, folded and carried up & down the steps on the heads of an elderly local man and a couple of women which does make my concerns about the steps appear pathetic."

However, he kept shouting to me and my boyfriend loudly trying to embarrass us into buying an overpriced bintang. Not the worst but on top of repeatedly suggesting we tip him a lot of money and whispering creepily into my ear about it, I felt a bit uncomfortable for the remainder of the trip. When he realised we weren't going to tip him (we did tip his more mild mannered colleague) he was again rude and went out of his way to make us feel uncomfortable. Was also quite rude and racist about the Chinese customers on our trip and was laughing about them with other guides along the river. Visit the river but don't risk a trip with this 'King Kong'.

The raft guide was excellent, he whirled us around when we got stuck and was so fit. I would think they would say its not for the unfit as older people would struggle with the stair climb. Also if you had knee problems it would be hard. The rafting was great though, lots to see and it was exhilerating speeding down the rapids and getting wet. They dropped us off at the monkey temple at the end and paid for entry. Otherwise they drop you back at your hotel. Meal was at the end of rafting, although they told us it was at the beginning which was a shame or else we would have had lunch before going, as we were starving by 5 pm when it finished. The other couple had the same thing happen. So watch this when doing the arvo session. Take a go pro or underwater camera or you wont get any pics. Cheap, fun day out. Try it."

There is a long steep walk in/out of canyon which you are not advised of and which would be difficult for some and a few of our group went the wrong way to the vehicle as there was no advice given. Don't bother taking footwear or additional clothing as it's just a nuisance. There are photos and video taken consistently which is very good and available to purchase after. Showers and towel available afterwards but nowhere dry to change. Lunch looked dodgy and flys everywhere. I can't help but wonder if this is where my husband who ate the meat got bali belly 24 hours later from."

I was pretty pumped for my first water rafting activity with my group of friends.At the headquarters, we were given the various attire like helmet, life jacket and pedal. The guide told us that we could bring along our camera and some money and place them in their waterproof bag. I thought that was convenient.We were then joined by other participants and took a ride on their van to the starting point at Ayung River. Not forgetting the long walk and descent from the drop off point to the foot of the river, so travelers with difficulties walking long distance or climbing up/down stairs should avoid it.The guide were reasonably fluent in English and ensure that the participants understands the instructions given so that we can enjoy the activity fully and safely.The river water is clear and clean, and really nice view of nature. There is a lot to see and experience. Even had the chance to swim a little and visit a small waterfall.There are stops along the way for rest break and photo taking, or to purchase drinks and tidbits. It was not too exhausting.Tipped the guide for the excellent service and even purchased the photos and videos of us (Rp 400,000 for both)."

            "review": "Very Exciting Adventure. We did rafting with this agency at the Ayung river. The total rafting time was approximately 2.5 hours. We hired a man to record our movements through a video camera for a reasonable price.Though the river was not extremely rapid, I fell into the river once. That was really funny and I was rescued in a jiffy. We tried diving into the river from a cliff and also enjoyed a waterfall. The time went so fast that we hardly realized the end of the journey. Our boat also flipped once and no injury happened to us since the guide appeared to be very experienced.There will be natural scenery and Hindu statues to observe throughout the course of the river. There will also be a lot of rafting teams going along with you, so normally there will be no fear in case of accidents as rescue operations will be definite. After the end of the journey, we had to climb a lot of steps to reach our jeep which took us back to the changing room.When the journey was over, we were famished and ate the meals which was decent enough to satisfy our hunger. The recorded videos were excellent and my falling out of the boat was also recorded. This rafting had been be a memorable experience to cherish in my life"

            "review": "Funnest Activity in Bali. We stayed in Bali for a week and would easily say that the rafting was the most exciting activity we did. We were driven first to the office in Ubud, where we were dressed in the gear, and then to a rice terrace. Although there were lockers, none were available so we carried our essentials in a waterproof bag (that they provided) with us. Note that you pay in either cash or credit at this office.We then hiked 30 minutes across the rice terrace and down a steep path (this can be tiring depending on fitness level) to reach the river at the bottom of a deep gorge. Once in the gorge, there is no trace of civilization except for the occasional rafters. The slopes/cliff walls are covered in lush, tranquil rainforest - it is one of the most beautiful places I've been to. As we began to raft down the river, birds would fly past the boat.The journey was 10 km and took about 2 hours plus one break halfway. The staff were really fun, friendly (we noticed that some other guides were not as friendly), explained the process well, and kept a good pace. Between guiding the raft among the boulders, getting inundated by the large waterfall, and enjoying the scenery in a non-invasive way, we had an enormous amount of fun.Afterwards, we were taken back to the office where we ended up buying the video and pictures for an extra 400,000 (bargain down to this number if you wish). Although the photographer will be boating from one shore to another to capture you, he is mostly taking video, not pictures. We received 50 pictures that were more or less taken in fast succession of just a single scene (we understandably hoped for better). The video was more worthwhile: 8 minutes long, consisting of both boats (the one you are on and company's other boat that is travelling at the same time). It better documents the entire journey.Overall, we would highly recommend this activity if you'd like to get wet, cool off (the water is pretty cold at first!), get a workout without realizing it, and see the untouched rainforests of Bali!"

There are other wilder rivers available. The walk down and up the river edge is very steep so being of a reasonable fitness level is needed. The water fights added to the fun. The guides were very pleasant, equipment safe, the lunch following was basic and I would probably ask for a price with no meal involved next time. It was a long trip from Seminyak , the taxi/driver was included in the price also, although u could negotiate your own driver. We would happily have another go at this."

It was arranged beforehand by our travel agent and we left the choice of which rafting company to book to them. We had already done our research online on white water rafting in Bali and its risks involved. We generally thought the river was easily accessible by a simple flight of stairs, but to our surprise it wasn't the case at all. We weren't informed beforehand at all about the steep descend to the bottom of the river which was deep in the forest, surrounded by high mountains. We felt deceived when we boarded a rickety, extremely old van that looked like it was about to break Into pieces. We thought we would arrive straight to the river but we had to cross a paddy field that had a narrow mud path which was extremely slippery and I almost plunged into the mud if it was not for a young couple who held me back. I suggest that u walk barefoot or bring along shoes with a good grip in the mud. Then we entered a deep forest and started to descend a very long flight of stairs.The trip down was horrible, it was so dangerous! The steps were carelessly built without proper railings to hold on to and no barricades. The steps were uneven, muddy and narrow, and if you walked to your left by one or two steps you would fall to your death to the deep canyon below. That's why I felt that they should at least build railings. I was shocked by the poor level of safety precaution done. I walked extremely slowly and carefully, every step was fraught with nervousness and difficulty for me and my father. We finally reached the river and the instructor introduced himself and we started rafting. It was overall enjoyable, scenery was nice and the rafting was quite safe. However when we climbed the stairs back up, it was very tiring but at least it was better than the previous one. This had proper steps but they were thick and had many steps. I suffered muscle aches on my thighs and arms after that. All in all, the rafting in the river was enjoyable itself but it was definitely not worth risking your life climbing the steps to reach the river. I guess it's due to the cheaper cost that they provide poor safety precautions. I advice people to join a more trusted rafting company. I heard other companies have safer and shorter steps down to the river."

We saw monkeys, steep canyons and magnificent waterfalls. We stopped to swim and float down stream in the calmer areas and then back in the raft for the class 11 & 111 rapids. When we finished we had a good climb back up to the road then back to base for a shower and lunch. I would do this again in a heart beat, it was a fantastic day in paradise."

            "review": "Great Fun Day with Kids. Before the trip, I was searching hard to find more info. on how safe it is to raft with kids especially my younger one is only 6 and cannot swim. Now that I have done it, I can share some useful info.1. Ayung river is low grade white water so it is very safe. No problem even with young children. Having said that, I think the weather plays a big part. It started to rain during the last 30mins of our trip and for such short period, u can see the water condition change quite significantly.2. Before the trip, I kept debating whether to spend more on the more reputable companies for safety sake. My take - equipment is similar as far as I can tell. Maybe u get better service and better lunches, but at double to triple the cost, so to me it's a no brainer. So, back to point 1, no need to book online beforehand. Just talk to those organizing tours and bargain. This also allows u to assess the water condition. If it has been raining v heavily the day before or a few hours ago, maybe u should postponed the trip if u are concerned.3. On the steps before and after the ride, if u are reasonable fit, it should be quite easy. My 6 year old boy almost ran up the steps non stop and emerge first out of the whole group. I was okay until I had to chase him and ended up panting. Just a tip, if u are no longer young and fit, do ur stretching before and after the climbing. Its not cool but it will save u the aches."

The kids definitely enjoyed it and had asked to do a second round. For this adventurous outing, be prepared to walk down around 300-400 steps to reach the starting point. (Don't be intimidated by this, just take it slow and steady. Or do some walking, cycling etc to prepare yourself before coming for this trip) Later another similar number of steps up to have your lunch and get changed. Just bring a small camera and extra clothes as the guide will make sure you get wet. There is a locker to keep your clothes and your camera will be kept in a waterproof bag, kept by the guide, to be brought along so you can take photos at two pit stops. We were briefed on the do's and don'ts before the start of the journey downstream. The guide is both skillful in maneuvering the raft and entertaining. There were lots of screaming and laughter."

He noted that all of the companies use the same equipment, and we observed this to be the case on the river when we saw numerous rafts from other operators. Our driver booked it for us, and got us a great price, so we went with them.On advice from other reviewers, we did wear water shoes/sandals, which were helpful on the walk down. We felt quite safe, and in our group of about 20 people, only one person fell out. She was pulled back into the raft just 5 seconds later by her raft guide.The views were absolutely amazing. The guides smiled and joked and splashed. It seemed like they were having fun, and helped the guests to relax and have fun too. My husband has done a bit of white water rafting, and felt our guide steered a very good course. It was exciting enough to be fun, but not scary or dangerous. At one point where the water was completely calm, they encouraged everyone to jump out for a swim. At a snack stop, the guides starting jumping off the side of the river bank. They helped our girls swim across the current and climb up so they could jump off too. Great fun.There were 400 steps on the way back out. Our kids counted..that's actually a great distraction technique if you have kids..but they were fine.We did ride back to the lunch place piled into the back of a pickup truck. Kids thought it was fun, I wasn't trilled with the safety factor."

The crystal clear water, fantastic atmosphere and serene beauty with lots of fun with the professional guide is all what can expect. The cost for the tour is around USD70 per person. And also depends what combinations of tours you opting for. Do carry swim suit/ Water shoes / additional pair of clothes (light)/ water proof camera with a string to hand around the neck.We were picked up from our hotel in Kuta at 0830 in the morning. The driver who came to pick us up was very helpful and informative. he did allow us few stops for photography on the way to the meet point for river rafting. When we reached there we were warmly welcomed by Graha staff offering chilled mineral water as refresher. There is changing room facility. When all the group members arrives the guide introduces himself and distributes the life jacket, helmet and paddle. He does a check if the jacket and helmet is worn as per safety procedure.From the meeting point we start heading to the start point down the river. The walk thru the paddy field, steps down the mountain to get to the river was scenic. The Guide is very jovial and experienced with rafting. When we reached the river he instructed us few rafting rules and how does it works.Rafting is about 2hours experience for 10-11kms stretch with 1 stop for photography and self-refueling (drinks and juices). The rapids are fun and exciting. Especially if you sitting in front as the water splash is amusing. And our instructor had an additional command of \u201cboom boom\u201d that was to sit down when he command\u2019s this. It\u2019s quite a splendid experience to raft on Ayung.Once the rafting is over they offer towels and shower area is quite clean. They then take you for lunch and the restaurant we went for lunch had beautiful layout. I simply loved it.I recommend to do this activity when in Bali."

We had booked a wonderful cycling tour and were booked on this white water rafting tour in conjunction, so we could complete both activities on the same day.From the time our private transfer delivered myself & 2 teen daughters to Graha Rafting, we were totally ignored. After 10 minutes we were then told to \"come\" & were required to travel in their vehicle for the next 15 minutes. Again, no communication or instruction. We had no idea where we were being taken too, or what was going on. When we finally arrived at the destination we were still none the wiser. After another 10 minutes of standing there, we were finally summonsed to be fitted for a life jacket, helmet and paddle. I was then given a dry bag to place my wallet in, which the guide then placed in his dry bag. We were then told to head down the track past the rice paddies & down the stairs to the river. As we got to the stairs ....guessing about 600 of them....double stair in thickness .....damp & slippery (thongs would be dangerous....really glad we had our runners on)....the guide decided that he had to go back & told us to keep going. I did get nervous at this point as he had my bag...with substantial money in it. I was feeling very uncomfortable with the entire set-up.It was not until we got to the river that the guide decided to speak to us in English (up until then he'd only spoken in Bahasa) & introduce himself to us (only an hour too late). He then had the hide to suggest we tip him at the end of the rafting. He blew any chance of a tip in the first hour that we spent with him. The guide did seem to know what he was doing in the raft. The rafting itself was a lot of fun and incredibly beautiful, through pristine rainforest, rock carvings & waterfalls. There were lots of opportunities for photo's & swimming. However, in all the rafts there was not one woman that wore bathers & a life jacket. People wore their clothing rafting and swimming; so a complete change of clothes is required at the end of the adventure.We did get some great pictures with a waterproof camera and we did have a lot of fun. Would we raft with this company again? NO we wouldn't. Would we raft in Bali again? Definitely, but with a different operator.At the end of the Rafting there are approximately 600 stairs to ascend. These have been put in by a competitive rafting company and are safe in comparison to the other stairs we descended. The spectacular view of the terraced rice paddies on the way back up is worth the photo stop."

We bumped a few times on the rapids, but it was always very safe and was never concerned as the guide (Made) always had control and had a big smile on his face - as we all did.A few things people ask;What are the steps down to the river like? The walk down is not hard - there is no time limit so its just a stroll. The path is at times small and a rocks a bit slippery - but it is Bali and your walking down a slope in a jungle.Is it dangerous? No, I am very cautious and at no time was i concerned about my 11 year old boy. You do get wet and bumped around a bit on the rapids but that's the fun bit. We did not tip over at all but yeah it could happen as it is a river with rocks everywhere... Just remember you have a very knowledgeable guide who does his best with 4-6 unskilled paddlers and occasionally there might be hiccup and someone falls out- if you fall out - so what!,,, it's water and you have a life vest on. The titanic had the best captain and ship equipment and it bloody sunk. What's the walk out like? A lot easier then walking down as there are steps all the way. Slow and steady again - no problems. If you get a bit tired and think its all to hard, you will then get overtaken by the ladies carrying the rafts on their heads back up the steps...yes they carry all the gear back up on the their heads on the same steps. Overall - a great enjoyable day. Graha is a cheaper company that offers the same fun and safe day without all the extra costs the other companies charge..Give it a go you'll have a ball..."

As we were rowing with the river current, the guide failed to steer us to the right passage causing the raft to get stuck between two large rocks and the boat to capsize. Another rider and myself went overboard and was swept away by the strong river current. I hit a large rock directly on my left thigh and legs. The other rider sustained bruises and injuries. The rest of the riders struggled to remain on the boat amidst the rampaging waters.The other rider and I were swept downstream for about 10 meters until we were able to swim to the river bank. When things have calmed down, I noted that the 3 remaining riders were now standing on top of one of the rocks where the boat got stuck (my wife would later recount to me how she was shivering in fear at that time) while the other rider and I were catching our breaths on the river bank. I then realized that I had a throbbing pain on my left thigh. The 3 riders were eventually rescued by another boat and taken to where we were waiting.Realizing the trauma my wife just went through and the pain I was starting to experience, I had asked the tour operator to end my tour and get me and my wife back safely to the vehicle. They said that there was no way for me to get back to the vehicle except to finish the rest of the 2-hour boat ride. The guides assured us that the rest of the ride was \u201ceasy\u201d. It was not. I had to go through the rest of the 2 hours in agony. There were 2 or 3 times when I asked the guides to let me off at the next stop \u2013 they said YES but did not do it.At the end of the ride, I thought my ordeal was over. I tried to get out of the boat but realized that my thigh muscles have contracted and I found it painful and difficult to walk or apply weight on my left thigh, and then to discover that there was a 600-step stairs flight up the hill that I had to go through to get to where the vehicles were waiting. It took me about another hour to get to the top at the rate I was climbing.The accident resulted in a fracture on my left femur. I have discovered new cuts, bruises and swelling on both legs that I have not noticed on the first few days.There are things to be noted about this tour:1. There was a 600-step walk down the mountain to get to the boats.2. There was a similar walk up the mountain from the boats to get to the vehicle.3. The tour did not have any emergency medical personnel nor any evacuation procedure in place on the river portion of the tour nor on the 600-step climb up or down.4. The river was deeper and the water current was stronger because of the continued heavy rains brought about by the monsoon. It was in fact, raining hard on the morning of March 7. The tour operator should have considered canceling the tour because of this.5. Their website claims: \u201cWhether you are 5 or 65, a natural or a novice, our white water rafting in Bali ride is safe, fun and a breathtaking experience to be enjoyed by the whole family. \u201c After what I have seen, I would not recommend this to a child, elderly or a novice rider/swimmer. If it was my wife (a novice swimmer) who was swept away by the strong current, she would not have had the presence of mind to fight the current and swim towards the river bank. She would end up going through another \u201crapids\u201d 10 meters from were I stopped.Here is a video clip of the accident: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTkUjI4VzGI"

            "review": "Fantastic experience. We were staying in Ubud and keen to go rafting. There are quite a few rafting companies and a large difference in price. Picked up a brochure for Graha rafting and easily negotiated the price down to approx AUD$30 per person (there were 4 in our group).Picked up on time from our hotel in nice air-condition vehicle. Short 30 min drive from Ubud to meeting place. Got fitted for gear and had a 15min hike (steep downhill) to the start of the river. Very friendly guides, good rafts and a very fun experience on the river. One guide plus 2-5 persons in each raft, as they tried to keep couples/families/groups together. Short 10 min break from rafting half way through the trip where you can chaply buy a can of drink from a small stall on the side of the river (so take a couple of $). Very basic cold showers near the river at the end of the trip and a simple but tasty lunch. The hike up many many stairs at the completion of the trip nearly killed me, but I'm unfit! Still, definitely not for those who aren't fully mobile.There were a few rafting companies conducting white water rafting on the same stretch of river. All the rafts and equipment looked about the same. The only major difference I could see was that the large Adverture Tours company had a flashy finishing area with nice changerooms etc - next to where Graha tours stopped - and both companies used the same stairs to exit the river area. This other company was also nearly 3x the price, so I was very happy to have more basic change rooms and save some money."

If u arent picky & need everything to be fancy you will enjoy this just as much as if u paid $100. Wonderful experience.

We could tailor make our day tours such that we don't miss on the best places. Since we had an infant and a toddler with us, we had to stop at some places which he did without a frown. He also shared a lot about the Balinese culture. He gave us some interesting insights which we wouldn't have known about, otherwise. He was also a keen listener and extracted a lot of information about our culture as well. The conversations with him, made the long drives from Nusa Dua to Ubud, very interesting!Also, he guided us on our souvenir shopping- what to buy, how to bargain etc. We would highly recommend him for anyone planning a trip to Bali.thank you Wayan for being fantastic!Shreya and Shantanu"

And I\u2019m incredibly glad that I did! The team at Amansuka was incredibly accommodating of my last minute request for a day tour. I ended up booking the Traditional Morning Market, Historical Temple, and Volcano Tour and was lucky to have Wayan Arjana as my driver/guide for the day. From the first minute to the very last, Wayan shared stories about his culture, daily life as a Balinese, and the history and significance of each of the places we visited. There was never a dull moment, as he fielded all my questions with great detail.Even the smallest considerations like preparing a cold hand towel to refresh after each stop, providing sarongs for temple visits, taking the side streets to avoid traffic, and haggling with the coconut man to get the local price were very thoughtful and greatly appreciated.It was a long day (we visited 9 places total!), and Wayan remained engaged the whole time. It was great to see so much of Bali, and these sights were greatly enhanced by the extra context Wayan provided.This was without a doubt the best day tour I\u2019ve ever been on. If you\u2019re looking for a professional, friendly, and engaged guide with heaps of knowledge about Bali and its beautiful culture, I highly recommend booking a trip with Amansuka. Thanks so much Wayan Arjana for a wonderful day, and I look forward to recommending your services to all my friends and family!"

He is extremely well educated in the various things in Bali - conversationgs shifting from religion to politics to food etc...I will highly recommend him for a tour.While talking food to him, he asked us if we enjoyed good local street food and when we said yes, he stopped at a nice place on our way, bought some really nice food for both my wife and I as a gift. Not only that you learn a lot on the Balinese culture but he will become your friend after the tour."

He made us feel so at ease, wrapped us in sarongs when it was cold at the top of the mountain (we weren't really dressed for cold), took us to some amazing places, constantly took the most fabulous pictures of us both, and dropped so much knowledge and philosophy he probably changed our lives forever. He's such a peaceful, cheerful man and has so much to share its worth spending some real time with him. Bali is beautiful and Wayan will show you everything in its best light."

We were ripped off by another company, so we really appreciated Amansuka Tours for their hard work and honesty.We booked a custom tour on the Wednesday afternoon, we flew in and Wayan picked us up from the hotel at 2.30 in Legian and took us to the Uluwatu temple, it was such a stunning site, Wayan is extremely knowledgeable about the area, history and pointed things out to us along the way, on the way back he stopped at a shopping centre for us because we had forgotten toothpaste and some other essential items. We were supposed to go to a restaurant at 7:00 pm but we were so tired Wayan took us back to the hotel. We were very happy with our custom tour that Wayan was able to fit into our afternoon.On the Friday we picked the Singaraja 'Lovina' Tour. If you only have 1 free tour day in Bali make it this tour!!! We went to the Ulun duna Temple which was just breath taking it was 50,000IDR each to get in, which I though was a bit expensive, until we go inside it was worth every cent. The grounds and temple are just one of kind, the mountains by the lake are just stunning. We were also lucky enough that there was a Hindu ceremony happening at the same time so Wayan was able to explain a lot of that to us. We also went to the Gitgit waterfalls, Lovina Beach, the Twin Lakes (it's cold up there take a jumper or cardigan), the hot springs and the Buddhist Temple. We saw so much of Bali and different ways of life of people. We were surprised when we were cold up at the Twin Lakes and stopped for coffee and a fried banana.Wayan personally, has a very friendly manner, he is approachable and easy to talk to, we didn't feel uncomfortable asking him questions or joking with him. Being in a car for 12 hours I think it's important you can relax and relate to the person you are with.Amansuka is a family company, I think it shows, the effort and personal touches Wayan put into our tour were above and beyond what we received from other tours and drivers during our stay in Bali.We already want to come back and do more tours with Wayan."

Wayan was a good tour guide, he spoke great English and was amiable to however much time we wanted to spend taking pictures. Tanah Lot itself was incredibly crowded and touristy - not the tour guide's fault - just a heads up. Although we enjoyed ourselves a great deal, we ended up paying entrance fees in the sum of something like $50 total for every place we went to. Now, the confirmation email he sent did say that entrance \"fee\" was not included, but it didn't specify what those fees were. Plus, the fees for Tanah Lot had been recently increased. Luckily, we had enough money to pay for everything but it was super shady not to be upfront about that kind of thing, especially when people are usually traveling on a budget. We cancelled our second day trip because of the additional costs. I don't mind paying for things as long as I have a heads up I have to pay for them. If you book with them, ask for a thorough price list."

As a first time Bali visitor, Wayan was really good about making us comfortable, from the prompt Denpasar airport pick-up to the making of excursion deals for us so we got the local price and making of spa appointments. His English is very easy to understand. He flavored the tour of the temples/countryside with Balinese culture/wisdom, which we requested and appreciated. He provided sarongs whenever temple dress was mandated and he had umbrellas on standby for the afternoon rains. He was aware of issues we might have with Bali food (\"Bali belly\" is a problem for westerners sometimes) and pointed us to eateries that would be safe. His driving tours seem to be based out of Ubud, so he is really good for seeing mountain scenery, rice terraces, and temples in central to North Bali. He has a lot of local connections and recommendations, so helped us to get into the #2 cooking class in Ubud (recommended for its small class size). He also helped us to get a rafting excursion for half of the list price. Coming from a Northern climate and not being acclimated to tropical climate, it made a huge difference to always have an air conditioned car waiting for us so we could really enjoy each day.

He worked with our scheduling issues, and ended up providing a tour and transfer between Legian and Ubud. What is important to note first is that he's a great guy. You're essentially spending a day trapped in a car with a stranger on those Balinese roads (ohhhhh those Bali roads). He's very nice, he's funny, and he's personable. It was like we were touring with a friend. He would translate interesting conversations going on around us, and some of them were quite entertaining!Having scoured TripAdvisor prior to our departure, I had a list of things I wanted to see (and no idea whether that list was reasonable or realistic). Wayan took a look at the list, and offered suggestions for a more reasonable itinerary. What resulted was a great tour of the central part of the island, from the southern coast to Lake Beratan, and back to Ubud. Wayan was right on time picking us up from our Legian hotel, greeted us at 0830 with a smile, and helped load our luggage into his van. Throughout the tour, we peppered him with questions about Balinese life, culture, politics, and essentially any information you might ask. He was so incredibly knowledgeable (and delicately pointed out any misinformation we were fed earlier in our trip). We learned SO much about Bali with him!In sum, I cannot recommend Wayan enough. Had we more time in Ubud, we would have absolutely booked several days with him and toured more of the country. Go! And enjoy!"

Our day was fully packed with lots of different things: Visiting the water temple and a coffee plantation, the rice fields, a typical Balinese family compound and Balinese artists just some of them.Thanks to him we now know so much more about Balinese customs and culture. He told us a lot about Hindu philosophy and impressed us a lot.In summary: Write Wayan a mail or give him a call, your day tour with him will be one of your best days in Bali! Thanks Wayan, you made our life so much richer and we will never forget your wise words!"

I sent an email and Wayan responded immediately even with the time difference. He was very kind and scheduled out what I was to do each tour. Before departing from America I made sure to double check we were still good to go and promptly got a yes! The morning of our first day of tours we were greeted by our driver, Made. Made is awesome. Very humble and a wealth of knowledge!! We were able to see so many things and learn about the culture while viewing 8th century temples!!! Each day he was on time and would take you anywhere you wanted whether keeping it local at the market or seeing the tourist spots. The cost was well worth it and I will definitely return to visit Wayan and Made one day!! Thank you!!"

The reservations were fine, Wayan, the owner, promptly responds. I was under the impression that he'll be the one joining me in the tour, I guess I should've confirmed. Anyway, I was assigned Wayan's brother as my guide (I forgot his name). He was at the airport when I arrived. Before the tour, Wayan provided 2 lists of itineraries from where I can choose from, so I did and tell my guide what I wanted, he was kind, but it kinda felt like i was on an unprepared tour. One of the sites we visited was Besakih, he told me that if I'm lucky he will be accompanying me inside the temple and that I dont have to pay for a guide, it confused me all of a sudden why he would say that and insisted that he come with me inside. He did, after insisting twice. I paid almost a hundred dollars for this tour but I thought that I didn't get what I paid for."

My husband and two teenage children spent a wonderful day with Wayan getting to see some of the real Bali away from the tourist hotspots. He tailored the day to our wishes and requirements and made flexible adjustments during the day when we were short of time. Very good driving and HEAPS of fascinating information about Balinese culture delivered with a lovely smile. Silversmithing, temples, coffee plantation, rice terraces and a beautiful serene lunch next to the rice paddies. Absolutely no pressure to visit particular shops or to buy anything, and good tips about imitations versus authentic handicraft. I hope we can take some of his peaceful optimism home with us......Thank you Wayan!"

Initially as a solo traveller I was nervous travelling alone with someone I hadn't met for the full day however when I met Wayan my worries vanished. He was friendly and easy to get along with. I learnt so much about the Balinese culture throughout the day. I got so much more out of this experience by going with Amansuka tours, as they are a family business who are from the area and therefore answered all my questions and taught me so much. As I had only one day I wasn't expecting to fit so much in. Wayan managed to fit in 11 different sites! My favourite experiences were visiting a Balinese family house, visiting the temples, the monkey forest and the coffee plantation.Amazing day! Couldn't recommend them enough! "

This pretty much became a custom made tour. Nyoman made some good suggestions. Firstly we stopped at the butterfly sanctuary which was really nice and held a large collection of colourful butterflies. Then off to the nearby waterfall, sorry can't remember the name but it's close to the butterfly sanctuary. Wow, the waterfall was running well and the opportunity to swim was available, so take your bathers. There were warungs and souvenir stalls at the waterfall if you get hungry or want to shop. Next stop was for Lewak coffee and herbal tea tastings at Taman Ayu where they make the products.This was set in a jungle setting overlooking an old temple. Relaxing location where we sampled the coffee and teas which were really good. Next stop Tanah Lot for the sunset. Hundreds and hundreds of tourists rolling up on big tourist buses. This took the ambiance away to say the least but it was good to see the temple.Then we went to Melasti restaurant for our seafood dinner. This restaurant overlooks the ocean and temple and is outdoors. This was a mistake as everything we ate was bad. Aside from this we had a really enjoyable day with Nyoman. Nyoman was such a pleasant, kind and courteous man with a good sense of humour. We got to know him over the afternoon. We learned about his family and his life which was good to hear about. Nothing was too much trouble for him. If you pick a tour to Tanah Lot best not to eat there or Google restaurant reviews before selecting a restaurant. Thank you Nyoman for an enjoyable tour, we enjoyed your company very much :-)"

He has an immaculately clean and comfortable car, and drives carefully. At no time were we concerned for our well being or safety. He is prompt, courteous, and professional. Our communication was through email until our arrival to Indonesia. We always received quick responses to any messages we sent.We had planned a short visit to Bali, so as first time visitors, we wanted to see as much as possible. We decided a private guided tour would be ideal. We couldn't have asked for a better guide. I chose Suka through reviews I read on TripAdvisor. Suka helped us to customize our itinerary based on our interests. We covered the Central Mountain region part of the East Coast. He explained so much about Balinese culture and people. We saw many examples of daily life and the beautiful countryside. We were able to avoid a lot of the heavily visited sites. We spent approximately 9-10 hours each day touring. That is a long day of driving, but Suka did not seem to mind.When I return to Bali, I will seek out Amansuka Tour for services. I will also recommend him to anyone searching for a guide or driver. We couldn't be more pleased with our first stay in Bali."

We thoroughly enjoyed our 2 days with Wayan Suka and Wayan Eka, both very professional safe drivers who also pride their business on being guides not just drivers. This makes them a step up to the average driver which is much more enjoyable. They gave us an interesting insight into the Balinese way of life as they skilfully drove through the bustling market places and quiet country laneways of Bali. I have visited Bali 4 times before and have learnt so much more this time than previous visits. At each attraction they went out of their way to show us the best areas, take photos for us, suggest the best places to have lunch, but never tried to talk us into seeing something we didn't want to see as many other drivers do. Wayan Eka took us to his family temple where we were lucky enough to meet his mother and share a cup of coffee with his family and friends. This was a very special time which we will never forget. We won't hesitate to use these guides next time we are in Bali and I have already recommended them to my friends who will be visiting in December. Thank you Wayan and Wayan for making our visit to Bali such a memorable one.Cathy, Liz and Trish from Australia"

            "review": "Great family run service. I used Amansuka tours on 3 separate occasions while holidaying in Bali. On the first occasion, i incorporated a transfer from Seminyak to Ubud while exploring some temples and other local attractions like rice fields,; the next occasion was a whole day tour and the last was a transfer from Ubud back to Bali airport.What impressed me was the level of flexibility my driver (Wayan's nephew) had in my itinerary. After weeks of emailing and discussing with Wayan (Uncle) a tour itinerary I had to make a last minute change: I was meant to have got to Uluwatu the day before on my own but due to bad weather i didn't go. I told Wayan (nephew) on the first day of my tour and he handled this with upmost professionalism. He did not question my decision at all. So I knew from that point, their focus is on the customer. In addition to this, I did not have to wait in the lobby of my hotel for them- like when they say they will be there at a certain time, they will be there!Wayan my driver/guide was a gracious and funny host where we joked around and laughed during my tour. However, it was disappointing that Wayan could not drop me off to the airport as i wanted to properly thank him for an amazing time i had with him.What i truly liked about this tour company is that its a small family run business, where the money goes back to the driver and their village. We, from a western culture need to support such companies and give back to those that survive on our tourist dollars! Their prices were very competitive with other tour comanies in Bali and would happily recommend them to TA readers. I would most certainly use them again without a doubt!"

As we wanted more of a guide than just a driver, we emailed several tour guides / companies and the reply back from Amansuka was what made us book a day tour.Wayan gave suggestions as well as asked what we would like to do and the email was very clear and informative on price and pick up etc.Wayan was a great driver who spoke brilliant English. He was happy to answer lots of our questions and was generally a lovely man to be around.We would not hesitate to book Amansuka Tours again."

First, we were late to the hotel for our pickup that I had made weeks prior and just confirmed the day before (batik class took much longer than expected and there was a lot of traffic due to a parade). We rushed in the hotel for a very calm man to be waiting, telling us it would be fine, that he would wait even longer for us to go to our room and use the bathroom and such. Much appreciated! Well, my daughter got a little case of the \"Bali Belly\" I just couldn't put her in the car for an entire afternoon not feeling well. As I am a single parent and was tending to her, I called the front desk and asked them to tell our driver we needed to cancel and that I would not be returning. Later (almost an hour later) I went to the front desk to ask a question. He was still there!! The front desk never told him!! After getting very upset and making a scene in the lobby insisting the front desk apologize to this man...he remained so calm. He told me outside that it was ok, this was common with this hotel, that he understood and to go be with my daughter. As horrible as I felt for being late, cancelling and then unknowingly keeping him waiting...he was still so calm and kind to me. This says so much about a persons character. I recommend this company based on this and feel that if you are able to use them, you will be well taken care of. Amansuka, thank you so much for understanding."

Everything we saw was fantastic, Made, our tour guide was really friendly and had lots of information to give us on Bali and the culture, he even stopped off at a rice terrace and asked a lady if we could have a go at harvesting her rice! He was more than happy to stop anywhere we wanted en route and had spare sarongs in the boot for when we went to the temples. The experience was amazing and getting to see so much in one day was so unique. We would definitely recommend them to anyone! Thank you!"

The whole service was superb!I initially e-mailed at really late notice, but Wayan Jr had no problem in fitting us into the diary. The day was completely orientated around what you wanted to see as a guest. For our tour, we opted to visit as many temples as possible in the day, and Wayan had no issue in taking a little extra time to see the bits you wanted to see. Despite the price being for a 9am-6pm tour, it was nearing on 7pm by the time we got back as Wayan Jr took a detour to the Luwak coffee farm with no hesitation! What also helped is that we were picked up from out hotel in Ubud in the morning, and then dropped off in Seminyak later in the day.In summary, an fantastic day with a fantastic guide that was completely tailored to you as a guest! 5 star easily!"

I especially loved Tirta Empul, Pura Kehen, Bangli, & Kerta Gosa floating palace & courts of justice at Klungkung. Wayan was friendly, courteous & polite.

A vacation is so much more enjoyable and enriching when you have an experienced guide. And it's worth every penny to not worry about driving in Bali. I've driven in Paris, but driving in Bali looks even more stressful! I could tell Suka is a sharp and careful driver though so I was able to nap peacefully on long drives. :) There is so much to learn about the culture and the history you don't want to miss so Suka's proficient English and deep Bali knowledge was great. We had 2 other drivers on the trip and the language barrier made it more difficult to get much info from them.But above all, I am glad we found a trustful person. He was responsive in correspondence and arrived on time. We had a 5 year old with us and he was so kind and attentive with him. He has great suggestions, but also laid back and flexible on plans too. As others have mentioned here, he seems to have a wise and kind soul!Suka - Thank you for a wonderful vacation with many great memories for life - much because of you!"

My partner and I were able to cherry pick attractions for a customized 1-day tour, and he's very accommodating to our arrangements (even when our destinations are practically spread all over Bali and he had to drive for hours).Amansuka speaks very good English, has a deep knowledge of the Balinese culture and is very well mannered. He never failed to make us comfortable throughout the whole trip, and worked diligently to make sure that we see the best of Bali. Unlike many other guides in Bali, he does not cut corners and would be the last person to bring you to a tourist trap. Amansuka is like a Balinese friend who's happy to show you his hometown, and his tours are also competitively priced (we even gave him a good tip for the fantastic tour).If you're arranging for a day tour in Bali, look no further. Thank you Amansuka for the great experience, and see you again when I visit Bali."

My friends and I came off the tour filled with so much knowledge, ideas and appreciation for Bali and her beautiful people and their way of life. And there is still so much to know, to learn, to explore.

My mom had a bad leg during the trip and he would think of alternative routes or places that would suit her better. We are also appreciative that he did not try to inject his ideas into the tour; instead he would constantly seek our opinions which made us very comfortable throughout the trip. I have included 2 photos which i took during the tours, one was taken in a restaurant (that serves awesome organic food) facing Mt Batur and another was the breathtaking Uluwatu Sunset.Made was our driver who drove us from our hotel in Ubud to the airport.

We also went to the irrigation museum, saw a traditional Balinese home and went to Jutiluwih rice terrace where we got to see some farmers and buffalo farming the rice. Wayan showed us a local warung where we would try suckling pig, we had never tried it or eaten at a warung so that was a great experience.Wayan gave us a lot of information throughout the tour which was very helpful and he was great to chat to and made us feel very comfortable.Our flight had been delayed the night before so we had only slept for three hours before wayan picked us up. We kept falling asleep in his car and he was very considerate not to wake us up and even went and got the car for us after the walk in the rice terrace so that we didn't have to walk. Thank you so much for a great day wayan!!! Our second tour we had another driver named wayan who took us to GWK to see some amazing giant statues of Garuda and Vishnu, it was such a great experience and we really appreciate the information he provided about the Vishnu and how long the statue has taken to build. We also stopped at Padang Padang beach before heading to Uluwatu to watch the sunset. The views from Uluwatu temple were breathtaking and we got some great photos here, wayan knew the best spot for us to watch the sunset and took some photos for us.Wayan then took us to Jimbaran bay to a restaurant called 'new moon' for a seafood dinner.Thank you wayan, we enjoyed our tour!We would recommend Amansuka tours to anyone who would like to see something different and we liked that we could customize the tour based on what we wanted to see and how long we had.

Wayan was very punctual and his vehicle is well maintained and comfortable. We wanted to combine the move between the hotels with a day tour of Balinese countryside. Wayan came up with several excellent suggestions for the trip. During our journey to Ubud, Wayan shared a lot of valuable and interesting information on Balinese life and culture. He's very knowledgeable and speaks excellent English. Because he's a licensed guide, we were able to save money at the Mother Temple in east Bali and avoid the need to negotiate with and hire local guides. On our second day, we visited The Sacred Monkey Forest, the butterfly par, several villages, and a Balinese home. Wayan is extremely friendly, helpful, flexible, and has a good sense of humor. His tours are custom tailored to the interests of the clients. We recommend him highly. You won't be disappointed. John and TatyanaJuly 2016"

After having made a lot of research to find the best guide in Bali, I decided to contact Wayan to show us the beauty of his island on 3 different days of our trip. I can confirm that he is an excellent guide, but out of the 3 days booked with him, we only had the pleasure to meet him during the first day of our Bali tours . On une 28th, a family member came to pick us up, as one of his relatives had passed away and he had to organize the funeral. We had also booked him for July 7th and he wasn't available because his son had a badminton tournament, so somebody from another company came to pick us up. From my experience during our Bali trip,4 out of 6 planned transportations were not done by the person we initially fixed the appointment with. They will always tell you ' yes I'm available ', but then it's the cousin of the brother or the nephew of the aunt that will come instead.To pay 60 USD for a day tour with someone who is exceptionally well quoted is fine, but if then you have to pay the same amount for somebody you didn't choose and with a service that is basically ok but far less professional than with Wayan himself is questionable."

He began by understanding precisely what type of tour we wanted, what we would like to see and then created a tour that we will remember for our lifetime. Throughout the tour he answered our many questions with enthusiasm and detail and was happy to explain everything from religion, culture, farming and so on! We definitely recommend this company, especially if you want to better understand Bali.Thank you again!All the best,Apolline and Brian"

He is also very punctual. He explains every aspect about Balinese life and culture extremely well, putting the history behind all the sites that we visited in the context of how they are a part of Balinese life. He was also very flexible in allowing us to tailor our tours according to our interests, as well as the restrictions that traveling with a toddler brings.If I could offer Wayan one small piece of advise, it is don't be afraid to offer your knowledge at will. He was always able to answer our questions, but I think his fantastic tours could be improved even more by explaining more without prompting."

He arrived on time to picked us up in the morning with a nice spacious van.Amansuka drives very carefully on the small and bumpy roads of Bali which made us feel very comfortable and safe. He speaks excellent English and has the typical Balinese curiosity to him which makes it easy to learn more about Bali and it's culture. We had many interesting conversations with him in the car which made the time between stops feel very short. He also provides good suggestions on places to visit but you can of course decide yourself which places you want to visit. Unlike some other drivers-for-hire on Bali Amansuka would never take you to places where you feel obliged to buy something. On the contrary, he gives advice on how to avoid the many touts in tourist areas. Also, when going places of interest Amansuka will join and share his knowledge about the place rather than just wait by the car. If you are visiting a temple, he will provide you with the required sarong. The next day we booked Amansuka again to go to the airport. So you can also book him as airport transfer, if he is available of course he primarily do half day or full day tours. All in all we could not be happier with this service. The rates are extremely reasonable so if you are satisfied with the service I think he deserves a generous tip."

Aside from being a wonderful, skilled driver through the narrow, busy, scooter-filled roads and local backroads, Suka is a great teacher of Balinese culture and Hindu beliefs. Bali is gorgeous itself, but with Suka, Bali became alive and more personal. His English is excellent, making communication, conversations and questions easy. He helped explain the history and design of each of the numerous magnificent temples we visited and arranged the tour around our schedule, desires and needs. Suka even went out of his way to help us by stopping by the grocery store during our daily tours, and helped fill in our tours with suggested sites and highlights along the way to points we already wanted to see. His transport was roomy for the 5 of us, clean, cold AC for our daily drives around Bali. Rates are reasonable $50-60/day. Our 5 yr old son loved Suka and had a great time helping to grind coffee beans at a local agriculture farm stop. The most memorable part though, was a stop at a random local residence where Suka introduced us to the random family and to their open and welcoming lifestyle of Bali culture. Here Suka taught us the traditional layout of a Bali residence, how the extended family live together there, and the importance and incorporation the Hindu religion into the residence. It is no surprise that the other reviews for Suka are similar, and next time we visit, we will be sure to contact Suka again."

During our tours he provided us with tastes of local food and drink with explanations about how they are made, and where they come from etc. He also indulged us with lots of explinations about Balinese culture and was able to answer all our questions. Wayan ensured we didn't do the same thing twice throughout our tours and offered us lots of flexibility and alternatives. He even helped us find a good massage and picked us up earlier to take us there. Basically the service we received was lovely, there was a lot more he did that I won't put here but you couldn't have met a nicer guy who cares about his community and guests.

After reviewing some reviews about Amansuka Tours, we decided to book them for our tours. It was the best decision. Wayan Suka, the guide, was extremely nice, very knowledgable, and helpful. Initially we booked one trip with him, to visit some of the must see places in Ubud. After spending a whole day with him, we decided to book another day to explore the other cities in Bali. He went out of his way to take us to the places that were a must see. Everywhere we went to visit had history, and Wayan knew so much about all of these places and it was great to hear about everything and get more insights from a local himself. I really appreciate everything Wayan did for us the several times that we saw him. Although we only expected a tour with him, he literally went above and beyond for us, doing things I did not mention here. We feel fortunate to have met someone as kind as he was, and some things he said and advices he gave are things my husband and I still reflect on and talk about."

He told us he worked in a large tour company for several years before setting up this private tour company 8 years ago with his brother. His experience really shows in everything he does. He is calm and polite and has a great sense of humour. He's an excellent and safe driver and really knows his routes well. He answered every question we asked (religious, political, historical, agricultural, personal etc), and he shared with us the Balinese philosophy of life and its religion. He brought us to visit a random family's home compound to illustrate the Balinese philosophy of welcoming all and sundry to their home (hence the front gates are always open during the day). I feel I really have a deeper understanding and respect for the Balinese culture in the two short but action packed days my family of 2 adults and 2 boys (aged 7 and 11) spent with him.

He was able to customize a full day tour for us, visiting a school, a temple, a luwak coffee farm, and a hike across some rice terraces. Perhaps the most unique part of the tour was visiting the compound of a Balinese family. We thought that perhaps we would visit a pre-arranged family, but we just waltzed into a random house and learned about the family's compound and Balinese homes in general. While this would never fly in the Western world, apparently all Balinese homes are open to visitors. Very cool experience.Wayan Suka's English was great, and we really enjoyed all of his insights into Balinese culture. Our tour was definitely one of the highlights of our visit! Highly recommended. "

We did two tours with Wayan during our time in Bali, the Uluwatu tour and the Lovina tour which essentially took us from the bottom to the top of the island over the course of two days. We would have never been able to see the majority of these sights without Wayan and our vacation would not have been as wonderful and fulfilling. Wayan was an absolute joy to tour with. It was our first trip to Bali and he answered our multitude of questions about the Balinese lifestyle and the Hindu religion. His business is family run and his love for his family and Bali is shown in every aspect of his manner. If you want an enlightening and lovely tour of Bali then I highly recommend using Amansuka tours. Thank you Wayan!!!"

I was not aware that several different Wayan's work for this company (as someone with a negative review mentioned) and I feel lucky that we seem to have gotten the one who is the best!Wayan Suka picked us up early in the morning and gave us an incredibly comprehensive tour of Bali for TWELVE HOURS. Seriously, he went above and beyond to show us everything we wanted to see. He was funny, genuine, and honest. Above all else, that last part was most important - we love Bali but usually felt on guard as so many people are trying to hustle you out of money - Wayan Suka NEVER did that. He didn't take us to expensive galleries or restaurants to help out his friends, he didn't upsell us at all, he just did the exact tour he advertised to us. The rest for our minds made us feel truly on vacation! I would recommend this tour to any travelers to Bali. It was personalized, detailed, and fun. Thank you!"

At first, I was very apprehensive about booking a tour as I'd be on my own, but after the first few minutes, I quickly settled in and reaped the advantage of having the guide all to myself :)Wayan is extremely kind, knowledgeable and a very careful and considerate driver. Please know when you're booking through him, it is a family oriented business and he truly cares about its reputation and making customers happy. He embodies the true spirit of Bali as he makes it a point to greet the locals we come across, always with a genuine smile on his face. When speaking with him, you will have a genuine conversation about all aspects of life and he not only teaches you about Balinese culture but about life in general! He was very prompt with the email replies and was very accommodating when my flight time changed last minute. Remember to book a few days or weeks in advance cause he gets busy!I took a full day tour with Wayan and he took me to the marketplace (I was the only tourist in the whole place), to a traditional Balinese home (just a tip - I wish I brought some gifts for the family), the rice terraces, waterfall, the coffee plantation, the water temple, and a lunch spot at batur mountain. He was able to squeeze in the elephant temple, was able to find me a working atm and even dropped me off to my next tourist destination when the tour was over! He even has a sarong prepared for the tourists like myself who wear shorts while entering the temple. The rate was a lot cheaper than other tours and it does vary depending on your itinerary :) Overall I can't sing enough praise for this man. If you book with him, you'll be in good hands. And just a tip, please don't be a rude, disrespectful or extremely picky tourist. He is a guide-not a servant.Thanks Wayan! I'll be emailing you soon for my airport transport!"

He was also very informative and entertaining, explaining to us a lot about the Balinise culture and Hinduism in Bali. The only sad thing I have to say is that our trip was too short that we regret not booking it a bit longer so we could still explore Bali more with Wayan Suka and with Amansuka tours.

We visited a traditional Balinese Home, art gallery, waterfall, volcanoe, rice terraces, wood carving, coffee plantation and even a ceremony taking place at a temple in a local village. Our day was packed full but it flew by so quickly. The best part of the trip was Amansuka himself, so knowledgeable of Balinese custom, he accompanied us whereever we wanted to go and went to great lengths to explain everything we wanted understand! Amansuka's English was great, he was very funny and also quite spiritual; we learnt some great lessons about ourselves and about how life should really be lived. \"Always smile, it costs nothing and most of all, be happy!\" We highly recommend having a tour and spending a day with him."

It was so much to see in one day!! He accompanied us to the Monkey Forest, which I appreciated because I would have been very skiddish to give monkeys bananas, but he ensured us it was safe, and it was so fun! He recommended a great place for us to eat lunch overlooking a volcano and took pictures of us during the entire trip. After our day tour, he asked us if we wanted transportation to the airport. He was cheaper than our resort, so we said yes, but our flight didn't leave until 1 am. Wayan dropped us off in the city to get massages and dinner, picked us back up and then drove us to the airport with very short notice! Most of all, my favorite part was listening to his lessons on Balinese lifestyle and insight, which I found extremely inspiring. He literally made me want to move to Bali and live life like they do!

However the tour was a big disappointment. As it turns out this company works with several guides named Wayan (as it is the name given to firstborns in Bali) and not all of them are equally good guides. Reading the reviews and looking at the website one can get the impression that there is only one Wayan. This is not the case, but they failed to clear this up.Our guide was quite different from what you can read here. His English wasn't good and therefore it was hard to follow his blurry explanations you really had to concentrate to get like at least half of it. He brought us to all the must see places of course, but any driver could have done that for less. We didn't get any information on Balis history, and had to look up all the places afterwards. On the first day he brought us to a very touristy restaurant at lake Batur. It was a fishy looking badly presented buffet lunch at a price for 135k/person. It was a rip off considering the quality of food and considering that we had very nice food throughout our stay in Indonesia for a lot less. When we told him, he said that there one has to pay for the view and not for the food. Next day we ended up eating at a similar place. When we told him that we are not impressed at all, he said that two months ago it was a good place maybe they had changed the chef since... Then I have checked Tripadvisor again, as I could not believe that this service has so good reviews and only then did I realise that the guy smiling on the pictures here in the reviews is not the guy driving the car I am sitting in. Huge disappointment.I am sure that our Wayan is a really nice person as well, I am sure he did his best, but we expected more and the whole story felt like a tourist scam. We had several drivers during our stay here in Bali and this service was in no ways better than theirs only more expensive. We would have been better off with 'just a driver' and looking up all the stories for ourselves. We just thought a guide would be a nice treat at the end of our stay in Bali.At the end my husband tried to tell him how disappointed we are but obviously he only understood 'tripadvisor' and 'compliment' instead of 'complaint' as he encouraged us to write a review so they get better rankings. It was very sad."

Wayan picked us up from Seminyak and took us on a fantastic tour to Ubud - from cultural dances to holy temples, and mountain views to monkey forests, this day trip had it all. Wayan was very responsive from the first time we were in touch, and was very knowledgeable about Balinese history and its cultural and religious background. He was also a very pleasant tour guide, who would be happy to assist when required but also provide you with the independence to go and explore different locations on your own. Highly recommended!"

Wayan was responsive on emails and is able to customize the itinerary to your interests and travel needs. My friend and I were picked up from our Ubud hotel at 8:30 and we asked to visit a range of temples and a waterfall before heading to Seminyak to check in at our next hotel. His personalised service was a bargain at USD55 (IDR 700k) for the day since we covered a lot of ground. We got to visit a number of temples of varied structures and significance (gunung kawi, tirta empul, goa gajah) as well as a nice lunch stop overlooking ricefields, an afterlunch swim at tegenungan waterfalls, and even Uluwatu temple for the stunning cliff views. Wayan accompanied us at each of the sites and was very informative about the temples as well as about Balinese life and philosophies in general. It was a fantastic day and I would not hesitate to recommend his service to all.\u00a0"

I did the Singaraja Lovina tour, visiting the stunning Ulun Danu Bratan temple where we arrived before the tour buses and we stumbled on a local religious ceremony - Wayan explained to me what was happening, so I was able to appreciate it much more than I would have if I'd found it on my own. We also went to a beautiful waterfall (note: the walk to Gitgit Waterfall is somewhat difficult, but Wayan was patient with me), had a relaxed lunch on a quiet beach, and visited a scenic monastery and an interesting holy hot spring - I thought the itinerary sounded very ambitious, but we got through everything, and I didn't feel rushed.I booked direct with Amansuka Tours by email - it was easy to do since Wayan usually replied to my emails within 24 hours. He offered an airport transfer, that was great too - Wayan's nephew (he was lovely but I've forgotten his name) picked me up at the airport with my name on a sign, we had a really interesting chat on the long drive to Ubud, and he even gave me a free orientation drive around town. I also asked for a transfer to my next hotel in Seminyak, that too was a fun ride with Wayan's nephew.I paid just 60USD for the day tour, an amazingly good deal - Viator charges about twice that, and I think (based on prior experience elsewhere in South East Asia) hotels would also charge twice that if you ask them to arrange a guide for you. For each transfer I paid 25USD, that's slightly more than what online searches say the taxi fare is, but I think it's worth paying a little more to feel as safe as I felt with this company."

Wayan was always attentive, quick to learn my preferences, always polite and ready to chat and answer my questions. I went to Ubud without planning much sightseeing, but the day was worth it and Wayan made it so. The rice terrace was beautiful. It was a hot day but Wayan patiently walked with me. Too bad that the sun set was cloudy, but we compensated it with a banana pancake with a view of Tanah Lot and the ocean. Maybe it was menat to be, now I have another reason to come back to Bali, nice clear sun set at Tanah Lot.So thank you Wayan, hope to see you again sometime, in my next visit."

Wayan took us to the local market and we picked out some fruit and tried a couple other interesting snacks. One being a rice and banana snack all wrapped up in a banan leaf. It was really delicious. Our guide explained so much to us about local traditions and rituals and answered the millions of questions I had. Following there we went to a locals house and hung out with a family. We got to see their home and the way they live. This was a heart warming experience. The one man was an amazing painter. I just loved his work so much I refused to leave without one of his pieces to take home. I'm very grateful to be able to hang his work up at home. He also had a niece about 2 years old and she was just adorable. She melted my heart. We also visited the rice terrace which was so beautiful. Wayan knew all the good trails to take and tips to avoid additional costs by taking photos with the workers etc . He also demonstrated his skills in the bamboo drums ( I don't remember the actual name for the instrument) but Wayan was really good. We then proceeded to lunch with a stunning view of the active volcano. We had the choice of eating at the fancy touristy restaurant or the local one across the street. We chose to the local one and it was very very good. We then proceeded to holey water temple. Thank goodness for Wayan being so prepared. I forgot all about the appropriate attire for the temple and he had come with extra sarongs which worked out awesome. Wayan knew the history and legendary stories of the temple which was so fascinating. It felt very majestic walking around, kind of like the eat pray love vibe. I really enjoyed it. Lastly we headed to the waterfall. This was fun,great views. (Tons of stairs) cool spot for pictures. We didn't go swimming but we did cross and hike up the other side of the cliff which was stunning. I really couldn't say enough positive things about this tour and our guide. He made our trip in ubud so memorable. I learnt so much from him and am so grateful to have met him. I highly recommend doing this tour. "

Wayan also made some suggestions that complimented the all-day private tour e.g. visiting a traditional/authentic Balinese home (with people inside going about their daily business) and a swim at the nearby waterfall. Wayan engaged us in the history of Bali including the Hindu religion and rituals. We visited the usual tourist areas such the volcano, monkey forest and temples but a nice unscheduled side stop was to a coffee plantation where we tasted the famous 'Bucket List' lewak coffee. The whole day was zero stress or no stop offs being driven to pre-determined shops (like is typically done in China). Wayan was keen to take us to wherever we wanted to go for a long as we liked. We eventually 'tapped out' at 4:30p and arrived back at our hotel.

Right from our first contact with Wayan, to the confirmation email, the prompt timing of pick-ups at our separate addresses (one in Seminyak, we were in Ubud) to the abundance of knowledge about Bali and the Hindu culture, the humour and value for money, I have to say that Wayan went above and beyond to make sure our day trip was a most memorable, informative and enjoyable experience.We saw the natural beauty of the waterfall at Tegenungan, the magnificence of the volcano at Kintamani (where Wayan said he preferred to take us to the quieter restaurant rather than the huge ones where the coach loads go) and the rice terraces just outside of Ubud at Tegallalang.Wayan gave us a deep insight into Balinese life and the Hindu culture and answered every question we asked with both a beautiful humility as well as a touch of cheeky humour. We visited a Balinese house, the Batuan temple and Tirta Empul (the holy water temple). The temple was founded in the 11th century but what impressed me most was the depth of Wayan's knowledge historically and factually, but also the mythology of the holy temple and the Hindu tradition of the Balinese.We could not have asked for a better day! And as for value for money, I had to send an email to re-confirm that it was correct. The price was per tour, not per person and at U$60 with two pick ups and a 7 hour day, we couldn't believe it. Just remember to take some extra cash for donations to temples of nominal entrance fees, a dollar here, a couple of dollars there, 3 dollars to enter Kintamani. It's all explained in the confirmation email from Wayan.Next time, we are in Bali we will do a day trip to West Bali and we will be calling Wayan. Thank you for showing us the best of Bali, you are the best of Bali.See you, next time, Martin & the gang"

First stop a walk (and photo opportunity), down into the rice paddies. It was a very hot day, so it was a relief to be handed a cold bottle of water and face towel once back in the car. We visited varies temples throughout the day, our favourite being Pura Tirta Empul, where we took part in a water purification ceremony. Another highlight was lunch, where we sat in a restaurant overlooking the beautiful Mount Batur (an active volcano).

We originally booked as we saw how highly rated he was on trip advisor and within a few hours of emailing him he had replied with a day free for us and a list of things he would recommend completely tailored to us. He also advised if there was anything extra we wanted to do just let him know and he would be happy to. He arrived perfectly on time and from the minute we got in his modern air conditioned car, I immediately liked him. He was so happy and friendly but so knowledgable. Everything we drove past he would let us know of its significance and I learnt more about Bali and Balonese people in that day than I did for my entire trip. The sights we saw were beautiful and it was by far my best day in Bali. For the sake of $50 between us for the whole day, with our own private tour guide, it was just such great value for money! He knew EVERYTHING. I really really cannot stress enough how incredible Wayan was. These reviews certainly were not lying! He told us so much about their culture and religious beliefs and showed us places that we would have no idea existed just by looking on Google. If you are considering a tour to do whilst in Ubud you will regret it if you don't book with him. It's probably the best value for money I've ever got. Wayan is a wonderful man, and Ubud is an incredibly beautiful place. I will never forget yesterday, ever. Ps he's also a man united fan so if that's not a reason to book with him then I don't know what is!"

Our experience was so wonderful that we booked him for two more days of touring. Wayan was professional, reliable, informative, and a pleasure. Our conversations with Wayan Suka helped us get to know Bali in a way that would have been missed had our trip not included him. We feel very fortunate to have found him and you will too!"

I told him I wanted to see rice fields and a waterfall, and showed him the names of the most known ones (that I found online, and people had told me about). He then said he could take me to an even nicer waterfall with not as many tourists, and the same with the rice paddies. And boy am I happy he suggested that. The waterfall was just stunning, and we were the first ones there. So peaceful. The rice paddies he took me to see were also mindblowing, it was just such a huge area and it was all so lush and green. Simply beautiful! He also told me a lot about balinese culture and their beliefs. His english is so good, and I had a wonderful time listening to him, learning new things. He also took me to the Baturiti coffee plantation where I got to try the famous Kopi Luwak. Very interesting and cool experience. I have been on a quite a few tours around the world, and this is one of the best ones! :) strongly recommed it!"

We spent two days travelling around Bali with Wayan Suka, and choose him as our driver based on the reviews we had read about him, but also because he offered the most flexibility of any of the drivers I researched prior to coming to Bali. We were not disappointed; he was absolutely wonderful. His prices are very reasonable, and he was kind, attentive, helpful, and flexible. He seemed to have a great sense of his guests, giving us space when we wanted to rest and take in the experience and providing us with information when we needed it. I would absolutely recommend him as a safe, trustworthy, and knowledgeable guide. From our encounter with him, we were left with the sense that he is a man of integrity and works very hard to ensure everything runs smoothly for visitors to Bali. He deserves every bit of the positive feedback he receives. Thanks Wayan, for a wonderful few days touring Bali :-)"

He replied promptly to my email giving me suggestions and options of what we could do and said we could cater it to what we wanted. I am 20 weeks pregnant so I didn't want to stay out the whole day or do anything too strenuous, which he took into account. We visited a Balinese house, a waterfall, the Tirta Empul temple, the volcano, had a delightful lunch at sari organik, stopped by for durian and the cantik coffee plantation. During the whole trip Wayan kept us informed and entertained, we learnt about the Balinese way of life, their philosophies and culture. He also happily answered all our questions and provided water and cold towels for our day. I had emailed a few other private tours which either offered to put us into bigger groups, or charged by per person whereas with wayan, he took just us, and charged for per car so it was definitely the best deal which turned out to be a great way to spend the day!"

When we booked Wayan at the last minute I braced myself for the possibility of reckless driving, hard to understand English, or being subjected to a lot of info we could easily find ourselves on the Internet. What a wonderful relief. Wayan was none of those things. Actually, he was the polar opposite. He crafted a remarkable day, tailored for our interests. He imparted his great knowledge of Balinese history and culture in a way that made me want to hear more. We had an amazing day. I would not hesitate to recommend Wayan to anyone who wants to get better acquainted with beautiful Bali."

We could not have been more pleased with the sights that we took in and felt that we saw so much in just a day. Wayan arrived promptly at the time he had quoted in a very clean van. His driving was excellent which says a lot as Bali driving is not easy. He was extremely informative at each stop and welcomes questions, delivering his answers with impeccable English. He offered to take photos for us at each stop and always had the best tips for getting the most out of each place. I don't think I spend better money during our stay in Bali. If you want to see a lot in a short period of time, and are looking for both transport as well as background knowledge on the places that you are going- then Wayan is the guide for you."

He showed us many many beautiful views, a dance, temples, a random regular Balinese house (apparently you can just walk in any traditional Balinese home) and explained its composition, talked of many nice stories of his religion and their views, and shared a lot of interesting facts about their culture and way of living. We saw monkeys, waterfalls, a volcano, royal temple, markets, a guy climbing a palm tree bare handed to let me drink from a fresh coconut etc etc.Wayan Suka, \"your friend\" (as he calls himself), was insanely kind, super funny and very knowledgeable. We HAD to see him again, so we asked him to bring us to the airport few days later.Few tips: (1) ask him about: smiles, problems, and positivity. Very inspiring views.(2) don't let your hotel organize this tour. It cost us 15 dollars more because the resort claimed a part."

I was picked up from a friend's home near Seminyak and customized my own tour until we reached Ubud. We visits temples are various other tourist sites. I stayed 2 days in Ubud and was picked up by the same driver and headed back to my friend's home (again stopping along the way to eat, shop, and see). I was lucky enough to happen upon a ceremony at a small local temple that only happens once one's life. ( I want to say every 100 years.....at least that's what I was told) there were only 2 other tourists there who also happened to be using this company on that day. Wayan was kind, patient, and speaks perfect English. As a female solo traveler, I soon felt comfortable and relaxed riding with him, The price was very reasonable. I was told I could do and go wherever I wanted for 1 flat price for the day. I found it to be very affordable."

Any questions we had he could answer, always with a smile on his face. We got to see all we wanted to see and returned home very satisfied. I highly recommend Amansuka tours to any one who wants to know more about the real Bali and is looking for that little extra service."

Every point of interest we went to he gave us a tour and in-depth information about everything we needed to know and things we would not have necessarily found out elsewhere.As lovers of all things food, talk mostly got on to Balinese cuisine. He would even stop off and buy us various types of food throughout the day, because he was so excited for us to try it all. Telling us to wait in the car so we wouldn't get charged a 'tourist price'. I couldn't recommend Wayan highly enough and advise everyone to book with him. Humble, clever, friendly, funny and just an all round great guy."

I am a single 60 year old female and it was my first time to Bali, so I was a bit nervous at first to hire a private driver who could show me around the island and suggest a few places I would like to visit. I am forever grateful to the people I met in Kuta at the beginning of my trip who recommended Amansuka Tour. I felt very safe with their excellent drivers. Their english is also excellent and if you are not sure where or how you would like to spend your day having fun in the sun, they will give you excellent suggestions. Amansuka Tour is an absolute must. I had two separate drivers and both of them were just the best ever. Plus, their prices are very reasonable. I would use them again in a second."

We were looking for some handmade art, and he helped us figure out the best shops to visit for the style and price range we were looking for. He also gave great explanations of the cultural and religious beliefs and helped us understand Bali culture in a way that would have taken us weeks or months to learn on our own. The people of Bali are deeply religious and spiritual, and Amansuka helped us experience that part of their life. I am leaving Bali with a new found respect for Hindu and the Balinese.

Both tours felt very tailored to us and Wayan was very sensitive to my abilities with the temple steps and the sticky heat! He even stopped to give me a little bit of reflexology when the heat got to my head. I felt as though I learned so much more about Balinese culture than I would have if we had directed ourselves and it was particularly special to spend some time in the morning market and a Balinese home which gave us a taste of what Balinese life is really like.

First of all thanks Tripadvisor and fellow reviewers for writing reviews which helped me to find a friend in Bali.Right from my first email, Wayan Amansuka was quick to respond (considering the time zones) and helped me to plan visits in Bali. His suggestions were meaningful and helped me. We availed his services for 3 Days and airport drop on day 4. We had great time with him. He is local and born and brought up in Bali and hence know each and every detail. He was happy to share details of culture and explained us everything very well. Also, he planned the trips nicely and took us to places at perfect hour of the day. He is flexible and accommodated our request to change schedules and tours per our needs and likes. He is a very good driver and drives safely keeping speed in check. Highly recommended for private tours in Bali. I will definitely contact him whenever I will plan a trip to Bali."

Besides the fact that Bali is a very beautiful place, it was enhanced more by Wayan because he explained very well the nuances of their culture , their way of life and their beliefs. He speaks English very well , hence, he was able to convey the emotions and experiences of the Balinese people. He is almost poetic.He is very patient and understanding - catering to our specific requests. Good driver too.I would wholeheartedly recommend to anyone to take his tour. Great job."

We both immediately felt at ease with Wayan, and his friendly manner.His wealth of knowledge about Bali, it's history and culture, made for a very enjoyable day. We learnt so much about Bali just by chatting with Wayan on a wide range of topics.We have been on many day tours over the years, but this trip will stick with us as the best. The scenery is amazing (Tanah Lot takes some beating), but in this case it was Wayan who made it memorable. His attitude to life was amazing and his love of Bali shone throughout the day."

He knew so much about Bali, and he also had great marriage advice (seriously!).There was one hiccup - in our emails with Wayan prior to our tour date, we scheduled a tour with him to pick us up from Seminyak and drive us to Ubud (our next location). The day before our tour, I emailed confirming what time he would pick us up and let him know what hotel we were at in Seminyak (a well known hotel). Wayan misunderstood and also couldn't read the entire email, so he went to our hotel in Ubud to pick us up the next morning. But we were waiting for him in Seminyak. After emails and calling him, we agreed to continue with the day, and Wayan drove to Seminyak to pick us up. We started the day an hour and a half after we had planned (11:00 instead of 9:30), which was a bummer, but we're confident that this was a one time hiccup for Wayan. He was apologetic, and we understood the miscommunication. Not a big deal for us (we're pretty relaxed), but just something to keep in mind in terms of confirming with him!"

We wanted to see some of Bali, but the real life and not just the tourist attractions. Asked him to make a program. The price was very reasonable.Wayan picked us up at 9 and we went to a local market. By coincidence we witnessed a huge ceremony at this village. Beautiful. We toured the market and Wayan, being a farmer himself, was able to explain a lot.From there we went to a ricefield where we made a walk and talked with him about Bali agriculture, met some farmers on the way. Interesting.Time to go for a Bali coffee at a street stand. Across the street a ceremony was going on in a temple and Wayan gave us the proper dress to attend the ceremony. There was cock fighting, dance, a lot of offering and we felt welcome. It was impressive and the explanations of Wayan helped understanding all of it.From here we went to visit a Balinese house and again the explanations were very good.After a lunch at a local warung we went to see a big temple (forgot the name) and on to Tanah Lot. Actually, you probably need to see Tanah Lot, but for us the rest of the day had been much more interesting.We really enjoyed this tour. Wayan is a pleasant, open guy to talk to. He is very knowledgeable and explains it all very well. A great day !!! Thanks Wayan."

That was huge for me because I wanted to get out of the touristy areas, which meant traveling further out and on some rougher roads! By the end of an amazing two days, we were more than happy to give Wayan some extra tip money because of his amazing attitude and services. We also felt so safe and taken care of with Wayan, which was important for us as two young women traveling around Bali. Wayan took us to a VERY local market after hearing that we wanted to eat some local fare. While we were scarfing down suckling pig, Wayan bought us a drink that soothes stomachs (to prevent \"Bali belly\") and bought me several coconut peanut snacks found at local markets, which he had also overheard me saying I loved-- so so sweet of him!! I could not get over his hospitality. He also taught me a little Hindu life lesson about appreciating the good and forgetting the bad. This helped me through the next day when I had a terrible sunburn- I just reminded myself of the amazing adventures that lead me to the pain of the sunburn :). Thanks again for everything Wayan!!"

We used his services for 3 days, and even though we probably didn't see all of what Bali has to offer, he clearly gave us a good insight of the Balinese culture. We started our tour on day one from Sanur and finished in Ubud from where we saw most of the center on day 2. For our last tour he drove us until Jimbaran and showed us very nice sites on the way trying to avoid al the touristic crowd. I highly recommend him, he's very flexible, and a very safe driver. He always have good suggestion on what to see and if you feel like doing something different during the day you can always change your plans last minute. If it's possible, he will help you.

He is fantastic, really highly recommend."

We emailed him a list of things we would like to see, and he arranged two excellent day tours for us. He drove us around and told us a lot of interesting things about Bali and it's culture. His English is very good and he is friendly and chatty. He picked us up from the hotel in time and was in no hurry to get back before we felt we had seen whatever we needed to. Highly recommended."

We communicated with Wayan before our arrival to be picked up at the airport and dropped off on the day of our departure. Wayan communicated with us efficiently and in a timely manner. He is a great driver and speaks English very very well. He is very knowledgeable and funny. We communicated with him about some of the sights we were interested in visiting, and based on our interests he was able curate an unforgettable low stress day of sightseeing. We learned a lot about Bali culture and Wayan obviously took pride in making sure we were comfortable and all our needs were met. Our day with Wayan was definitely the highlight of our trip and I will be recommending his service to anyone I meet who is interested in visiting Bali."

Suka is a really friendly and thoughtful guy that helps you plan your trip to get to know Bali. He can tell you a lot about Balinese culture and traditions which provides a nice background for the places you visit and gives you a better insight in their way of life. He knows his way around the island very well and sometimes made a random stop at a market or foodstand to explain us about and let us taste some of the local products and fruits that people sell. Our day with him was one of the highlights of our vacation."

We ended up going to a traditional Balinese market, hiking to a waterfall, visiting a local household, seeing three amazing temples, stopping by a wood carving village, having lunch overlooking a volcano, and visiting a local coffee plantation. The day was planned perfectly and we felt like we were quickly immersed in all the culture Bali had to offer. Wayan was so much more than a tour guide-- he made us feel so welcome and was incredibly fun to be around. We ended up booking him as our driver for the remainder of the trip. It was great to have a local's insight, especially in a not-so-touristy area (we stayed in Ubud for most of our trip). I would 100% recommend his tours to everyone visiting Bali, and I would definitely be booking another tour when I visit again!"

After doing a bit of research online, we decided that it would be best to hire a driver to take us around each day, rather than depending on taxi\u2019s. I found Wayan Amansuka through Trip Advisor and after reading all of his wonderful reviews, decided to book him for the week. From the first communication, I was extremely impressed by Wayan. He was very professional and friendly in all of his emails. He read through the itinerary we put together and provided great feedback on how to make it better. He included prices for each of the daily tours and called out any entrance fees that may apply. Wayan\u2019s prices are also very reasonable, ranging from $50-60 USD for 8-10 hours of driving and $30 USD for airport transfers. Some may say that you can find cheaper drivers on the street, but I can guarantee they won\u2019t be as good as Wayan Amansuka! Before leaving for our trip, we felt comfortable and confident in Wayan and his team and were excited to meet him at the airport. Unfortunately, our flight arrived late and we had no way to contact Wayan. However, as soon as we got through customs, we saw Wayan waiting to greet us with a big smile! Over the next week, we hung out with Wayan and team for 3 day tours and 2 hotel/airport transfers. Wayan\u2019s nephew, Arjana, took us on a tour of South Kuta, Wayan\u2019s best friend, Madea, took us on a tour to Lovina, and Wayan himself accompanied us on a tour to North Kuta\u2026all of which was amazing! With Amansuka and team, you will feel comfortable, safe, and most importantly, you will have a great time! Wayan and team were always punctual in picking us up and also flexible with our plans throughout the day. If we wanted to stop for photos or to grab something to eat, they did so without hesitation. We truly felt that they were there to accommodate us and make sure that we were having a great time. They also provided HEAPS of great information. We can honestly say that the best part of our trip was learning about the culture and religion in Bali. Something else to point out is the fact that Wayan and team are all awesome drivers. If you have ever been to Bali you know how chaotic the roads are. We had no idea what to expect and let\u2019s just say that we were SO thankful to have Wayan and team driving us around. Wayan and team also had clean, reliable cars with air conditioning. They provided us with bottled water and even whipped out little snacks every now and then. With Wayan and team, conversation also flowed easily. We spent a lot of time in the car driving and never once did we feel awkward or uncomfortable. Overall, we were very satisfied with the services we received from Wayan Amansuka and team and would highly recommend them to anyone visiting Bali. Thank you Wayan and team for showing us your beautiful country and for creating amazing memories with us!"

My brother and I spent two days with Wayan at the beginning of a three week trip to Indonesia and a month later we're still talking about those two days! From our first communication with Wayan via email, to our final goodbyes at the airport, our experience was first-rate. We contacted Wayan a few weeks before our trip explaining the kind of cultural experiences we hoped to have. He didn't disappoint. We saw intriguing historical sites, walked the beautiful ricefields at Tegalalang, visited a traditional family compound, and enjoyed some gorgeous scenery. But talk about going above and beyond - - - - Wayan had also contacted friends in the area about unique ceremonies/celebrations that might be taking place while we were there. As a result, he was able to take us to temples and small villages where we saw some very special and traditional activities. Joining a once-every-thirty-years procession (wearing traditional sorongs and headress provided by Wayan) is just one example of the incredible experiences we had on our tour! Everything others have said about his demeanor is true. He is kind, funny, thoughtful, knowlegable, charming, sincere and committed to providing you a memorable experience you'll never forget. Terima Kasih, Wayan!"

He has a calm and gentle personality and is sensitive to his surroundings. If we had many questions, he was comfortable conversing with us about anything. If we wanted some quiet, he was respectful and not intrusive. Even though we only had one day with him, I feel like we got to see and understand something about Bali, not just through the sights that he brought us to, but also in spending time with him. He patiently answered all of our questions and provided a window of insight into the Balinese culture that we will remember long after we have forgotten the places we visited. His love for his people and culture is evident and he clearly enjoys his job. Wayan was well-prepared for the trip, including umbrellas for the rain and sarongs so that we could enter the temple. He brought us to the places that we were interested in and was never pushy about us going particular places or buying anything. He never rushed us and was highly competent in every way. It was a thoroughly enjoyable day and I would highly recommend Amansuka Tours to anyone visiting Bali for whatever reason."

I also arranged for him to collect our friends the following afternoon which was not a problem. The day tour to Lovina was good fun. A long drive but we wanted to check out some of the out-of-the-way places. We were due to go to Git Git waterfall but as I'd been before he suggested an alternative. The 6 of us ended up at nungnung waterfall. It was AMAZING!! We were the only travellers there and we swum as close as we could to the roaring water. So much fun. A steep climb of about 400 steps each way so it's not for the faint hearted. We also visited Ulun Danu Bratan temple. Wayan organised for his nephew to help take us all down to Legian on our departure. No problems whatsoever. I highly recommend Wayan and will contact him again on our next visit (and hope that he's not booked out which may be the case as word gets out about his super service and reliability. I found the pricing of his transfers and day tours very affordable so we made sure to tip him a bit extra for his time. ps... We loved his jokes - had us all in stitches! See you next time Wayan : )"

He very kindly arranged for us to go to Bali Bird Park as the first stop on our tour as he knew this was when the birds would be most active and we would be there in time to see one of their great shows.After the bird park he had cold bottles of water waiting for us and later in the day he had more water and cold towels to refresh ourselves which was a thoughtful touch and very much appreciated.We also stopped at a Luwak coffee plantation, Goa Gajah, Tirta Empul and Tegalalan Rice Terrace. At each of these stops Wayan was an excellent and informative guide, providing us with so much information we that really added to our experience. At lunch he took us to a wonderful restaurant, Bebek Tepi Sawah, which turned out to be one of the best meals we had on our holiday. Wayan was happy to take photos for us and answer any of our questions. He tells some hilariously bad jokes too - such a funny man!Wayan offered to make other stops after our last stop, including a tour of a Balinese home, which we were not able to do on the day but I will most definitely be back and will book Wayan for a few days to do this and more.I often travel alone and have hesitated to book private tours in the past for safety reasons - I would absolutely book Wayan when I am travelling alone in future.

On the drive to my hotel, he was already pointing out notable sights and introducing me to the local culture and traditional practices. As a female that was traveling alone, I felt very safe with Wayan as my guide. He was always very polite, a safe driver, and a great teller of jokes. He even helped me locate my hotel - which was located down a dodgy little alleyway at night. Later in my stay, Wayan took a friend and I on a private tour, sprinkling fun facts throughout a day visiting temples, rice paddies, and even a Balinese home. When we wanted to do a bit of shopping, he even went ahead and negotiated better prices than tourists would ever be able to secure alone. In addition, every time we stopped at a new location, he would pull a new surprise out of the back of the car: local fruits, bottles of water, cooling cloths, and more. Because of Wayan, I feel as though I have more of an insider perspective of the culture and a resulting affection for it as well. You can tell that he truly loves where he comes from and wants to share that love with everyone he encounters. I am lucky to be able to call Wayan my friend, and I hope our paths will cross again one day."

His knowledge of Balinese culture and history was terrific.His English is also fantastic and always responds to emails. We took over 2 hours to get out of the airport on arrival but our transport was awaiting us without any problem.We would use Wayan again without hesitation."

I contacted him before I left for Bali and informed him of where I would be staying and where I would end up. Wayan planned the sights to see on our trip based on what I had wanted to see. I didn't have e-mail access the first week in Bali but he took the initiative to call the place I was staying to confirm the pick up time! Amazing because I was worried that he would have tried to contact me and I had no way of contacting him. I was really impressed by his initiative and determination. He picked me up on time and took me to several places, during the drive he explained Bali culture, education, marriage, etc-shared so much and I learned a tremendous amount on the drive with him. He is also great at taking photos based on what he's learned from other tourist. He is funny and likes to tell jokes. Unfortunately I needed to be picked up at 10 instead of the suggested 8am and it cut the tour short since it was too dark to see anything- so keep that in mind. Most drivers will charge you what Wayan Amansuka will charge you without the tour guide knowledge and experience. He picks you up in a great car with air condintioning and provides bottled water during the ride. I would definately recommend him to anyone interested in seeing the best sites and learning about Bali culture."

He also drove very carefully at all times through the at times crazy Bali traffic.We enjoyed his tours and insights into his Balinese life, he took us to some lovely places in and around his native Ubud, and tried his best to make all the locations we wanted to visit fit within a sensible schedule. He has also kept in touch with us since we left, and I would certainly contact him should we return to Bali one day to use his services again, which I shouldn't forget to mention were of great value.Two very enthustiastic thumbs-up for Wayan, would not hesitate to recommend him to anyone...Martin & Helena"

Wayan is a native of Ubud who is clearly passionate about helping visitors understand his culture and religion and the way it pervades the everyday life of locals in Ubud. He does this in a very sincere and matter of fact way without ever slipping into the Western pandering mysticism that sometimes cloaks Bali. He will tell you about how he and everyone else grew up learning the traditional arts. He will tell you about growing rice and how his family still growth their own today. He will tell you the meaning of all the little decorative offerings in front of homes. He will tell you where to find quality local art or jewellery but only if you ask. He will never push you to go shopping. Wayan is also an accredited and fully licensed Indonesian Guide. This is very important if you want to visit the Mother Temple of Besakih, which is frankly a must-see in Bali. Unfortunately, the Mother Temple is plagued by organized thugs that demand 100,000+ Rp from each visitors as is well documented on TripAdvisor. The only people they will not bother are those accompanied by a licensed Indonesian Guide. We walked straight in having only paid the de minimus actual admission fee and had access to the entire temple including those areas for locals only. Wayan's knowledge of the Temple far exceeding anything in the guide books and he turned what for many is a horrible Balinese experience into one of our best Balinese experiences. Wayan's rates are very reasonable and just a slight premium over the cheapest drivers you can find. He charged me 550,000 Rp (about US$60) for a 10 hour tour all over Bali. Frankly, for the money you spend getting to Bali, you would be crazy to go with someone other than Wayan because of price."

Like other reviewers on here we booked before we went with Wayan because of his quick and courteous emails and the considered advice that he gave us regarding the most appropriate tours and use of our time. Wayan's high level of customer service continued from there. He always ensured that we saw what we wanted and that we had the time that we wanted at each location. He was happy to adjust the day throughout as we saw fit without hesitation. I cannot recommend his services enough if you want to get out and see some of Bali beyond the tourist hot-spots. Wayan's knowledge is fantastic and he shares it in an enthusiastic yet not overbearing way. Wayan will welcome you like an old friend and treat you with the same warmth and hospitality. Initially we booked to spend one day with Wayan however because we enjoyed the first day so much we booked a second day as soon as we could. We probably would have booked another if we had the time as we saw so much of Bali that we wouldn't have done without a knowledgeable, friendly and enthusiastic guide. On the second day of touring with Wayan my other half and Wayan were talking about how much we had enjoyed the local sambal. The next day before we left to travel home Wayan delivered some homemade sambal to our hotel so that we could enjoy the taste of Bali for a bit longer once we arrived home. You certainly don't get that service from many places at all!Like I say, I highly recommend at least one day touring Bali with Wayan. It is certainly well worth the money you will pay."

Suka speaks excellent English, is familiar with the entire island, and also can help you acquire a SIM card to use your phone locally. During hot day trips he was thoughtful enough to bring along cold towels and water bottles in the ice box of his car."

Early in the morning we went to some real markets away from all the tourism and even experienced the true local lifestyle while we visited a completely foreign family in their house. For me it was the moment when I realized how friendly and completely different bali's people are.Furthermore we had the chance to hike along rice fields and at the end of our day we drove up to mount Agung enjoyed the view of a big lake and a volcano ( sorry, i forgot the names). Finally we arrived in Pura Besakih which was despite the reviews on tripadvisor an amazing temple and because of our licensed tourist guide Wayan Suka not a single person touched or bothered us.The best thing about all is that Wayan Suka planed the whole trip for us. But if you wish he will drive you where ever you want.As a person he was really friendly, always smiling and happy to show and tell you things...a real friend on the tour!He is a real balinese who can show you all the secrets of his culture. By far more than just a driver and worth every single cent and much more!Highly recommended to everyone!Thank you for that great day,Tim & Anne"

Wayan was highly recommended to us by friends who had a wonderful experience in Bali and we also had an excellent holidays in Bali with Wayan's guidance. He is a down to earth, friendly, polite and honest man who speaks good English. He can taylor to whatever type of holidays you require. A group of 6 of us holidayed together in Bali and Wayan showed us around in this air conditioned mini van. It was spacious and comfortable. We told him roughly what we'd like to see and eat and he was able to plan a comfortable relaxing itinerary for us, including lunch on the mountain overlooking volcano, dinner on the beach watching sunset and simple street food. He even prepared lunch with cold towels & drinks when we were in excursions where food was not readily available.He was also able to take us to good foreign exchange offices where locals exchange the money (with excellent rate, much better than the airport) and how to avoid tourist traps in one of the temples. He is also very passionate and knowledgable about the culture of Bali. We experience not just the beautiful sceneries but also the culture, history and religion of Bali.We highly recommend using Wayan to experience Bali."

If you need a driver in Bali - to take you on a fantastic tour (a few hours, a day, a few days - your choice) - Wayan Suka of Amansuka Tours is fantastic. We have used him many times. He has a good car, is an excellent driver, speaks good English (plus some other languages), and is passionate and knowledgeable about the culture of Bali. He is also very moderately priced. He will take you on back roads if you want, show you rice fields, temples, a village, a silver smith, shopping, whitewater rafting, volcanos ...or whatever. He is from the village of Kedewatan just to the west of Ubud, but will travel anywhere ... and will guide you, or wait for you if you prefer. For his contacts, and website, see http://amansukatour.com/ He is also on facebook - search on Wayan Suka Aman means safe and Suka means like, or sweet.He will also transport you to or from the airport if that's all you need."

We toured the cultural sites, we saw the artists and craftsmen at work and purchased gorgeous pieces that we are so excited to have brought back home! We also explored the different food options and learnt from him insights about the people and the culture.We highly recommend Gusti for your visit to Bali.

I'll share about how I met you since there are so many reviews.Sometime around 2012, I took a not-so-nice driver to Ubud and spent a day there with my wife. We told the guy to head back and we'd find our own way. After spending countless hours there, we didn't realise the sun was setting early.Now we had walked past this long-haired, ripped jeans, unshaven but rockstar looking dude a few times and he had asked us a few times in perfect english if we wanted a ride. We had politely turned him down, and he was still friendly. When he suddenly needed a ride, we chanced upon this rockstar again.The first good sign was the price, which was exactly what I had in mind. So off we went. That's how I met Gusti. Gusti brought me back faster through the back roads and in heavier traffic. Plus we discussed so many things about Bali in English. I liked him so much, we had dinner and a few beers together. It totally sucked that it was our last night there.Now we keep in touch via Facebook. I've recommended so many friends to him. And my next trip with my family will definitely be planned around Gusti's schedule! I hope he gets the recognition and accolades he deserves one day!"

He quickly became a friend and trusted partner of the tour and all of the fun we all had that week.Everyday I was impressed with his driving skills, and in Bali you need them! As a local he can quickly, safely and confidently navigate the twisting turning sometimes very steep roads of Bali (see if you can navigate passing slow drivers while leading a line of cars). And luckily for us, Gusti was able to cut 45 minutes off a long drive back to the hotel returning from Mount Batur because he knew the backroads, and that was after the sun went down.Gusti is professional as well as personable, and I would highly recommend him for corporate tours as well as personal trips. I have lived in Manhattan for many years and I have learned that expertise like this makes all the difference. After a short trip in another country, I returned to Bali, Gusti was coordinating a 15 car tour but he still made time to coordinate all the last minute drives I needed.If you want to visit the spiritual sites of Bali, Gusti can guide you through these as well. You will be able to approach the temples as the locals do, joining the ceremonies and participating as not as a tourist, but as a devotee. Gusti will lead you through it.Born and raised in Bali, Gusti knows the sites, locals that can help you, actual drive times and also negotiated prices for me. I can\u2019t tell you how valuable that was.If I were you I would call Gusti well in advance so he can be available for you, and give the planning and coordination of your vacation the attention it deserves.

We said we wanted to visit a holy spring temple (tirta) and perhaps do the aura cleansing ritual; he showed up next day with sarongs for us to borrow and he got for us the most amazing offering to bring to the temple. Wait, it doesn't end there, then he taught us the ritual, the prayers and he walked himself into the pond to shower away any bad energy (I doubt he had any) so we could follow.Unpredictable weather? We had a rainy day, but Gusti had a plan \"B\". Resourceful and reliable are both his middle names. He even took our laundry to his neighbor and brought it back folded, smelling fresh and ready to just throw inside the suitcase saving us time and space. A sincere smile, a contagious laugh, a beautiful spirit, a trustworthy professional...Gusti Badra is a total blessing.Thank you, Brother."

Gusti is not only reliable, good driver, great guide but an all round great guy. We had Gusti pick us up from the airport and then for a day trip up to Ubud. He took us to places I've never been to before which was great plus found us a great place to buy bean bags. Always smiling and joking I'll definitely be calling you again brother.....highly recommended!"

He picked me up from the airport and within 2 minutes of our trip from the airport to Ubud, I knew we'd become friends. Meeting Gusti was a blessing, he is an excellent driver, helped me with my visa, helped my find a place to live, invited me to join his traditional family ceremony, has organised my trips to climb volcanoes and visit Uluwatu and has been a wonderful friend. If you are coming to Bali, I highly recommend Gusti. He is a friendly guide, speaks excellent english and is quite funny - it makes a big difference on long trips having a hilarious and friendly driver. :)"

Gusti is very passionate about what he does, he doesn\u2019t say it, but you see it in him and you sense it in how he speaks fondly of people, places, and experiences. He is so passionate about sharing Bali, about sharing his culture, and that\u2019s what made us so thrilled during our trip. What we appreciate most is that, in between our planned schedule, Gusti would take us where the locals would go, the ones outside the main tourist track; where to have coffee, where to eat, what food to try etc. With Gusti, we never felt as outsiders to Bali, and it is an experience so worth sharing.

Our experience was really made by our guide (Name was Nikki/Dikki??) who was a lot of fun. The journey down the river last just under 2 hours and you get the opportunity to stop in the jungle for a coconut and a rest. As well as the fun of the rapids you also get to see local people using the river which was a humbling experience.Beware there is a number of steps to walk down and back up at the start and end. This is not to bad however for anyone unfit it may be more difficult in the heat.

Really it was enjoyable and fun especially if the boat leader is funny . The cost will varied from company to another but as I noticed in Bali you should try your best to decrease the price they first give u because every thing is negotiable . It cost us around 34 us dollar per person including the transfer from and to the resort. The river is located near the four season resort in ubud and also they will provide you with a lunch at the end of your journey but I do not recommend to eat it. The only drawback was you should use very long stairs in order to reach the river . I am highly recommending experience this activity for any visitor to Bali"

It's an endless laugh - so much fun - and the scenery along the way is unbelievable, what an amazing place.NOTE: The walk down the steps to the river was genuinely tricky. It was raining and it made the walk down pretty dangerous really - so best not to wear thongs, but rather some proper shoes that you don't mind getting muddy. I guess not an issue if not wet."

There was a 4 metre drop off a weir towards the end and this happened to be my 8 year olds favourite bit! My 10 year old loved it from start to finish as did myself and my husband. Our guide was wonderful and obviously new the river well. He negotiated the rapids with ease and ensured our safety throughout. We would highly recommend rafting on the Ayung."

The journey start after briefing by our guide/ instructor and we were heading to the river by going down about a hundred steps staircase (maybe more than that!). we love the rock carving along the bank not far from starting point and the \"ride\" was smooth that day with quite a few good rapids.....scenery was good along the river - hotels, paddy field, and met some friendly villagers. very good family activity!"

The trip down the river provided us with amazing views of the Bali jungle also with exciting Rapids. The tour guide we had was also great with a positive attitude. Bring a waterproof cameras or a GoPro. The bad part about this tour was the lunch which was well below average as well as the time driver took for us to leave once the tour was finished. We waited almost an hour which is simply not good enough. Overall the experience while rafting was amazing but the company needs to work on the smaller things such as customer service and the Lunch they provide. "

The scenery was stunning and we were delighted to see wild monkeys. It is best to take waterproof photographic equipment but that being said, the guide will keep cameras dry in a waterproof bag. Things to be aware of :Steep, slippery steps down to the river,Steep climb back after the trip.The things that rather spoiled the trip were pressure to buy the guide a beer when we stopped for refreshments and hassle from the guide to give him a tip. Further, the poor conditions of the showers and rather scungy area at the end of the trip was a little off-putting.That being said, I strongly recommend rafting as a must-do activity while you are in the Ubud area."

Our guide Jackie was good fun, there were 4 of us plus guide in our raft, we spent about 2 hours on the water with a stop half way where you could purchase drinks & snacks, these were overpriced $3 AUS for a can of coke, but I guess given the location & effort it takes to get stuff down to the river this is to be expected. After we finished on the river the climb out is very steep, we are both fit so had no problems whereas others were struggling. When we arrived back to rafting office we were given towels & could shower & dry off before eating lunch which was a buffet."

After you al get jammed into the back of a ute and taken a few k's up the road you then come to the great stair climb. One of my friends have mobility issues and it took almost an hour just to walk from the drop off to the rafts. The walk was through wet and eroding stairs that were far from safe with sheer drops at times. The rafting was quite placid with no real drops or high rating parts. The stopping points were nice as was the rock carvings. After you finish your met by another few hundred steps (a little safer than the first ones) then a buffet lunch which we chose not to eat and eat somewhere more reputable.Do yourself a favor and do the Telaga Waja river rafting. You will get it cheaper and much safer and better run"

WOW what can I say, this was just AWESOME, I am 55 years old and a little overweight and unfit, to get to the river for the rafting we had to walk down 1000 steps that were very steep and mostly just dirt with not a lot to hold onto so you need good footwear but we only had thongs on and managed ok. Once at the river they take your shoes and place in a bag along with other items you may have but they also supply a locker and key back at the headquarters where your personal things are safe. Once in the raft it is not stop fun and laughter for 1 1/2 hours, be prepared to get very wet, it is quite safe and you do have a life jacket on, the time we went the river was low and the rapids for only small, if you have a waterproof camera defiantly take it, as the waterfalls and scenery is lovely. I have not laughed so much in years, the guys that take you in the raft are fantastic and go out of their way to make sure you enjoy it. You are expected to paddle and there is a rope for you to hang onto. Once the rafting is finished you then have to walk up about 200 steps which is a little difficult but I managed it ok, just take your time, when back at the headquarters you are then given a towel to have a shower and change before sitting down to a small buffet lunch and there is a bar to buy a drink from as well. All this for $60.00 Australian dollars bloody fantastic cannot recommend this enough, is it for young children, not sure, there was a young girl maybe 8 or 9 that was in one of the other rafts with her parents and she was crying and scared at first but did settle ."

It is because after nearly two hours rafting, you still have to climb up more than seven hundred something steps to the parking lot high above the river, I think it is not an easy job. Walking down those slightly steep steps to the river is not exhausted. But after rafting down the river for hours, the adventure tired the children. At the very start, participants seem to be very energetic, but they are all in at the end. The river bursts its bank where waterfall runs deep. Sometimes when two rafts collided end on, everybody instantly screamed. The view burst upon your sight with a pleasant outlook over the valley. Ayung water rafting is very suitable for a beginner as the river is not too rough, besides, it is also safe."

You don't need to pay there, seance you can't bring money with you, but instead you pay at the end of the tour.The lunch afterwards is good (We had honeygreased chicken) and there are showers to clean yourself afterwards.Also you can buy pictures afterwards for 70k each, and they can also mail them to you for this price."

There is not a lot of white water but for us it was still fun. We took photo stops at the waterfall and stopped at the obligatory shop where you can buy drinks snacks and souvenirs.There were only 4 of us in our raft plus our guide/instructor. he was very nice and helpful. The rafting itself is hard work, after 2.5 hours I was exhausted. Yes at the end there are stairs, a lot of stairs, stairs that go on forever it seems, probably more so because you are already tired from paddling. You just have to get over it and eventually you will reach the top.There are showers and a feed included in our package. Simple food but tasty after such a workout.Reality is I have no complaints, it was a fun day out. Maybe a little long for me I reckon 1.5 hours would be enough but that is more a general observation than a complaint."

This is a great place to do some family bonding activity while in Bali. heard about the river rapids here is acceptable even for beginners. And so I brought my family along. The only downside to me is the long downward climb to the start point. Be careful that some of the steps are pretty steep. No recommended for anyone with handicap,The journey from the start point to the finish takes almost 2 hours. The scenery along the way is really breath-taking. you will get to be so close to nature yet enjoying every bit of view along the way. The guides here are very professional and fun. they make sure you enjoy and at the same time safe too. There is a waterfall at a rest point where participants get into the water to feel the cold water from the waterfall. After a 10 minutes rest, we continue our way further down to the next rest point, where we can buy some drinks to quench our thirst. you will be surprise how these vendors get there with drinks to sell to you. On the way to the finish point, there is a rapid drop where one get to feel the rush, this is a longer drop compare with those experienced earlier.Next is the long climb up to the road where they park the transport. This is one long climb, about 800 steps is all and some are pretty steep as well. Can be quite challenging for those with weak knees, hahaha...Other than that, this is a good experience to have."

Prices are steep but who's complaining when your desperate for some refreshments in the middle of nowhere. Overall good fun especially if you have never white water rafted before.

It's cheap, fun, great for a workout and it's sunny so you're not left high and dryI was picked up from my hotel promptly and taken to the site for rafting! I actually ratted alone as a single female and still had a great time...shame my fellow rafters didn't have as much energy with their oars as I had!!! The team given the safety demos and guiding us were brilliant true professionals doing everything to make our trip fun filled and safeThey even took my pics as being alone I didn't want to pose for selfies!!!! I did this alone whilst my other friends went on a jungle safari and I certainly enjoyed myself! Lunch was served after the rafting which, basic enough was delicious and hot!!!"

Driver was prompt and we were only 1 of 3 pick ups before we headed to the start lodge. Very professional set up and friendly and fun guides. Once down on the river the scenery is absolutely breath taking, and a view that you wouldn't see from any tour on land! There are shower facilities at the finish and a basic lunch included.Only downsides are if you are an adrenaline junkie this rafting is quite tame, more geared up for families and day trippers, there are even sections where you can get out and swim along. And there are a lot of steps down to the river and back up from it so if you find too many steps challenging then you should maybe look for a different company who start and end somewhere else."

People should be advised that they would have to go down 300-400 stairs as well as have to climb back up another 300-400 stairs after the whole rafting experience. Actually no. People should have been told this when they are making a booking. I am really unfit and though the rafting was alright, the stairs ruined the whole experience for me. I literally was on the verge of tears. That is how torturous those stairs were. My legs were aching for days after. There were 6 of us in total + a local instructors/guide. All of us were in slippers which were totally inappropriate footwear for all the climbing up and down those stairs. There was also no handrails and the stairs got pretty steep at some points. I was literally afraid that I was gonna go tumbling down like Humpty Dumpty. Unfortunately we went during a low tide season (which I felt should also have been advised to use as we were making a booking). Because of this, we got stuck between rocks plenty of times and there were times we had to get off the raft and swim for a bit cos it was too shallow. The swimming bit was lovely though. The water was refreshing but I was like a fish flopping around when I tried to climb back onto the raft again. The guide was very capable and experienced. And very fit too though he didn't quite look it. He was a bit of a perve though and made quite a few unsavory comments to all of us. It was mostly jungle view. Didn't see any animals or birds or anything. The whole experience was peaceful but really not that great. The whole package came with a meal after but the meal looked like it was sitting there for hours. It was a really small buffet line in those metal warmer things but the staff obviously could not be bothered to keep the food warm. On of the girls in out group ended up just eating rice with black sauce.Would I do it again? No. Would I recommend it? Only if you're relatively fit and you're prepared to face those wretched stairs."

The ride is 2.5 hours and it turned to be quite exhausting for beginners who know nothing about this sport. We were not warned that we would get wet and some of us had their t-shirts on and they hit a big stone and flipped into the river and were dragged in the shallow water hitting stones and got bruises here and there. We were on two rafts and we had one companion on each boat to help us and maneuver the raft if things go bad. One of them spoke better English than the other but was less skillful and hence could not save the passengers from the risk of flipping. The overall experience was very pleasant, but things could have taken a very bad turn if it weren't for the skill of the second companion. The scenery is extremely nice but they need to be equipped for emergencies and to warn people of all possibilities. This is not recommended for elderly people or those with back problems. Be ready to get totally soaked and take extra clothes to get changed after the tour. They have showers for those who want."

About a 15min walk to the river and quite a hard climb back up the stairs once finished. A challenge if you are not fit.

We purchased a River Rafting & ATV package, which cost us around IDR 850,000 (most places will quote you around 1.4million, and you can definitely work your way down to this amount, even less I'm sure if we had time).You're picked up in the morning by a driver and dropped off at the site. We went with Payangan Rafting company. We suited up (life jacket, helmet, oar) and walked down a loooong (slippery,steep) way down to the river. Once there, you get into boats of 6, and you're on your way. The guides were good fun, young guys with bountiful energy. The ride is about 2 to 2.5 hours, and the sights are lovely and tranquil. The rapids aren't very intense, so don't worry about falling off the raft!Halfway you can stop for a beer or a drink (not included in packaged price).I highly recommend Payangan Rafting. They're the ones with the umbrella logo :) The only down side is having to walk down the steps for a good 10 mins, and about 400 steps up at the end of the trip. Your thighs might hurt the next day, if you're not super active.ENJOY."

This isn't a problem per se, but after two hours of white water rafting, walking up 15 mins worth of stairs in no small feat.The endless Myriad of stairs on the way down to the riverbank are masked by the excited chorus of laughs from the expectant crowd, eagle to test themselves against nature. It is a very different soundtrack to the one at the end of the rafting where every step up towards your street level is punctuated by the breathless wearing of an overweight Japanese teenager or the moaning of a slightly more 'seasoned' gentleman who really should have know better than to sign up. The stairs are not a joke and are more exhausting than the rafting itself. If you are ok with this then DO NOT miss this trip as it is exhilarating and mesmerising through its adrenaline fuelled circuit to the breathtaking views you encounter. And to everyone who doesn't like the sound of climbing more stairs than Covent Garden Tube Station, then I would recommend that you chill out and enjoy the pics up your groups return BTW I booked through BALI adventure tours who seem to be the celebrity choice for these things.

You don't need to worry as some pictures seem dangerous, but they are not. It really depends in which period are you doing rafting as in some months water is much higher so you will have higher falls then in others. In July and August is very calm, really enjoyable place to spend morning. Definitely visit in the morning as it is much cooler in the evening. You need to bring pants and t-shirt ( the best would be a surf shirt and some Nike pants for gym for example ). You can have your flip flops on, as you will be barefoot in the boat ( and flip flops will be tied to the boat ( so your shoes do not get wet ). Tour guide has a big waterproof bag so you can bring mobile, wallet and a small camera. There are 2-3 stops on the way so you will be able to buy drinks ( but take your cigarettes with you :) ) There is a professional photographer taking pictures and making video which you can buy at the end.They provide food after the rafting but you should definitely skip that meal and take only water, coffee and tea.Meal is terrible and old and just don't eat it as it is very questionable. Me and my friend ate 12 days Balinese food from the stand, eating with our fingers and everything like locals but this meal and food is definitely old. You need to walk about 10 minutes to the river and 10 minutes from the river to the car. It is not that heavy, and no one is pushing you- so you have enough time even if you are not in any condition. Anyways, for a quicker falls and more downfalls take the other river in Bali and for more relaxing one, Ayung is the perfect match :)"

Between the fast falls there is time to enjoy the jungle with monkeys swinging from tree to tree. We also saw a man bringing his sacred cow to the river to wash it and children come to wash as this is the only place they can wash. It is amazing that these children who have so little are so happy and they left us with big feeling of humility. We also had the opportunity to stand under a perpendicular water fall which was very refreshing. At the end our guide gave us the opportunity to lie on our backs and float down the river. At the end there are showers to freshen up before enjoying a great lunch. All your clothes are put in a waterproof bag to keep them dry."

Scenic view along the way and some pit stops for refreshments and photo op.

Do not be scared, it is a little river with small current nothing dangerous, the hardest part for me was going down from the activity center using the man made stairs to the river...

We were lucky to run into RAR (acronym for a long Bahasa name). Different companies have different start and end points along the same river. Try to pick the company that takes you from farthest to farthest points. Expect a lot of hiking down to the river and up from the river when done. Expect to get totally drenched. Rafts usually have a dry-bag for valuables. We paid Rp300,000/person. Family of 4. That included transport to / from our Ubud Hotel, equipment (very basic), rafting, a simple lunch. We tipped our raft guide an extra Rp300,000 because he showed us a great time. The scenery is incredible. The rapids are thrilling and great fun for the family. Our family was all-smiles throughout. We were picked up at 8:45am and dropped back at our hotel at 2pm. The best money and time I ever spent with family. It was so beautiful and breathtaking. And to be there with my children, instead of iPads or shopping or pizzas was PRICELESS."

Our effort is very little bcaz the man who is guiding for rafting puts lots of effort to make the rafting perfect. Better to Carry one or two redbull can with you. If you feel thirsty the guide will stop in two places in the middle where small vendors sell drinks but it is costly (at least three to four times rate). Instead of paying more you can give tip to the rafting guide. Most important thing is to reach the river flow you have to step down nearly 300 steps after walking distance of one mile, which is really a tough job. It will make more pain to the legs and will take weeks time to recover. And people who have walking practice may not bother."

When we asked how many kilometers we had left - he didn't know what we said, and just shook his head! 2 hours is a looong time! At least it was for us :) But the nature was beautiful! We walked sooo many stairs to get down to the boat and to get up again! They say that from 7-65 years you are able to do this trip - i would say maybe from 10-12 to 60 tops!!

We were accompanied by another couple who was staying in the hotel across the street. It took about 1/2 hour from downtown ubud to reach our destination. Check in was efficient and we got our gear very quickly. I had worn tennis shoes as I had no sandals and our guide gave me his flip flops and packed my shoes away. I thought that was quite kind. It was a long walk down to reach the river on steep steps, but to be honest after Mt Batur it was a piece of cake. :) A guide gave us some quick instructions and we were on our way. The whole trip took on the water took about 2 1/2 hrs. There were some spots that were exciting to go thru, but primarily it was a charming trip of rowing and sometimes swimming in the current against a backdrop of sheer walls of tropical plants and rocks with stunning waterfalls and some resorts hanging on the edge of cliffs scattered along the way. It was an absolutely beautiful view of the tropical side of Bali and our guide did a great job of making sure we were safe and as well as our cameras and other belongings. When we reached the end of our trip, we did have to walk all the way back up. By then it was past noon and pretty hot, but the view was again stunning as the path took us up and thru tiered rice paddies fields and we got water when we reached the top. We reached the main street and walked a few blocks to a small restaurant where they provided us with a buffet of local balinese food. It was very delicious. A driver was waiting to take us back to our hotel as soon as we were ready. Everything was planned out perfectly and efficiently. I would highly recommend this company for your water rafting experience."

            "review": "The perfect antidote to Ubud retail madness. First up - don't believe the price your hotel quotes you. We started with $79 a person for Bali Adventures and I nearly fell off my chair. Their website offered 30% off and this website (TA) switched me onto going with Ayung, and getting a whole lot more river to raft, as other reviewers have said you pass the 'putting-in\" point of Bali Adventures and other outfits WAY below where Ayung put-in. So you get more river with these guys (I think, though perhaps the other outfits go further down and do some really chicken-oriental-mental stuff).Our raft guide was awesomely skilled, athletic and Bali-friendly. For those who haven't done this sort of thing I'd want you to register how a steep river like this tracks through the wildest terrain - raw, raw jungle. The leaf-scapes above you (particularly when you go through narrow stone gorges) are FABULOUS. The fun of squeezing through gaps in the rocks with the white noise of the rapids discombobulating you is totally brilliant. DO ask to swim in the current - a lovely way to drift on your back admiring the surroundings - your guide will only let you do it where it's perfectly straight-forward to stand up and get back on the raft.Has anyone else on this review postings mentioned the 300m of stone carving you go past - AMAZING!TAKE A DRYBAG if you have one - they supply them too and take your camera... Fabulous light.One last tip - go on the morning so that more of the sun gets into thE river valley.. We went on the afternoon gig and it was a bit cool.I paddled a lot at the front of the boat and felt shagged out at the end (really really tired).Lastly this outfit had a buffet for us to tuck into at the end of the day - some very welcome calories and a cold bintang.5* afternoon? GO WITH AYUNG!!"

The rapids were bumpy enough to be exciting for adults and children alike and the scenery was amazing. Be aware that there is a 450 step decent from the drop off point to the river which for some may be very challenging (especially if you have knee trouble). The buffet lunch was a nice way to finish a great morning. Highly recommended for everyone!"

            "review": "Superb Experience. 4 of us, my wife, two kids (12 and 10) and I, went on this adventure. We booked this package through Bali Adventure Tours and were very pleased with the whole experience. All it took was a phone call when we were in Bali and we were able to book the package or pickup two days later.They picked us up from our private Villa and we were driven with two other families in a 10 seater bus to the Bali Adventure Tour booking office where we had to pay for the tour. This is the same place that the tour ends, where the changing rooms are as well as the restaurant. We were given a bracelet that opens a locker and we dropped off our bags and changes of clothes. You get back on to the bus and its another 15-20 minute ride to the starting point. Here, you are outfitted with a life jacket, helmet and an oar and you then walk down about 600 steps to the river itself. The walk is not too bad as the steps are newly built with handrails and the stairs are not too steep. Once you reach the river, your guide will offer to take your shoes and put them in a water proof bag so you are no barefoot when you get into the river. You are then given a briefing by your guide on what to do - Maju to pedal forward and Mundur to reverse, Boom Boom when you are about to go down a fast rapid and Big Boom Boom when going down a really fast rapid. It is then Maju and you start rowing. The entire journey on the river is about 2 hours and you stop 3 times along the way. First stop was where one of the cliff faces has got carvings on the walls, next stop at a really fast waterfall where the guide lets you get out and get soaked or pushes the raft under the waterfall and the third stop to get drinks. Some of the rapids are quite fast some are not. Really enjoyable but quite tiring on the arms and shoulders especially since with 2 kids on board, the 3 adults had to do most of the work!You reach the finishing point and now comes the really hard part - 400 stairs that you have to climb to get back to the top!! These stairs are a lot steeper than the starting point and with no handrails either. Once you get to the top, you are actually on the road and you have to turn left and walk another 100 meters or so to get back to the changing rooms (the booking office where you first arrived). Hot showers and towels await you although there are only 4 showers in the mens changing room so you cant really take too long a shower. Towels are also rather small so if you are the shy kind, bring your own towel if you dont want to change in the nude.a Buffet Lunch is provided and it is quite a good lunch. You have to purchase your own drinks and these are at restaurant prices. Finally, photos are available at the booking office. USD15 for a CD of 8 photos or USD8 per individual photo. The photos are taken at the same spot but at slightly different times so some people would just want the one photo. You can also get a video CD of the trip but the cost is USD35 which seemed a bit steep to me. So yes, all in all a Superb Experience and something I am glad we did. It is not as scary as it seems and the experience is something that you will remember for a long, long time!"

            "review": "Ayung River Rafting fit for 8 to 70 years old. I am not a thrill or adventure seeker but decided to join my family so as not to disappoint them. I read up and watched youtube the day before just to make sure it is not too 'scary' for me. My anxiety was unfounded. The river and ripples were so tame and mild that I got used to them after 5 mins. Our guide had to deliberately steered us towards the waterfalls and splashed water onto us to inject some thrill lol ! The view is quite scenic and we got to see different hotels and villas along the journey. We decided to go with Sobek as it is better known and established (especially after a mild injury having used a run-of-the-mill water sports company at Nusa Dua instead of the one recommended by our hotel). Sobek is about US$10 more expensive than most of the others we have enquired but I reckon it is worthwhile as the journey starts almost at the top of the river and right down to almost the end. We saw several other rafting companies boarding their customers 3/4 or half way down and ending their journeys much sooner than our stop too. I would suggest that you do the rafting in the morning like 10-11am slot instead of the one at 3pm as it is brighter and more crowded (I prefer more people as it is more fun!). I have suggested 8 to 70 years old because there are indeed a lot of stony steps down to the river and then up again for lunch and shower. I had aching thighs the day after, a better work out than my arms :)! Free pick up and drop off from the rafting companies and I would suggest you pay with your Rupiah or you will lose out on the exchange rate with US$ and credit card charges with any credit cards. The guide expect some tips though. Enjoy!"

The rafting was extremely fun because we had a great guide who knew what he was doing and instructed us well. Lunch was included and was okay for a buffet. When it was time to climb the straps again there were more landings and more even steps so it wasn't as bad as coming down. The guide had me use the oar going down and going back, as a crutch, which was very helpful!! The guide MADE the river raft trip enjoyable!"

You get to raft through the green jungles with serene waterfalls. (2 to 3) The water was not so deep though the rapids weren't that bad. This is way better than the Ayung river rafting which is much calmer. I wouldn't recommend this for children though as there are unexpected tree roots sticking out which would be dangerous if struck to their faces. Lunch buffet and towels/showers are provided at the end.Price : Rafting: 300000 IDR per person (includes transportation)Pictures: 300000 IDR per CD ( 40 pictures)Tips:1) Wear full sleeves, pants (water-resistant preferably) and shoes(Avoid flip-flops as there are rocks in the water)2) Get a Go pro to capture the wonderful scenery3) Put on sun-screen to avoid the sun-burn4) The lunch buffet wasn't that great.

It's a fun and affordable way to spend the day exploring the beautiful jungle scenery with plenty of gentle waterfalls. We went with BMW - although the equipment has seen better days, we felt safe throughout with our experienced rafting guide. The river itself is not very deep with certain sections of 'white water' making it more fun. Great for inexperienced rafters as there is a greater excitement to effort ratio. The drop at the end was fun but anti-climactic. I imagine the Ayung River rafting to be much more calm. Lunch at the end is mediocre with towel and shower facilities. TIP bring a go-pro to capture some of the beautiful scenery! (Or risk taking your camera out of the water bag)"

Also i wouldnt book with just you are your partner the company lobs you in with other bookings. So if you have people staying all over bali for the hotel drop offs on the way back you are looking at over 2 and half hrs drive. My husband and i were looking at getting back on the road as soon as we had eaten like normal people do but the group we had been lobbed in with took there sweet time like over 2 hrs to eat and get back on the road. So dont believe the website when it says how long it takes we left our hotel at 0800 got back at 1700 so very long day. In a nut shell book more than 3 or 4 people in your booking and be well prepared for a very long car ride there and back. But the rafting was great alot of fun tour guides were awesome very friendly and funny. Im glad we did it but would have preferred to know what we were getting into at the start so we could have planned better."

We saw another operator that finishes 6 km shorter and customers need to take more than 500 steps up the hill without railings on those steps.The river is about an hour drive from ubud, free pick up and drop. Free coffee, tea and water at the registration. They only take local currency, USD or Euro, no credit card. We paid In rupiah which was about USD 23/person at that time.Just missed those Manchester United soccer team. They came from Nusa Dua with police escorts and body guards. One of the guides showed me the pictures on his cell phone. After getting our gears, put our phones, wallets in waterproof bag, we were ready to roll. The guide explained what it means for boom boom, jump jump, lean back, lean forward etc. , how to paddle, some safety tips. The view is stunning, beautiful gorge, 8 waterfalls, one can get you wet as you went under it. As we were down the river about 4 km, the guide asked us out. It is the first dam. He pushed it down and we hopped in again. Several pit stops are along the way. At one rest area with a big waterfall, a cold can of soda costs Rp 20.0000. A Bintang beer can is Rp 35.000. Dont forget to see a hut made of empty water bottles. Most of the time he paddles, steers our raft, we rarely paddle. Some guests made splashes to each other. At one area he let us jump to the water and swam. Yay... At the second dam, boom boom ... went 4m drop, that was fun!At the finish line, by the big bridge, we walked to a restaurant where free lunch is served. Drinks are available for purchase. Free towel to dry out. Highly recommend this operator Bukit Cilli Rafting (BCR) aka Telaga Waja Rafting. Very good in taking care guests, especially young children. We were pleased with the care and safety."

I was actually very nervous particularly about the 4m drop however once we got there, all nervousness disappeared but rather excitement took over. The guide was extremely helpful and will go through the safety rules prior. Suits beginners as the guide does most of the work but at times you will be required to forward/back paddle, lie down to avoid low bridges and to hold on particularly for 'boom boom' when the raft hits a rock. You will get a pit stop where you can buy a drink and take photos. The 4km drop was towards the end but having gone through it, i was worrying for nothing. Great rapids with scenic backdrops. Will definitely do TW rafting again. We booked through our hotel but you will be able to negotiate a better deal with a local vendor."

We have done White Water rafting a couple of times and this trip while not overly challenging was the most fun we have had for sure. Seems there are many companies on the river some with yellow rafts, some with white our were red as in the picture above. This is important as these guys at Telaga Waja Bali River Rafting are the best! Most fun - we had Bernard was just so much fun kept us all busy, hit many obstcles, got us wet sliding slideways through rapids and we all laughed the whole trip. Boom! Towards the end we had some friendly paddle splashing wars with a couple of other boats, from other companies and it was all in good spirit! The river at this time of the year is just high enough and running fast enough to make it fun and keep you alert - I would love to come back and do it in the rainy season. At the end we had a nice lunch and the 90 minute drive back to Ubud. Highly recommend these guys and this experience. Photos come on a CD so I havent accessed them yet as my laptop doesnt have a CD drive. Oh and by the way it is sooo cheap $30 AUD per person inc transfer and lunch! I have done this in Australia and NZ and paid 4 times that much an this was 16Km of river!"

Made reservations for 3 people by phone and was told we would get picked up at our hotel at 8am. We were nervous because they didn't give us a confirmation # or anything but our driver, Marty, arrived at 7:45am and waited while we finished breakfast. 5 STARS!Dedi(sp?) was our guide, his English was great, he was all smiles and made our rafting day a lot of fun. We opted for the photos** because we probably wont be river rafting through the jungle in Ubud again. *** The photos they shot were great! We just had some trouble with the CD they put them on, we had to try a couple of computers to get it to work. Bring a flash drive. Overall great experience and would recommend it to anyone spending a couple days in Ubud. It's a full day event so make sure to eat breakfast and maybe even bring a snack if you get hangry(hungry+angry).Not sure who the rafting expert is below, but we are in Bali not the Colorado river. Expect a great day with carefree laughs, beautiful jungle landscape, and getting a little wet ;) Would 100% recommend!"

To sit on a raft down a stream... no adventure at all. We have done white water rafting before and even others on the trip said it was so boring. Its 2 hours to get down and a slow boat ride.Only good thing was the 4m dip at the end.Also there are about 200 (well it felt like that) steep steps to climb up at the end. with your kit in hand. If you have asthma even mildly bring your puffer.Also the food at the end gave me a funky stomach. The potatos in one dish were still hard and not cooked. I can confidently say this as this was the first and only meal of the day after a piece of toast for breakfast.Try a different activity or do this in the rainy season when there is more water."

There had been some heavy rain but we were assured that it would only make conditions better and they were right. We booked our trip with BMW rafting and with an on-the-spot discount got $40 per person. We paid in advance for 5 of us and got transport all to ourselves. In the end due to illness only 3 of us made it but that was no problem and at the rafting start I was refunded $60 of the $80 for the 2 who didnt make it - I thought that was very fair, although I suspect I could have fought harder and got a full refund.The rafting was c.15km long and took an hour and 40 minutes including a 10 minute stop at the waterfall. Even though there were LOADS of boats going down (c.20+) we never really felt that the river was overcrowded and had time and peace to enjoy a terrific trip down a lovely river valley covered in jungle with some good rapids. If it hadnt have rained I suspect it would have been a 'nice' trip rather than an exciting one.Well worth it if you can get a good price - $88 (ratecard price) would have been overpaying.Theres a good phot supplied at the end when you all go over the 4m dam."

Both of them are very nice but the one AT TELAGA WAJA RIVER is more suitable if you do not have kids because there are four meter slope . Do not think that it will be dangerous because you will be with a Professional river guide. The number of stairs that your should use in this river is much less than the one in AYUNG RIVER trip. It is highly recommended to bring with you new clothes to be use after the rafting"

Well, we should have done this ages ago, because we all had so much fun!We were picked up from our Hotel in Tuban by a very knowledgeable driver, who was great in explaining certain things we saw, as well as holding a good conversation on a number of different topics. Although the drive to the rafting is long (about 2 to 2.5 hours) which made this an all day event, we were not bored at all, seeing a different part of Bali.The scenery is awesome, some wonderful natural waterfalls and peaceful waters, combined with fun Rapids and an adrenaline pumping 3m waterfall drop. Our guide was awesome, assisting our daughter when needed, and providing great information of the surrounding area. We felt comfortable and safe all of the time, it was apparent that safety was there number 1 priority, closely followed by having fun!The course is the longest on the river, about 16 or so kms, and you get the opportunity to have a drink stop at one of the larger waterfalls, where you can purchase drinks from the locals and take photos in front of the impressive waterfall.We would highly recommend this activity and in particular Telaga Waja Adventure who were simply wonderful."

If you compare it to rafting in Turkey it is far more safe, but unfortunately also a little bit less exciting and engaging. It doesn't require from you paddling. Steersmen make most of the job for you. Unlikely to turkish steersmen, their indonesian equivalent don't turn upside down the pontoon and you don't end up in water. Maybe because the river is too shallow... I recomend it to people in every age, also to families with children (7 years old and older). Good to see foryourself."

I almost bought it, but my friend insisted that we go to Telaga Waja. I am so glad we did, because that was possibly the activity I loved most in my trip to Bali.We booked our reservation with ALAM, and were greeted with a gong at the entrance and simple breakfast, overlooking a paddy field which was nice. We paid 400,000 idr per pax. There was also a flying fox from the office to the starting point which would cost you 50,000 idr more, if I am not mistaken. We chose to walk instead, which was only 300 - 500m walk from the office going through the paddy field.We waited about half an hour at the starting point and started paddling only at about 11 a.m.. There was a briefing about 5 minutes on how to paddle. Our guide was Jacky, a pleasant guide, but I observed that most all of the guides there were polite as well. In my case, because the current was quite strong and our guide did most of the work, at one point we didn't even paddle anymore and Jacky did all the work. We took the time to observe the beauty of the nature, paddling so slowly, most of the times not paddling at all. I loved the mini waterfall/ water flowing from the cliff, the clear river water. The view was so spectacular we even thought of repeating the rafting activity, just because.There was a kid about 10 years old in another boat rafting with his family. With adult's supervision, I think the activity is also safe for kids (really, no paddling is required if you don't want to). Adventurous kids are going to love it, and it is suitable for beginners too (2 of my friends never tried water rafting before).The journey took about 2 hours to end, and afterwards we had to climb up some stairs back to the office where we gathered. They were ample changing and shower room provided by ALAMl; they were clean. Meanwhile the lunch, it was just superb. I recommend booking with ALAM.If there's a thing I could comment on ALAM, was the price they charge for the complimentary CD (staggering 400,000idr per CD per boat, which equivalent to the price of a rafting trip for 1 itself). We managed to ask for a discount of 200,000idr. Beautiful pictures, especially at the rapid, but I felt like it was a rip-off.I didn't go to Ayung, but I never regret choosing Telagawaja. Really a must go."

At the end of the trip we had to walk up about 300 steps, very steep. Once at the top we were given towels to shower and change, before having a basic lunch. This company could definitely work on there service skills both at the start when first arriving and at the end. We could however not fault our guide. I would say this is a basic budget rafting company as have previously done it in Bali with another company and was a much more experienced and professional company and standard of service."

The quads are junk and dangerous , bald tires and very rough condition . We had a quad flip and people got hurt because of Jungle Bali Atv 's dangerous equipment . Plus the tour is only about 4 Kms long. I have had quads for 25 yrs and my expertise says DO NOT USE THEM , be safe and stay away ! The crew and staff were great but the owner wishes to put tourists at risk and he has no regard for safety. Please stay away!"

Thank god I did because it was SO much fun. The views are just spectacular going through jungle type Forrest down the fast flowing river passing waterfalls (we went in wet season so not sure if they are there permanently) and even spotted wild monkeys. The safety session was good, they provide the life jackets and hard hats. I would certainly NOT recommend for people with young kids, although sagged I think you really need to hang on."

Price same for all, but one of the cheapest, no bargaining allowed.Day didn't start too well as they were an hour and 15minutes late with pick up as they blamed google maps and we were in an unusual pick up spot in Legian. Best to send picture of location on map if this is your case. Anyway we got there and were the last to go in the river, meaning not all of us had a correct fitting helmet or life jacket as they were all gone. They did give us a 150k discount total after we complained about the tardiness of the pickup time. They tried selling us river shoes at 50k each saying that were necessary, we refused to buy them and went barefoot which was no issue at all. We also refused the 400k cd photo option. However once we got in the river all was terrific, the guides were great and kept our 2 boats close together so we could enjoy it together. The total time on water was about 2.5 hours and was quite fun. Scenery was brilliant and rapids were not extremely dangerous, but still gave some good thrills. Lunch at the end was quite yummy , but drinks were overpriced, nearly double what you would pay at a basic restaurant. We tipped the river guides as they were genuinely quite good.All up value for money was very good and will do it again on my next visit, now I know what to expect, there won't be anymore surprises."

Alot of rocks you might get your raft stuck on, and alot of walls you might get your head hit on (dont worry, there are helmets provided). This route has amazing view of the villages and nature you wont get to see in the city.Clear & cold water; the guide will allow you to take a dip in at a certain reating spot. Keep your eyes out for branches that might stick in your eye, and the napier grass that grows at the sides of the river. Wearing wet shoes would be advisable, if you dont have any you must rent their sandals for 15,000Rp(Sg1.50).Towels are provided for shower after the raft, and a nice spread of buffet lunch is included after that.Adventure is good if you travel out with friends, just remember that each raft can only fit up to 4 pax. Additional pax will be asked to share a raft with other couples or groups."

My husband and I arrived one hour earlier than the designated timing and in order not to make us wait for too long, the company actually sent us to do the water rafting. So amazed and grateful for their kind hospitality. Also, there is a welcome drink and you can choose whether you would like coffee or tea or water. Really cool.Our instructor, Made, was so funny and accommodating. He let us stop at this big waterfall that we were so amazed at and he even let us play in the waterfall for a while and took pictures for us. The most fun part was the 4m drop at the dam. It was super cool and fun! But the adventure doesn't stop there. After you are done with the rafting, you have to climb 361 steps to reach the top for your lunch. That's the grand closing ceremony for this experience. Upon reaching the top, the staffs will provide you with clean towels for you to shower. The shower and changing rooms may not be very clean, but it's sufficient to just clean yourself and change to clean clothing. I thought it was a sweet gesture of the company to provide clean towel as I did water rafting before and that company did not provide towels and the toilet was dirtier than this. The buffet lunch was awesome too! There were traditional fried rice, fried noodles, stir fry veggies, chicken and some fruits. But you have to pay for the drinks. Overall, it was a really great experience!"

Overall, we enjoyed the little adventure, no complain at all. If they could lower the price for the photo package, believe the demand would be higher.

Made the adventure memorable. There is a half way stop at a waterfall. Carry money with as there is a makeshift stall selling drinks [$2-5]. You will definitely want a drink by then. There are no toilets at the halfway stop. The ride ends with a 4m drop..which was brilliant! The 300 stair climb to the get back to the top was a kicker...so beware. I survived..just barely. My hubby and son felt it a breeze. At the top you are given a towel to dry off and there are toilets and showers available. Not the best but relatively clean.Traditional Indonesia lunch was part of the package we paid for.The eating area is a thatched building with benches and tables. Very rustic. It was a buffet that consisted of a soup starter, sticky white, noodle stir fry, potatoes chips, boiled veg and chicken in sauce. The chicken did not appeal to us, so we stuck to the noodles and boiled veg. was very tasty. You pay for your drinks. and you can purchase your photo. they print whilst you eat your lunch.

The prices are very reasonable and you can bargain with them to get a good deal. For $40/person, the cost included transportation to and from, and all you can eat lunch buffet. The driver picked us up from the hotel, made a stop at a Luwak Tea/Coffee joint to get you to buy coffee/tea (Seemed like every company did this because every driver stopped by this place before rafting. It's almost like a scheme and the driver gets a cut from how much money the group spent.) The local rafting instructors were super nice and funny. The water were extremely rapid and fast and only waist deep. Everyone took breaks by gorgeous waterfalls where you can take photos and drink beer. Towards the end, there are about 200 steps you walk up to have lunch. The lunch buffet included rice, stir fried noodles, chips, soup, chicken, and vegetables. Keep in mind it's nothing but a shed/hut with food out in the open where flies are around. They keep their food covered as much as possible but I got sick from eating it. There are restrooms and showers but be prepared to wait in a long line because there are maybe 3 restrooms and 3 private showers with another 4 open shower stalls. Don't expect anything clean, we're in the rainforest :-) Enjoy the fantastic view from up top. It's magnificent. There are people who take photos all along the river and you can buy them towards the end of the rafting where you have lunch. The photo quality is very good and its cheap so bring your money. $5 for a 5x7 -- can't beat that!"

I had suspected this, but foolishly let myself be convinced by the sales person that it would still be exciting. Afterwards, I then waited another hour while they flipped around who was leaving in which bus. Then the driver taking me back again didn't know his way, so we arrived at Legian at 4:30, taking over 3 hours for the drive back. The whole experience left me pissed off.

We were given some instructions and of we went.....And hey YES this is Indonesia! A beautiful river with a few rapids, lush green fields, tall trees small waterfalls providing us with fresh showers a lovely young guide Wayan telling us how and when to paddle and explaining about the river, trees, plants and the Indonesian lifestyle. We made a short stop at the waterfall for some photo's and a drink and continued in our raft, further down the river.Maybe not spectacular enough to everyones liking but definitely great fun for every age group.I felt safe all the time and we sure got great value for our money! 2and a half hours.At the finish we were dropped at the restaurant, showers and changing rooms which are (much needed) being replaced. But hey this is Indonesia and no doubt everyone of us can take a shower back at their hotel. I have been rafting quite a number of times in several countries some more adrenaline powered but this place is well organised, safe and has one of the best sceneries.One thing I do agree with.....The food was very, very poor!

So, eventhough we can speak english and indonesian, we only used korean easily during all our trip. How wonderful!After rafting, lunch buffet was very good and scenery around restaurant was awesome.

Telaga, like the rest of the operators offer a very soft, family-friendly day out. This wasn't my first trip on this river, so I've had the experience of comparing operators. If you're hoping for a terrifying session of paddling and trying to stay afloat, this is not for you, but from what I've seen, it's great for young families. The drive-in was fine, the briefing, long (yawn), the lunch; not very memorable. The scenery is nice along the way and the operators are friendly, but all said, the river is really an automatic car wash with a dozen operators constantly sending a flow of rafts through. Our guide gave us a prepared speech at the end about wanting a tip (donation), which was ironic, since these guys got to steer their way through the last two hours, only for all of us to witness the local women struggle to carry deflated rafts back up the steep cliff side. If you're in Bali for more than a week, the rafting makes a nice change from the noise, crowds and smoke.TIP: We used the included transport to move from one city to another! (think of it as a taxi ride with great benefits!) ;)"

As it turns out I think we picked one of the best. We went with BIR - Bali International Rafting. The price was only 300000rp each (about $30AUD) - there were 4 of us. The rafts were in excellent condition - especially when you looked at some of the other companies. The best part was there were hardly any stairs at the end and only a very short trail at the start - just a few steps to the rafts - and our rafting distance was the longest. Our guide was great. The lunch was simple but hot and okay to eat. You could buy a cd at the end for just 350000rp. Towels and shower were also provided at the end. All in all a good fun day with lots of laughs."

Booked through e-kuta.com we got a nice price for rp 250,000 per person. The rafting company is Lapama Rafting. The ride begins with 300 stairs go down to the river, its not a big deal because you are excited about the entire trip, so no worries. Before we start jumping on the raft, the instructor explain us a few safety instruction, easy to understand quite straight forward, if he said paddle..we paddle, he said stop ..we stop,... he said bumbum..means bump a head and hang-on, he said laid down we laid down because you can see ahead there is a bridge ahead.....hahahahaha easy.....Sometimes you will pass other rafts from other company and they often splash you with water and you are expected to splash them back, its like water war out there.The river condition when I was there was not too rough, its June during dry season, rather shallow if I might say, but some part of the river is quite challenging. At the finish line, yo need to climb up 124 stairs if I am not miscount because already out off breath, but still okay hahahahah . Lunch standard, eatable but we did not each much. Shower room a bit dirty though, well just for rinse and change you clothes.We buy photos on CD, but lots of them are blurrrrrrrrrrr.....they give me discount price, my recommendation is to see first the result of the photos then pay latter.Overall fun experience, good for my kids. If you are happy, tips your instructor, share your happiness......."

I've been rafting a handful of times and this was definitely the tamest so great for beginners and families but not for adrenaline junkies! The current is fast but there is only one really big drop which is a dam about halfway through. Now...here is my experience with 'best rafting bali' or 'bali cilli rafting' which was written all over the equipment. Pick up was 8-8.30am in Ubud. When I hadn't been collected by 9.30 I assumed I wasn't going. Turns out the driver was stuck in traffic but no effort was made to call my hostel despite them requesting the phone number in previous emails. I was collected at 9.45 in the end. Taken to the start point where we had free tea/coffee (very poor) and they offered to take photos along the way to put on a cd...at a price of 30USD!!!!! We were given life jackets and helmets, both of which had seen better days. My life jacket was WAY too big. They said they didn't have smaller, having fallen out a raft I know they pull you in my your life jacket and mine would have slipped over my head it was so loose so I wasn't feeling safe. The helmet was too big and I couldn't tighten it. They told me it would be fine. 3 hours is a VERY long time to spend with a life jacket up to your ears and a helmet spinning on your head pulling out your hair strand by strand. We then had the 'safety talk'. The guides did not speak great English. I think because the river is pretty tame they didn't stick to the usual WWR safety tips. We didn't sit in the raft the way I've always been taught and there was no safety kayak. Again no big deal because the route is pretty mild. Had a stop at a waterfall to take some pictures halfway through. Few rapids, a few laughs. It was ok. But after 3 hours of rafting and considering I had last eaten 2 hours before we even started I was STARVING. Excited for food I bypassed the shower (which was, quite frankly, embarrassing to call a shower) and went to eat. Lunch was buffet, noodles and rice which were stone cold despite them constantly replenishing from the kitchen, and some kind of chicken dish but all that was left was the feet by the time I got there. Had to pay for drinks which were ok priced but they whacked an outrageous 21% tax and service charge on top! Back in Ubud by around 4pm. I was also charged 10USD extra because I'm travelling solo but spent the day in a group. It killed a day in Ubud but I felt like it was a waste of money for the service received. "

Which I did not experience from another company for Ayung River Rafting, which only gave us 1 pic for the same fee. Telega Waja River rafting company is not a wrong choice. I found this company while searching for a good price online. I booked through them online and made payment only after arriving at destination. They were very prompt at responding to my emails and arrived to pick us up on time. The driver even stopped at a location with great view for us to snap some beautiful Pictures. The Guide pronounced as (Geri) not Jerry is a great guy with good entertaining skills. Overall, I would really recommend them."

Very scenic and do look forward to the 5 metre plunge.At the end, please note it is a long climb up via stairs approx 100 steps. Those with knee problems or difficulty climbing this may be a hassle to you.Also, as per all adventure activities, you mind get some scraps here and there but i think the guides should not be blamed for this.

            "review": "Telaga Waja River Rafting . I did a lot of research before my trip and only booked my rafting while I was in Bali the night before the rafting day. There are plenty of stores in Bali where you can book the rafting when you arrive.I did not want to try the Ayung river as I've heard about the scary flights of stairs you need to climb up & down before you get to the rafting site. I researched and found Bali View Rafting the most reasonable. I contacted them through watsapp and the guy who replied was extremely friendly and responsive even at 9pm at night. They charged the same rate of IDR325,000 or US25 for both the Ayung River & Telaga Waja River. This includes transport to/fro, rafting, towels & lunch. We confirmed it through watsapp, send him the map to our villa and that was it.On the actual day, the driver came and picked us and we realised it's almost an hour drive up to the river from Ubud where we were staying. From Seminyak or Kua will be about 1.5 hours so the rate might be slightly more due to the longer driving distance to/fro. He mentioned that Telaga Waja is a better choice compared to Ayung as the river is cleaner and more fun. Although Ayung is the most famous rafting site, TW is the best rafting site. It's also considered slightly more adventurous as it's a class 3-4 rapids but still safe enough for beginners. It's located at the East of Bali and the river is about 13km and the time it took us to complete was about 2.5 hours. There was a drop towards the end of the river which was quite scary.Overall, my husband and I had a great time! We had another couple with us and the guide in our raft. We stopped by a waterfall to get some soft drinks as we got a little tired by an hour.. needed some sugar There were a few low lying branches in the river and we had to bend ourselves back really low to avoid getting smacked. It is extremely safe and we will definetely bring our kids back to do this together. When we ended, we were extremely tired and hungry so pls do have a hearty breakfast in the morning before you start. We were glad we don't have to carry our raft and climb up the scary stairs to get back which we heard you need to do in Ayung. We tipped our rafting guide before leaving. Towels were given to us to dry ourselves. They have shower facilities but it's very open and not private so I just walked to the washroom and changed out to dry clothes after drying myself. Prefer to have a proper and thorough shower back at our villa. Note that the washroom is extremely dirty Lunch was really simple.. Some rice and noodles, satay and stir fried vegs and pieces of chicken. It's buffet style though soft drinks are not included. Lunch was as the food was cold but because we were hungry, we ate a little.Btw, the company sells rafting strap on sandals meant for rafting on site for IDR50,000 which I bought for myself.Things to note:-- Got picked up at 9.30 and returned by almost 3pm- Bring a set of dry clothes to change out- Rafting sandals recommended but not a must. The lady in front of me wore flip flops- Have breakfast before starting- Tip the guide as it's definetely not easy manoueving the river. He kept us safe!- You can bring a small bottle of water if you don't want to bring $ out with you.- You can bring waterproof camera and take pics along the way but need to be quickThat's about it.. Great time we had and will try it again when we are back... GOOD LUCK"

The driver drops you off and then meets you at the end. The 2 hour rafting was through some unbelievable scenery with many rocky areas which made navigating fun. There were a few low points where you leant back flat to pass under bamboo or bridges. Of course plenty of interaction and fun between rafts scooping water at each other. Plenty of laughs . A couple of stop/rest points where you could buy expensive drinks. Hey, everyone has to make a living!!! These people live in the area (jealous of them!!) so if you can't afford a few dollars for drinks ???!!! Definitely worth taking a water proof camera. A nice water fall we went under as well. One stop was a waterfall that you can access and have photos taken The last highlight was going over the vertical wall. Awesome !!. A long trek back up the hill to where you can have a shower and have a free meal which was delicious. The rafts are collapsed and carried on the head of workers up the steep incline. There was an older lady doing this 3 times a day. !!! These rafts weigh about 70 kilos. A fantastic day on the water. And yes you have to row!! Heaps of fun and laughter.Would do it again. Highly recommended if you haven't done it before!"

The kids wanted to go rafting on a recent trip to Bali, so ended up booking with Telaga Dewata Rafting on the Telaga Waja River.Published rate on their flyer is US $80 per person, but paid US $30 thru Dianne's Shop in Kuta. (Inclusive of rafting, transfers and lunch)Having gone white water rafting several times in the past, this was the first time on the Telaga Waja river.The advantage of this trip was minimal stairs to climb down at the beginning and NO stairs to climb up at the end !Tho be prepared to exit the raft several times to negotiate a set of waterfalls and to cross over a water pipeline.This company appears to finish much further down the river than it's competitors and the rafting guide we had was sensational.The journey lasted close to 3 hours, with good sets of rapids, not much flat water, but probably not quite as picturesque as the Ayung river.On a cautious note tho, keep a good look out for tree roots etc, sticking out facing up river\u2026.these could be lethal if struck in the face !There are also a number of fallen trees where you need to lay down in the raft while passing underneath\u2026My wife was very apprehensive about allowing our 10 year old daughter go, due to heavy rain and word rafting had been cancelled the previous day due to high/dangerous water levels..And due to reading some crack pot reviews somewhere claiming this to be dangerous river, decided she was not going to attend..Personally I'm glad the water level was not any lower, as at times the raft was bottoming out on the river bed.It was a great day out with the kids and my daughter could do nothing but laugh and squeal with delight the whole trip\u2026.only wanting to go back to the start and do it all again !If I go rafting again on future visits to Bali, I will definitely book thru Telaga Dewata Rafting."

Dont get me wrong its challenging, navigating the run but i think an enthusiastic guide might make the experience a lot more fun. My fellow travellers and i worked out how to navigate rocky rapids by laying down rather than being marooned every 30metres. The guide could have helped with some simple words and run knowledge but sadly i think he was not the most confident chap. In fact he steered us into rocks on several occassions and we were overtaken by other rafts . The steep climb back to the eating area would be a considerable challenge for anyone over 40 with over 200 steps. Its a nice little day to get the muscles working, you see a waterfall and do a 4 metre drop at the end which is very good. I wouldnt make it a \"must do\" more a \"if you have a day and feel energetic do\" hope this helps. Mark"

Many huge rocks and even a fallen tree over the river and we had to lean back to go under the tree and branches. Had some kind of \"mud spa\" from a yellow water fall. Our raft went down the 4m fall and went to wrong direction so we had to bash through the forest by foot and got some leeches on our legs. Alex checked our legs and removed them. Walking up 400 steps was tough for me and I was literally crawling on 4 towards the end. We were given bath towels to dry after our shower. The next day I develop itchy rashes all over my body. My husband had some rashes but not as bad as mine. I believe the bath towels are not washed but reused as I saw the lady folding them back nicely instead of throwing into wash.

For a very reasonable S$28, it was approximately 2.5 hours of navigating the 12km river. Transport to and from your hotel is provided, so that made things very convenient. Each raft can take a maximum of 4 people, though my raft only had 2. Rest assured, each raft has a raft guide accompanying you. In my opinion, these guys are the true heroes. They do everything they can to ensure you are safe during the course of the entire journey. Midway, there is a short break for you to take in the breathtaking scenery as well as snap a couple of photos with the waterfall. The course is rather challenging for a newbie (if you truly want to paddle with your oar), but if you're fine sitting inside the raft as the raft guide helps you steer your raft in the right direction, then this 12km stretch of the Telaga Waja river is extremely exciting! P.S. Look out for the waterfall drop at the end."

BUT. We were a car of 5 people. So we were paying1.4 million rupiah. And the experience was worth every cent. But if that 1.4 mill, the driver is paid 50,000 for his 4 hours driving and 3 hours waiting. No doubt the raft guy wasn't paid that much more. And the buffet wasnt worth writing home about....So the company is making do much money off the hard work of the drivers and raft guides who are doing all the work for very little pay. it's not right."

            "review": "It really worth the price to try the first rafting in my lifetime. Telaga Waja River is classified as Level 4 Rafting. To newbies like us we were kind of scared in the first place simply we know nothing about rafting except that i know i will be on a boat on the river. The company offers a more than reasonable price of about $28 per person, pick up and drop off inclusive, including insurance and guidance. Compared to those who advertise $85, come on be serious. Dont fall into the traps. Do a number of more research and you should be able to find one yourself. They picked us up really on time. At first they could not confirm our room number. It was my fault since i did not pay attention to my personal email ever since i was in Bali. Anyway the company took the chance and trusted us, so they arrived on schedule at our hotel. How surprise! We got a pair of Canadians with us too. Marvellous idea. We shared our cultural experiences and talked everything. WHen you are going in couple, you might probably get some other foreignners as well. Making new friends is good. The rafting itself is not scary at all after sitting onto the boat. The river speed is a bit low due possibly to dry season. It might be a reverse in the coming wet season. The guide has poor english so I could understand less than half of his speech. However he's very experienced. Whenever we were jammed by sth, he rushed into the river and pushed us out of the barrier, then quickly get back to our boat. His skills is undeniable. After a few moments you can walk over the land and take a rest. Take some pictures. There should be a waterfall. Later then, the rafting continues and in the end there's a 4m jump. At first we were scared to death, in the end i could just say: we have worried way too much. It is far easier and safer than ever imagined. The most tiring part has finally come which is to walk up over 400 steps to the lunch place. There will be showers and towels provided. However i did not particular like the smell of the towel. They seem not clean at all. The lunch is in buffet. Dont get much expectations, there were just some fried rice, noodles and chickens. The lunch is below average but able to let you feel how the locals eat daily. We slept smoothly at the way back. It was a wonderful adventure and i would definitely be confident to try level 5 at other places."

The pickup was on time and we had a comfortable 1.5 hour journey from Legian. On arrival you are given a waterproof bag to store valuables whilst in the raft. The river was a bit low in some areas and you would occasionally get stuck on the rocks, but trying to bounce yourself off the rocks or waiting for the next raft to crash into you and push you off, was all part of the fun. There was plenty of splashing in the boat by our guide \"Muddie\" as well as with any other raft the came within distance. After an hour paddling we had a break at a waterfall where we could buy a drink. Soft drinks were 20,000 rupee and a Bintang 35,000. The scenery along the way is very good but you don\u2019t get a lot of time to enjoy it before you hit the next lot of rapids. We were on the river for about 2 hours. The rafting isn't overly challenging but is very enjoyableThe only down points of the trip was the climb up the 300 odd stairs Be wary of the street vendors that tell you it's only 60 stairs and not difficult - it was quite a hike especially for some in our group with health issues. The showers were a cool trickle and the \"fresh\" towels were folded up and put put back in the pile for the next person to use. The lunch was average but for the price we paid it was adequate. I didn't see these things as a real issue as the main reason we were there was for the rafting which was a lot of fun."

The water itself is clear and cold. In the middle of the track, we stop by the waterfall and enjoy some sceneries there. One bad thing is that they sell the photos for IDR 70k each, or IDR 210k per boat. If you are in a group of 5 boats then you have to pay IDR 1 million (try to haggle to get some discounts)."

The view was better, and the water was clearer. There were paddy fields as we paddled through, and there were a lot of small waterfalls. Our guide let us stop at one of them to take pictures. At the shallower parts, the water moved faster, and it was easy to get stuck. Close to the end there was a dam than we can go down to and it was fun! I suggest that you bring your own waterproof camera so that you won't miss taking pictures of the beautiful view as I did :(Padas was better in terms of the water speed. And there were several rapids that were dangerous enough that can make your boat capsize (so yeah, it was more fun in a way!), also the train ride to Padas river was a great experience. But due to the scenery along the river, I think Telaga Waja was more memorable to me."

The guide tried hard to create excitement by steering the raft into the rocks and banks, but can't say it had much of an effect. Excitement aside, the 2-hour drift down the river was relaxing as the river is surrounded by lush greenery and if you are lucky, you get to witness the lives of the local people there."

It's also inexpensive ($30 or less) but you need to book it directly with them, instead of through a hotel which usually asked for $60.

Halfway through the journey ( I think it's 13km in total), you'll stop to see a beautiful waterfall. There, you can purchase some drinks before moving on too. The 4m drop in the end was as usual the highlight of it all; do try to keep your eyes open as you'll see the beauty of it all if you do! There is a walk up the stairs after you end the activity and head to the lunch area though. This can be quite a challenge if you have knee problems or is short of stamina. I can't rmb the rafting operator that I was with during my first raft (it's the one with the blue rafts) but with that one, the rafting was a bit longer and at the end you just need to climb a short slope..

Showers and change rooms are very rustic though they provided clean towels which was nice - we just changed as quickly as possible into our dry clothes and got out of there to have lunch.The whole price game could really get to you so bargain hard upon booking. Never pay the printed trip price of $80 or whatever per person - $25 in and around will be good value. Photos that they take on the day you'll want to bargain on those as well. The photos are great to have.What we liked best about the experience was that this company didn't have too many people and therefore the two of us got our own raft with guide. It was like having a private tour down the river! Fun day out, we're happy we went.Note: Was apprehensive because after the research it seemed like Alam was the better choice but when we went to book we were told Alam was full for the following morning.

There's little privacy to change at this stop so be prepared to get in the boat as soon as you arrive and leave your change of clothes in the van. There's room to take small valuables in a waterproof bag that they provide. The photographer tries to sell you his services at this point. 1 picture at 50,000 rps or a CD with 140 pictures for 250,000 rps. coincidentally, the 1 picture option wasn't available and we didn't particularly want 140 pics of other people so we declined.A (very short) demonstration later and we were on our way in our very battered boat. It's only when you see the other boats that you realise that the reason this is cheap is because the company is using second hand or old boats We had a lovely guide called Marco and he understood that we wanted to go fast so took us down a few runs where other boats were getting out and walking."

The river winds its way through steep canyons, rice terraces and jungle for about 3 hours and it was continual rapids the whole way. It is a beautiful river with lots of water. Grade 3 with the occasional Grade 4 section which were easily negotatoated by the skilled guides.There were a lot of rafts on the river at the time so there was not much solitude, but it was fun and water fights soon erupted between various rafts.My only complaint is that we passed the most beautiful waterfall on the trip where many others stopped. Our refreshment stop was a pretty mild cascade. But with the Adrenalin running high no one really cared.You could not complain about the length or duration of this trip, it is just one rapid after another and some pretty tricky negotiations keep everone on their toes.Forget Water Bom, thuis is the best water park in Bali. We loved it!"

At the road they will drop by to one of the local coffee maker shop, if you like coffee try to buy the ginger coffee (around 10 - 15 usd per pack). Arriving at telaga waja make sure you bring your sun block cream, coz the trip will last about 2,5 hours. The river is not deep, the current is level 2 to level 3 size, so its a recreational rafting. Bring ur waterproof camera, lots of good views from the river. Its quite fun on the trip, your gonna have 1 stop in the middle and make sure to take a pict in the waterfall there....fun. The hardest part is the 400 steps at your arrival point, but after that they provide you with lunch and drink. Overall its a must try if you go to bali....just remember its a recreational rafting dont expect for adventure rafting and it is worthed, for 45 - 50 USD you had a fun time for 3/4 day."

I took my wife on this adventure knowing that she would be able to cope with the final drop even though she was scared out of her mind when I told her about it \"on the raft!\". ;-) But like I said she managed just fine and now raves about it. Had to save her falling out of the raft once so those with kids need to be mindful, however often not that deep and guides are there to help when needed. Great for beginners. Those wanting intense rafting wont get it here. Facilities very average and must keep in mind were you are and put things in perspective when comparing to Australia, otherwise a good day out. To get a video costs about 500,000 rupiah so worth taking your own shots as they have a dry bag that goes with you, or better still take a water proof camera. Stairs will test the unfit or overweight. The provided meal at the end was okay, flies were a bit off putting. We did see a monkey which was a highlight, would love to rate this a bit higher but find it hard comparing it to the Tully river in North Queensland, but still worth doing."

The splashing and fun is unlimited. The carvings of the Ramayana and Mahabharata along the stone sides is a beauty to watch. Make sure to tell your guide to stop so pics are clicked.

Don't fear to fall into water you are always within safe hands with the team. Excellent adventure & great experience. Don't miss to carry a gopro camera with you to record the experience worth sharing. Should also mention since it's located across the mountain areas lots of steps to go down before being able to get into the boats & at the end of the journey have to climb up again which was a bit of a tiring experience for people who hardly ever walk on a normai day. A full body massage at a spa is reccommended in the evening :)"

The tour agency will provide us with all things needed: things to bring with you, things to be prepared for you, directions before you start and one instructor to go with each boat. OUR TIPS:- If you like something more adventural, choose to go in a rainy day. That would be much fun!- Bring sneakers with you, then ask the instructor to help you keep them (they have a waterproof bag on boat). The tour agency may tell you to bring a slip-on so it will not be wet during the tour. But it made me feel so difficult to walk down the stairs to go to the river station when you start your trip.

Still a great trip through beautiful scenery and would highly recommend when you search for a deal.. I think we paid around \u00a330 pp, whilst some places advertise for up to \u00a370 pp. Also beware the stop half way down the river when about 10 women jump on you trying to sell very expensive beer."

We booked this as a last minute adventure as it was discounted down to $29 / person which included transport to/from the rafting from our hotel, the rafting which lasted about 2:30hr and a bite to eat. Safe to say our expectations weren't too high for this cost; how wrong we were. We had a brilliant time with our rafting captain Jhon. Just the 2 of us in the raft and the river wasn't in full flow by any means. The walk down is steep and you need to be good on your feet - the walk back up is also steep and quite tough. The scenery is worth all the effort - it is just spectacular. Would not have missed it for the world and cant recommend you do it more highly.Seeing lizards, monkeys and birds all in the jungle is special, along with the natural sights such as the most amazing waterfall which we hopped off the raft and waded under - absolutely breath-taking. The rapids were fun, not too scary and not too boring. I had a couple of swims where we were allowed and of course the impromptu water fight with the other rafters!!if you are in Bali do this trip - it is brilliant"

We were grouped with 2 other couples and all of us had a great time. Our guide was very funny and loved to joke around. The locker and the changing area were pretty clean. Towels were provided as well. The bad:You have to walk lots of stairs down to reach the river and once you were finished, you need to climb up about 300 steps which was very exhausting. But, the guide was nice enough to wait on us when we took breaks in between. The food they served were terrible. You better off passed on the meal and go back to your hotel to eat."

Was patient with me walking slowly down really steep mud stairs on the way down, helped me out when I get got stuck on many rocks, and waited whilst I really slowly made it up the many many cement stairs at the end. We were in single tubes, and off we went, many rapids, and turns! I was glad for my kayaking experiences. Tubes are hard to 'steer'. If not sure of your skill set, I'd try white water rafting where you are in boat with many others and a guide. The only down side was there are many companies on the one stretch of water, and we were 'hit' several times by the bigger rafts. Would I do it again - hell yeah!!"

The stairs were SLIPPERY and MUDDY (it was raining yesterday) when wet and it was very STEEP. So you need to use your shoes that really grips. A tourist in front of me actually fell of but he was okay.* After arrived at the river. Johnny seemed experienced and know a lot about Ayung River. He gave an introduction of how to safely rafting this river.* The rafting experience was fun (we had enough river current to have some fun) we had 3 stops to swim, taking pictures at a waterfalls, drinking beer (Bintang small bottle is 40k)* At the finish point we went uphill for about 15mins (I personally took 3 stops to catch a breath..lol). This time the stairs were not slippery (seemed to be properly cemented) but it was VERY LONG AND STEEP. Be ready for overweight/old/unfit people to walk these stairs, take a break to catch a breath is okay, so do it.* Arrived at Toekad Rafting office. We had buffet lunch and the food was okay.* Be ready to pay another 250k Rupiah if you want to take home the photos taken earlier when you were rafting (SILLY BUSINESS)"

Our guides were Ari and Kadek (good guides and professional and made sure we were safe at all times). We walked down a long path of stairs coming down a steep slope to the river (beware if you have bad knees) - we had individual boats for 2 (but you can get them for 4 people as well)We had a 2,5 hour rafting tour through an amazing valley (even though it was shoulder season) and were at no point surrounded by big crowds. At 2 or 3 turns there is a photographer but you are warned on time so you can prepare your smile ;-) At the end of the tour we walked back up (yes pretty tough) to the van (whilst the local ladies carried the rafts back up !) and the office for picture viewing (pretty affordable) and free lunch (an average buffet in the open air so be careful what you eat) However I highly recommend the rafting company and rafting tour as it is a well worth experience."

If you want to enjoy yourself by cycling around Ubud and enjoy their wonderful fresh air, this might be one of my recommendation to spend your day in Ubud. You can enjoy the freshness and the breathtaking sight. To be noted, the route is not for starters or newbies, but for safety, they always monitor our trip and already prepare for the worst. Such a wonderful experience while I am in Ubud."

A word of warning: the climb down and back up from the river is pretty steep but a good workout. You go down with all the other rafts and rafting companies which is fun to try and splash them.You also get to stand under an amazing waterfall and they'll take your picture. They also take pictures of you along the way. If you want to buy one, you have to buy all the photos on a disc and you get one printed. This was disappointing as I only wanted one, not the whole lot. The buffet lunch after of chicken, fried rice, noodles, white rice, fruit and prawn crackers was quite nice too."

Hotel brought us to Toekad rafting, we arrived there around 12.15 PM. First we went to the restaurant for a buffet lunch. The restaurant was rally cosy and had a nice view. The buffet was surprisingly good, with various food options like nasi goreng, fried potatoes, soup, a lot of fruit etc. Only the drinks we had to pay. After that we stored our belongings in a safety box, and took only some small money with us, to buy some drinks along the trip. By A/C car we went to the starting point, which was a scenic drive. There we got our stuff, and walked through some fields to the steps. Indeed, many many steps down to the river. When we were down our funny guide Johnny gave us instructions and we started the 2,5 hours trip. The shoes were kept in a special bag, and also my camera was stored in another water-free bag. It was gorgeous!! The nature around it was stunning, we saw beautiful blue birds, jungle all around, and passed some beautiful hotels, like The Royal Pita Maha. Half way we stopped for a break and could buy some drinks. The guide was really funny and pushed us under some waterfalls several times. The kids were allowed to swim for a short while in the river. We really enjoyed this great trip, it was not scary at all (that was the main reason we didn't do it before). If you keep you legs and arms inside, I really think nothing can happen.At the end you have to climp up, really heavy, but less steps than the starting point. Then a few hundred meters along the road, and there was the office/restaurant of Toekad again. We took a shower there, large and clean showers, large changing rooms, everything really great. We bought a CD with a lot of photos as a memory of this gorgeous day. I think in the afternoon it is less crowded on the river. We saw some other boats now and then, but most of the trip we felt we were along on the river. Just go, a must-do, while on Bali!!"

If you are considering doing the rafting or the tubing then I would say go for tubing if you want more excitement but willing to work for it as you have to paddle and control it yourself.. you will be tired at the end but thoroughly satisfied. If you want a more relaxing ride with only having to put in minimal effort then go rafting.. It still looks fun but not as much excitement as tubing."

Unless you're very very strong, never go tandem. You will paddle for more than 2 hours almost non stop. Careful though, it really isn't for the more panicky person, since to give up just before a steep 1-2 meter drop is not really an option. You will get jostled by the larger rafts, and balance and upper body strength is a must. Is it fun though? Absolutely. Is it safe? Well not really, it's more of an extreme sport category, so do take care."

You are then driven, about 15 minutes, to the launch off location. A 20-30 minute hike follows, mostly down steep terrain to get to the river. Once we got onto the raft and started our journey, our guide, Kres, came alive and definitely ramped up the experience a couple of notches with his whoops and general enthusiasm throughout the trip. The rapids are not the most exciting and for most parts we were drifting gently down the river. Nevertheless, the scenery was wonderful and stone carvings along the river were spectacular. We saw several other rafts from other companies along the way and had a good time splashing and getting splashed by rival rafts. After reaching the finish point, you have to climb up thousands (alright, not thousands, but seemed close) of steps to get back to the base. Whilst our group was generally physically fit, the climbing down and up stairs portion was challenging and could probably defeat plenty of folks (and not the rafting itself). I think that should have been mentioned at the outset. Lunch was perfectly adequate. An enjoyable day, but not one I would repeat unless I was training for a stair-climbing challenge."

You have to steer yourself and for a complete novice this was quite scary - I couldn't make the tube go where I wanted it to go so often hit rocks or got stuck on rapids. I've been rafting before and it's a lot easier and very tame, because the guide is on the raft steering it for you. It's also a lot easier to flip a tube than a raft - our guide told us that about 40% of people will flip their tube at least once.Tubing is not a relaxing meander down the river - you also have to paddle yourself for 3 hours which is tiring if you're unfit. In a raft you can get away with barely paddling but in a tube you don't have a choice. As others have mentioned there are also the steps at the beginning and end of the trip whether you raft or tube.Our guide spent most of the time screaming \"be careful\" which just freaked me out because I didn't know what he was referring to or what I was supposed to do. Compared to other rafting companies, Toekad is just okay. I've been with Sobek and Bali Adventure before and both were better (nicer facilities, more professional operation, nicer lunch) but Toekad was cheaper."

Lunch afterwards was great too, not the most amazing food but just what you need. Be warned, it's about 300 steps down to the river and another 400 at the end to get back up.

But I expect that the stairs were even and not dangerous.But the reality is 100% the opposite. I feel it's quite dangerous since it's wet so it's very slippery and some was covered with mud. Also for few times we need to sit.As we come with our 4yrs old (they said it's ok) he's very struggling to go down. So we had to carry him as we don't want he fell down. There's railing for Some spots but others don't have. I was quite shock to see why they didn't make it more proper stairs so small children can go down safely."

If you did not bring a water proof bag, the staff will secure your property with their own water proof bag and carry it for you. Most items are recommended to be placed in a locker which is provided free.The walk to the starting area can be difficult for kids and elderly, due to traversing across a rice field first before descending down a long flight of slippery stairs. After the rafting, there is another climb back up.If you do not mind the stairs, the water rafting itself is enjoyable. You do not need to paddle much as the river itself pretty much carries you down stream. Water is cold and refreshing; and it is only knee deep in many areas, making this a very children friendly area.There is a rest point midway where drinks are sold if you did not bring your own. Along the way, there will be a stopover by a waterfall which my kids enjoyed playing at.At the end of the rafting journey, there's hot shower (with shower gel), towels, water and a buffet lunch waiting at the center. It taste pretty good though, my preference indicated that food is rather salty.One would receive a better offer via calls or through their website because of a discounted rate.

There were only a few sections of rapids, and towards the end it started getting a little boring, so the 2 hour trip length was just right.

It wasn't too crazy with waves and bumps, so most anyone can handle this. The instructor was Madi, he was great! There was time for us to get off the raft and go into the water, take pictures at the waterfalls. There's little stops to buy water and snacks and such. They also give you a waterproof bag so if you want to bring stuff on the raft (camera, money, etc) you can! There's a basic shower there and lunch was included! The Ayung river is beautiful, I had a good time. If you're expecting a huge adrenaline rush and big waves, you won't find that here, but I definitely recommend it!There's a lot of stairs to go down to the beginning of the river, maybe ~250. So be prepared. We wore flip flops which were fine, you'll just have to carry whatever you bring with you on the raft. You carry your paddle with you down the stairs as well. You take a different route on the way up, the steps are much easier to get up."

We asked for 'extreme' as it was low season with less water and so he provided sound effects, water fights with other boats (with Indonesian hotel staff), went down the rapids backwards, got soaked in the boat under any waterfalls etc Felt very safe though.550 steps down to the river and 400 steps back up weren't bad but be prepared. I think it's probably the same for all companies? At least 3 companies shared our landing point so you can't avoid it.Good facilities, locker, showers, change rooms, lunch restaurant with nice view and delicious free buffet etc. This was one of the highlights of our trip. My daughter had done this in Bali before but preferred this company. Probably because of Chris - some boats looked very careful and boring but we laughed for 2 hours!"

The guide,Maddi, was extremely good and funny. The scenery is simply exquisite as the river is located deep within a canyon. You will see waterfalls and actually even get to swim under them: magical. I am so sorry we did not have a waterproof camera/action cam. If there is a place where it should be used is really there. The rafting wasn't extreme and Maddi was great in directing the raft along. The ride takes about 2 hours of pure pleasure. Be mindful of 2 things:1) If you want to pay by credit card, they will try to charge you an additional 3%. There is an ATM across the street though. 2) as the river is located in a canyon, you will have to take a long hike down hundreds of flights of stairs to get there. That is still ok. But when you are finished, you will have to climb another hundreds of stairs (Albeit fewer than for the descent), still ... There are a lot of stairs. Toekad commodities are very good: you get showers, towels, waterproof bag and a food buffet at the end. Be sure to bring with you a full change of clothes. You will get fully wet. In conclusion: lots of stairs but fully worth it."

Provided lockers and a short shuttle trip to the start point. Hundreds of steep stairs down to start point were fine for us... But company should mention this at some point as it wouldn't be if you had a injury or low fitness level. Very short instruction from guide pre start. Forward back boom and where to sit. From then on the guide was very rude and seemed to enjoy hassling us (particular me) for the first half of the trip..patronising and asking if I understand what he was saying... I believe I was following all his instructions and paddling alot more than most of the 3 other adults. I was also told I wasn't smiling enough (wow I looked a bit petrified on my first shot at rafting.. Shocking!! ) and he made a massive deal about it in front of the boat full of people and told me it was offensive to him if I don't have fun in his boat. Did not understand what all this was about at all.!! Mid way break was fine... However... I dont believe it is professional for the person serving drinks to ask you to buy/shout the tour guide a drink \"can he have one??\"... Stop for photos at a waterfall was good and another nice break to cool off in the water. Second half was nice and I could enjoy it more.Steps back up were hard and tiring. Again rudeness from the tour guide after showering whike I was waiting for my partner to finish...was very rudely told to move away from the area and wait in the restaurant for him. Lunch was ok... Bain Marie style.. Not too many options... We didn't really eat it.. Didn't include drinks. Overall experience would of been much better for me if the attitude of the group guide was nice and positive. Very nice river location however. "

The rafting was fun, although I feel that the rapids were not as rough and exciting as I would like it to be, perhaps because July is the dry season in Bali. Toekad Rafting provided us with changing and shower facilities, lockers to store our belongings, and a waterproof dry bag for our camera & important items, which was extremely useful. The rafts, paddles, helmets, & life vests provided were well maintained, and the company drove us to a location near the rafting start point in a comfortable car. The guide was helpful and clear in instructing us throughout, and pointed out waterfalls and many other beautiful attractions along the Ayung river. Halfway through the rafting, we stopped at the river banks for a break where drinks were being sold by local vendors, and although we were not keen on buying drinks, our guide and the vendors were never pushy. The only negative point about the rafting was that there were many steps to climb down and up from the river, and the steps were not nicely constructed and railings were not always present, hence it could be dangerous should one slip or trip over a step. It is also rather tiring to climb up the steps after the 2 hour long rafting trip, and I would not recommend this activity to anyone who has difficulty climbing stairs. The buffet lunch post-rafting was tasty and was regularly topped up by the staff. Overall, I enjoyed my rafting experience with Toekad rafting!"

The river is beautiful, a few thrills, enough to make most squeel. Bali is so much more than Kuta. The scenery is incredible as you are right in the jungle. There are some killer steps at the end but they are well made and safe, those not so fit took it slowly- all good.

After 2 years i found the river to be very busy lot of rafting companies operating hence you will witness traffic in the river. What made it fun was our rafting guide Jack ( great guy to raft with ). Briefed us well with safety instructions before the start. He tried his best to converse in all languages(Including Mandarin) so that everyone understood. There is a good 20 minutes walk down the steps to the river. recommended not to wear shoes, best to raft in flip flops.It is 2 hour session of rafting. We reached the end point at 9 to register and you get a locker to keep your valuables and you get transferred to start point in their car. Equipment was good, safety vests and roving paddles including the raft itself. There is 15 - 20 minutes break after 1 hour of rafting for refreshments.They offer credit here. Bill can be settled later at the end point. You can mini cliff jump there. Even with traffic in the river it was lot of fun for second time. Highly recommended for first timers if you are in ubub.On completion you have to make 15 minutes walk up the stairs to the end point where food is served. Good 3 course Buffet.

While we enjoyed our trip and would do it all again, I think everyone needs to be aware it's a different experience tubbing versus rafting. We didn't really know what we were letting ourselves in for when we signed up for this. The tub is essentially an inflatable small dingy/boat and some of these rapids are fairly dangerous so you need your wits about you and it's not for the faint hearted. You feel everything in the tube and you will capsize repeatedly in the rapids unless you are really lucky. The guides look out for you and are patient coming to our rescue repeatedly. If you haven't done anything like this before you might want to opt for rafting. However if you are up for a challenge and want to do it the hard way then tubbing is for you. Thank god for the life jackets...it was awesome though!"

The river itself (in the January rainy season) is packed with Class 2 and moderate Class 3 rapids. That means lots of splashing and an occasional two-foot drop ... but nothing that gets remotely terrifying. It's a fine river for families, dating couples, etc. Excellent scenery along the way, with many waterfalls, amazing forests and startling views of homes, resorts, etc. on the hills.Our Toekad guide was strong, friendly and eager to please. He picked some eccentric paths through the Class 2 rapids -- either because he wanted to make them more exciting, or because he was making it up as we went along. Our raft periodically veered into a wall or pirouetted on exposed rocks. But, hey, on Class 2 rapids, if you take them in the smoothest possible way, their modest-sized waves can get dull after a while. This kept everything exciting. And on the Class 3s, we never felt in peril.Our tickets included good safety gear (vests and helmets), a well-maintained raft, a couple fun swimming or waterfall stops along the way ... and a nice lunch at the end. You've got a bit of descending at the beginning to reach the water entry point. Also some stairs to climb at the end. But it's not arduous -- and it helps you feel more fully connected to nature."

Not to fear however, as this was a great half day out on the water. A reasonably step descent down to the river followed by 2 hours of rafting. The water seemed to be on the low side so we got stuck a few times but our guide Bobby made sure we were back cruising down the river in no time. A 10-15 minute walk back up to the base camp was at a less steeper gradient than the walk down. Nothing to be too concerned about. Buffet lunch was adequate and the shower / bathroom facilities were reasonable. A good day out."

Toekad Rafting did a decent job and their stuffs is friendly and attentive.Our guide is friendly, entertaining, skillful and trusty.There are many company operates rafting activities here at this river. I think Toekad is the best one. Based on what we saw among other along the ride.They take us by their van to starting point, 15 minutes journey. Put on life jacket, safety helmet and took paddle. A short journey across paddy field and then a long stairs down to the river. I could say it's a tiring warm up.We spreader around 6 into a boat. With a guide.It's a quite relaxing but fun at the same time. As contrast to what we tot it would be exciting and dangerous. Nice scenery along Ayung River, my 5 years old girl seat beside me is enjoying the ride. Only adult paddle but not all the time.1 hours into the ride and there a pit stop where beverages and beer can be purchase.After 20 minutes rest then there another 1 hours ride. Very enjoyable journey as there will always scenery around and interaction with others boat. Won't get bored.At the last 100m you can jump into the river and flow by it to the end.There another tiring stairs climbing to the restaurant after the ride. There you can wash up, towel is provided. A simple bali style buffet lunch is also provided. Lunch is included in the package.A wonderful experience, and nice family and friends bonding activity."

A driver from the rafting company picked us up on time but was pushy, impatient and a bit of a scary driver (compared to normal bali standards). The equipment provided was of high quality (life jacket, helmet & paddle) and then we set off to the river. Please be aware that there are about 400 very steep stairs to climb down that were muddy, unsafe & only partly hand railed. I feel over twice which was scary. By the time we got to the river I was sweating like crazy & my legs were like jelly - I recommend only using this company if you have a medium-high level of fitness and definitely not if you have small children as this climb down is unsafe.The rafting was really fun, our tour guide mardy was hilarious & there was a bit of friendly completion between us and the other rafts. I imagine the more rain in the lead up the better the rafting so could be best to go after a few days of rain.The climb back up stairs was much shorter and the stairs much safer (Aporox 200 stairs) and the guide walked with me as I was lagging behind. Lots of annoying ppl trying to sell you goods on the way back up which was frustrating.Lunch was ok - as a buffet though the rice/noodles were luke warm and I would have preferred a bigger variety with less spicy food.Overall with a couple of small tweaks, I would recommend this company however I would just make sure your fitness level matches the requirements as I struggled to get up/down stairs for 3 days after rafting which wasn't at fun!"

Its nice enough, they are all pretty much the same, the odd Japanese tourist screams with delight as you go over a small bump, but we all do it anyway. Looking for that little bit of extra rush? Something a bit more extreme ? Then this place with their White Water Tubing is the perfect choice. Things seem somehow easier when your in a boat of 6 people and a guide and he yells Boom Boom, paddle, right backwards, to when suddenly, your all alone, in a raft smaller than the size of a bathtub and your heading towards rocks, drops and twists with no front line of defence except good sense. I assure you, that soon flys out the window when your left to your own devices. There is a guide, he is the one at least half a kilometre ahead of you saying come on and you dip, dive, drop and flop off the damm thing. This is a full on thrill seeker experience and one that you do definitely need a good baseline of fitness as there is a lot of paddling to do, and you don't have the other 6 that you can hide from. They have strong currents in the water, so deep, hard paddling is a mist to avoid being sucked through shards and rocks. But very well worth the ride. There is plenty of down time to sit back and chill and just go with the flow, but when the pressure is on, its all hands on deck.So if your looking for a true extreme sport to do in Bali, and one you can do at the same time as the family and friends do the Rafting option, look no further. An amazing voyage."

We took this company as the hotel we stayed in has a promotion on their rafting activity, we paid USD75 for 2 persons instead of per person. I had done a rafting activity at the ayung river with a different company before so there will be some comparisons that I am gonna make with the experience that I had today. The initial part of the experience was walking through (a lot of) steep steps down to the river. Now that is to be expected but the path down is not as secure as what I had experienced with the other company that I went with - there were no consistent hand rails, the steps are narrow, uneven and broken. Families with young children are not recommended here. Ensure you have proper shoes like water shoes (at least those with some grip) my other raft-mates were wearing flip flops so they had a hard time climbing down these stairs. The stairs are not for the faint-hearted.Reaching the river, instructions for rafting was not as thorough as it could have been. Very brief with just how to paddle and not to panic when flung off the boat. I think guides must go through safety procedures with some length as the river can get choppy esp in the wet season and rain (it poured during ours). On a good note, our guide, Alex, is really fun, our journey was filled with a lot of laughter and he takes a lot of effort to make it a fun experience such as getting us to the mini waterfalls, jumping off cliffs, swimming in the water towards the end and lots of banter throughout. Kudos to him for making the experience an enjoyable one! However, safety procedures must be taken seriously esp for families with children cos for many going to Bali for rafting, it maybe their first time experience (we are a rambunctious bunch of adults who rafted before, fyi)The food and changing facilities are satisfactory; a little rustic; don't expect too much. Just a word of caution, you will have to go through a busy street before reaching the restaurant; ladies be aware that you may get stares by the locals for wearing your bikinis which may be uncomfortable for you. Also, to get to that street you will have to climb many, many steps with your jelly rafting legs, but these steps are much better maintained.Another good point is that Toekad rafting has the longest route on Ayung river, no doubt about it. We started at an earlier point and ended at the finishing point later than other companies. This is really great! You get a lot of bang for your buck for that. However, this young company has some ways to improve on esp for safety and facilities which I hope the management will take note of if they want to be a serious competitor in the rafting business in Bali."

There were heavy rains for several days before we went so the water was really moving. Everyone we saw was having a great time from kids to the 50+ crowd. The staff knows what they are doing and really tries to make it fun. They tease and joke with other boats from all the companies that use the river. I will say that Toekad's equipment looked newer and better maintained than a lot of the others I saw out there. Some of the other companies had life vests that were falling apart and boats that look like they could pop with one good hit. No thanks.Warning: there is a steep climb down stairs to get to the raft and some of the steps looked a little dicey. However, I saw one of the staff running down them at full speed in flip flops carrying one of the rafts, so it can't be that unsafe. Just take your time and the boat will be waiting for you at the end."

First, you will never be told that in order to get to the river you will need to take a long way through lots of steps downhill and through the jungle. Take care of your knees! After some 20 min and lots of sweating you will get to the starting point. There you will be handed a water proof bag where you can place your wallet, phone, camera etc. You will be assigned a guide to road with you and other 5. He will explain what to do and how to row. Ours was named Monky and it seems from the reviews here that he is famous! Very kind and funny. The trip is calm with some little bumps and downs. Sometimes the boat will get stuck into some rocks and you will think it can flip over but it won't. Current is not so hard at least when we were there and it was raining. You will be half way around the first hour and make a pit stop. There you can drink something. Ending point is one hour from there. At the end you will get to a small restaurant after going up again through some steps and back into a pavement road. Walk a few meters and there you are, showers and changing rooms (a little rusty). The food was simple but good. We had chicken, fried noodles or rice, soup, fruit, salad and water. The only thing that I didn't like, and probably has to do more with the way commissions work rather than with the rafting company, was the huge differences in prices that you may pay for the same trip. We booked through our hotel and got a \"discount\" from $75 in the flyer to $60. When we were there we met some friends from Argentina. They had hired a local driver who arranged a whole day tour including the rafting and its buffet for $50! This included a tour in southern Bali also. The same experience with other tours like elephant ride. So, I strongly recommend to book these type of activities directly with the company or through local intermediaries. 30-40% less of the list prices is more or less what we learned you can get."

We arrived at Toekad Rafting, the toilets were Western (so no squatting required)!We took out only our valuables to put into the waterproof bag provided to take with us, the rest of our stuff we just left in the van (a nice big bottle of water for the way back I recommend - rafting is hard work!!)Was AU$40 for the white water rafting for 12kms - we only had Rupiah and lucky we took a bit extra as when converted into Rupiah the price came to about 435000.Wayan was our guide - all smiles and knew how to have a joke which was great! Got fitted up with jackets and helmets and walked down a bunch of stairs for 5-10 mins to the river. Once in it was fantastic, so cool! We got to stop at a few places along the way and take photos together, swim in a few spots and buy water/Bintangs. Take it all in, the scenery and greenery are STUNNING and the air so clean and fresh! It's not really for intermediate/advanced rafters is all but if you're after some beautiful surroundings, this is it. I highly recommend wearing sunscreen on the back of your arms/hands and your thighs/knees as these are exposed to the sun the most (I learnt the hard way the very first time I went!)Once finished it was a short 5-10 minute walk back up to the street and then we ended up at a beautiful little restaurant for lunch. Mainly traditional food but some salad and potatoes. Scrumptious though and ice cold water! Towels are provided and you could have a hot shower if you wanted to.Our van and DJ were waiting to bring us back to our hotel and that was that! So much fun and definitely recommend to everyone :)"

My boyfriend and I booked a tubing trip with Toekad down the Ayung river expecting to lie back for a relaxing cruise lasting an hour and a half. What we got was a 3-hour adventure through rapids and the odd one-metre drop. I got to hang on at the front of a tandem tube with our guide Sonix and my boyfriend went solo. We both loved it and Sonix was great - obviously experienced on the river and a great sense of humour. Take a change of clothes because you'll get drenched."

There are about 12 companies doing business down this bit of the river so there is much bumping into other rafts which adds to the fun. All the crews seemed to get along well. We had 6 rafters and Monkey (guide and master rafter) and had a brilliant time together. The hike down to river was steep but easily completed by young and old. The hike up at the end was many steps but easy gradient and no problem either and through some beautiful rice fields. A 200 met walk along the road before the change rooms, showers and restaurant. All were perfect. The meal was a tasty and fresh buffet set in a beautiful location. The transfers were easy and comfortable. Very highly rated."

            "review": "Excellent value...long ride. This rafting company seems relatively new, and I was reluctant to try it, since my previous experience had been with the more established Bali Adventure Tours.For a group of 12 people, Bali Adventure wanted to charge $67 per person, after some negotiating. Toekad, however, offered a price of ~$26 per person. Despite the huge price gap, the inclusions were all the same - transport from Ubud hotel, approx 2 hours on the Ayung River, lunch, showers, experienced guides, and professional equipment.Too good to be true? Fortunately, it turned out to be excellent value all around, and I would be happy to go with this group again. It seems that Toekad takes a similar, perhaps even exactly, the same, route that Bali Adventure did when I went with the latter in 2011. The endpoint docking site for Toekad appears to be the former Bali Adventure site. In fact, we passed the new Bali Adventure docking site (which is very fancy-looking), which is now further upstream. I believe Bali Adventure shifted their entire route slightly upstream, perhaps to avoid the huge construction site of the new Ritz Carlton, now going on up on the shores of the Ayung River.Back to Toekad: After a long, downhill stair climb, our group was split into two rafts. Barking out the occasional paddling instructions (\"Forward,\" \"back,\" etc.), our guide made the trip lively and raucous by spinning the rafts, splashing the other rafters...i.e., the usual rafting shenanigans. In May, the rapids were never above Level I or II, and beginners would be perfectly comfortable here. Even non-swimmers. The gorgeous scenery is a huge selling point for these rafting trips -- lush foliage, unusual rock carvings, cascading waterfalls -- it's what a tropical paradise should look like. Two hours may be a bit long for adrenalin junkies, but I enjoyed just being in nature, even in the slow spots.Few areas of improvement:At the end of the route, we climbed a long upward path to the street (not as long as the descent into the river valley), and had to walk along the street where cars and motorbikes were passing. For the women in our group who wore swimsuits, this felt a bit uncomfortable. Toekad should provide van transport for this leg. We convened at the Toekad headquarters for lunch and showers. The showers were a bit rough -- kind of half-constructed with no towel hooks or shelves -- and could stand improvement. The Toekad restaurant was cute - with a nice terrace overlooking some terraced rice fields. Food was just okay, but adequate for a post-rafting trip, which makes one surprisingly hungry. As with most of these outfitters, Toekad provided some photos for us to purchase. Unfortunately, the guides never told us where the photographers were, so few of us were actually facing the camera in the photos. Plus, Toekad provided only one of each sample photo, even though more than one person in our group wanted the same photo.Overall, it was a fun experience, and great value. My guess is that the price difference between Toekad and Bali Adventure is that the latter has a newer, nice headquarter, better photo setup, and a more upstream route that avoids passing the Ritz construction site. Nonetheless, having done this trip with both companies, I would happily go with Toekad again."

            "review": "Fantastic 2-Hour Adventure. We were so fortunate to stumble upon this rafting company, of several available in Ubud. We could tell that our experience was better than some of the others we encountered. We started at a higher point on the river, and we made several stops that other rafts didn't.Hubby and I were collected at our hotel in downtown Ubud by a driver who took us about half an hour north to the company's headquarters, where we met four other people who were taking the trip with us. We were fitted with life jackets and helmets.Without delay we began descending about 300 steep steps down to the Ayung river bed, where our raft waited. We were given good instructions from our raft guide about the do's and don'ts of rafting.Almost as soon as we got our boat underway, we hit the first set of rapids. Our guide made it really fun ... in fact he was a bit of a prankster. He allowed us to get out and swim in a couple places, and he stopped at some beautiful landmarks for us to enjoy - one an enormous waterfall and another a small cliff for jumping off into the river. We took a breather halfway through the trip for drinks. Our raft guide was happy to take pix of us and kept our cameras in a waterproof bag so they wouldn't get damaged. He told us about some interesting points along the river, like the Balinese Romeo and Juliet story.When we were finished, we were provided shower rooms and towels, and then a wonderful buffet lunch - all part of the package. We were also offered the opportunity to buy a professional photo of us on the raft, for only $5 US. The advertised price was $79 US (always negotiable). We paid half that for two full hours on the water, plus the buffet lunch, plus round trip transportation to our hotel door.We had such a wonderful time we hated to see the adventure come to an end. I highly recommend Toekad Rafting."

As we really enjoyed his company, his kindness and his professionalism, he soon became our driver to discover the region of Ubud.We have been very lucky to have him as our driver. He is extremely punctual, friendly, polite and very honest. He also drives very well, we felt very safe with him.

The prices he proposed to us have always been reasonable.We also liked the fact that Ari is really open-minded regarding other cultures. As he stayed and worked in Europe for a long time, he has a fair knowledge of European culture and knows how to make Balinese culture and traditions understandable from a European perspective. He really takes time to give you all the information you need and will be happy to answer to all your questions about Balinese culture.Another great thing with Ari is that he gladly accepted to show us things that most tourists don't usually see around Ubud (countryside, small villages, etc.), and gave us several tips which were way more valuable than the tips we received from other locals."

I travelled with my family for the first time to Bali \u2013 an exotic , colourful, culture rich island which we had an extraordinary time exploring thanks to I Made Ari ,the owner of Ubud Destination. He is a diver and a guide, a very friendly, reliable, fun person and of course very professional . We didn t exactly follow the tours indicated on the website as we already had some ideas of our own and Made had no problem adapting to our dream tours , making them a reality ;) He told us fascinating stories at each temple , helped us get an insight into the balinese culture and patiently answered all of our questions regarding the everyday life in Bali. So, as the first tour was really enjoyable and memorable , we decided to go on 2 more tours , which were also great( however, on the third tour we had another driver, Coman, who was very nice , but not so much of a guide). Finally , the airport drive was pleasant and on time.I must add that I would have preferred that Made accompanied us everywhere, but there were a few places where he didn t come with us ( and ,for example, it was a bit tricky to find the right , easiest trekking route at Tegalalang rice fields; also, as a travel tip : in my opinion Jatiluwih rice terrace was way more beautiful , more extended, less tourists, so very peaceful)All in all, thank you Made Ari for a wonderful experience!

He drove us to the rice field terraces and he was funny, polite and very service orientated. So we decided to book another tour with him and as well the shuttle to the airport. Compared to the other drivers/day tours he has a really competitive price and therefore he has an outstanding service! He is very reliable and do not just want to make money. He wants to give us tourists a good time in Bali! We felt very safe and he was always giving us some insights about the area we are driving through as well as about the Balinese culture. Thank you Ari for your Service!Really looking forward to come back - in the meanwhile I am happy to recommend your perfect service which made our Vacation very relaxed and comfortable!!!"

Much to our surprise, the staff replied us early in the morning on the next day and we were so glad that they managed to slot us in for the afternoon rafting.It's value for money since they offered to pick us up right from our hotel and sent us back at the end of the day. Once arrived at the place, we had lunch and oh boy! The food is very good! Wide range of food, hot and nice! Apart from the food, you will need to pay for the drinks though which doesn't bother us much! The rafting cost us two hours and WE WERE NOT DISAPPOINTED! It was the best two hours of our lives and it was definitely the highlight of our Bali trip! However, take note that to reach the starting point, you'll need to go down about 600 stairs or more! My legs were trembling at half point. And you'll need to go through about 300 stairs up when you reached the ending point of the rafting! Apart from that, everything else is simply amazing!Agus, our rafting instructor helped us a lot from ensuring our glasses were in tact (by helping us to tie rubber bands to secure it) to tying our go pro to the raft! He told us about the river sculpturing and all throughout our two hours journey and not to mention, he is a funny guy too! Try to opt for Agus as your instructor when you want to play this!

But it was fun! Certainly well worth going with this tour as it appears that they start higher up the river and therefore we may have a longer ride down the river - but don't take my word on that!! Security conscious and safety first made us feel very comfortable.Not extremely wild water when we experienced this trip as we went in the dry season. But I can imagine what it would be like with lots of rain and water. But it was still exciting. The best part was dropping out of the raft and floating on your back down under a canopy of leaves and trees - blissfully cool and relaxing.Our guide was excellent! And my son who really didn't want to do this activity really enjoyed himself so much, he started acting like the leader and shouting us instructions!!! Soooo much fun!!!Lunch afterwards was good.Definitely a must do."

Bali adventure Tours were extremely professional throughout with good organisation, good equipment, safety conscious, knowledge and ensuring the experience was one to remember. The views and being on the water was truly a wonderful experience and I will treasure our memories. Obviously I cannot leave out a comment on the steps!!! Being a mature lady with arthritis in both knees these were extremely difficult both going down and up and I suffered the next day with aching thighs and calf muscles!!!! But I do want to say that even though there were hundreds of steps up and down, these were well maintained with hand rails throughout which helped enormously. Would I do it again? Of course I would, I wouldn't have missed this for anything. If I had been told about the steps would I still have gone, probably not!!!! Would I be disappointed that I missed out on this amazing experience? Yes, yes, yes. So if you too are mature like me bite the bullet and go for it, take time on the steps, wear good foot ware and enjoy this amazing wonderful beautiful activity to the full Also did the elephant safari which was also amazingExcellent day throughout"

We were picked up at 11:30am from our hotel in Ubud. 12pm we arrived and waited till about 1:30pm for the tour guide to actually guide us to the starting point.. Along the way, we had to wait for some more joiners, and started rafting proper only at 2pm.. including going down the massive flight of stairs of course.We finished at 4pm and had to wait for more people to join the bus etc.. some one was still in the shower and the whole group had to wait.. Alot of waiting and waiting and really spoils the day as they were very very disorganised. Some others who were with us were really angry at all the waiting.So I would not recommend Bali Adventure rafting unless u have alot of patience and also, are ok with wasting a whole day for this! :("

If you only want to do white water rafting, then this company will provide you with a good experience.Compared to the other rafting company, this one is more expensive but at the same time there's a reason for that. They starting out very far away compared to the other company in the area. If I have to make an estimate, it'd be something like 30-40 mins trip further up. So if you would like to have a longer rafting session, then this would be a perfect one. If you just want to do an hour or so, just to experience rafting, there will be many other options nearby that's also much cheaper. The guides are professional, some of them can speak chinese, japanese, and english. Don't expect some sort of fluency, but enough to know what they meant.Do rafting in a rainy season because otherwise, from my experiences, it tends to get boring in the middle (about 15-20 mins worth of time) due to the lack of strong current. While word of caution, rainy season also comes with more unpredictable water movements and could be dangerous for someone old/too young. tips: get the package with riding an elephant for a splurging whole day experience."

But it was worth it! I wish I'd taken my phone for photos as the lush jungle is quite beautiful, and we were lucky enough to see some monkeys. But you would need waterproof protection for gadgets as you DO get wet and there's always the chance you can go in - during July the river is not as rough as it can get. Sports shoes were recommended but don't wear trainers if you can help it, ours were still wet and very smelly days later (and coming back into Australia you are supposed to declare that). We were fortunate on the day we went that there were not masses of people as the restaurant certainly is set up for large numbers. But it is very well organised - a little like being herded - but there were only around twenty/thirty people when we were there so was not uncomfortable. Remember to take a tip for your guide, ours was amazing and kept us safe even though I thought we were going to go over more than once. Had I thought about it I would have tipped the poor souls we passed who were lugging those boats up and down those steps.The experience was great fun - and we saw other companies coming in lower down he river - so I would definitely go with this company again."

There are a few stairs tho.When finished we were given a buffet lunch. All in all a great day we had thoroughly recommend"

We thought the daytime would be more hot, but it was actually raining so it was a better experience. Watch out for the stairs down from the station to the river and stairs back up from the river. I think Bali Adventure had better quality equipment and longer route compared to other companies on the river bank and better instructors. I heard there are around 11 other companies operating the rafting ride. But Also Bali adventure is one of the expensive choices, so if you're on a budget, you might browse other options."

The can cost a little more but it is all worth it.Our driver arrived right on time to pick us up in Ubud. He was friendly and helpful.At facilities at the check in point are excellent. Good lockers, showers and toilet facilities. The rafting itself is great fun and the guides make it humours and entertaining while always having your safety in mind. Make sure you listen to your guide as he will instruct you how to paddle and more importantly when not to paddle.This section of the Agung river is rated levels 2 & 3 for Rapids and being the end of the wet season we had a fantastic ride.The steps down we didn't find as difficult as other reviewers. The steps up seem a little more difficult but remember you have been sitting in a raft for a few hours.Take your time there is no race to the top.We had a delicious Indonesian lunch once back at the check in centre. The driver service back to our villa in Ubud was no problems at all. This is a very well run operation.Tips - wear reef sandles or river shoes.- take a waterproof camera as the sights are stunning. - wash any clothes your wore as soon as you can. The river can leave a bit of a stink otherwise."

Weren't too keen on the woman who was looking after the orangutans though as she seemed a bit mean and wouldn't let the orangutans near any visitors. The young lad who took over from her afterwards though was much better and was playing with the monkeys and giving them more attention than the girl before him"

Lockers and change room/bathrooms were very clean however they were very vague about what you take with you. Do I wear a bikini or a shirt? They said we could take phones/hats/sunnies as they give us a bag...then why do we need lockers? I couldn't get a straight answer of what to take!! We then had to drive a little bit (not long) to the starting point where we got geared up. We got helmets, oars and vests. They didn't really check the vests were done properly as my mum had to tighten mine up all the way. We then had to walk down very steep steps (it was slippery and I was barefoot). It was a long walk down so not fit for the young or elderly! The journey itself took about two hours. It wasn't very scary, more of a paddle but that was what I expected. There were other companies as well on the rivers so everyone could look out for each other. We got photos taken at various points and bought these for about $13 Aus. At the end point there were showers and bathrooms but then you had to walk up about 300+ steep steps while you were soaking wet (even worse than the way down) and along the streets (I was in a bikini walking barefoot on the street) to get back to the start point. Lunch was ok, had to pay for drinks. All in all it was what I expected. Not very scary"

The company bus came picked us early in the morning then we passed on 2 other hotels to pick 2 other couples. It didnt take more than 15 min then we head first to Rafting place. Locker rooms were clean and u get a key for ur locker. Our Rafting guide was very funny and helpful, making sure that we are enjoying our time. Water levels in Oct. were low, so rapids were moderate but we enjoyed the breathtaking scenery, green jungle all around with waterfalls. After we r done, we head back to locker rooms to shower/change (they provide plastic bag for ur wet clothes) then go upstairs for lunch. The open buffet was very tasty with wide variety. The waiters were very helpful and advised us on what to avoid as we were muslims.After lunch, you go to elephant park. We watched a show, checked mini museum and we took our elephant ride. then back to bus to return to hotel.If you will do 1 activity then you need a half day for it. If you combined 2 activities, then you need to free a whole day. As you will be so tired to do anything when you return ."

We were transported by a new and comfortable minivan to a center, where we get a privat locker and change clothes for rafting. The center also fresh and clean bathrooms with showers, towels included. Then you ride a little bit more to the river. Our guide was very professional and experienced. The raft was new and all equipment well maintained. The river itself was dry with small rafts, but it's october. The scenary was spectacular with wild monkeys and waterfall showers. The lunch was very tasty and plenty, the drinks, as usual, were not included. There are steps up and down to the river. The company says that rafting is for all, it's true! You still should use a common sense: white river rafting is a high energy activity. The Bali Adventure does it really well!"

As the first person to raft this River many years ago I can testify that despite all the recent competition Bali Adventure Rafting is the most safety conscious plus gives the best value for money . I would recommend Rafting in the Morning , then Lunch at their Kedewatan Restaurant followed by a visit to their wonderful Elephant Park . However if you are staying in Nusa Dua you must leave early in the morning to avoid traffic ."

The scenery is breathtaking - rich, green jungle all around with waterfalls and hand-carved rock walls. There weren't any terribly big rapids where we felt nervous or unsafe, for the most part it was really fun and we had a great time. I don't normally go rafting, but I would highly recommend this adventure! Especially if you're in the area, you might as well!"

Also, there were about 400 steps on the way down and the way back up.

Once we finished first bit of our package tour (Elephant Safari Park in Taro), we were taken to Ayung riverside area to continue with White Water Rafting.Small group of 10-12 people spread out on 3 boats, each accompanied by local guide. All staff was very friendly and helpful. They provided us with helmets, vests and paddles which was quite reassuring.Rapids weren't too steep at all and we felt pretty comfortable throughout the course.Afterwards, we were able to have a shower & get changed into dry clothes which was great. Locker rooms were very clean and spacious, so was the restaurant area where we had lunch prior to our event.Once we returned home, we thought that it'd be nice to have a memory of that day so I contacted them to check if there're any pictures of us taken while we're going down the river. They responded swiftly and forwarded us some pictures (additional, but very reasonable fee) which we appreciated a lot! Overall, we had a great day and would happily return to join other events in the future. I would definitely recommend Bali Adventure to anyone looking for some fun on their holidays / honeymoon :) Thank you."

The locker rooms and showers are clean spacious and have amenities includig soaps, towels, plastic bags. I would recommend highly as TOP of the line in Ubud and quite frankly anywhere. The steps are safe with all the strong stainless steel safety railings. The footings are large concreat conforming to International safety standards. You can see rafting on the Ayung river for 90 minutes that all the other companies respect and are inferior to the BAT crew. It is very comforting to be in the hands of guides that are selected by the \u201cemployeers of choice\u201d on the Ayung River course.

The owner's make shift stall charged us IDR230,000 (USD18) for 4 small Bintang beer, a coconut and a pack of chips! Very pricey!. Later we found out from several tour agencies that the same water rafting costs only IDR300,000 (USD23) per adult inclusive of lunch and return hotel transfer! We contact the owner and he said that his price is high as it includes insurance at IDR30,000 (USD2.30). Clearly we were ripped off by this company.

Last time I chose Sobek and this time Bali Adventure Rafting.Let's cover off cost first - yes it is one of the more expensive operators but you are paying for no compromise in quality. With a couple of young boys (7.5 YO) we chose Bali Adventure Rafting as they have a solid safety record, full insurance, quality rafts/paddles/helmets/life jackets, the facilities are first class and the guides are all highly trained. We could have gone with a cut rate operator and, having seen the other operations on the river today, I'm glad we didn't. We were picked up bang on time and taking to the Bali Adventure Rafting centre. Our names checked off and we were given a electronic wrist band for each adult in the party. This accessed our secure lockers. The changing rooms were guarded, so nobody could come and go without being checked off the list. If you have a waterproof camera, take it - they have dry bags to store them in for you. Also a bottle of water for sipping when you get to the bottom of the steps and coming back up again. Remember a tip for your guide too, it can go in the waterproof bag.This company offers the longest rafting of all the groups. Yes there are a massive amount of steps down to the river, I counted around 592 but I may have slipped a couple. However they are all cleaned dry, concrete and the same depth with a guide rail to hold on to as you come down. Having seen some of the other descents the other operators use, I was glad to have the safe steps, despite how many there were.On the water you get a briefing and safely sat so weight is evenly distributed. Fortunately we were the first to set off, so for a third of the trip we had nobody in front of us, it was wonderful. Our guide was great, understanding that our boys would dabble rather than seriously paddle - so the three adults took up the slack. It's a long trip down but the views are wonderful. It's dry season so the river is low and slower than in the wet season - good for kids and older adults who would prefer thrills without the spills. We did have to get out and walk about 20 metres as the river was too low at one point. Disembarking the raft was very easy and the operators know how to get people up onto the hard safely. You give your paddles etc to the porters, use the bathroom / showers to get the bits out of your shoes and start the walk up back. My kids ran up the 300 steps, fresh as daisies as they'd sung rather than paddled most of the ways. I had jelly legs and had to stop a few times, I'm getting old!At the top you walk about 20 metres and you are back at the Bali Adventure Rafting centre. There you are handed towels and directed back to the changing areas. Hot showers and wonderfully clean toilets await there. You don't need to bring towels with you, they give you one.After changing your names are again checked off and you are ushered into an elevator to take you to The Canopy restaurant. You are checked again as you enter The Canopy, lots of security and safety at this company. The food was brilliant, best buffet we've had in a long time and there are sweets for the kids too. The drinks are a bit more expensive than restaurants.Once it's time to leave you can choose to look at your photos. It's $10USD per set - one super large one, two big ones (you can have two different shots) or four smaller ones (again all different). Best value was the four smaller ones as you can have four different shots.Once you've finished your name is checked off and your driver is waiting to take you home. This operation has really invested back in the business. Staff are fully trained and really engaged, service is top notch and facilities and gear are all in very good order. We'd use this company again, there is no compromise in quality here."

They have been doing this for over 25 years, have amazing guides, the longest section of the river and fantastic facilities and equipment. I have to say, the trek to and from the river requires some fitness...it was a LONG flight of stairs down...so long that my thighs were a bit wobbly once at the bottom. The trek back up wasn't as long but even though I consider myself to be of average fitness, it did require a couple of rest stops on the way up and the next day my legs told me all about it too! That said, it was so worth it! The rafting was great, the river beyond beautiful, our guide was loads of fun and the lunch after was totally amazing! A great mix of Indonesian and more western fare as well, enough to satisfy all! The locker and shower facilities were great as well and much needed! We can't wait to do this again on our next trip!"

Went there with almost 150 people and honestly they well prepared on it. They arranged for pick us up at the hotel in the morning and take us back after all finished. The location of is very strategic and easily to find. The staffs were very nice and the guides were amazing and very helpful! It was taking about 2 hours to complete the track which was a very long distance that made the journey unforgettable. They set up us games on the way for teamwork bounding and made everything much fun. The buffet dishes were great as well. All foods from starters, mains. and desserts taste beautiful, was not enough for only one turn LOL! Bali Adventure is very recommended rafting destination to try. I think I'll come again with my fianc\u00e9 for personal experience.... Just come and feel the thrill!"

It was about $85AUD booking through the travel agent back home but you can definitely book once you are in Bali. Its a little tame if you are seeking a challenging morning however was a very pleasant entry for a beginner white water rafter. You stop at a beautiful waterfall where the guides let you get out and take photos for you (so pack a waterproof camera or go pro).Lunch is included and is a buffet spread is available upon finishing the rafting which was good without being amazing.

We will definitely take our children on the tour next time we visit Bali. The amenities are impeccable and each rafter is provided with a locker and wrist tag and shower facilities.

When I tried to book through one of the places in Ubud they tried to convince me to go with a random company that was about 20% of the price so I ended up booking direct. They came and picked me up from my place in Ubud. Facilities are good. It is a lot of steps as noted by others, but you are doing an outdoor activity so that didn't bother me. As I went in the morning the rafting was first. Guide was good, they make sure you have a lot of fun and there was a lot of splashing about at other boats. The rapids were quite small (and the guide said they had been as of late - maybe this should have been mentioned at booking) this was fine for me as it was my first time, but I think if I went again I would find it a bit boring. After the rafting there was a buffet lunch which was frankly not very good. I understand that they have people from all over the world so the buffet needs to be able to suit a wide variety of palettes, but the food was bland and dishes that were suppose to be hot were not even warm, I was really disappointed as the company seems to have high standards in their other areas. Also, drinks (alcoholic or not) are an extra charge."

When coming to Bali i really wanted to do a few of the more extreme activities that are a bit harder and more expensive to do in Australia.This was heaps of fun and really can be done by most people.If you are un fit, do prepare yourself for the hundreds of steps (some drop 40cm) you must walk down to get to the starting point, and the more you have to climb at the end (the less fit had to stop a couple of times).Our guide was great, in fact all of them where, Safety is a priority. But the professionalism and humor of these guys would make even the most squeamish have a great time (my girlfriend is afraid of water and she had a ball). The instructions given out at the beginning are very simple, with only a few verbal commands to follow. The river took us just over two hours to complete with a rest stop with drinks about half way through. There where points where our guide would yell \"swim aussie, swim!\" and i would jump out the boat and float down the calmer part of the river. They have a very light hearted approach to the whole thing and it seems they really love their job!i didn't use the shower facilities at the end as i was quite dry by the time we got their. The food was okay, nothing special. All in all it was a great day and i would recommend it to anyone visiting bali."

By the time we got there it was a full on monsoon, the stairs had become rivers and the river was rising quickly. The staff delayed the start to assess the danger and we began just as the thunder and lightning started. We had a thrilling 5 minutes rafting but then trees started to fall and rocks too. The guides decided to cancel the trip and we had to walk back up 700 different steps. My legs took three days to recover. I would really recommend this trip and was disappointed when ours was cut short. The refund process here is badly explained and caused a few people to get angry, especially those that had paid by cash. Basically the refund will be sent to your card (if you paid that way) or paypal account within two weeks they inform you by email. Booking online is cheaper but they only use paypal, however if you ring up they will give you the online price!"

I was a little worried having never done White Water Rafting before but these rapids are pretty tame but really fun.We were picked up by Bali Adventure Tours from our hotel and taken to the main Bali Adventure Tours office where there are change rooms, showers and lockers so you can bring a change of clothes.We were then taken to the equiptment office where we were given a life jacket, waterproof bag for small valuables and our paddle and we met our Boat 'Guide'.There are then 600 steps to go down to get to the river where you will start. My legs were shaking at the bottom of these.Then you get a briefing with the 'guide' who will tell you how to hold your paddle, and what you need to do on his commands 'forward' 'back' and 'stop'. The Guide does most of the work, you just provide some extra power if needed.My only criticism and this would have made the ride so much better is if they could try to keep language groups together, we had the guide, us 2 aussies and 3 Chinese people in the boat with us. The guide would call out the commands in both English and Chinese but the Chinese people just didn't seem to listen at all, he would say Forward and they would paddle backwards ect. The guide did thank us at the end as we had to help him with momentum, but it was very frustrating. If they could keep the boats more language specific I think it would be more enjoyable for everyone.After the rafting there is a buffet lunch which is delicious."

Our guide Gusti was very informative throughout the drive and answering any questions we had. The only negative was the very bumpy road leading to the rafting and it was very narrow. It really needs an upgrade but nothing to put you off the rafting of course. They kit you up with all your safety gear and provide waterproof bags for your valuables. The trip down the river was very enjoyable. I would've like steeper rapids but thats the thrill seeker in me. The guide at the back of the raft gives you all the safety info and the work you have to do is hardly anything only the occasional forward and backward motion but he does most of the work. We stop at a small waterfall and you can get out of the raft for photos. Then on a bit you can stop and purchase drinks. On completion our guide was waiting with our bags and you can shower and change. Then sit in the beautiful surroundings of the rice fields for a buffet lunch. Very enjoyable. We definitely worked up an appetite. Delicous chicken dishes, salad, noodles and rice and plenty of water. On from there we were taken to a temple and then toTanah lot which is spectacular. Unfortunately we weren't able to see the sunset as our guide advised us that a ceremony was due to take place and we would not get back to our hotel until almost 11pm. So we decided to leave beforehand. Our guide took any photos of us that we asked and patiently waited while we browsed through the markets and had some food and drink. Great from start to finish.

As a complete beginner I was worried about the adventure but I need not of been, with a shuttle picking us up early this morning we were set for a day of adventure, after arriving at ubud we were given a locker and all kitted up ready to go, the 700 steps down left the legs feeling like jelly but not for long as our guide got us all set ready to go. The instructions are simple so that all languages should be able to follow, the trip was fun and splashing the competitors on the river is definitely encouraged which makes for a lot of fun, the guides are very nice and great to talk and laugh with, and very helpful for photos or if u are using a go pro as we did. Once the 9km is over there is a 300 step climb back to a beautiful smorgasbord lunch and a nice hot shower.Overall a great day especially if followed by the elephant rides. Enjoy a sleep in the shuttle on the long way back to your hotel as we did :)"

It is fun rafting actually and kind a lil bit boring for people who experience real adventurous rafting. I booked this activity for my teen daughters, who never experienced any rafting before. They liked it so much. It is a perfect fun activity meant for everybody who looks for little active adventure that is safe, easy and not extremely challenging. Further more Bali adventure rafting really provided excellent facilities that is clean and well managed. The changing room/shower room, locker, pickup and drop off service, excellent guide and good restaurant's ambient and good food.Yes there are other operators offer cheaper price but for this kind of activity, you should not compromise safety for money especially if it is for your family, although as I said rafting in Ayung river is not something extreme that we need special skills/expertise but as any other sport it still has chance of accident, so choosing the best equipped and managed operator is important.Beside the facilities, the service provided by Bali adventure rafting is well managed. The only complaint I have is about the steps after we finished rafting, the climbing was really challenging for people who do not exercise regularly. Too many steps and it is a really high climbing! Bali adventure should think to provide lift just like some beach clubs in Ulu Watu area, because accident can happen not from the rafting activity but person slipped from the steps because too tired to climb."

The pick up service was on time and the driver was excellent. The office / changeroom facility was the best i have seen it is modern and clean. The sense of security in having an electronic lick on your personal gear locker was welcome. The path down to the river was beautifully kept with hand rails most of the way down. Our guide was fantastic and didnt come across with all the aussie aussie aussie oi oi oi rubbish. Just a nice local man who knew a great deal about the ayung river. My 65 year old over adventurous mother in law came along on the trip and the staff and guides couldnt have done more for her. A nice trip down the river that was fairly sedate a nice safe trip for all ages. Yes there are some steps at the end but they were a lot easier than some.The buffet lunch was one of the best tour lunches i have had in bali.The only issue i heard about was a very crowded ladies changeroom so make sure you are first up the steps.Highly recommended for all age groups"

            "review": "Expensive but good facilities and professional guides. Adult rafting + lunch buffet + elephant ride and show is about AUD$140, which is expensive but must do in my opinion (except the elephant ride - more about that later)! There are cheaper rafting companies but this one is the best and most professional. Change rooms are clean and has lockers, showers, bath gel, benches, towels and attendants - they give you plastic bags afterwards to put your wet clothes in. 600 steps down to river and 300 up are well maintained, the ones going down have railings whilst the ones going up are safely encompassed by cliff walls and plants. We saw other companies with more more dodgy looking stairs and, more importantly, less experienced guides - our guide has been doing this since 1997 and knew how to read the rapids but we saw boats from other companies flipping due to the water flowing differently after heavy rain the night before. I think they are also have a monopoly on adventure tours to Elephant Safari park in Taro - which is a beautiful place where elephants are trained and cared for by their human partners (who stay with their elephant for many years). It is a great to go and take photos with the elephants - they are very smart and can do many tricks under the instruction of their trainer. The short 10min show is great and must see. The expensive 35min ride however is just a loop around the park and not through any exotic trail - I would give this a miss, but I did have a lovely chat with the trainer while we we rode his elephant and got great photos - best of all is that someone takes photos from your camera for you. I think there is another place called Elephant Base Camp in the area, but reviews on tripadvisor say that elephants are hit and poked around to do tricks so I would definitely choose Elephant Safari Park!"

            "review": "Awesome Experience!. 4 of us, my wife, two kids (12 and 10) and I, went on this adventure on the Ayung River. We booked this package through Bali Adventure Tours and were very pleased with the whole experience. All it took was a phone call when we were in Bali and we were able to book the package or pickup two days later.They picked us up from our private Villa and we were driven with two other families in a 10 seater bus to the Bali Adventure Tour booking office where we had to pay for the tour. This is the same place that the tour ends, where the changing rooms are as well as the restaurant. We were given a bracelet that opens a locker and we dropped off our bags and changes of clothes. You get back on to the bus and its another 15-20 minute ride to the starting point. Here, you are outfitted with a life jacket, helmet and an oar and you then walk down about 600 steps to the river itself. The walk is not too bad as the steps are newly built with handrails and the stairs are not too steep.Once you reach the river, your guide will offer to take your shoes and put them in a water proof bag so you are no barefoot when you get into the river. You are then given a briefing by your guide on what to do - Maju to pedal forward and Mundur to reverse, Boom Boom when you are about to go down a fast rapid and Big Boom Boom when going down a really fast rapid. It is then Maju and you start rowing. The entire journey on the river is about 2 hours and you stop 3 times along the way. First stop was where one of the cliff faces has got carvings on the walls, next stop at a really fast waterfall where the guide lets you get out and get soaked or pushes the raft under the waterfall and the third stop to get drinks. Some of the rapids are quite fast some are not. Really enjoyable but quite tiring on the arms and shoulders especially since with 2 kids on board, the 3 adults had to do most of the work!You reach the finishing point and now comes the really hard part - 400 stairs that you have to climb to get back to the top!! These stairs are a lot steeper than the starting point and with no handrails either. Once you get to the top, you are actually on the road and you have to turn left and walk another 100 meters or so to get back to the changing rooms (the booking office where you first arrived). Hot showers and towels await you although there are only 4 showers in the mens changing room so you cant really take too long a shower. Towels are also rather small so if you are the shy kind, bring your own towel if you dont want to change in the nude.a Buffet Lunch is provided and it is quite a good lunch. You have to purchase your own drinks and these are at restaurant prices. Finally, photos are available at the booking office. USD15 for a CD of 8 photos or USD8 per individual photo. The photos are taken at the same spot but at slightly different times so some people would just want the one photo. You can also get a video CD of the trip but the cost is USD35 which seemed a bit steep to me. So yes, all in all a Superb Experience and something I am glad we did. It is not as scary as it seems and the experience is something that you will remember for a long, long time!"

The company provided nice facilities for their customers such as electronic lockers, nice changing room & shower areas. After that, we were issued with our gears and received help from the instructors on how to put them on. After descending through a few hundred flight of stairs, we got on our raft. Our guide was Mr Apel. He was funny and cheerful. We had 2 hours of fun, including scenic photo taking sessions, a short swim and splashing water at other rafters. Upon reaching our destination, we were then led to a nice restaurant for a buffet lunch. The food was tasty!"

They assigned us to our guide. We put helmets & life jackets on & trekked down the stairs to the river. We were the only ones in our raft. All the other rafts were packed. I was seated in the front of the raft as the guide said he would need D to help with the paddling when in the rapids. The views along the river were spectacular. We rafted along the river in a deep ravine. The cliffs were covered in gorgeous tropical trees & plants. Along the way we saw people bating & washing clothes in the river. Trails meandered up the steep cliffs to the rice fields. I could see it would be very hard work for me to climb up any of these trails. When, we hit the rapids, the guide let the front of the raft hit the rock cliff face several times. This was quite a thrill for me as it looked like I was going to crash into the cliff as I was I the front. My husband & the guide would paddle like crazy to get us through the rapids. Near the end of the trip down the river we went over a small water fall. We landed with quite a thump! We waded through the water to the dock. Then, we had to trek up the tallest steps that I have encountered! I am very petite. It felt like these steps were half my height. The guide & D stayed with me as I struggled up the steps. Finally, we reached the area where we took showers. A lunch was included in our package. We were told that the curry style meat dish was chicken. But, my husband said that there wasn't a chicken in the world that had bones that size nor had ball & socket joints. We don't know what we ate? Looking back on our day, we figured out that they isolated us on one raft so, that the youngsters could have their water fights & fun. Also, that way, they could take extra care of us. We totally enjoyed our day on the river. it was almost as much fun as zip-lining in Thailand.:)"

The morning on the river was great and the views amazing. Please be aware that a certain level of fitness is required for rafting. There are 600 steps down to the river and then another 300 up at the end of the rafting experience! After rafting there are facilities where you can shower and change (same area as lockers) and towels are provided. Buffet lunch at \"Canopy\" restaurant was exceptional. It gives you the opportunity to try lots of different Indonesian food. After lunch it is a short drive to the Elephant sanctuary. These creatures are amazing! To have the opportunity to get so close and touch and feed these animals is wonderful. I was a little apprehensive visiting the sanctuary as some previous trip advisor comments included stories of performing elephants. Yes they did perform some painting and kicked a football, but it was more like playtime for them than a performance. The elephants appear happy and well cared for. We thoroughly loved the time spent at the sanctuary. The day ended with a driver taking us back to our hotel. The driver had excellent English and provided us with great information about Bali and the local area. A great way to finish the day!"

When (nearly) everyone had arrived we were driven to the starting point about 6km away. Here we were fitted with helmets and life vests.The walk down to the river is about 600 steps, all well constructed. I'm 61 and 100kg so most reasonably fit people could manage that.Down at the river you board the raft and instructions are given. Quite basic but in my experience it was sufficient for the relatively gentle journey. But be aware that the time of year (wet season or dry season) will dictate how much water is going down the river.Guides made the trip fun. A bit of splashing occurs!The river valley is very beautiful and I really enjoyed it.There is a climb out of the valley at the end of about 400 steps.You then get a hot shower and a clean towel.My only complaint was that we were delayed in getting back to our hotel due to a family of four 'dragging their feet'. Whilst this wasn't a direct fault of the operator, I would have preferred it dealt with to allow us to get back rather than be held up 45 minutes or more.The facilities at start and finish are all 5 star. Nothing dodgy here."

Money aside, well worth it if you get a good deal and organise your own transport!!Excellent time - first time rafting, was unreal, the instructors were out to have as much fun as those on the tour and they made the day even better. They were incredible could not fault them. The price - We paid $88 US each - as per brochure price - DONT PAY THIS!!!! Don't book online!! Did include lunch and transport to and from. Our hotel organised our booking, big mistake!! Determine best price with a driver or stall or at a market. There were people on our tour who paid $88 US for 2 people - this would have been more appropriate, we were ripped off big time!! We brought additional flying fox ride at the start - good fun, but not worth the additional $10US each we paid, better off walking down to the river for that price. Transport was organised to and from - the driver was lovely, but seriously how terrible - picking us up in Sanur - travelling 1 hour to get the next couple in the opposite direction, then 1 more hr to the river. Unnecessary travel for us, wasting 2 hours of our day - did not appreciate this. The driver was lovely, had no say in the pick ups as he was working for the organisation. Would encourage to organise your own transport!!! The lunch included was a very nice spread. Appropriate shower facilities. 5 minute stair walk back to the bus at the end. Could get a CD of all the photos taken by instructor for $35 US - we didn't think it was worth that much, but some awesome photos! Would encourage to take your phone camera with you (not your best camera) water proof bags provided - we didnt take one and regret that! We stopped for 10mins for a swim in a calm area of the river and opportunity to take photo's. another stop for drinks break - stall on side of river selling soft drink and Bintang - cheap price. We also tipped our instructor, commonly done, he appreciated this - again a lot of money for the company, but not much goes to the workers as per many many companies in Bali. The river itself was low when we went, this was no issue. The views are amazing, with wildlife buzzing round - keep an eye out for the black and purple butterflies - incredible. We went under waterfalls. Instructors easily understood with good instructions. 2.5 hrs of rafting went so quick!! Not hard work!This was the highlight of our trip - so much fun!!!! Absolutely amazing views, great, fun loving, cheeky staff :P"

Having said that, the river was low at the time and i can imagine it would get fairly 'serious' after a rain or when the water is high so best to check conditions before you book.

I will say our guide was great and we have no complaints about the safety and professionalism of this company. Both my wife and I enjoyed it. Her more so than myself as I have been rafting quite a bit back in the states. I think where this trips shines is the scenery. It's nothing like I've ever seen in all my times in the rubber boat. Often I would stop paddling without knowing and find myself looking around jaw dropped in awe at the stunning landscape throughout the canyon. The guide would have to yell at me to snap me out of my trance. That alone makes this trip worth it in my eyes. This company also did a great job making sure the stairs down to and out of the river are safe. Having past a few other companies launching rafts into this river, I would say I'm glad we didn't pick them. Their staircases seemed sketchy as all get out! I appreciate Bali Adventure taking the proper \"steps\" to maintain customer safety. Where this trip doesn't shine so much would be first the river is crowded. Our morning group had about 30 rafts and other companies are launching about the same number at multiple spots along the way. We were constantly traffic jamming and running into people which was quite annoying. It even ended up ruining some of our runs through the rapids. The second downside was the rapids were pretty weak. My guess would be nothing over Class 2. For someone who's new to rafting, like my wife, this might be a good thing! But even she said she wished it was gnarlier. If you are looking for rafting in Bali, this is a great company to do it with. Just go with the mindset that it's not really white water, just more like a nature float! Look up, enjoy the scenery and have fun! "

Wouldn't advise those in ill health or elderly to do this due to the amount of steps down to the river and the amount of steps you have to walk back up afterwards- quite physically draining. The buffet lunch was great and catered really well for vegetarians.Definite highlight of the trip.

            "review": "The best and safest company in Bali. Our family purchased a package from Bali Adventure Tours ... recommended from friends as the most professional tour company in Bali ... and I must fully agree, after seeing other tour operators at both activities.We undertook a package for USD$ 410.00 for 2 Adults and 3 Children with had us collected at The Conrad Bali, taken to Ubud for 1.5-2.0 hours of White Water Rafting, showered and lunch provided, then transported to Taro for an escorted tour of the Elephant Safari Park. We then driven back to The Conrad Bali.The experience from the moment we arrived in Ubud, can only be described as professional.From our private mini-bus we were escorted to the main desk where credit card payment was made and wrist band locker opening devices were issued to male and female members of our party.We were then escorted to the large super modern and immaculately clean change rooms, to change into our swimming attire, leaving all items in our secure oversized lockers.We were then escorted back onto the bus, and taken 5 kms along the major road, and then the same distance down a side road to the Rafting Centre. Here we were allocated a well spoken guide who fitted us with modern rafting jackets, helmets and a paddle.Be prepared for a 15 minute walk down, concrete stairs with stainless steel hand rails, to the river at the base of the hill. Whilst quite steep, the well spaced and wide stairs offer great security, unlike other companies which we viewed as we travelled down the river.With the water level medium to low, the rafting was laid back and easy with 1 metre rapids every 200-400 metres.Have faith in this company, as the guides are extremely experienced and can relate to all age group with respect to their abilities.I noticed as we travelled down the river, our start point was at the highest point of the river, where other companies started a few kilometres further down the river, where the river was very open. Starting in the canyon walls made the experience all the better.At the end of our river rafting, we exited the river to modern facilities with toilets, other companies don't offer this.The 300-400 steps back up to the top of the hill and our initial bus arrival point (lockers) requires a medium level of fitness, and takes 10-15 minutes. Plenty of places to rest along the way.Back on top of the hill, we went back into the Locker Area, where modern toilets and hot showers awaited with plenty of clean towels. This area was large and never felt crowded.From there we entered a lift to the third storey of this facility, where a huge open dining area was located with modern \"sails\" providing shade along with overhead fans. A large buffet lunch was provided with a large variety of fresh food. Drinks were provided but at cost.All in all, I have to say this company far exceeded my expectations in service provide and product delivery."

My 10 & 6 year olds absolutely loved the rafting and went floating down the river at times (very competent swimmers) to mix the ride up. The guide was great and Bali Adventures provides a 9.5 km journey that is easy on the arms. As far as the return up the hill, be prepared for a leg workout but there is a great view to keep your mind off the walk if you find it tiring. Facilities for changing were very good and the lunch also good."

This means the safety standards, technology and structures are all very Western and thoroughly competent. We had a great time. The check in and kitting up are efficient. There is a safe place to store your things. Our rafting guide knew his stuff and as a bonus (nothing to do with the company) the sides of the river are carved with the story of the Mahabharata. The rafting was lovely - quite tame but definitely lively. You could bring young kids with no worries. (Perhaps not a baby). I've done quite a bit of rafting before and I thought the instruction was very good. Afterwards a meal is included - it's not memorable; but it's nice enough and after the walk up and down the canyon (and a good shower) it's a good idea.Highly recommended."

The scenery along the river is very nice, had the \"Jurassic Park\" feel...Prepare your camera or phone but don't forget to bring along the plastic cover for your camera or phone as we will get all wet (the guide would have a water-proof bag to keep all the belongings). There are other rafting facility sharing the river but we were recommended by the hotel to this. Rafting is not as scary as some people think it is, it's a great activity you can enjoy with the whole family, in my raft we had a 5year old girl from France and she was loving the whole process with her 7year old sister.The guides are very communicative and fun. We are provided with a small locker for necessary belongings. They provided buffet lunch after the ride (please do not expect too much, its just a simple lunch).The shower is area is something not very good, though there are towels available but my wife and i are particular about cleanliness so we brought our own towels from the hotel we stayed. Bear in mind, there is no hot water available for shower. The The price included with a hotel pick-up to Ubud. Cons The drinks are not included in the buffet lunch, and is quite expensive. Prepare for a lot of steps up and down as its a long way down before departure, and its a long way up after the tedious raft. Some people may not even have the energy left to climb up after the rafting session. haha!The turn-off part is that after our session, when we were chatting with some of the locals, they said that its not really recommended to go into the water because it is very dirty. This is because the rafting portion is almost the bottom of the stream, at the top of the stream, villagers wash their clothes, and the stream serves like a public toilet for most, and they also bath in it. So i do not have to elaborate further."

We missed out the chance to white water raft earlier on our holiday in New Zealand because of our daughters age (9), so we were delighted when we got the chance to try our hand in Bali. The whole experience was very slick. From the hotel pick up, to the food (before you ride), to the safety procedures and equipment briefing. There are about 500 steps down to the river so you've got to be fit (particularly as you have to walk back up them after the trip down the river), however the ride itself isn't too strenuous as the expert and the river take most of the strain. You're in the boat for about 2 hours and it's great fun. Afterwards there are hot showers. There are a couple of photo stops along the way and the whole process is filmed so you can purchase the DVD and photos after. Highly recommend. Tip: take flip-flops and bikini, no need for towels as they are provided. You can also take your own camera as they have waterproof bags."

Everything there is clean and modern with lockers provided for dry clothing and valuables to be left. We were given helmets and life jackets and then led down 500 stairs (yes you read correctly!) before getting to the rafts. Our legs were like jelly at the bottom as they were very steep stairs. The rafting trip itself is around 2 hrs and it very beautiful and lots of fun. This company has the longest trip of all with some other companies joining the river almost 3/4 of the way down. It was pretty tame as the water wasn't very high (dry season) but still had a few thrills along the way. At the finish there are 400 stairs to climb back to the top. Needless to say, not being terribly fit, my legs ached for 2 days after! Not for the very young or elderly, unless they are quite fit! Lunch was ok, and we were the taken promptly to the elephant sanctuary for the next part of our day."

I kept going down despite my legs getting wobbly which at the time I didn't think was a big deal but they where so sore for the next three days after !!! I realise this is my fault for not being fit enough and not the rafting company's. The rafting it self was great, myself and my partner didn't find it particularly scary but the people with us did.

            "review": "Dangerously untrained guides and poor organisation. We had the misfortune of booking the Elephant safari and rafting package through Bali Adventure Tours. Whilst the elephant park was fun (without getting into the ethical issues) - The rafting was an absolute nightmare.Firstly, seeing as we booked both as a package, no one told us anything about how to get to the rafting from the elephant park. We assumed they were near, but are actually a fair distance drive apart. Had we not asked at reception, no one would have helped us get there and we would have missed out (in retrospect, not the worst thing in the world).When we did arrive at the rafting, no one greeted us. My fianc\u00e9 began reading a leaflet with safety instructions but was promptly told to put it down?!? and come join the rest of the tour. Luckily we rushed over because there was a 'short' 1 hr wait for anything to begin. (and it only started because I told them to).We were given helmets (my fianc\u00e9's was too big), life jackets and a paddle and told to follow the guide down to the river (still no safety instructions). Once we got to the river we jumped into the raft and FINALLY were given a brief safety breakdown which lasted around 1 minute and delivered by a guide whose English was not good at all. After we set off down the river, we promptly smacked a rock and capsized. Not really knowing what to do in this situation, my fianc\u00e9 got trapped under the boat and I got swept away from her. To be fair, at this point, the guide was excellent and grabbed her and took her to safety though it was still a very distressing situation. That was the end of the tour for us and we requested to be taken back up to dry land. Our guide paddled us to another tour company's starting point and we got out there. Interestingly, the other company (i didn't find out their name) were safety drilling their riders and making sure they understood everything unlike our company (who boast being the 'original' and safest rafting company and urge you not to 'accept imitations') I would definitely not recommend this tour and especially not for young kids, the elderly or poor swimmers. (the company says you're fine between the ages of 5-75!!!)My advice would be to do your homework and find a company that is much more professional and not just relying on the endorsement of a few celebrity riders."

            "review": "nice view, but too many steps to walk to the starting point!. My GF and I did rafting with Bali Adventure Tours in the Ayung River and in general, we thought that it was great, but not excellent though.Firstly, in terms of the scenes, they were very beautiful. If you love watching waterfalls and forests, you should do this tour. However, to get to the starting point, you had to walk down like more than 300 stairs and this really broke my legs. My legs were shaking and could barely walk after arriving the starting point. After finishing the tour, i think you have to walk up for around 200 steps, which is easier than going down-hill.Secondly, in terms of services and professional experiences of the rafting guide, perfect. This company did provide \"hot\" water for shower and provide plastic bags for putting your dirty cloths into it after doing the rafting. The tour guide, although i though he was a bit rude at the beginning of the tour, at the end i thought he was ok sine he had to make sure everyone understand his commands and hence, make sure everything was safe. On the other hand, the driver who drove us to the rafting office was really nice and explained to us why there are so many people in bali and hence, traffic jams. Thirdly, about the food, the buffet lunch they offered was great and I especially like the desserts. The one in light green, which looks like pancake in a wrap, was the best. Fried rice and noodles were good. Another pitfall was that drinks were not included and you have to pay for the drinks.Finally, it was very crowded on the river. This was quite annoying that you saw many rafts on the river and for a few times, there was even serious \"traffic jams\" there and this made several rafts crashed tgt. But this was not the problem of this company, and so no start was deducted from this pitfall.As a result, I would like to give a 5-star review, but since you have to walk down for more than 300 steps to get to the starting point, one star was deducted. Overall 4 stars were given."

The boats are good quality and you feel assured that safety is importantOnce on the water it's all fun. This isn't Grand Rapids but there is just enough white water to put a smile on the face of thrill seeking kids (and adults). The boat crew make sure you go at the pace you want to - so we saw some people taking it very leisurely while others were being more adventurous. Our guide had being working for the company for nearly 20 years and was great fun. There is a buffet lunch (not the best we've had but sufficient) and hot shower at the end. This company charges more than some others but you do get longer on the river and personally we thought it was worth the additional cost."

If you're afraid of cold, you might want to wear a T-shirt under your life jacket.We intend to buy only a few pic of us but the printer is not working so end up buying a CD of pictures they took for us at IDR200,000. Worth the price for the quality as it was drizzling we're unable to take some pictures with our mobile cameras."

Bali Adventure had the longest rafting route, provided good services and has good bathing facilities. The only warning I have is that you have to be ready for the many steps down to the rafting start point and again the many steps up from the end point. And it was really many many steps. Nonetheless I still felt that it was a worthwhile trip and something that you should not miss. I mean the rafting, not the steps!"

            "review": "Amazing value, professional set-up, top points to this organisation. These people know how to run a business. Rave review is a no-brainer for this joint - here's why:- Pick-up bang on time from hotel- Great facilities when you arrive - locker room, nice showers, plenty of friendly staff helping direct you- We had an awesome, smiley and super friendly guide named Desu. Never once lobbied for a tip or anything, and unfortunately all of our gear was left in the locker so we actually didn't get a chance to give him anything, which we felt a bit bad about. But you'll never be made to feel as though you need to spend anything more than the ticket price- The steps descending to the river (and yes there are a lot of them, so get ready for a workout) are a masterpiece - loads of thought and work has gone into this operation, all the equipment is top-notch- You literally spend about two hours on the water - it's awesome fun. As you go down the river and see all of the other company's guest hobbling down overgrown, narrow steps with cheaper gear, you'll feel a bit of pity for them and thank the stars that you picked these guys. But I don't want to sound harsh, I guess you get what you pay for and not everything's affordable for everyone - all of the tour companies were good sports, we splashed all the other boats as we went past them and spirits were high between all those using the river- The river is stunning - absolutely beautiful scenery the whole way- Aside from an orgasmic local smoked duck experience elsewhere (which I'm not going to review on Tripadvisor, too good to publicise), my wife reckons the complementary buffet lunch after the rafting was the best on the trip. Top marks to these guys for this, as it would have been easy to just shovel some slop on a plate and fulfil the obligation, but rather they've got a great dining area attended by lovely staff with excellent food and dessert - really well thought out.Nothing to knock about this adventure. Should be rated higher in my opinion.Some tips:- You can wear bare feet in the raft, so the footwear is only relevant for the steps going to/from the river, and our guide put our shoes in his wetpack to keep them dry. So if you're happy to descend about 1,000 steps in thongs, don't be fussed about what footwear to take. Towels were supplied by the tour company so no need to steal your hotel one, and plenty of plastic bags were available for your wet clothes.- If we did it again we probably would have purchased a drypack for our mobile phones and used them as cameras (these are available for about US$20 at the venue), otherwise the photos are for sale for US$8.- There's a little store there that sells water and snacks and sunscreen etc. at reasonable prices- I can't be sure what caused it, but I did arrive home with a bit of an ear infection and I reckon this might have been from the paddle wars we had with other boats (probably worth the fun, to be fair). So you might want to take some earplugs if you're worried about this."

The equipment is very good and the guides extremely knowledgeable. It was our first rafting experience and we felt completely safe with this company. And it was still plenty of fun! You could see other tourists which were on dodgy looking rafts with no handles to hold on to! Some groups kept getting stuck on rocks or didn't seem to be able to steer properly and kept on hitting the banks of the river. Our guide was so good we quickly became confident and never went off course. Although I would like to say we were that good, it was clearly only thanks to him! Only warning : to go down to the river and back up again, there are many many stairs (I can't quite remember how many the guide said but hundreds of them). If you have trouble walking, this is clearly not recommended."

The whitewater rafting itself was not very extreme as it hadn't rained recently. So it was a nice row down the river and had great views of the surrounding waterfalls/rainforest. There were some more exciting sections but was hoping it would be a bit more intense. Would definitely recommend this company as they comply with safety regulations which is not common to many of the other companies."

I read their brochure on rafting and it sounded like a fun way to get some exercise without being too long a day. The only fault I can find is the river rapids were a bit tame for my liking, but the upshot is that while the rapids may lack adrenaline moments, the ride is relaxing and is great for all ages. The day started with an on schedule pickup at my hotel. The first stop was the check-in center. As with everything else throughout the day, the check-in was seamless. At the check-in center we were whisked to locker rooms to change and leave the non-essentials behind. THe issued digital locker keys work great. AFter this brief break we continued in our same group to the rafting launch center. ANother extremely efficient outfitting process ensued. Literally we just walked through the center and were handed life jacket,helmet, and oar. THe only \"delay\" of the delay was killing time waiting for all other groups to show up and be outfitted. After the group was put together, the long slog down the many steps to the launch station ensued. It would have been nice to have been or forewarned about this descending process beforehand. There would have been ample time to show a video for example while killing time before the walk down to the boats.Our guide was great. There was six of in the boat including him. The safety briefing was conducted and we were on our way. THe scenery really is breathtaking. I felt like we were on the set of Jurassic park as we meandered down the river. The ride itself was very docile. Nobody was tossed out of the boat or for that matter came even close to meeting that fate. Along the river we passed by many waterfalls and other rafters from other companies. There was one section where we jumped out of the boat and floated leisurely downriver. Occasionally water wars erupted between passing boats. All in good fun. The conclusion to the fun ride downriver was a long slog up stairs back to the rafting check-in center. THe stairs really aren't that bad, especially when one sees the raft porters hauling the deflated rafts up on their heads. That's about 60kgs we were told. After changing/shower/freshening up, there was a splendid lunch hosted in their check-in center restaurant. As per usual for these excursion meals, drinks are extra. The facility is top-rate and seating choices include inside with full air-con and outside under umbrellas. I'd recommend the outing if only because it's relaxing and I was back at my hotel at 2pm, so the day still had plenty of time left to use. True adrenaline junkies won't have their cravings met, but for most others the incredibly smooth operation, genial staff, plus beautiful surroundings will make for a memorable day."

They are all even though and well maintained.My wife and I were allocated a guide and a raft with two other people. There was a short briefing and then we set off paddling into the main stream.The river flows quite rapidly but the white water sections are reasonably gentle. Good fun though as the boats bounce of the gorge wall, rocks and tree branches. At several points the rafts are pulled over to the side and only allowed through certain sections when it is clear and safe to follow on. There are safety crews located at all the larger white water sections.The scenery is spectacular.The trip lasts about 2 hours, much longer/further than a lot of the other rafting providers. At the end there is steep climb up (c300 steps) to the base where you can get a shower and are provided with a buffet meal."

The equipment is new & safety is uppermost. Boats are not crowded & the guides are really professional. It's safe but still lots of fun & you do get very wet. 300 steps back up & these really hurt the calf muscles but the guides help you all the way. They do not solicit or expect tips. Back to headquarters which are super clean & there are clean towels, showers etc & plastic bags for wet clothes. This is really well thought out. Upstairs for lunch & it's really great. A buffet to satisfy anyone on the covered but alfresco deck. Great staff.Just go back downstairs when you are ready & they will drive you back to your accommodation.We will do this again but might wait a while for our leg muscles to recover"

The river is actually quite benign and shallow. I can't imagine it would be fun in the dry season. The equipment was good. Yes, there are cheaper rafting co's but how much money do you need to save? Steps was a big consideration for my wife who is recovering from an accident. This one has secure concrete steps with handrails all the way down at the start and concrete steps and no handrails at the end, so that was a bit harder. But we managed. Some of the other guides weren't so good. One actually fell out of his boat ... The photos were $8 for four so ok, the food afterwards is ok, but skippable."

Interestingly, it wasn't the first tour offered, but after we looked at the brochure, the tour desk said 'it was the best but a little more money'. For about USD$5 avg pp, for their security, safety and cleanliness as stated in their brochure, it was an easy call.We had a driver pick us up from the Nusa Dua property which took about 1.5hrs to get to Ubud and the white water rafting. We changed in the super clean locker rooms - a key coded bracelet is assigned to each locker. Then fitted with new helmets and life jackets, we joined others at the meeting point. The staff were happy, chatty and professional at all times.We wore reef shoes, swim shorts and bikini tops. Pleased we wore the shoes and especially the shorts as you sit on the rubber rafts and you could end up with rashy butt if you wore bikini bottoms. Not a good look! Take your own waterproof camera on the raft.There are about 400 steps to walk down and your legs feel like jelly at the end. Other companies use the same river but Bali Adventure Tours starts higher on the river.Grade 2-3 on the rapids and fine for older children and we had a lot of fun for the 2 hours.Then the 400 stairs to the top was a bit of a killer; hot shower, change and then a lovely lunch to end.Our driver then took us to the Elephant Safari Park which was again, clean, professionally run. Quick show, then onto the elephants for half an hour walk around the park. The elephants looked well care for and their handlers are chatty. Photos feeding them, on them, patting them \u2026. they weren't out of bounds.Obviously a bit of money spent on both attractions and the slightly higher price reflects it. But we had a great time and well done to the organisers for helping the elephants."

But to me, the slightly higher price is great for a peace of mind for safety and an enjoyable time. We booked our trip through Bali Discovery Tour which was helpful and recommended Bali Adventure over others as they have just upgraded their facilities. Pick up was early between 715-745 and the drive was around 1.5hours from Seminyak to the Ayung river area. After which it was changing in the washroom which had showers and toilets and was extremely clean and well-maintained. Lockers were provided to keep your belongings and you could bring your camera with you as they would stop at some place with cravings for you to take photos and provided waterproof bags.After changing, it was a short drive to the facility where they prepared you with life jackets, helmet, paddle and signing of an indemnity form and walking down many(!) steps to the river. It's not an easy walk as the steps were steep and there were many of them so it would require a certain fitness level as it is a treacherous road back up with an equal amount of steps to climb and my calves are still painfully aching though I did the activity two days ago. But the whitewater rafting was worth the steps! It was my second time doing whitewater rafting, the first in Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, and the second time was as equally enjoyable as the first. Bali Adventure starts at the highest point in the river (it does seem so as we saw other companies as we went further down and we didn't see anyone coming from behind us) which also means the longest experience! Their rafts had ropes for us to hold on to and they packed no more than 5 people onto a raft. Guides were experienced, friendly with a fair understanding of English and were excellent in their skills. Bali Adventure did not stop at any of the stalls along the river for us to \"buy drinks,\" which I was half expecting. They did stop at a carving to help us to take photos and take a brief break and at this waterfall area which was absolute great fun! Our guide pushed the raft towards the waterfall and it was a strong one, I could feel the water crashing against my helmet and if you're more adventurous, you could walk (the water level is hip deep maybe? I'm 1.58m) and stand right under the waterfall which would pummel you and leave you unbalanced but my guide was there to hold me and make sure I didn't go under. Absolutely wonderful and the highlight of my whole journey along with the rapids. After the adventure it was many steps back up to the facility and a quick shower to get clean. Soap/ shower gel and towels were provided and facilities were excellent. There could be a wait to shower as there were only about 5-6 shower cubicles. Lunch buffet was pretty good and better than some I had at other tourist areas in Bali. An absolute must-do if you're in Bali."

The pickup was very late, we were told to be ready at our pickup point between 8:15-8:45, but they arrived to pick us up at 9:15. To their credit they did communicate well with us about the delay, but considering we were only staying 10 minutes from the destination it would have been easier to get there ourselves. As we were already staying in Ubud it also uncomfortably felt like our fee was subsidising tourists from further afield (eg. Kuta). Maybe there should be a reduced cost for people arriving under their own steam! When we arrived, it was quick and easy to get through and we were given our locker tags and had the opportunity to get changed into bathers- I would definitely recommend this, or come already dressed in bathers. The facilities are 5 star, - very clean, high tech and modern. We were then fitted into a vest and helmet, and then we climbed down a lot of stairs to get to the starting point of our rafting tour. Our guide was very nice, he had excellent English and always made jokes. The whole rafting experience was thoroughly enjoyable and fun, including the small stops such as the water fall massage and the rock carvings. You get extremely wet, so bring a spare set of clothes to change into afterwards. You don't need anything else, as they supply fresh towels, body wash and shampoo! The lunch afterwards was good quality food but drinks were an unexpected additional price. The whole thing was very safe, and the staffing levels were excellent- they even had someone to help get the vans out to the road safely. This was an awesome birthday celebration and the premium price for this company was well worth it for this special occasion."

The driver collected me at 7:15am and it took more than an hour to travel from my hotel near the beach up into the hills.Once you have been signed in and given your gear there is long walk down some stairs to the river and a long walk back up the stairs at the end of the rafting.The rafting was great fun. Our guide was excellent. Apparently the best time to go is in December or January when the water is higher during the rainy season. The activity requires no special experience and all the safety gear is provided. The tour operator has secure lockers and change rooms with clean showers and towels.The activity also included lunch. The food was a bland mix of western dishes and asian food. I would have preferred to be offered more local dishes. I thought it was cheeky to charge for drinks to go with lunch."

Beautiful scenery and jungles, so much fun!WE ABSOLUTELY LOVED OUR GUIDE - ARTA!His english is really good and he is really nice. This was our first time rafting and he made sure that we were safe but also enjoy the bumpy ride! He is really funny and also did few tricks which made the rafting really fun. We were not able to give him tip as we thought he was going to come to restaurant with us. Tip is not compulsory but we felt bad as he worked so hard to made our trip so much more exciting. So if you choose to do this, take some money with you. (even though it will get wet!)Food was also very nice, nice salads.Elephant ride was also quite exciting. They had few baby elephants, quite cute.Guides are nice and will make sure you enjoy your ride :)Absolutely recommend this activity. This was the highlight of our trip."

I think you will know that this company charges are highest but is it worth the value!Equipment are clean and steady, and our guides are good. There are all in all 12 rafting companies for Ayung River at different starting points and with Bali Adventure, they travel the longest along Ayung River. Each raft takes 5 pax but some companies have raft taking up to 7 pax which resulted in a lot of stuck rafts between the rocks !!!! The rafts from Bali Adventure were never stuck between the rocks (at least what I saw) so I credit that to the smaller sized rafts and skills of the guides.This is my first time doing white water, but I was in awe with the beauty of the river. Towering cliffs, different types of fauna, waterfalls...so pretty! So if you are giving this activity a second thought, don't! And I honestly don't think you should let the stairs hinder you :)"

            "review": "Great adventure. We've bought a package with Bali adventures, doing an afternoon session of rafting followed by night elephant safari. The rafting experience was real fun! After getting ourselves equipped, we walked down from top of the mountain to our start up point. The rafting wasn't very difficult and in my opinion it is manageable even for beginners. Couple tips/ recommendations:1) Wear a light t-shirt, it gets slightly chilly after you got wet2) It's ok to paddle barefoot, so don't bother buying special shoes 3) If you have a Go-Pro recorder and a casing, bring it along! I saw people fixing it on their helmets4) Bring along your camera. You'll be given a dry bag and in between stops u can do good pictures5) Save some energy, because you need to climb all the way back up on stairs to the starting pointThereafter, you can enjoy a good hot shower at Bali adventure's facility. You really don't need to bring a lot of things.. everything from toiletries, towels, bags for dirty clothes... it's all there. Food is served after the trip.As to the elephant safari, I must say that this is by far the most decent and cleanest safari I've ever been to. The elephants are bathed daily and very well groomed, we even got to see the baby elephant!"

The pick up from Nusa Dua was efficient and well organised.Driver was a little reckless, and hit a motorcyclist on the return journey (luckily both rider and bike were intact, and sadly I had already filled in my comment form).The rafting experience was fun, the guide on the raft was a well mannered and polite guy who enjoyed teasing the tourists in a nice way and wouldn't push people into doing things they weren't comfortable with.This sounds obvious, but carry a spare set of clothes... you will get drenched. Also be prepared for a hike up a loooong set of stairs to get to and from the river.We did an Elephant tour too - so our day was split with a complimentary lunch. Food served was excellent and the cooridnation between the different events was well timed and planned. Overall an excellent experience. I think if I was to do it again, I would probably miss out the Elephant Ride, even though it was good fun and a nice trek, I've done elephant rides before and could do something else instead."

We took the rafting and elephant safari ride package for our family of 4 - including a 6 and 14 year old - and all were impressed with the day. We were staying close to Ubud so the amount of time in traffic was minimal (but still probably 30min each way - but that is Ubud traffic) - would be a very long day if you were coming from Kuta.The rafting section of the day was awesome. Well organised and run - although it is a bit chaotic at times with the number of people and working out where to go next. You start at check-in (they call you by your hotel name) then store your gear in the lockers (available in both the males and females change rooms). Change room facilities were very clean. Towels available free of charge. You need some footwear to get down the stairs to the start of the rafting and also for the walk back at the end (along the road for about 200m). Thongs are fine. All gear you take (cameras, shoes, etc) are stored in waterproof bags during the raft. We had a small waterproof camera which they tie to your vest - able to get some photos in the times when not paddling.As it was near the end of the dry season when we went, the water level was low which was good for the 6yo and other first time rafters - enough water over the rapids to make it thrilling but not too scary. A couple of chances to get out of the boat and float along the river as well.Buffet lunch provided after - excellent variety of food. Just need to pay for your drinks - this is where they make their cash.The elephant park was good, but there was a lot of waiting due to the numbers of people and the need to wait for an available elephant. However, they call you (and find you if necessary) as your time gets closer. The ride itself goes for almost a half hour and wanders through the forest so does not feel rushed. Could just do with a couple of other things to look at/do while waiting for your ride."

The cycling tour was very interesting, although in some parts I felt that less experienced riders might find it a bit tough and probably even might fall off due to the steep downhill jungle paths.Anyway, the rafting was a very exciting experience (I have never done this before, so I have no point of reference for comparison). The guide was absolutely crazy, but in a good way, i.e. he managed to help us navigate the raft in safety, but yet in some parts I could feel I might fall into the river (didn't happen, thanks to the advice of the guide). He managed to add loads of \"thrills\" to the ride. I also got to see very scenic parts of Bali and very interesting rock carvings along the way, which otherwise would be difficult to get access to.I would totally recommend it!"

We booked via phone (Skype) once we arrived in Bali and the reservations clerk completely messed up our name and hotel resulting in no pickup. Luckily we had some flex in schedule and were able to rebook a couple of days later, locking in the online price which was $20 usd /person less than in local brochures. (rafting and elephants combo including a very nice buffet lunch - no drinks included in price! - and hotel transfers). Rafting was awesome with practically brand new change rooms / shower / toilets / free locker facilities. (towels, shampoo, conditioner and plastic bags for wet clothes included)All the rafting gear was in great condition and our guide Agus was friendly and helpful.Its definitely a jurassic park type experience with 200+ feet high cliffs / forest surrounding the river. We got to stop for a couple of photo opportunities (cameras can be taken in the guides waterproof bag) and then jump out and float down on our backs for a couple of slower segments. (optional and great fun).The whole rafting part goes for approx 2 hours and allegedly 9km of river. All you need to remember is to be prepared for quite a few steps and sore thighs and calves the next day. (600 down and about 350 up at the end) and also that you will be required to put in a bit of effort and actually paddle at times to fully appreciate the experience."

We bought the family package for our family of 4 (including two boys ages 8 and 11) which included transfers from our hotel, rafting, and a buffet afterwards. (We purchased this package at the Elephant Safari Park the day before and received a 20% discount). The experience was first class from the time we arrived at the locker changing room, to transfer to the head of the river, to meeting our very personable and capable guide, Wayan W. Although the rapids aren't very challenging, they were lots of fun for the kids. The thing that made it so special was the incredible scenery. We have rafted in Colorado, West Virginia, and Costa Rica, and this was definitely the most beautiful river, flowing through a deep gorge in the jungle. The scenery was fantastic, mostly pristine jungle, with an occasional hotel on the hillside, and an interesting area that had been carved with Hindu stories. My son loved jumping out of the raft and standing under a waterfall. Our only disappointment was that we weren't told that we could bring a camera to put in a waterproof bag and so missed this photo op. You should also be aware that you have to go down what seems like thousands of steps to get to the bottom of this deep gorge at the start, and back up again at the end. A little bit of lower body exercise to even out the upper body workout from paddling! At the end of the trip we took hot showers in the very nice locker room and had a nice buffet before being driven back to our hotel."

They came highly recommended by our guide and the tourist information staff. The pickup from the hotel was right on time. Aside from us there was another Australian couple who also booked with them. We were grouped together in one boat. You leave your stuff in the locker provided and they give you a water resistant bag for your belongings. My mistake i left my wallet in the locker...but more on that later. The staff were very professional from the briefing right down to teaching you where to clip your water proof camera. The steps down are not so bad because there are handrails along the steep stairs which is a huge help. During the whole stretch of the river, your guide will point out interesting stuff like carvings. They will also inform you which part you can get off and let the current drift you along. Several stops are made along the whole journey for photo ops including one waterfall. The only thing i didnt like is that our guide did not inform us where they will take a picture of you for souvenir...we ended up with a lousy picture so i just got one. If you do go with them make sure to remind your guide to inform you so you can get great pics. The step going back up is hard if your not fit. The buffet lunch included was good also. Drinks not included. Pictures at 8 usd for one big one. The lockers and shower area are also very clean.Now about my wallet. I found out i lost my wallet on the way back to the hotel. The driver they contracted willingly drove us all the way back to check if my wallet was still there. When i got to the locker i found out the walls between lockers can be removed. All it takes is just one strong push. I asked the staff of the company if they found any wallet and they said they did not. So i guess the mystery of my wallet will never be solved. SO IF YOU DO GO WITH THIS COMPANY MAKE SURE TO PUT YOUR WALLET IN THE WATER PROOF BAG THEY SUPPLY. Only put your spare clothes in the locker. Luckily all my cash and card i gave to my wife for safe keeping. Other than this incident i would say we had a fantastic time. Would i still go with this company? Yes i would. We felt really safe in their hands."

I have done similar group rafting in USA and Australia but this was probably the most enjoyable. About 4-6 pax raft. Very well organised with time spent fitting everyone with the right gear and instruction on basic rafting. Guide was happy and friendly and really wanted everyone to enjoy themselves. The walk down the stairs is a long long way down and should not be attempted by anyone with knee problems. The walk out at the conclusion of the rafting is not as arduous but still a bit of a climb. You can take a camera as the guide has a waterproof bag on board the raft. The scenery is great and the rapids provide for plenty of fun. Bali Adventures start further up the river than the other rafting companies and seemed to be very professional. When you finish your trip and you have climbed the stairs turn LEFT on the road and walk 100m to the Bali Adventure centre. The only thing they forgot to tell us!The Centre provides you with a locker to put your clothes in before the journey and towels and showers after the rafting. Make sure you have a change of clothes The buffet lunch in their restaurant was very nice no shortage of food or drink (incl. in total cost). The restaurant which is situated on the third floor of their building with pleasant views.I recommend sandles not thongs/flip flops and expect to get very wet.

This was the only 'excursion' we booked ourselves on during our week long stay in Seminyak, and we were so glad we did it! The brochure's 'What to Bring' section was very helpful in helping us pack for the day. Our driver, whose name I unfortunately missed, picked us up from our villa and was exceptionally gracious - as we've found with all the Balinese we've had the fortune to encounter, and he was knowledgeable too. Our first stop was to leave our belongings in lockers, before being transported through traditional Balinese landscape to the starting point, where we were fitted out with helmet, life jacket etc, all very reassuring. The scenery is stunning! You descend down the amazingly well crafted, complete with handrail, 600 steps through lush rainforest to the Ayung River. Our rafting guide, Wayan (apologies for incorrect spelling) was fantastic and there is terrific camaraderie, and splashing, amongst all the guides. Make sure you pose for the camera at one bend in the river, as you can buy a souvenir photo at the end. The 2 hour, 9 km journey passes so quickly and before you know it, you are making the trek back up the 400 steps to the top. Inspirational, and therefore deserve a special mention, are the 'Porters' who carry all the rafting gear, paddles etc up the same 400 steps...on their heads! After a very welcome hot shower, towels & shampoo/conditioner provided, we were shown to the restaurant for a very unexpected (as we didn't realise it was included in the package: food was, drinks weren't), yet welcome 'late lunch' (5:00pm). Our wonderful driver then took us to The Elephant Safari Park, where we hand fed 2 of the beautiful rescue elephants. This was probably my highlight. We also got to: coo over the nearly 4 month old Faja and stroke 'it', under the watchful eye of it's mother; appreciate the special relationship between each of the elephants and their individual personal trainer (mahout) and gently lumbered around the dimly lit forest track on the back of Barti. It was an amazing experience, the elephants are obviously very well cared for and content and all the staff should be commended for what they are doing to a) rescue these beautiful animals and b) raise awareness about their plight. We finished the evening with a lovely buffet dinner before being driven back to our villa by our lovely driver, who never once made us feel hurried or that we were putting him out, even though he probably wouldn't have gotten home himself until after 11:30pm. When we indicated our appreciation, he simply said \"It's my job!\" You wouldn't get that level of service or professional work ethic in Perth! In conclusion, a fantastically memorable and good value package which my husband and I would certainly recommend. Thank you to all the Bali Adventure Tours staff, who made it such an incredible experience."

So this was a must when booking this trip for my partner and I. We had a fabulous guide who was very friendly, and animated....the scenery travelling down the river was breathtaking, waterfalls, vines, lush greenery, it was something from a movie. Was one of the most beautiful and fun experiences I've had in my life and I want to do it again everyday!!!!!"

The guide was sooo funny, the scenery breathtaking. great showers for afterwards and a clean restaurant with great food choices too. We combined this with the Elephant ride, show and dinner at twilight but the whit water rafting was the highlight for us. The elephant ride was great and it was good to see that their keepers really did care about the elephants. The grounds were clean and the dinner was fantastic - mini desserts were delicious! A five star tour - well worth the money."

They use high quality equipment and good safety standard, that most of the other rafting providers doesnt have it. The loooong way down to get to the river was safe and clean. The guides also professional and friendly. The lunch we had was a buffet and also nice. We booked rafting and elephant ride package, so after rafting we went straight to elephant park, enjoy elephant riding and relax the tension. If you want to do rafting with safety and fun, this is the right provider.Dont forget to bring your camera because they have waterproof bag in the boat and you can take a picture at the waterfall in the middle of the route. The guide will me more than happy to help you taking pictures everywhere you want"

They picked us up directly from our hotel room and take you to their main facility where you get ready and also where you will have lunch. The entire day was great from the 2 hour rafting to the 30 minute elephant ride \u2013 I would highly recommend this package. Rafting is fun and really easy for all ages \u2013 the only thing to keep in mind is that you have to climb some steep stairs up/down to get to the rafting and back up again (there is no other way) \u2013 some people were not aware of this and had extreme trouble with the stairs. Also you get very wet so dress appropriately and be careful what you take with you (they give you a water-proof bag but don\u2019t risk it!).Elephant ride was equally as great \u2013 I initially wanted a longer ride but honestly you don\u2019t need it. ~30min is the perfect time on the elephant and you also get to watch a show and take pictures with the elephant.Depending on what you\u2019re looking to do in Bali, I would recommend this."

Also there are little ladies who actually sell drinks & coconuts on the river!!!

The rafting experience itself was awesome! The views you get while on the river were amazing! I would definitely recommend this tour. The only warning would be that you would have to climb down a very very very long flight of stairs to get into the raft on the river and that was easy but climbing all the way up those flight of stairs after the rafting was done was exhausting! especially if you haven't worked out a day in your life like myself:) I also recommend doing the elephant safari tour that Bali Adventure offers as a package tour with this Rafting. That was a once in a lifetime amazing experience as well!"

You get a waterproof small bag to put in your camera/wallets and change of clothing. Other items can be left in your transport which will be waiting for you at the end of the Rafting. You get kitted out with life jackets, helmets and then have to walk down some 600 steps to get down to the river. It was a 2 hour rafting ride and the scenery is spectacular with a lovely refreshing waterfall about half way through. The rafting was great fun and only a Level 2 so suitable for family. At the end of the rafting you have to climb back up from the river, some more stairs and quite a workout. We had a light late lunch and then were transported to the Elephant Safari where we got to pet a 2 month old baby elephant and feed the elephants. We then watched the show where the elephants did tricks and then went for the safari ride on the elephants which was followed by a lovely buffet dinner. This package was worth every penny and we had a wonderful day."

All reassuring when you feel like there might be times when your life is in the hands of your guide. Truth is, this rafting trip is not the most challenging but is great for families with kids or those who are inexperienced with rapids. It is a long 2 hour drive from the beachside tourist spots so consider doing a package. As a family, we combined cycling, elephant safari and river rafting all into the one day. It was a long day and we slept well that night but what great fun we all had."

I can honestly say this is 1 of the best organised trips I have been on, at first I was abit apprehensive and wasn't particularly bothered about doing it, but my fianc\u00e9 wanted to do It so I went along with it. The bike ride at the beginning takes about 2 hours only because the guide stops and shows you different things along the way! Don't be put off by going up hill at first like I was the rest of the ride is mainly down hill - watch out for the pot holes along the way!! We cycled to the elephant park which was perfect you get to see the elephants, they do a little show and then you go on to an elephant ride if that is what you have paid for, the lunch which is provided is brilliant as far as buffet lunches go probably the best I've had on an organised trip, drinks are not included! After this we went to the white water rafting which I was NOT Looking forward to in the slightest but it was really well organised and really good laugh, the guides are brilliant and make it a really fun experience if you want to tip up the guide asks you but I didn't want to sometimes people do fall out but the guide helps you so don't worry! I would 100% recommend this to anybody definatley worth your money! I'm not one for normally writing reviews but I felt this deserved it! X"

            "review": "Dangerous and tour operator not prepared for accidents. Our boat Capsized within the 1st 10 minutes of the white water rafting ride, around 10:50am of March 7, 2013. As we were rowing with the river current, the guide failed to steer us to the right passage causing the raft to get stuck between two large rocks and the boat to capsize. Another rider and myself went overboard and was swept away by the strong river current. I hit a large rock directly on my left thigh and legs. The other rider sustained bruises and injuries. The rest of the riders struggled to remain on the boat amidst the rampaging waters.The other rider and I were swept downstream for about 10 meters until we were able to swim to the river bank. When things have calmed down, I noted that the 3 remaining riders were now standing on top of one of the rocks where the boat got stuck (my wife would later recount to me how she was shivering in fear at that time) while the other rider and I were catching our breaths on the river bank. I then realized that I had a throbbing pain on my left thigh. The 3 riders were eventually rescued by another boat and taken to where we were waiting.Realizing the trauma my wife just went through and the pain I was starting to experience, I had asked the tour operator to end my tour and get me and my wife back safely to the vehicle. They said that there was no way for me to get back to the vehicle except to finish the rest of the 2-hour boat ride. The guides assured us that the rest of the ride was \u201ceasy\u201d. It was not. I had to go through the rest of the 2 hours in agony. There were 2 or 3 times when I asked the guides to let me off at the next stop \u2013 they said YES but did not do it.At the end of the ride, I thought my ordeal was over. I tried to get out of the boat but realized that my thigh muscles have contracted and I found it painful and difficult to walk or apply weight on my left thigh, and then to discover that there was a 600-step stairs flight up the hill that I had to go through to get to where the vehicles were waiting. It took me about another hour to get to the top at the rate I was climbing.The accident resulted in a fracture on my left femur. I have discovered new cuts, bruises and swelling on both legs that I have not noticed on the first few days.There are things to be noted about this tour:1. There was a 600-step walk down the mountain to get to the boats.2. There was a similar walk up the mountain from the boats to get to the vehicle.3. The tour did not have any emergency medical personnel nor any evacuation procedure in place on the river portion of the tour nor on the 600-step climb up or down.4. The river was deeper and the water current was stronger because of the continued heavy rains brought about by the monsoon. It was in fact, raining hard on the morning of March 7. The tour operator should have considered canceling the tour because of this.5. Their website claims: \u201cWhether you are 5 or 65, a natural or a novice, our white water rafting in Bali ride is safe, fun and a breathtaking experience to be enjoyed by the whole family. \u201c After what I have seen, I would not recommend this to a child, elderly or a novice rider/swimmer. If it was my wife (a novice swimmer) who was swept away by the strong current, she would not have had the presence of mind to fight the current and swim towards the river bank. She would end up going through another \u201crapids\u201d 10 meters from were I stopped.Here is a video clip of the accident: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTkUjI4VzGI"

That was not a problem nor it caused any safety hazards, since the Ayung does not have any complicated rapids (I've done rafting a few times before), and is more about the setting than about the thrill. But still, having an instructor that only could say 'go go go' or 'stop stop' was not very welcoming, since this alongside with Sobek are the two priciest rafting companies in Ubud, so I was expecting better instructors.The buffet lunch was ok (though drinks not included and pricy for Bali standards), but the facilities in there were a bit weird. The mens showers were kind of inside of the female changing rooms!?!So yes, a good experience, but not worthy of being the priciest rafting from Ubud. Shop around and you'll find similar stuff for less."

It sounds strange that my complaint is that everything was too well arranged, but it really felt impersonal because of it. Yes there are good stairs to and from the river and there are showers at the end of the tour, but when you are dropped of at the starting location it feels a bit like a factory line. This impersonal approach is so unlike elsewhere in Bali. Don't get me wrong, the rafting was great and the gear was safe and the staff worked hard, but I think that all the provisions didn't really add to the experience."

It had also rained heavily the night before so we were concerned about the rapids and water level. We were picked up promptly from our hotel and taken to the raft centre where we were kitted out with equipment. There was quite a large group (30 or so) and the raft is one guide to every four people. However we were put at ease straight away with our guide (Katut was great!) who made us feel comfortable and safe with his experience and his sense of humour. It's not a rough ride and quite easy to get through even for beginners - though the guide does most of the steering and maneuvering and we just give him a bit of power. The whole thing lasted for about 1.5 hours and we were disappointed when it ended. We wanted more!Amazing scenery and views down from the river. There are several stop points (one by a waterfall and one by some rock carvings) so bring a waterproof camera if you can to get some pictures. Your valuables are placed in a waterproof bag and taken with you on the raft while the rest of your gear is transported to the destination. There are a number of steps to get down to the valley and also to walk back up at the end so bring a pair of thongs to make it easier on your feet.Bali Adventure Tours is highly recommended. It seemed they had the longest track (we saw several other rafting company start points along the way). Definitely the most popular too. All the guides looked like they were having fun and everyone was enjoying themselves. Meals and showers are provided at the end so bring a change of clothes. The buffet was great and had plenty of variety. You have the option of purchasing photos from the trip. We got some awesome action shots printed for 35,000 each. Can't thank you enough for an incredible experience! Looking forward to coming back and doing it all over again."

When we got into the boat the the only thing our raft guide wanted to discuss was how good his tips had been over the last couple of days, this conversation was bought up throughout the trip and it was a shame as it left us feeling a little uncomfortable and if anything less likely to tip at the end.Apart from these small details we loved it!"

Our rafting guide was very professional, knowledgeable, and friendly. After a fun filled 2 hours of fun, we ended up at the retaurant, where they served a delicious gourmet lunch buffet to satisfy our hunger. I recommend rafting and other activities with this company when you go to Bali and I guarantee you will have an amazing time!"

The problem with adventure is their pricing is very high compeer to other company who do the same service and a longer distant , at Bali adventure rafting , and they charge US 79 for adults and around US 50 for the kids, the other day we used other company who charge us US 50 for adults and around US 30, as for the food , both are ok food"

Equipment was new and lifejackets were better than we've seen on many US rafting tours. Cleaner, too.It is a long drop from their facility down to the river, so be sure you can handle the stairs, and I'm talking like 600+ stairs. They've built new stairs and provided a strong hand rail, so its surely the best operation on Bali.River is mostly class 2 and 3 rapids, but its worth the effort to make the trip. Lots of fun and our guide was great."

As we passed other companies we could see their boats were of less quality and their steps down seemed quite dangerous. Whereas with Bali adventure tours, the steps down had hand rails and seemed to meet international safety standards...also their run on the river seems longer. Our guide kept us smiling and joking throughout. However, when it came down to tipping, apparently our tip was not what he expected and the smile went away... They should either give tipping hints on their website beforehand or just pay their employees better so as to avoid this awkward issue. Also, while they have a lovely building at the beginning, the end shower/changing area is a huge disappointment. Its a common shower and the rooms offer no privacy for changing. The lunch is mediocre and considering they are 40 USD more than other companies, you'd think they would throw in a bottle of water free! While we enjoyed ourselves, I wouldn't go again--the river is quite calm with very little adrenalin rush. But for first timers with kids they are good and safety wise, they were excellent."

There are just enough rapids and rocks for excitement, with most exertion needed for the stair climbing to the and from the river. Most of the time, you can relax and enjoy the waterfalls, lush greenery and imagine what Bali was like before mass tourism arrived. While there are several outfits that offer rafting in Ubud, Bali Adventure's quality gear, organization and stunning staircases make them the top choice for me. Showers, towels and buffet lunch (nice view of rice paddies) are also included."

My only negative was that it wasn't very hard at all, the people in the boat didn't need to do anything at all really, it was only the guide who was really doing anything, I guess it's the class of river and level of water, but having rafted before on class 3 rivers I was a little disappointed. On the plus side, it was great for first timers and families. The scenery was stunning and lunch was good. I would use Bali Adventure again as other companies' equipment that I saw on the river looked inferior and the facilities at the start and end were brand new."

While I had been rafting before this was my wife's first experience -- and it was a good one.Pros: Beautiful and relaxing setting (Ayung River), extremely funny guide that kept us laughing, we rafted longer than the people that went with the other companies as we passed their put-ins and put-outs, tame experience for first-time raftersCons: A lot of steps to/from river (but this probably the same as all the companies) and could do without the buffet lunch where the drinks were not included in the tour priceDepending on what you are expecting, the rapids themselves may be a disappointment. Our guide told us Class II+ but this seemed generous to me. Maybe after some big rains it would be more exciting.My suggestion is that they make a slightly cheaper version that skips the lunch and just takes you directly back to your hotel."

Not as many rapids as I would have liked but it was a great first experience for many of my friends. It takes about 2 hours. It is a longer journey than other tours which is why it's more expensive. There are A LOT of steep stairs to get down to the river. Our guides spoke okay English and were very friendly. As far as the elephants in taro: feeding was exciting but the elephant rides were in the dark. I enjoyed the mysterious darkness of the jungle but many of my friends were disappointed. The dinner was okay (soup and salads were amazing while the main courses were sitting in the pans heating too long). A nice day trip for a group."

I don't know why but I only just picked up a brochure of Bali Adventure Tours on my last Bali visit and decided to go rafting with them since they described themselves as \"the best\". Needless to say I was blown away by the difference. The facilities were immaculately clean and seamlessly Westernized, the staff from start to finish were all very nice and organized, the food provided was delicious and more than just small boxes of nasi campur (mixed rice) as we'd experienced with the previous companies, and the top section of the river they start at before all the other companies was actually the most beautiful and exciting part of the Ayung River. Without a doubt Bali Adventure Tours leaves the competition for dead and provides the best rafting experience you could expect in Bali."

The man who showed us around there was also friendly and did a great job in sharing with us about their products and what they do there. I was sleepy from the car ride but he managed to grab my attention to learn more about coffee and cocoa and spices they grew there. Our last stop with gede was for white water rafting. We reached there abit late and had missed the briefing. But even without the briefing, we had a blast. Telaga waja river was awesome. Thrilling rafting experience. After we were done, gede was patiently waiting for us at the top with our bags in hand to pass to us to wash up. Thank you for the enjoyable experience!"

We did this as part of our two week holiday and it was one of the highlights of our whole trip. We were staying in a remote Air BnB in Ubud, the guys found it really easily without any guidance from us (many taxi drivers had a problem previously so we were a little worried). We were picked up promptly at 2:30am and taken to the site to meet our two guides. The hike is hard work, but more than achievable for all fitness levels - just wear some proper shoes!We brought our own snacks and water but definitely didn't need too, they gave us loads of water at the start and end, plus a lot of food! They even cook the eggs in the steam of the volcano and you can watch them do this too. Definitely bring layers as its a sweaty walk up but gets very cold whilst waiting for the sun to rise and very hot again walking back down in the sunshine.On the walk down ask to go the Monkey route, they said they aren't always there but we were lucky and saw loads, they climb on you too! The hot springs after were a great addition to get clean from the dusty/sweaty walk. We were given more free snacks and drinks here too and plenty of time to enjoy it for as long as we wanted. Coffee plantation is a good end to wake you up and you can experience it in just 15 - 20 mins, if you're as tired as we were by this point. Everything is included and there are no hidden costs, we got so much for our money (approx. \u00a360 each) than we would have expected. All in all, an amazing and great value day out with loads of picture opportunities and different experiences."

We were picked up promptly at 2.30am by our driver and driven to meet our guide, Jerro, at the start point. The drive took 1 hour from our hotel in Ubud. We were given a small bottle of water each to take on the walk (in hindsight this is not enough - thankfully we had our own). Jerro was really friendly and helped us both out on the climb. His English is very good and his cheerful personality made us forget how exhausted we were! The climb up is hard work, but it only takes 1.5-2 hours. There are a few places set up with benches to watch sunrise at the top (there are a lot of people who climb each day). Jerro served us boiled egg, egg sandwiches, banana sandwiches, passion fruit, chocolate bar and a large tea while we marvelled at the incredible view opening out beneath us. We walked around the crater after sunrise and watched the monkeys play (very friendly ones!) and saw the cave and the steam rising from the rocks. The descent was comparatively easy but slippy (good trainers should be a minimum), the driver gave us a walking pole each which was really useful. The temperature was quite cool and the recommendation was to wear long trousers, I decided to wear shorts and was very grateful as it does get warm once the sun rises (but it is quite cool when you're sat at the top after the hard walk). We stopped at the coffee plantation on the drive back which was very interesting but we could barely stay awake.The trip was well worth it and we felt we had the best guide of the day. Our recommendation is you take more water and take something to wash your hands and face after - the black dust gets everywhere!"

The tour comprised of 3 activities: 1. Trekking up Mt. Batur for Sunrise2. Visiting the Natural Hot Spring3. Visiting the Balinese Coffee plantation(The tour was 160 USD for us both).We were picked up from our hotel at 2.30am by our private driver; he was very knowledgeable about the tour and also Bali in general. On route to the volcano he stopped off at a local shop and brought us some very tasty fried banana snacks (free of charge). When we reached the volcano, we were greeted by our super friendly private tour guide who set off with us up the volcano at around 3.30am. The journey is not for the faint hearted, it\u2019s steep pretty much the whole way and over 1,700m to the peak. It took us around 1 hour and 20 minutes to reach the peak view point and its pretty cold up there! Once we reached the top the tour guide prepared us a breakfast consisting of banana sandwiches, egg sandwiches, fruit, chocolate bars, tea, coffee etc. The sunrise came at around 6.30am and it\u2019s a great spectacle that around 500 people trek up to see every morning. The tour guide took plenty of photos of us and cooked us some eggs and bananas the \u2018natural\u2019 way in the active volcano. There is also a large colony of monkeys up there that love a banana sandwich and to sit on your shoulders whilst they eat them! Personally we found descending the volcano much harder than climbing up it; it\u2019s very steep at the top and slippery. The tour guide was brilliant at getting us down safely, if it wasn\u2019t for him we would probably still be up there! Make sure you pack sensible shoes for this trip!After the volcano our tour guide drove us to the Hot Spring, this is a good way to relax and take a bath after sweating getting up the volcano! The scenery is pretty decent around the Spring too. The final stop was at the Coffee Plantation, we were given a tour of the different plants and given samples of 12 different Balinese coffee\u2019s to try. We then tried the \u2018special coffee\u2019 that is eaten by Civet\u2019s, this came at an extra cost of 50,000 IDR per cup. Please be aware that at the plantation you do see Civet\u2019s kept in small pens. The plantation was OK, but we felt it made the trip slightly long and was unnecessary. Overall we loved the trip and would definitely recommend! For us the tour guide who took us up the volcano made the trip."

We had asked to skip the coffee plantation trip at the end, but the driver had not been told this, but it was not a problem. Our driver, Boby, was very good and we felt safe the whole drive in the dark. We arrived at the foot of the mountain and start of the trek at 03.30. It was a lot of fog and really windy, we were really happy we had brought quite a lot of clothes - long pants, technical t-shirt and long sleeved, and a jacket. I had also brought a buff to wear as headband (it was needed close to the top). The hike is quite tough and you have to be somewhat fit, we used 1,5 hours to walk to the top, our guide Ketut Batur was excellent. It was freezing and very windy up there. We were some of the first ones up there, so we were able to choose one of the \"huts\" to sit while we waited for the 06.30 sunrise. Ketut also took some nice photos of us. My boyfriend got really sweaty on the way up, so he was freezing at the top and Ketut lend him his jacket (really nice). We had a nice breakfast at the top, the tea was really good and warming!! The walk down was fast, and we did not spent a lot of time at the top after the sunset. We were back at our hotel around 10.00. I would recommend to bring water, toilet paper (there are no toilets on the way up or at the top) and warm clothing in a backpack. Choose a company that does private tours, so you can decide what pace you want to go, not the group. I really recommend this trip and company- very professional!"

One of our friends had also injured his knee before coming away and was having trouble with it on the way down, the guides could not have been more helpful in ensuring that he was safe and comfortable. They were also extremely friendly and funny throughout the whole day.The taxi drivers were also great, they picked us up from our villa in Seminyak and dropped us off in our next villa in Uluwatu, they also dropped us off for dinner at our request on the way back and waited around to take us back to our villa.I would suggest carrying as little as possible and taking a jacket as when you reach the top it is quite cold (but you're greeted with a hot chocolate).I cannot fault this company or the guides who took us up the mountain."

We booked a the Mount Batur trek, along with the hot spring and Kopi Luwak tour.This was on our honeymoon, so we were really looking forward to this trip.We were picked up 02:30 am by the driver at our hotel in Ubud.It was raining cats and dogs down in Ubud and some streets almost were flooded, but fortunately the sky was clear as we arrived in the \"highlands\" and we could see the beautiful stars. The driver was a friendly guy who drove safely and spoke english very well. On the way back from the trek we talked a lot about Bali (on the way to the mountain we were a little bit too sleepy!) and had a really nice chat.Our guide was fantastic.We started early, he was a really patience guy and we weren't in a hurry at all. Could have walked even slower.On our way up we were talking a lot about the volcanos on Bali, the temples (he even stopped to make an offering), his family, our family, etc... it was really nice.As we arrived on the top he found a very nice spot (seemed like the best spot on the whole volcano actually) and we had it all to ourselves. We were able to just sit there and look at the beautiful night sky (have never seen so many stars at once) and wait for the sunrise. Fantastic.He served us hot tea and coffee (which was included) and a perfectly nice breakfast (which was much better than what the other tourists got served from their guiding companies).As the sun finally started to rise the view was spectacular. Can't really describe it, but I have added some photos of it. Take a look!The trek back down was no problem at all and as we arrived back down the driver was waiting for us.First he took us to the hotsprings, which weren't really memorable compared to the trek and the coffee plantation. The hot water was however relaxing and quite needed for the tired muscles after the hike. Also, the view over the lake was good.After the hotsprings he drove us to the coffee plantation where we were served eight coffee samples and six tea samples for free and a nice tour with explanations of the coffee making process (also how they make Kopi Luwak).Of course we had to try Kopi Luwak (both beans), which was really something. Probably the best coffee I've ever had (also affected by the hype and also the beautiful surroundings - hehe).This was one of the most memorable trips of my life and I if you are planning a trip to Mount Batur (or somewhere else) I really hope you book with Bali Trekking Tour."

Our drivers were safe and prompt, and our trekking guide, King, was kind, knowledgeable, and funny. We did the Batur Caldera hike, which was a little shorter than I was anticipating. I would have been up for a longer/ more challenging hike, but the views from the top were still gorgeous. We LOVED the natural hot springs after the hike (a serious highlight) and the coffee plantation visit afterwards."

Batur hike, where we met up with SAJA who was such a pleasantly warm soul. He was so friendly and easy going but definitely knowledgeable in terms of the trail, as well as on Bali/Indonesian culture, as he taught us a thing or two while hiking.On our way to rafting, we stopped at a coffee planation, which was such a fabulous idea; not only were we exhausted from our late evening the night before, our early wake-up and then our sunrise hike, but the coffee, teas and chocolates were so, very delectable!!! ALEX was very friendly and knowledgable as he gave us a tour of the planation while providing us with cool coffee fun facts :)When we were ready to raft, ARHA briefed us on raft safety before helping us climb in. We truly enjoyed our beautifully, scenic excursion down the river. ARHA was so very friendly, keeping us laughing throughout our adventure!!"

He made the early start and car trip so fun. We met up with our Guide (Eddy) at the bottom of the mountain. My friend & I decided on do the Caldera trek as we are not strong hikers (we do go to the gym so it wasn't too bad). The hike took us about an hour with a couple of breaks in between. Eddy was very patient and did not rush us to the top. He was very knowledgeable with information on the surrounding mountains. He also encouraged us to take as many photos as we liked and even took the photos for us! We then visited the swings which they built by the lake (awesome photo opportunities) and did a boat ride across the lake. The whole mountain trek was breathtaking and definitelly worth the early start. From the Calderra, you can see the ocean, about 4 volnic mountains & the lake. It will be hard to beat another sunrise experience like this! We visited the Santi coffee plantation after where we got to try various teas & coffee (including luwak coffee). Afterwards we headed to the white water rafting which was awesome fun. It was not difficult and the jungle/river was gorgeous! Lunch was provided after rafting. It sounds like a long day and tiring day but our driver kept us entertained. Thanks for this life memory, will definitely be back :)"

At first we thought it might be too much, but actually it was awesome! A driver came to pick us up at the hotel in Ubud at 2.30 am, very punctual, and he drop us off in Mount Batur, There, a mountain guide was waiting for us and gave a light and a stick to go up the mountain. For the trek you must be reasonably fit, but the guide helped us a lot, he had some chocolates and fruit for the stops during the trek and took care of us at all moments. At the summit, the views are incredible, suddenly, the sun rises and the clouds disappear, and it is amazing! Also, the guide offered us some breakfast (banana sandwich, fruit, boiled eggs and coffee), and then we went down. The driver was waiting for us and we went to the coffee plantation.The coffee plantation was not anything special but we could taste the Luwak coffee (the most expensive coffee in the world).Finally, we went to the White Water Rafting, it was a fantastic experience. The rapids are not very strong, but the views are truly worth it. Nature in the most pure state, waterfalls falling to the river... Awesome! After, we were also offered lunch near the river, some rice, beef,... Buffet style.Finally we arrived to the hotel, very tired, but with the satisfaction of having spent one of the best days in Bali!"

            "review": "An amazing experience. I was in Bali for my 40th Birthday so decided that I would do this trek on the morning of my birthday and see the sun rise. I emailed and booked this about 2 months in advance and confirmed with Bali Trekking Tours a few days before our trek.Our driver picked us up from Sanur at 2am prompt and it took just about 1.5 hours to get to the base of the volcano. The car park already had a few cars in it but we quickly met our guide, Madeh (please excuse the spelling as this may not be how it is spelt) who gave us our walking sticks, our head lamps and 2 bottles of water and set off straight away. The climb was tough and we quickly realised we needed to take off some of our layers that we had put on. Madeh made sure we had plenty of breaks and even though we are both quite active and fit we were glad of the breaks.....we were in no rush to get to the top of the mountain first and were quite happy to sit and rest and chat to Madeh. I have to say at this point how amazing Madeh was.....he practically held my hand all the ways up the mountain....at first, being an independent person I didn't think it was necessary.....after a while I realised how wrong I was......I griped on and we trekked up together. This was the case on the way down too which was even more challenging that climbing the volcano.When we got to the the top we noticed how cold it was and where we had been sweating on the way up our t shirts were a bit damp so that made us even colder, however we did have a delicious mug of tea and banana sandwiches, egg sandwiches, fruit and a packet of chocolate biscuits.....in fact my husband were so busy tucking into our food we forgot where we were for a while. Medah took lots of photos of us and he really couldn't do enough for us......I am so glad we decided to use Bali Trekking Tours and would recommend them without a shadow of a doubt."

Very punctual, we were picked up at 2am and reached the bottom of Mount Batur at about 3:30am. We thought that we will be grouped with other travellers but we had 1 guide to us even though it was just me and my friend. A plus point for that because we could trek at our own pace. Very personalised and both drivers and guide speak good english so communication was never a problem with them.The whole trek was great as the guide took care of us really well. He helped us on steeper routes, had a range of food for breakfast and takes great photos for us. He even offered to carry our backpack!After the trek, we went to the coffee plantation which was included in the tour. Prices were better compared to other plantations we been to. The driver was really friendly and enthusiastic to show us Bali. He even explained to us things we see along the way. Very very good experience with the driver. His name is Nyoman Adik, totally recommend him to everyone.All in all, we had a wonderful trek with Bali Trekking Tour and it is our first ever trek up a mountain. We trekked on 18th July and took us 2 hours to get up there. Weather was not too bad. Do keep in mind that weather and nature is unpredictable, so you need to keep in mind that trekking carries on rain or shine. All equipments including walking sticks, torches and even mineral water was provided. You have nothing to worry about booking your trip with them! Absolutely recommend this to everyone!"

He was a great guide, coach and cheerleader and got us to the top of the mountain in plenty of time for sunrise- we were the third group of people to arrive! He set us up in prime position and then prepared our breakfast and coffee while we relaxed and watched the sky change as the clouds and mist rolled by and the sun came up. Pretty spectacular. Our driver (who's name I forget- we met him at our hotel at 2:30am!) was also great. We mentioned we had already visited a coffee plantation (included in the tour) and didn't want to visit again, so he took us to Tegalalang Rice Terraces on the way back to our hotel instead.

My girlfriend was very ill on the journey to the mountain and the driver did everything to ensure that she was ok and not in discomfort. Once we got to the start of our climb, we were provided with hiking sticks and flash lights (god send). Our guide made this tour very personal to us, whilst ensuring that our safety and wellbeing was at the forefront (he even offered to carry our water and backpacks whilst carrying his own!). Our tour guide taught us so much, not just about the mountain and Bali, but about the cultural differences between Bali and the UK. Our conversations could have lasted hours. Our guide climbs this mountain every morning and then goes to a second job in the afternoon, he does this everyday and only has two days off a month. This was never evident through his attitude/energy. Our guide was inspiring to my girlfriend and I and made us appreciate how fortunate we are. The sunrise itself was breathtaking, pictures do not do it any justice. It was a very surreal experience when the sun came up. The natural spring was amazing. We would defiantly recommend doing this whilst in Bali."

I called my guide the mountain goat lol he could honestly tiptoe along the edge of the cliffs without even breaking a sweat and he was such a lovely man! We got the nicest breaky from our guide when we got to the top, our eggs where even cooked in the steam from the volcanic heat! Unfortunately we had fog/clouds that morning so we didn't get to see a proper sunrise, but because the fog was there we did not realise how far we were up and how beautiful the scenery really was until the clouds drifted away! It was such a lovely surprise!! After our descend we were driven to the natural hot springs which was soooo good on our muscles as it was quite a trek and the scenic views were so picturesque I'm still in love with them! We then were driven back to our hotel by the awesome driver who waited for us all day by the way! I would totally do this again and I recommend it to everyone, even those afraid of heights!

My daughter was right- it wasn't easy, but Sar made sure I took breaks and kept my breath under control. We laughed , climbed, took photos, and joked with others on the trek! He encourage me to keep going when I needed it and made sure my feet landed in all the right places. At the summit, he made coffee and cooked breakfast while the sun came up! During all of this he took pictures of the entire journey! It was beautiful and truly one of the best experiences of my life! Once time to go down, I was nervous- it was steep! There was no need to fear, Sar was there! I came down with ease and had the best time! The decent for me was easy and fun! The monkeys made us laugh, the holy cave was inspiring, and the steam was warm and inviting.

At 2.30am we were picked up at our hotel in Ubud and we drove for an hour to the foot of the mountain. The driver was experienced and spoke well English, good start of the tour. Ketut was our guide to the top of the mountain. he introduced himself, handed us a walking stick and a flashlight and off we went. we were so naive to think we can walk this without research of what this trekking tour even is about. boy, were we surprised! there we were in our Nike's not fit at all for a hike to the top of the mountain. please note, our advice is to use boots for this hike. it is very steep and very challenging for the unexperienced like us. Ketut did a marvelous job in guiding us to the top, ensuring the pace was not too fast and frequent 5 minute stops were used. after 2.5 hours we reached the top, so proud of ourselves! and there we just sat and wait for the sun to rise, and what a breathtaking view it was. after a few hundred pictures, a nice breakfast and some well deserved hot tea, we had to hike back down, which was even more challenging than going up! we reached the foot again and we were exhausted but excited as well. us unexperienced naive girls did this! and so can you.again, prepare yourself for a challenging hike if you are not experienced and use the correct shoes.we can definitely recommend Bali Trekking tour. the driver was nice and patience (he waited at the foot to bring us back to the hotel), the guide was wonderful (1 guide for the 4 of us, instead of guiding a big group, so personal attention!) and the result is so worth it. enjoy your hike!"

It's the most incredible achievement and experience trekking up the active volcano and the guides are extremely helpful. They cook you breakfast off the steam and celebrate once you've reached the top. It's quite cold at the top so it's a good idea to layer up. When the sunrises the view is absolutely incredible and like nothing we've ever seen before. Would definitely recommend doing this when visiting Bali! We went to the hot springs after climbing back down the volcano and it was a perfect finish to the experience. There are a few different hot pools looking over a beautiful lake - definitely worth doing."

I left my credit card at home so they allowed us to pay cash on collection. They collected me and my son at the agreed time in a comfortable car with plenty of space and good air con. It took 2 hours to get to get to base which we slept all the way. On arrival we met our guide and was given walking poles, head flash lights and water. Our guide was fantastic holding my sons hand all the way to help him up and mine too when i wasn't sure what footing to take. We had a private guide just for me and my son which was great as he could help us I saw bigger groups struggle with one guide to 11 people they couldn't quite help with everyone's footing which is why Bali trekking is so good. We got to the top in 2 hours and took our seats. The colors of the sunrise were beautiful and well worth the trip. We had our breakfast of fruit, choc bars and biscuits and took lots of photos to share with back home. We then had our egg and banana volcano steamed sandwiches which were awesome. On the way down we took the lava slide route which was rather scary at times but we made it. This is worth every penny and we were so glad we did it. My advice to anyone going unless your baby is in a back carrier don't take very young children, it was very slippery at times and I needed 2 hands to steady myself so I would of been too scared of little Ones falling if you have more than 1 child going up. This said I did see a very young children group doing it and seemed fine. Other advice would be to take a wind breaker for the top. I wore trainer, shorts and t-shirt and had a thick hoody for our July trek which was fine - would of been too hot in jeans. However, at the top I could of done with a something thicker as it is very cold especially after a good work out getting to the top. Final advice.Ensure you take money to tip the guide as we had an amazing one and we couldn't of done it without him. An awesome awesome experience you must do it"

This tour is private so although there are lots of other people doing the trek being able to go at your own pace and not wait around for your group is a bonus. Our guide was knowledgeable and our driver was more than willing to take us to see different sights after the trip but we were too tired.We arranged to go the hot springs after which was nice but not a patch on the volcano trek. We are fit 30s and found it challenging in parts but saw some people struggling. But also some people took their babies along with them so it's definitely doable if you're relatively active. You must do this if you get a chance. "

I noticed a lot of the other trekkers on the mountain weren't provided these by their own chosen tour companies.-Breakfast was provided including fresh fruit, chocolate bars, tim tams, egg sandwiches, banana sandwiches, and water.-The trek wasn't easy, some of the terrain was loose dirt so easy to slip on, but it was so worth it!Wear good walking/running shoes with good grip. Take a warm jumper and long pants as it gets very cold waiting for sunrise at the top. Bring some money as they sell warm drinks up top. Bring some sunscreen for the descent when the sun is shining bright.Our guide Gunawan was amazing! I was scared of slipping so he often assisted me with a hand on the tricky steep parts. He was very friendly and such a happy man. He was very excited for taking pictures once the sun had risen and took us to all of the best spots for photos. He provided us with interesting information about the volcano and the adjacent volcano and mountains, and had some interesting facts to share. Gunawan was the best guide!! He played an important role in making our trekking experience enjoyable."

Bobi picked us up (from two very hard to find places), supplied water and snacks, and then more water and snacks at the end of the hikes. Both guides were great. We had Kaki for Mt. Agung and Sari (spelling?) for Batur. Kaki especially was so helpful since the climb was so tough (we climbed via Besakih temple). He kept us informed of our pace, knew all the right places to stop, and even stopped my friend from tumbling down a steep part of the mountain! Mt. Agung was one of the hardest physical things I have ever done, but the view and experience was so, so worth it. I would not recommend the Agung trek from Besakih if you aren't at least in decent shape though! Thank you for such a wonderful experience!!"

The communication with Bali Trekking Tour before our trip was perfect - they let us know everything we needed and answered very quick to our questions. We were picked up by two lovely guys in Ubud who brought us to the starting point of our tour. There we met our guide Kaki and got equipped with plenty of water, a box full of food (such as juice, fruits, cookies etc), a walking stick, a poncho and a headlight. At 11.30 pm we started our way up to the summit. Kaki always took care of us and helped us pass difficult sections. We made a short break every hour to get something to drink and eat but we could also make a short stop whenever we wanted to. After a few hours Kaki made coffee and tea for us :-) We reached the summit just in time to see the beautiful sunrise. We spent some time there, drinking another coffee/tea, had breakfast and then went back down. Kaki took special care of me on our way back down because it really was hard and sometimes very slippy but he is always there for you to give you a hand. When we reached the start again the two guys with the car waited there for us, served us chilled drinks and fruit and then safely got us back to our homestay.The tour to Mount Agung is really special and you won't see many people hiking it (we were 5 people at the summit, 2 of them were guides). It is a really hard walk up to the summit and you should be fit and in a very good condition! You should also have hiked before and bring some experience with you! I would say hiking boots are an absolute must! Although a day after the tour we are really tired and have muscle soreness, we are happy that we made it! It is a great tour, the staff is friendly and helpful and our guide Kaki was the best we could have!Thanks for letting us experience this tour!"

We were picked up in Ubud at 2:30AM by a young, friendly driver who told us about the volcanos on the drive to the basecamp. When we met our tour guide, he provided us with walking sticks and flashlights (though we were glad to have brought our headlamps). It took us about 2 hours to climb the mountain, which was pretty steep, and we stopped to take breathers often. But Genoumon was very patient and encouraging and often helped us to get up the steeper parts by lending his hand and pulling us up. He didn't mind that we wanted to go at a nice, slow but steady pace, and reassured us that we had plenty of time before sunrise. At the top, it started pouring rain, and we were allowed to huddle in one of the tents up there (where the guides prepare breakfast) to keep dry, but we were still glad to have our raincoats. The sunrise was cloudy after the rain, but still breathtaking, and breakfast of coffee, chocolate, eggs, passion fruit, and bananas was delicious. On the hike down we got to check out the hot steam coming from the mountain, amazing views, monkeys who were much friendlier than the Ubud Monkey Forest monkeys, and two temples (one in a cave). The other hikers were also fun to meet, and there were hundreds of them.Our guide was very knowledgeable and loved photography so much that he insisted on taking tons of pictures of us from every angle at every conceivable opportunity. He was very attentive to us, and we had a blast with him. Overall, it was outstanding!"

Upon arrival at the base of the mount batur we were handed bottles of water, a head torch and a hiking stick. The hiking stick will be your saviour!!Mangku was our guide for the climb, He was so experienced and confident on the Volcano, as he climbs it daily! It was only myself, my partner and Mangku for the hike. He supported us on more challenging sections of the hike, but kept us at a good pace so we completed it within 1hr30mins. We were one of the first to arrive at the summit so we all sat inside the huts as it was freezing!! haha!! Mangku then took us down to the crater to show us how they use the volcano steam to cook! He cooked our breakfast in there, it really was amazing to see! Banana and boiled eggs!We had the most amazing experience at sunrise, such a bucket list moment and so breath taking! We set of back down the mountain and Mangku was telling us about the mountain, eruptions, the local town, the other volcano. He was so interesting to listen to!I really would recommend this to anyone considering it! COUPLE OF THINGS;-Make you have a spare jacket in your bag as its so cold at the summit before sunrise!-Ensure your shoes/trainers/boots have good grip as parts of the climb are particularly steep and loose gravel. (I did not, learn from me)-Dont underestimate it! Its a volcano not a walk in the park! Its a challenge to say the least! but an amazing experience.-And lastly have enough water with you, I pretty sure we ended up having about 6 small water bottles between two of us but it is a challenge and you will need every drop!"

Always the intention was to come North and visit the volcano's. I thought I could do this during the day as I was unimpressed with the early rise required to the Dawn climb. However the best advice received was that likely cloud cover by 9am meant there would be not much chance of a view once you climbed.So I bit the bullet and looked around and decided to engage Bali Trekking Tours for a Mount Batur Dawn climb based on their website and TripAdvisor reviews. Booked via their website, paid the full solo rebate in US dollars using a credit card via PayPal and received confirmatory emails throughout.So very glad I booked this service. So very, very glad. It was a memorable and unique experience that will be with me for the rest of my life.I am a 47 yo male who is not that fit, maybe 10 kilos overweight for my age and height. This is important because I read that the climb up Mt Batur was 'moderate'. Well it's not my definition of moderate, maybe some twenty-something's definition but not mine!!! :) I was met at my Nusa Dua hotel at 1.40 am by the driver, Ketut Ardana, who I was impressed with his road knowledge between Nusa Dua and Mt Batur. He seemed to know every bit of the road that might be uneven and drove appropriately. A small thing perhaps but worth noting nonetheless. Met at the base by the guide Putu, who provided me with a proper hiking stick. This guy was amazing. He never made me feel inadequate, was honest, encouraging and nothing appeared too much trouble for him - to keep the pace, to be at the summit in time for dawn, he would help me by hand holding me and pulling me up several of the sheer parts to the path. It took us a solid 2 hours of some of the most physically demanding effort I have recently done to get to the summit. It is steep uphill the entire path. For 2 hours. The provided hiking stick was not an affectation but an essential part of the hike.We had about 1 hour at the summit watching dawn come up over the clouds and light up the caldera and the surrounding area. This, with the sense of accomplishment of climbing up, is literally euphoric. It was a wonderful experience. Really stunning. I enjoyed the steam cooked egg but to be honest wasn't really there for the food. Then the descent via a slightly less demanding path. Again Putu earned not just his money but my respect with his ongoing patience and encouragement. Took another 2 hours to descend. It was also tough.Once finished there is a sense of accomplishment for someone of my age and background that will be hard to diminish. But I did not do it alone and I could not have done it without Putu. Request him if you can.There was an activity for after the climb but I passed on this and got Ketut to drive me back to the hotel as I was completely and utterly knackered.If this activity is something you are considering then Bali Trekking Tour are the people to use. I will not fault them."

We had to pay half the amount of the trip before we arrived, and paid the rest to the driver on the day. We were picked up on time from our hotel and were driven to the base of Mount Batur. Our driver was very friendly and supplied us with bottled water both on the journey and before we began our ascent. They also provided torches and walking poles for the climb. Without a doubt I would not have been able to do the climb without the walking pole so this was very valuable. When we arrived at the base of Batur, our driver introduced us to our guide who was going to accompany us on the climb. Our guide was very knowledgeable about the area and very friendly. He was very encouraging throughout the climb, and allowed us to stop whenever we wanted for a break. While we do some moderate exercise, this was the first time we had done anything of this nature so breaks were well needed. We reached the top while it was still dark and our guide got us a seat so we could watch the sunrise. While waiting he arranged breakfast for us which consisted of banana sandwiches, egg sandwiches and some eggs cooked using the steam of the volcano. This was delicious. Our guide also took plenty photos of us to document the occasion. After sunrise, our guide led us back down the mountain where the driver was waiting on us. Our driver then took us to nearby hot springs which was a great way to relax after a strenuous climb. He then returned us to our hotel. I would 100% recommend this company for the Mount Batur trek, they are organised, efficient and responded to our emails quickly. The driver and the guide were both a credit to the tour operator."

We were picked up by the driver at 3:30am in Ubud and began the approximately 1 hour hike just before 5am. We arrived to the sunrise point in plenty of time to watch the sunrise from the very beginning. There were beautiful views with the ocean and sunrise in one direction and Mt. Batur and Lake Batur in the other direction. Then we hiked down to the lake and had a boat ride across the lake to the hot spring. The hot spring was beautiful and so relaxing after the hike. We really enjoyed our tour and were so glad we did it. Both our driver and guide were both very friendly and informative."

            "review": "Mount Batur sunrise trek - great views with helpful tour guide. We were lucky and had a glorious day for our trek to the top of Mount Batur. Our local guide was very helpful and does this regularly in about an hour if he was his own! It took us about two and a half hours in the early morning - we were still slightly jet lagged and the climb requires a moderate level of stamina and balance. As we had a private tour for just the two of us, he was able to help me quite a lot but my husband was fine with the aid of the walking stick that the company provides. We saw a number of larger groups and I think I would have got left behind in a larger group. The sunrise is great and you get a cooked breakfast of eggs boiled in the hot spring at the top and banana sandwiches! There were about 50 other people at the top too so it is a popular tourist stop and a simple hut and no toilet facilities at the top so be prepared for that - don't let that put you off though, it is definitely a worthwhile experience. The descent is a bit more hazardous and is extremely slippery with the lava and ash from previous volcanic eruptions lining the mountainside so wear shoes with good grip and bring a light rucksack for water so your hands are free. To improve, I would have appreciated some tips about trekking from the guide, such as how to place my feet on the terrain, but he was very patient and stopped for lots of rest breaks. Overall, a great experience to see the sunrise and views of mount agung ( a much bigger and more dangerous mountain) and would recommend this company and tour guides."

He gave us bottles of waters and had a nice conversation with my husband and I all the way to Kintamani. There we were met by our guide Gunaman who was also very friendly and knowledgeable He was so patient with us during our hike up before sunrise which took just over 2 hours. He kept us informed and entertained throughout the trek which was very difficult for me as I am quite unfit and also had never trekked before. My husband had climbed Mt Snowden before but for me it was a first. Gunaman was really kind and even carried my bag after halfway because he could see that I was struggling. At the top he took some brilliant photos of my husband and I which I wil cherish forever and he gave us breakfast. The eggs were boiled using the natural steam at the volcano peak which you also get to see when you make it up there! Very rewarding and well worth the blood sweat and tears! And we are very glad we chose this company to go with! Thank you. From Farzana & Salim"

The trek begins around 4 am and involves some fairly steep and slippery climbs. Luckily our guide Made Sucipta was super watchful and careful, and made sure that I had adequate breaks and did not fall back down the mountain half way. I had a fantastic view of the sunrise, great breakfast and along the way, learnt about farming and wild animals of Bali. It was a great experience. For those considering, remember to bring warm clothes and good shoes."

            "review": "Amazing experience. We read all the reviews so knew it would be good, but we were concerned about the weather (as we didn't bring any warm clothes) and the hike (as my wife was not 100% after having leg surgery 3 months ago). We decided to give it a go and loved every second of it, not only because of the spectacular view, but also due to the people involved.We were picked up promptly at 1:30am and drove to the base of the mountain, met our guide Yogi and started walking at 3:30am. It was a bit disconcerting when everyone else had long pants and jackets and we were in shorts, shirts and runners but we were committed at this point. We started the walk and quickly passed the other groups to enjoy the first 30 mins through the easy part of the walk in the forest. After a quick rest and drink on the outskirts of the forest we began the climb across a distinctly different landscape of loose gravel and volcanic rock. From here we got some of the best views across the lake toward Mt. Agung in absolute silence in almost full moon light -- wow! The remaining climb took us 45 mins (75 mins total) and we got to enjoy the peak in silence for another 20 mins before the crowds arrived. There are a few shacks up top to help you escape the winds, but fortunately it was fairly clear when we arrived. Since you reach the top sweating, it would be a good idea at this time to don a jacket but we didn't suffer without one. After a short rest and a chance to take in the spectacular view, Yogi took us down to the volcanic vents (which were nice to stand beside for a while) were he cooked us eggs and bananas for breakfast.We then sat up top with a coffee (which you can buy from the guys at the top - 30,000 IDR or thereabouts) and enjoyed the sunrise for about 30 mins and took heaps of photos (some attached).After the sunrise Yogi gave us the option of heading back the way we came or walking around the rim of the caldera, which would take an additional hour but was something we couldn't pass up. For those with a drastic fear of heights, this may not be for you as there are a couple of hairy bits that you must overcome (probably 20m in total) where you need to hold on while traversing a slim ledge. That said, it would be worth trying and if you can't you can always head back. I say this because the view around that way was amazing!During the edge walk, we saw the caldera from all angles and views all over the island. We walked back past the other more popular path were heaps of people were lining up head down (thank god we didn't take that route!). We passed another lookout where there are monkeys enjoying the tourists hospitality and had another look into the deepest parts of the caldera. After this we descended using another path and were back in our car in 45 mins.I can not express how grateful we were to have a guide like Yogi. That guy was an absolute champ and played a big part in our enjoyment of the day.After this we dropped past a coffee plantation on our way back to the hotel which was nice where we tried a few different coffees and teas. We ended up buying some stuff there which we got back into the country without any problems.All up, great morning and something I think everyone should do. Long pants aren't required but a light jacket would be nice for when you cool down at the top, but once again isn't necessary. The only necessity would be closed shoes, thongs won't cut it.As for the walk, I would rate it as a medium difficulty (some fitness required). We're pretty fit but as I said at the start, my wife had leg surgery 3 months ago and did it fine. You can take as many stops as you like (the guides won't push you) so even if you're not in the best shape, you can take your time and you'll make it by sunrise.Enjoy!"

The shortness of breath and pounding heart from the hike were ABSOLUTELY worth the amazing sunrise view. We were picked up from our hotel on time. Our guide, Rodia (unsure if I spelled that correctly), was fantastic. He kept a steady and reasonable pace with breaks along the way. We made it to the top in about an hour and 40 minutes which was about an hour before sunrise. He cooked us each a hardboiled egg over the hot volcano steam and made us banana sandwiches and egg sandwiches for breakfast along with snakeskin fruit and bananas. He was so kind and made us coffee and offered to take our pictures and gave us history about the volcano and answered any questions we had. We are mid to late 20s and and haven't exercised too frequently in the last month or too, but we were able to complete the hike without too much trouble. As far as what to wear: yoga/sweat pants, a tank top, a lightweight zip up cotton jacket and a windbreaker worked fine for me.Also - this company provides hiking sticks. They were super helpful and I noticed many other hikers envying ours.This experience was very positive and I highly recommend it if you like being active and outdoors and appreciate the beauty of mother nature.OH! Almost forgot - they take you on a tour of a local coffee plantation at the end which was VERY cool :)"

We have both been fit for most of our lives - fit meaning, regular running, weights, swimming, some triathlons etc.. Not overweight at all, and thought ourselves fit. Speaking for myself, I thought I had a reasonable level of fitness and although I knew it would be hard to climb Agung, really, I was looking to climb it on past (Physical) glories. I thought I'd just tough it out.Lesson one. - don't lie to yourself about how fit you are!About 60% make it to the top I'm told. I thought I was easily going to be one of those... but I only made it just above 2000m. Why. Well, I was not fit enough and ended up feeling very sick and worse, feeling very sorry for myself not getting to the top. I was fit, but not fit for this mountain. If you're young and very active, you'll probably make it ok if you really want to, but if you're not climbing for purpose, that is, climbing hills/mountains and pushing yourself, then you may well find this mountain quite tough.I'll be back to conquor this mountain later - but for now, I suggest you are not only running fit, but climbing fit. Climb mountains, stair, anything. Wear a pack and be comfortable doing so.Clothes: - layers... it may be warm at the bottom, but half way up, you'll be feeling the cold when you stop for a rest.. the wind against your sweat may make you a little cool for comfort, so have layers!Food and Pack: - eat well before you go, but our experience and that of others we know is that most don't eat that much on the way up... some snacks and water + electrolytes, but other than that not much... on the way down you will eat more... Tour Guide - 'Mardi' - Well, I cant say enough good about this man.... he knew the track, had all the stories and was very supportive and patient with everyone... when i had to stop climbing, it was apparent that going down in the dark was not going to happen. too unsafe. He stayed with my wife and I till daylight. He made a fire, tea, and took care of us. It was embarrassing to have not made it up there. My fault for not training properly - but not a word or a look of any judgement from Mardi.The walk down was harder than the walk up in many ways. Easier on the lungs of course, but it just seemed we were slipping continuously on the loose ground.At the bottom we were very happy and overall, the experience was a great one, inspite of not getting to the top. We will be back here again and hoping Mardi is still with the company. Mt Agung beat us (me) this time, but wont next time.Summary - train hard and don't underestimate the difficulty of this trek. I don't know what other treking outfitters here are like, but this one we though, was quite exceptional.Happy Treking!"

He not only guided us up the volcano path, but bought us hot coffee from a vendor at the top, cooked eggs in the volcano and explained the history of the villages in the caldera. It was a truly private tour, meaning that you don't carpool with other trekkers, your guide goes at the pace you would like, and although there are quite a few people at the top of the volcano, your guide is solely focused on your experience. I would absolutely recommend this trek and ask for Radia when you go."

My partner and I did the trek in Feb. we booked very last minute (like a day before). our driver picked us up exactly on time, he was a little quiet, but that was ok because I wanted to finish my sleep on the ride there. When we arrived we were then introduced to our tour guide. I can't recall his name but he was very good. He was patient, informative, and very helpful on the steep incline by carrying my back pack for me. He had a companion who walked with us to carry drinks in case we wanted to buy some when we got there. He was also helpful too, he often grabbed my hand to help me keep up with the guys. We managed to get to the top in 1.5 hours. I'm glad that we walked whilst it was still dark. The last 3/4 of the trip is very steep. When you look down you could almost psych yourself out at how steep you've been climbing. We were the first to arrive- champions!! During the walk you will get really hot and sweaty, but 5 mins into stopping when you reach the top, you will definitely feel the chill so be prepared by carrying a wind proof jacket or something warm. When we arrived we were able to sit and wait for the others to arrive whilst our tour guide made us breakfast (this included banana and egg sandwiches heated up using the natural heat/steam from the volcano, and fruit, crackers and water. In terms of the view, it was quite cloudy so we didn't get the best view of the sun rise but it was still an amazing view regardless. The fact that in our photos you could see we were above cloud and the peak of the volcano across the valley made impressive photos. The trek down was interesting. We took a different route which is less steeper however I found myself sliding a lot on my feet down the loose dirt. To get a better grip with your feet, I suggest stepping on the yellowy coloured rock. I slipped a couple of times so it is important to try and control your walking. A little two much force or wrong direction could see you sliding off the mountain. When I think about it, it's actually quite dangerous with no safety gear but at the same time you still feel safe and in control. After the trek we went to the hot springs. This is definitely worth doing as part of the package. Really relaxed by calf and buttox that got a good flogging on the trek. I highly recommend using this company if you are thinking of doing a trek. They even asked for feedback after the trek. From start to finish i found dealing with this company very professional."

The first half was fine but the second half is much steeper and tough but definitely doable for someone with little cardio fitness like myself! We reached the top in 1.5 hours and waited around for about an hour for sunrise (that gives over two hours for anyone who finds it challenging). The views were amazing and our guide was fantastic...giving us a real insight into the Bali way of life. The way down was by a different route and much quicker and then it was onto the hot springs which definitely helped the muscles recover, so I would recommend it. Tip: Bring tissues...there is no toilet anywhere so you will have to find somewhere quiet at the top which I would recommend to do before the sun rises for a bit of privacy!"

Sorry I misted this going up, enjoying it extra hard going down hehe ;) He knows a lot about the plants and had some great life savers down the road :D Jero, thanks so much for the understanding and support by taking the time for Bram so he could also enjoy the view on top while being ill. Your the best! Almost forgot the hot springs and coffee plantage! Hot spring was a good idea after the trip. The heat was a warm welcome to our bodies :P"

Our driver picked us up at 1:40am from Seminyak with very little sleep, Ketut (who spoke impeccable english) took us through everything there was to know about Mt Batur and the surrounding villages, he let us know everything he was great! We arrived and met our trekking guide who took us up a hard climb and we made it to the top well before sunrise. He made as many stops as we liked and told us everything he knew! Once at the top he took us down into the crater to show us the hot steam and where he was cooking our breakfast, then made our breakfast and let us eat until the sunrise came up. The sunrise was what made the climb all worth it!, it was absolutely insane! and then all the monkeys came out to sit with us and watch the sunrise it was incredible. After the sunrise our guide took us all the way around the crater to many photo spots and telling us more information along the way! Once at the bottom our drivers were waiting for us to arrive to take us home, as soon as we got in the car we were fast asleep! It was exhausting especially when we had only 3 hours sleep the night before but it was definitely worth it! there are many options after the hike to go and try luwak coffee or go to the hot springs but we were too tired! Definitely a must do!!"

The night before our trek, we contacted Mangku via WhatsApp to confirm our pick-up time and location and had received prompt replies from him.My friend and I woke up late and received notification reminders from Mangku and Nyoman Adik, our driver who brought us to the bottom of Mt Batur at about 2.30AM. Nyoman was very polite and greeted us with warm hospitality, despite making him wait for about 40 mins. He ensured that we were able to catch the sunrise in time at the summit.I had a good time climbing Mt Batur and catching the sunrise while having breakfast. This wouldn't be possible if not for Kadekadi and Saja, the guides who assisted me a lot during the climb and descent respectively. They ensured that my safety was taken care of during the summit climb and descent. They were very helpful and patient. During the times when I needed a quick break, they would stop for awhile and ensure that I am ok before continuing. They supported me many times when the terrains were steep as we went along.During the descent, I enquired Saja slightly more about the history and existence of the volcano, and he was able to explain to me with patience and clarity.Nyoman was very helpful and sensitive to our needs. He was sincerely concerned and took great care of my friend who was unwell during the climb. My friend enjoyed the stargazing and catching sunrise from the other side of Mt Batur.We enjoyed the natural hotspring very much as we were able to relax and enjoy the view of the mountains and lake after a long morning.Will definitely recommend this tour to my friends. Will come back to experience this again. Thank you so much once again for the great service! :)"

The most important aspect as well, the price of USD 65 is way too expensive, I admit it is my mistake that I did not compare prices with other tour agencies. However, when I did the comparison, most other tour agencies are only charging USD 40 - 50. Hence Bali trekking tour is charging at least 30% more!2. Undervalued because we are being short change! While other guides provide coffee / tea for breakfast, we had to pay for our own. Though the amount is nominal but it just does not feel right.3. They included a \"coffee plantation\" visit, it is not a plantation! It is just a properly setup area that looks like a small plantation but it is a tourist trap to sell coffee beans / tea leaves at exorbitant prices.The positives are mainly (a) driver is on time and (2) the guide was experienced. Other than that, it is not worth engaging this company.However, I will tell all readers to go for the trek because the summit's view is breathtaking. Hence, it is recommended to go for the trek but with other tour agencies."

The guide was a few minutes late, but was ready to go as soon as he arrived.After a steady 30+ minutes of hiking, we stopped to rest and were greeted by a elementary school child that I suspect was related to my guide. I was then told by my guide that the child will be joining us and is bringing us Cokes for purchase at the top of the mountain and that the funds are for school. I felt pressured to purchase one, as well a two more times along the hike and one final sales pitch while I was recovering at the top. After being told the drink would cost 40K ($3USD), I decided it was too expensive and refuse at which point the mood of my guide soured as if I offended him.The hike was pretty challenging, but the reward is an incredible sunrise overlooking east Bali and the mountains of Lombok. My guide made some banana sandwiches and Balinese coffee to cap the moment. Following breakfast, we starting down the mountain and rather than take the same route, my guide decided to run down a different path, passing other hikers, to meet and chat with a fellow guide. I quickly caught up with him and he proceeded to walk down the hill, talking to his guide friend, both of whom were completely disregarding their hikers. Near the bottom of the hike, the trail split and my guide had to split from his gabbing partner and head to different parking lots.At this point, we stopped to rest and my guide told me we were not supposed to take this secondary route on the way down, but he thought I would like to see a different view. While, I would have preferred to hike down the same route and see what I scaled in the dark that morning, I am left to believe we went down this route because my guide wanted to talk to a fellow guide, rather than focus on the safety and experience of his paying customer.This does not take away from the beauty of the hike. The views were fantastic and the terrain changed from canopy-covered dirt to fully exposed volcanic rocks. I would love to do the hike again, although next time with a guide who is more customer-focused. I felt like I bother to him, which is not what I expected, particularly after being required to pay for a guide to have this experience."

Be sure to prepare a windbreaker or a good jacket because it was cold up there. We had breakfast cooked by our guide using steam from the volcano. Wonderful experience.The walk down was longer but you're no longer pressed for time so it's okay. No toilets at all so if you're urgent you would have to go in the bushes.

There was a short pit stop before we continued our route up (we took the advanced route which led to the highest point). The view at the summit was amazing. Beautiful sea clouds and sunrise. It was worth the climb!! We had plenty of time to enjoy the view and had breakfast (banana and eggs sandwich, eggs, energy bars, and coffee) prepared by Adi. I find that the journey down was more difficult than climbing up. It was sandy and slippery. There were 3 of us and Adi made trips up and down 3 times to help us down at some slippery paths.

Safe to say it was AMAZING and one of the highlights of our whole trip to Bali.The whole day ran smoothly; even the 2:15am pick up was on time. We had a lovely driver called Bobby who drove us to the start of the trek and waited for us whilst we completed it (which took about 5 hours!). We were met by our fantastic guide, Jerro, who was so enthusiastic and made the whole experience worth while. all of the guides are experienced with the trek and measure your ability on the easy part of the trek before deciding which route to take you to the summit. We were taken on the advanced route- which was worth it because we got to the highest point! We stopped whenever we needed to and weren't made to feel like we were too slow by our guide. We were concerned after reading reviews that the trek would be too strenuous- as we had never trekked ourselves before this, but we managed it absolutely fine! It doesn't feel like 2 hours up, or 2 hours down. Just make sure you wear suitable trainers! As it can be quite rocky in places. Once we reached the top, we saw the sunrise which was spectacular!! So peaceful and you could see the towns and lake down below. It was quite an achievement to see what we had climbed in the daylight! Jerro Cooked us breakfast from the steam at the top of the volcano- which again, was amazing! Before starting our descent. You get plenty of time to admire the views and watch the sunrise. Lots of photo opportunities and our guide gave us the history of mount Batur too. Our driver Bobby met us at the bottom and took us on to the hot springs, which are like infinity pools overlooking Batur lake. Our lunch was included too. (Well worth choosing this package, as the hot springs were a god send after all that trekking!)Although the trip is quite pricey, you definitely get what you pay for and we would do it all over again! The service and tour was such a good experience and we would encourage everyone to give it a go if you're in Bali!"

So we where perfect on time at the starting point, the Besakih Temple. There we met our guide and got our equipment for the hike (flashlight, trekking pole, breakfast package...) The hike was an incredible experience. But not to be underestimated! The mount Agung is one out of the three toughest hikes in all of Indonesia and rated a higher intensity hiking level than the Kilimanjaro Tanzania. Hiking levels for the Mount Agung are from a high intensity level just because you have to do it in one day, ascent and descent in +\\- 12 hours.Our guide (Kakki) was really experienced and was there for our safety. Because of high winds at the top of the mountain, we weren't sure if we could make it out of safety reasons. After a break of 45 minutes at 2600 meter, the guide decided to give it a try and revalued the situation as we got closer to the top. Eventually we made it to the top before sunrise without taking unnecessary risks. The view was astonishing, spectacular, breathtaking and worth all the efforts. We were glad we made it to the top of Bali!"

Batur Hike at night, relaxation at Batur Hot Springs, and a trip to a coffee plantation including a coffee tasting. It started at 1.30 a.m at our hotel where Mr. Ketut Antara picked us up. He was our driver for the day. He speaks great English and told us much about Balinese culture. He was very nice and gave us all the time we needed at the single spots. The hiking guide was great as well, but I forgot his name... So, if you are interested in doing Mt. Batur hiking you should most definitely book your tour via Bali Trekking Tour. In addition, you should ask for Ketut Antara as a driver. It is absolutely worth it!"

The climb to the top was harder than expected, but there is no rush and plenty of stops along the way. Really beautiful sunset and a friendly guide to help us along. I'd highly recommend going to the hot springs afterwards (we spent just over 2 hours there) what a great way to relax! The water was so nice, and the Indonesian lunch provided there was great too. I wasn't expecting much from the coffee place, but it was just beautiful. They provided about 20 samples of their different teas/coffees/chocolate to try. All their products can go through customs to Australia no problem, so we bought a few different things. Overall, a great day - well paced and great choice of activities - Thank you!!"

This was truly the highlight of our Bali trip and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is planning a trip to Bali. We had a very humourous, helpful and knowledgable guide Komang, who sticked closely with us each and every step of the way, and was constantly checking on us. We learnt so much about the Bali culture and history of Mount Batur through him which made the climb even more enriching. We were also blessed with a beautiful sunrise as the skies were clear that morning - this coupled with a cup of hot chocolate and a simple breakfast prepared by Komang truly made this one of life's best moments.This was my first time attempting to climb a mountain and have to say it is quite manageable for anyone with a reasonable level of fitness. We took two hours to climb up, and 1.5 to head down. Some key things to bring will be a jacket when it gets chilly at the top and a pair of good trekking shoes. If you have time to spare, go for the tour with the hot spring at the end where you will also get to enjoy a perfect view of Lake Batur."

Once we arrived at the base of the mountain we met our guide, armed our flashlights, and headed off for the summit. The trail starts with a mild incline through a series of wide paths then slowly narrows into steep singletrack as you gain altitude. There is a bit of scrambling required but we had plenty of breaks and a manageable pace. We climbed through the darkness for a little over 1.5 hours until we reached the summit. Once there, we settled in for the show while our guide prepared a banana sandwich and hard-boiled egg which was cooked in the steam of the volcano (first for me). Once the sun broke over the horizon we had a fantastic color show for 45 minutes or so. After that, we continued along the ridge trail around the crater then worked our way down. We were treated to AMAZING views the entire time and loved watching the monkeys at the base of the crater. Once we finally made it down we recovered at the nearby hot springs which was fabulous.Our guide and driver were both fantastic. Judging from what we saw on the mountain our guide was much more attentive, personable, and safety minded than the others we saw. While many others marched their clients up and down the route, our guide was careful to point out the right foot holds and offered a helping hand wherever needed. He was also extremely personable and a pleasure to be around. Our driver was right on time, safe, and got us from point A to point B with no drama. A+ experience all around."

This was one of the most amazing experiences in my life!To be very honest, its not the easiest treks. It is physically challenging and at times scary. However, because of our wonderful guide - we made it through and thoroughly enjoyed it. I am glad the trek uphill was in the dark because I would have been very scared getting up there if I knew how challenging it was - I may have given up. But believe me, the views are breathtaking!! The guide carried food for us all the way up! He cooked boiled eggs and bananas in the natural steam that comes from the volcanic mountain - its quite cool! I highly recommend. Ask for Putu when you book the trip. Luckily we had him to ourselves (me and my husband), so he really guided us well through the climb and descent. When I was about to give up, he held my hand and told me funny stories to distract me and helped me climb all the way up! Genuine guy who has been doing this for 20+ yrs. Hope to visit again some day!!!"

The package cost USD 65 per person including private transportation (comfortable Avanza) from our villa at Ubud area, the simple yet tasty breakfast (banana sandwich, boiled eggs and tea) we had on top of mountain, and a coffee plantation tour after Mt Batur trekking.We got a very helpful tour guide - Adi, who is knowledgeable (e.g. he knows several routes with different difficulty to reach the top as well as history of Mt. Batur). I am the kind of unfit person (can't even run 5 km) and never done hiking before. But under Adi's help, we were still able to reach the top within 2 hours and enjoyed the wonderful sunrise! We stayed there for about 1 hour and just couldn't stop taking photos.It was quite cold there as the starting point was at 700m above sea level and we started in midnight. Suggest to bring jacket and gloves. Also, a mask might be useful to prevent breathing in dust and sands while coming down. We back to starting point at around 9am."

This was our highlight of our whole trip to Bali! We were picked up on time by our driver who took us to the base of Mt. Batur. There we met our guide who equipped us with water, a torch and walking stick. The journey to the summit took approximately 2 and a half hours. Our guide regularly checked to make sure that we were happy to walk on and encouraged us to take rest breaks. He even helped me to navigate some of the steeper stones at the top as my little legs couldn't quite reach. When we arrived at the summit, we sat in a small wooden hut whilst he prepared breakfast in the crater of the volcano. We got chance to see how the eggs and bananas were cooked and sampled them when the sun came up.The sunrise was absolutely spectacular and it is an experience we won't forget! It was undoubtedly worth the 2am start! We opted to take the 'easier' route down and our guide was brilliant- helping us all of the way. He held my hand down some of the more tricky parts of the path because I kept falling over and he was very patient.The views as we walked down the mountain were incredible too and the guide pointed out lots of features in the surrounding area. We reached the bottom of the volcano exhausted but happy. This was definitely the highlight of our holiday!"

When we reached the bottom of the mountain, Guide Adi was ready for us with a good quality walking sticks for each of us. Along the way up, Adi would make stops to check if we were alright. A guy who sold drinks at the top helped my girlfriend the entire way up despite telling him we don't need help. It was a good gesture except that he would expect us to buy his drink at the top and give him a tip. Well that aside, Adi helped us with breakfast and snapshots. Breakfast was good as all the reviews suggested. He brought us into this little hut where all the other locals camped. and got us some hot tea which was simply perfect for that cold a peak. We got down unscathed and right on time for our journey back. Norman took us to the luwak coffee place, the wooden art pieces place and a local babi guling eatery. Along the way he would tell us what town is known for what product or produce. Listening to him is exactly how I would picture my tour. To add to that, he gave us a lift to the airport after our journey, which wasnt required but he did. Thanks for making our tour so memorable."

We didn't take the torches as we all had our own head torches (highly recommended, if you already have one bring it along) but the walking poles came in really handy.We (4 of us) are all quite experienced walkers so we set quite a quick pace and our guide was happy to accommodate this but still made sure we had a few breaks on the way up. We reached the summit in plenty of time and it is pretty cold up there. Learn from our mistake and do not walk too quickly or rather take a really warm jacket for the summit!Our guide was busy making our breakfast and took the time to show us where the eggs were cooking in the hot steam from the volcanic rock. Breakfast was egg and banana sandwiches and some small snacks like cereal bars and crackers. We also had hot tea/coffee which was happily received!We walked over to a quieter part of the mountain to enjoy sunrise away from the crowds and our guide didn't mind this and left us in peace for a while. Our guide was always more than willing to take photos and take the time to explain things to us about the area.We came down the mountain via a different route which took in the rim of the volcano and past some interesting sites including some very cheeky monkeys! At the base of the mountain we said goodbye to our guide and headed to a coffee plantation with our driver. This visit to the plantation breaks up the long journey and is interesting in its own right. We enjoyed some nice coffee and tea and had chance to purchase some souvenirs from the gift shop.Overall we had a great morning and i would highly recommend it to anyone regardless of age or fitness - just remember a warm jacket for the summit (brrrrrr)!"

The driver was on time and the drive took about two hours. He was friendly and had water and walking sticks for us. The guide was already waiting when we arrived and provided us with a torch each. He was fun and friendly, and adjusted easily to our speed without us needing to say anything. When we reached the summit he made us breakfast while we waited for the sun to come up. We had a fairly cloudy day but it was still a beautiful view and absolutely worth the trip. Do bring warm clothes and a blanket or even towel - it's cold up there!! We were in long pants, undershirt, longsleeved t-shirt and hoody and would have paid for a blanket! They sell coffee and hot chocolate on the summit which is not bad and considering they carry the water up on foot also priced fairly. If you get too cold you can get to the area where the steam comes out, you don't have the great sunrise view from here but it's worth spending a few minutes to warm up. Our guide gave us all the time we wanted on the summit which was great as the sun came out after a very cloudy start of the day and many people missed it because they were on their way down. We also took different routes up and down which was nice. He took a few nice pictures of both of us. The driver was there with fresh water as we came down and drove uns safely back to Jimaran while we caught up on our night's sleep."

Highly Recommended.I traveled with my girlfriend, and we were both unsure if we could make it to the peak. The guide kept a very steady slow pace, and never pushed us. He kept safety at his top priority. We made it with more than 30 minutes to spare.We were able to rest often( once an hour. minimum 10 minutes. with a 30 minute rest by a fire before the last 2 hours which is the steepest). Also, during the hike our guide taught us about local Balinese and Indonesian culture. The driver was also great. He arrived at our hotel a few minutes early, he was there to greet us when we came off the mountain exhausted. He drove skillfully and patiently, we were able to sleep for peacefully. The site at the top of the mountain was beautiful. The wind was peaceful and we could see across the whole island of Bali. It was a great way to start our getaway."

We had a private guide who took great care of us as we were climbing the mountain in the dark and were a bit slow. He made sure to rest when we needed to, but still kept us on schedule to see the sunrise. The sunrise was one of the most magical things I have ever seen, well worth the 3am wake up call. I definitely recommend using Bali Trekking Tours as the other touring companies have 20-30 people to one guide and you can get lost in the shuffle. We had a great personalized experience with a wonderful guide."

We had refreshments in between and at the very top, coffee and boiled egg prepared with the steam from volcano which was amazing. And watched the spectacular sunrise. After the trekking, there was Natural hot spring. Yes, Natural hot water pool with great view (lake and mountain in the back). And there was lunch also which was included in the package.

Although we have slept just for an hour prior to climbing the mountain, our driver from bali trekking GEDE was very professional and punctual in picking us up at our hotel in kuta. Along the way he was entertaining us with facts and myths about balis sacred volcanos from local culture, way of life and etc.Upon arriving at the base of the mountain we were guided by I Ketut kertana. We were lucky to have him as our guide since he was patient with us (we are new to climbing mountains), really funny, professional and will really help out when there are times you get slipped or tired from steep slopes. He even gave us chocolates to keep our energy up and running at one of the stops, provided water, cooked us egg from the volcano steam and gave us good breakfast at the top!Although it was really foggy that day, it was still memorable with the information and facts that I ketut kertana provide us regarding the volcano, his life in bali. Never a boring moment!I highly recommend everyone to have him as a guide and for the management to give him a praise for a job well done!!! :)"

Besides that, he knew where the good photo-taking spots were and we were pleasantly surprised by his excellent photo-taking skills. Our driver was an amiable young man, driving us from our villa in Seminyak in the middle of the night and ensuring we arrive safely at our destination in pitch-black darkness.With the spectacular views from the top of the mountain and a delicious breakfast made by our guide, this would be a memorable trekking experience for anyone!"

It was a hard trek to the top of Mount Batur but he was a great support. The view at the top is so worth it. Jero was very knowledgeable about the volcano and helped us take some awesome pictures. The tour included going to the hit springs which we didn't enjoy. It seemed to be very run down. The restaurant was covered in flies - the meal which was very basic - could not be eaten due to the volume of flies (and we are aussies ). We skipped the coffee plantation. My suggestion would be to take those things out of tour and just do the trek as you are far too tired afterwards to do anything but sleep. I would have liked the food to have been much better. However we highly recommend doing the hike and having Jero as your tour guide."

This hike is not for the faint of heart. It begins at 11PM and goes till about 9:30 AM the next day. The difficulty of the hike was made easier by my guides' knowledge of the terain, their carrying food and other supplies (they had a jacket and hiking poles for me), and timing our ascent so we reached the top just in time for sunset.Although some may balk at the price, here are some things to consider:-When are you ever going to be in Bali again?-When are you ever going to have the opportunity to climb an inactive volcano, let alone one in Bali?-When is the next time you will be dazzled by spectacular sunrise views from one of the tallest points in Bali?- The guides (I had 2 for just myself) put in A LOT of work. This hike is very strenuous.This hike is definitely worth the money. Furthermore, if you would like to save a little money just have more than one person with you."

The hike is massively sweat inducing but the summit is very cold so don't make the mistake of leaving without some extra clothing."

The kids of each village enjoy seeing people pass by and would all yell hello and be excited. You will see a lot of villages. The roads in Bali are crazy but we were safe the whole time. We would most certainly recommend this trip to friends and family. The bikes were in good condition. I was nervous I'd flip mine since the front brake was on the right handle bar and I'm used to the reverse of that. But everything worked out. We booked the rafting trip through this company. I wish we didn't because there was confusion multiple times with the rafting company about our payment and we didn't like the rafting anyways.

Made a deposit via PayPal and voila, the driver was there right on the dot to pick us! Amazed! We stayed in Seminyak so the pick up was at 1.40am. We took about a 2.5 hour drive up to the base in Ubud (note: undulating road as we drove further in..made me a little dizzy) and immediately started walking as soon as we disembarked. Torches and climbing sticks were provided along with water for the trek ahead! This is my first time trekking and I would say I am relatively unfit..so took a few breaks along the way, but managed to reach the summit within 2 hours or so. For clumsy people like me, do follow the advice and don your long pants cos it can get pretty rocky and steep towards the end..and you'll never know when you might just slip and fall like me. Breakfast and hot drinks were provided at the summit by our guide along with the boiled eggs cooked by hot volcanic steam! The view needless to say, was breathtaking! Trek down was slippery due to the fine sand, so do wear your climbing shoes if you have one. My husband and I had Mangku as our guide and we really enjoyed conversations with him about life and nature...really passionate guy! And not forgetting, he was very experienced and took good care of us throughout the trek. Never felt inadequate or felt rushed, despite me being not physically ready for this trek.After being totally defeated by Mount Batur it was nice to have Putu, our driver waiting for us and drive us to have a rest at the Coffee plantation and breathe in the cool fresh air. He was also really accommodating when we asked him to drop us at another location. Just felt really special and well-taken care throughout.All of them speak really well and we throughly enjoyed their company! Thumbs up!"

Though it was estimated to take 2 hours, a reasonably healthy person can reach the peak in less than that. Adi was also very helpful especially towards the last quarter of the journey where I had some difficulty climbing up the more slippery slopes. The view is worth the journey getting there.

The hike, wait for sunrise, and descent took just under four hours (you can't rush a sunrise!). When we got back down, Nyoman was so kind and offered to extend my day since I was finishing by going to the airport. We went to the coffee plantation, a few temples, and beautiful rice patty fields. It made such a special finish to my time in Bali.It was colder than I expected and more challenging - bring long pants and a warm top layer (that you'll eventually take off).

But we finally decided to give it a try as climbing volcano is something fresh to us and that both my partner and I are hiking fans. In overall, the trek was pretty challenging if you were hiking beginners. So, get prepared with proper clothing and some warm-ups beforehand. The trail itself was really steep, especially near the endpoint. Fortunately our guide, KOMANG, was really professional, assisting us all the way up and made sure we didn't lag behind. It feels amazing walking on the volcanic rocks and larvae. It took us 1 hour and 8 mins to get to the top, arriving the peak at 3AM. It was freezing up there but fortunately hot teas and coffees were served there. Living in the city for more than 20 years, it's my first time to see that amount of stars in the sky! After a wait of an hour or so, the sky started to turn reddish and purplish. We were so touched by the scene and the landscape was extremely beautiful! So much amazed by the power of nature! KOMANG also prepared us some eggs that were cooked with volcanic steam for our breakfast. Finishing the breakfast, we were ready to descend. The descending journey was even more fun!! You can't help but to \"ski\" over the sands and rocks just like how you did on the snow! Last but not least, I was so impressed by the knowledgeability of our guide, KOMANG. Possessing knowledge of disciplines like anthropology, philosophy and all sorts, we shared many common topics and it's really enjoyable talking to him!The driver Deny is really responsible and accommodating. We especially appreciate that he talked us about all sorts of stuff about Balinese culture and history during the drive. This journey is gonna be a lifelong memory of us! Great thanks to the trip organizer who made the trip so perfect! We will definitely be back in Bali soon!"

Batur Sunrise Trek & Natural Hot Spring and the 2 days bali tour package. We went on the two days tour first and had a private driver, Ady and he took us to all the sites as listed. It was so great and there was no rush. He made sure we saw the sunset at tanah lot and he bought fruit and special dessert they had on bali so we could taste it. If we wanted to stop on the way to see something (which was not on the itinerary) it was not a problem. So very accomodating and friendly. Since they take their time and it is up to you when you leave the arrival time back to the hotel was later than listed but this was not a problem for us. The volcano tour is a must do in bali. It is amazing to see the sunrise at the summit. We had a great and competent guide, Iwayan. We got flashlight in the beginning and he kept making sure we were okay and helping us if we needed a hand. I liked the fact that he only had my friend and me to guide up, so we could set the pace as we wanted). On the trip there also was a drink-boy. He followed us up and then we could buy sodas on the top. It was nice to have him with us on the trip - however he charged 50.000 IDR for a soda (normal price in the store: 3000 IDR). So this was really overprized and I would recommend you to make an agreement before you pay, as we bought 4 sodas (we bought one for the guide and 1 for him) and then he told us the price. Other than this trip was amazing and I would do it again. After the climb we went to the hot springs (really just a swimming pool with a nice view) and it was nice to relax after the climb. At this place we got a great lunch included in the tour.Overall I would definetly use bali trekking and tour guide again."

The whole package worked well, we were picked up from Ubud and arrived at the start of the climb around 11pm. Coffee was provided before we set off as well as walking poles, gloves and a hat. They also provided water for the climb.We met an American couple on the way up and had a great moment when Kika lit a camp fire near the top and we shared food and stories before the final push to the top. Andrew the Smerican gave me his lucky karabiners when we reached the bottom, a lovely gesture of a shared experience (don't worry, karabiners not needed on the climb!).The trek is long so a good level of fitness is needed. Some parts have loose rock, stones and soil but it's never dangerous. Kika always pointed out steeper sections and was very experienced. He does the climb about three times a week. I was impressed with his knowledge of mountains in the Alps, some of which I've climbed and I'd compare this climb to a long day there, but with no snow of course!When we got back to the start point out two drivers had fresh fruit and drinks waiting was a nice touch. The yellow watermelon was especially good! All in all I would recommend this company for the trek, but make sure you're fit!"

If you're into hiking and don't mind an early rise, then join the Mount Batur Sunrise Trek with Bali Trekking & Tours.Our driver Dany and mountain guide Raman were very friendly, reliable and knowledgeable. They made sure we were comfortable the entire time and allowed us to set the pace of the trek; so we felt no pressure whatsoever to keep up with anyone but ourselves.At 1:40am my husband and I were picked up from our villa in Seminyak (which was a 2 hour drive from the starting point).When we arrived, we met our guide who greeted us with a torch and bottle of water. If you prefer to keep your hands free whilst trekking,\u00a0 it is recommended that you bring your own headlight and water hydration backpack. It also gets really cold up here, so make sure to bring something warm to wear whilst waiting for the sunrise.\u00a0At our first rest stop we were given two options - the first was to take the popular track which would lead us to the sunrise point or the second track, which was steeper, would lead us to the peak of the mountain.My husband and I took the second route and even in the darkness we could see the shadow of Mount Agung behind us, the clouds below us and the morning mist forming. It was so beautiful and was well worth the extra 30mins climb!And to further add to the experience, once we were at the peak basking in the breathtaking views, our guide prepared our re-energising breakfast - eggs and banana (sandwich) steamed from the volcanic hot springs. This was one of our favourite highlights from our honeymoon in Bali! Highly recommend!"

Our guide, Ketut, was great and he really made the experience fantastic. Our driver, Bobby, was also really great. He was so knowledgeable and very accommodating. This tour was the perfect experience and I will definitely recommend it to anyone I know coming here! It's not the easiest task to climb the side of a mountain in the middle of the night with only a flashlight and a couple of walking poles, but I promise you that it is SO worth it when you get to the top!"

My four companions and I were virgins to mountain hiking and decided that the 1717m ascent to the summit of Mt Batur would be a manageable introduction to the world of hiking. Alas, some parts of the climb turned out to be more than what some of us had expected. (Think: steep knee high rocky edges)However, special mention goes to the care the guides showed my companions and I throughout the trip to make sure that we were safe and proceeded at a pace that was comfortable for all of us. They made the effort to remember all our names and constantly broke the silence of the twilight trek with choruses of \"Are you ok, (insert name)?\".Our guides were Jerro and Wayang and I hope you will be lucky enough to engage them for any of the treks you book with this company.Side note: There will be locals who trek the way up with you in hope of returns in the form of drink purchases from them (Rp. 50,000 for two bottles)."

We arrived at the bottom of Mt Batur around 3.30am and met our trekking guide Wayan, who kindly greeted us with trekking poles, torches and bottles of water. Wayan was very attentive to us the whole hike making sure we were ok and offered a hand to get us up the more difficult sections of the climb. When we reached the top we were offered tea or coffee and Wayan cooked us amazing egg sandwiches and banana sandwiches in the heat of the volcano steam and gave us fruit, chocolate bars and an extra hard boiled egg each. Once the cloud and fog cleared the views were breathtaking and the early rise and hike were worth it! Wayan then took us to another lookout where we saw monkeys and he gave us a local history lesson on the volcano village. The hike down was again unsteady but Wayan was helpful in making sure we trekked down safely. Overall it was an amazing experience and a lot of fun with much thanks to our fantastic and friendly guide, Wayan! Thank you! We would recommend Wayan as a tour guide if you are thinking of hiking Batur."

Our guides Putu and Ardi were fantastic and the hike itself was a thrill. We started on the trail at 7:30am and arrived at the summit around 10am. We were back in Ubud by 2:30pm, so a solid day hike. Unlike the popular Mt Batur sunrise trek, this was a more secluded area and we were delighted to have the trail to ourselves the entire day. (Note: this is a strenuous hike with an elevation gain around 3600 feet in a relatively short time, so be prepared for a steep climb and sore muscles afterward!)The views of Lake Batur and Mt Batur were gorgeous for the first hour of the ridge hike, and then we climbed up through beautiful jungle. At the top we felt like we were in another world, surrounded by thick clouds and mist, plus an ancient holy site. Since we didn't have our hiking boots, we were a bit unsteady on the way down after the rain, so Putu and Ardi were very helpful to make sure we made it down the mountain without a scratch. They were patient and had great senses of humor, and they are clearly very experienced guides. If you are looking for a challenging and rewarding day-hike in Bali, we highly recommend Mt Abung with these guides!"

The overall excursion was well coordinated and Radia was an exceptional guide; he was informative, cheery, and made sure we were safe throughout the hike. The hike took us a little under 1.5 hours and in the dark, you need to watch your footing. My husband and I are active and I would consider us both in good shape and it was a moderate to moderate/difficult outing. The work was well worth it for the sunrise - we had a perfect day and really got some time to take in all the views. It was one of the highlights of our trip! After the hike, we went to the hot springs (great for sore muscles after the long hike) and to the coffee/tea compound. Lastly, we drive by Tegallalang and got to see the famous tiered rice paddy fields. We enjoyed our day and Baki Trekking - we would definitely recommend the excursion and the company to future travelers!"

The driver picked us up on time and was fantastic. He checked that we had the correct equipment before we left. He then proceeded to drive very carefully (especially considering Bali driver standards!) and was was conscientious of pot holes and other obstacles on the Bali roads. We arrived on time at the base of Mt Batur where we met our guide Radia. We were given touches and offered hiking poles. We started the climb at 1000m above sea level and had a couple of breaks as we needed them. Radia was great and took us up at a steady pace so that we didn't tire. As expected for someone who climbs mountains for a living Radia was very fit and we all made it up the top no sweat :) In total it took us an hour and ten minutes to reach the summit with a total of 4.2km being trekked. Radia then showed us some volcanic vents where he later cooked our eggs in. After around half an hour being up the top we had a tasty breakfast of egg & banana sandwiches.After we watched the sunset Radia offered to take us the longer / more scenic route down along the crater which was worth the effort. He was very knowledgeable when it came to Mt Batur and the surrounding villages. Once we got back down we went to some natuaral hot springs for a soak (lunch was included) then headed home. We also got offered a trip to a coffee plantation but we were a bit tried.My wife and I highly recommend Bali Trekking and Tour Guide! - Joseph and Rebecca :)"

Made all the more special by our most knowledgable guide Rania who fed us, took our photos and trekked us from crater to crater. The breath taking views were spectacular, well worth the 130am pick up to watch the sunrise with the sacred Mt Agung as the backdrop. Warning!! The initial trek in the dark up to the summit is extremely difficult requiring a high fitness level. We will be returning to Bali at the end of the year but this time I will prepare with a better fitness level, correct footwear and warm clothing as it was very cold waiting for sunrise on the summit. I would not hesitate recommending this amazing trek with this very professional and safe tour. Thank you and extra special praise to the wonderful Rania. I hope you and your family are well. See you later this year! Rosie and Jason."

Luckily I had packed my walking boots, wet weather gear, warm jacket, and a thermal undershirt.The young fella picked me up in Jimbaran at 01:30 on what can only be called an awful night. It was blowing a hooligan and the rain was sheeting down. As we made our way up through UBUD, dodging dogs lying in the road and the occasional fallen tree, the rain increased and the skyline was illuminated with the flashes of lighting. We arrived at the meeting point at around 04:00 and I was introduced to Radia who was to be my guide for the morning.After sorting ourselves out we headed off into the gloom and a slow ascent through farmland and then into the forest. The track was slick with the rain and a the decision to pack my walking boots was validated. We passed the main Temple and one further up that is only used once a year. Near the end of the forest the incline increased and once we cleared it became fairly vertical testing the rickety knees out. Half way up and the rain was still belting it down. The reflection from the head torch against the rocky path was quite disorientating and next time I would take up the offer of the trekking stick with the flashlight incorporated. Radia's English was very good and we had a fair old chat on the way up. He is local farmer and is quite happy to discuss every aspect of life living in the shadow of the mount. We arrived at the summit around 06:00, still dark, still raining, still very windy, still thunder and lightening and very wet. I stripped off the wet shirt and donned the warm jacket and thermal vest - Now toasty warm sitting in a shelter at very summit of Batur. You could feel the occasional gust of warm air as the steam from the vents blew over. Radia mustered the eggs and bananas and cooked up brekky in one of the vents. Sunrise never really eventuated - Who cares, I was having a most enjoyable time and the air up here was clean and refreshing. The trek down took us around the crater and then down to a lower crater where the local monkeys and dogs were hanging out. Most of the other tourists came up to this point which is about 100 metres below the summit. After some photo taking it was off down to the transport. Again the decision to wear a pair of boots with decent tread paid dividend. Most of the other walkers had on shorts and training shoes and were and cold wet and slip sliding all over the place.Back at the car park it was time to say farewell to Radia - Cheers mate your cheerful attitude and chatty nature certainly made the day a memorable one. Would I do it again - CertainlyTerima kasih banyak"

We were picked up at our hotel at the scheduled time, the ride to the starting point was a long hour, due to the condition of the roads we travelled on. Our guides were wonderful and very helpful from start to finish. The trek itself is not a long duration, but is not for the faint hearted. Ensure you are of a decent fitness level before attempting as the path is very challenging at times. Proper footwear is essential as you are climbing a volcano and the terrain is unpredictable during the descent and ascent. The sunrise is well worth the views and many photo ops are available. Breakfast is provided at the summit which is a lovely touch to the experience. The descent is not energy taxing but can be hard on the ankles or knees. Also, essential to go to the toilet before beginning the journey, as I had to embarrassingly pop a squat at the summit at the cost of a pair of underwear lol. Besides that obstacle, it is a lovely experience I will remember for times to come."

It is very dark and they do furnish flashlights...but be prepared! We arrived safely at the top and enjoyed every step! The only thing I would have asked for that I didn't receive was actually getting to see the sunrise (it was rather cloudy at the top and visibility was poor), but clearly that was beyond the control of Bali Trekking. We did enjoy a nice breakfast at the top as well.Our hike back down was very nice and scenic...the clouds even cleared and we had a beautiful view of the lake and the surrounding village.

We arrived at the bottom of Mt Batur and it was raining so they gave us water, torch and poncho. We met our guides and set off! The first part of the trek is quite easy, I've never hiked by night before, but it wasn't scary and I think it made the experience better as you couldn't look down. Our wonderful guide Giro held my hand and pulled me up the tough part about half way onwards. It took about 2 hours total climb and all of us are quite fit and do a bit of hiking so a bit longer if you've had zero experience. At the top, I was feeling quite ill so we bought a coke for sugar and they were vet caring. The weather was terrible and freezing but they made us yummy tea and coffee to keep warm and we sat in the enclosure while they cooked us breakfast from the volcanic steam. My partner had a look at where they cook it and said it was very cool. We ate warm banana sandwiches (with no crusts) which were so yummy and boiled eggs and chocolates. We sat for an hour or so, then the weather was not getting any better so we started the journey down, but not before getting a few foggy, rainy photos. We were so elated just to be at the top. The climb down was a little slippery bit Giro held my hand and helped me whenever it was a bit tough (almost the whole way for me). The clouds cleared about half way down and we got some better photos. We run a bit, so our guides were happy to jog with us towards the bottom when it was easier. We had the most wonderful time on this trek, it was one of the best things we have done together and our guides made us feel at ease and happy the entire time. An absolute bargain of an adventure!"

Our drivers were very nice, and spoke English pretty well. They allowed us to sleep while they drove us across the island. We rode across the island to the starting point of our Mt. Batur hike, where we were greeted by our guide Jero War. He is a really great guide--extremely friendly and you can really tell how much he loves his job. He carried my backpack up along with his own, and also held our hands to help us up the mountain while still holding our backpacks. I am asthmatic, so we took a little longer to get up the mountain, but he was very patient and cheerful the whole time. He was very helpful and knowledgeable about the history of the volcano. The view when we got up to the top was absolutely magical. We were told we were lucky because the sky was clear that day in the middle of rainy season. Jero even cooked us breakfast using the volcanic steam! What an amazing experience! Totally worth waking up so early. After the volcano hike, our drivers took us to a coffee plantation where we saw how Luwak coffee is made, and after that we visited padi fields which looked amazing too. We highly recommend the Mt. Batur sunrise trek. It was one of the most amazing things we've ever done (not just in Bali, but anywhere). Also worth noting: we were told you can actually request to have Jero as a guide, and they will do their best to make sure that he is available for you. Highly recommend him! We will be requesting him for another adventure the next time we are in Bali!"

Still, as the saying goes, \"you can't get a rainbow without the rain\"! The hike path is steep and scrabbly in parts but the real challenge lies in doing it in the dark with only the light of a torch - the field of vision is much more limited, as was evidenced in the comparative ease of descending the volcano in broad daylight once the sun had risen. Our guide Jerro was terrific - knowledgeable, enthusiastic without being overbearing, took great photos using the panoramic function on our phone cameras. We were blessed with a cloudless sky to watch the magical sunrise, and lucky as it had apparently been either cloudy or rainy on the preceding 4 dawns!Although warm during the hike it is cool at the summit, so it's a good idea to bring a fleece. Shoes with a good tread are also advisable, as are a reasonable level of fitness, a head torch (so that you have both hands free for balance), and carrying minimal extras - all you really need is a bumbag to carry a little cash to purchase drinks at the top, your camera, and a bottle of water. Enjoy - this is really worth getting up early for!"

I would like to give compliments to our guide Ketut, for being extremely attentive and patient while we really took our time going up and down. :) We enjoyed this tour thoroughly and would recommend it to others.

No reply at all when we wanted to reconfirm our tour. Managed to get in touch with them when I sms them, telling me that email was down.On 29 Nov 14, our driver came to pick us up as promised at 0230H. It's about 1-1.5 hr drive from Ubud to foot of Mount Batur. We were greeted by our trekking guide Jerro. While walking thru the forest, he made 2 walking sticks for hubby and I so that we could have better support. Mid way thru, a drink seller Katut joined us. He would also accompany us throughout the climb to see whether we needed any drinks or aids.True enough, I was not a good climber. I had difficulties in overcoming my fear when I see big and steep slope. I made more than 10 small rests in between. Jerro and Katut had to pull me up at one point in order to get me to the top. We managed to reach the top at 0550H.The view was magnificent at the top, too bad the clouds covered the sunrise. Temperature was at around 20 degree C. Jerro then offered us biscuits while he went to prepare our breakfast, steamed hard boiled eggs and banana sandwich from the volcano steam.After breakfast, Jerro then brought us around the live crater and explained the history of Mount Batur. We made our way down thru the same way up.Would like to give compliments our trekking guide thru this platform. He held on to my hand most of the time while climbing up and down to help me overcome my fear. Thanks for making the walking sticks and providing the biscuits for us as I don't see other group having it. And also sharing the history and stories of your religion along the way.We enjoyed the tour and would let others know too."

The communication was excellent, and all my emails were answered promptly. Our driver Ardy was super friendly and very punctual. Water and snack was provided before the climb and we arrived to meet our guide at about 3am. Jerro was an excellent guide, and always stopping to give us little water breaks when needed. The climb up wasn't too difficult, but I would advise some good footwear! Once at the top, the views were incredible and naturally, the sunrise was beautiful! Jerro provided us with a wonderful breakfast of egg sandwiches, and banana sandwiches (cooked from the heat of the volcano). The whole trek was an amazing experience, and one that I would highly recommend to others!!"

I have been acting as the \"project manager\" for our past 6 hiking trips. I always started to plan the trip using the information I could get from the TripAdvisor. So, I contacted a few highly recommended trekking operators in Bali I found from TripAdvisor but disappointed as I did not get the response despite sending emails to each of them twice. Perhaps they only serve foreign tourists and not locals. I don't know. But Bali Trekking & Tour Guide responded immediately. I was only requested to make a small deposit of $50 via Paypal and settled the rest of the fees when we get picked up for our first trip. The pick-up were on time with two cars which provided us with more than enough space to sit and continued our sleep. At the starting point, the briefing was done like usual and the guides were very friendly. The rest of the hike to to Mt. Agung went well as expected although I need to stress out that the trek is not recommended for the beginners. We have hiked Kinabalu, Rinjani and Semeru and concluded that Mt. Agung is more challenging than those three. On the way down, two of my friends hurt his feet. So after we arrived to the hotel, we discussed and decided to cancel our trip to Mt. Batur and instead do more relaxing activities all together. I emailed Pak Mangku to inform our decision and to my surprise, Pak Mangku offered the full refund for Mt Batur altough I did not ask for it (having understand the terms and conditions) and he actually did not have to obligation to do so. It is purely a good faith of him and for that we really appreciate it. I would not be hesitate to recommend this tour operator to my friends or anyone expecting fast response on questions or concerns."

My only suggestion is to take a head lamp torch to free up one hand in the harder sections. My travelling helper and driver were also very caring.

Well let me tell you, after waiting for 45 minutes in the lobby of our hotel, continually calling the Bali Trekking phone number to no avail, we decided to call it quits and give up on the adventure we'd been waiting all week for. We went back to our room, got out of our hiking gear, crawled back in bed, only to receive a wake up call at 4:30am that our driver had arrived! Are you kidding me!? We said we were not interested in the trek when the driver arrived 1.5 hours late! We emailed the company outraged to which they responded that the \"driver had a flat tire\" and that \"none of their cell phones were working due to a network error\" and that the \"driver left his phone at home\". Seems like a lot of convenient excuses... Don't waste your time or get your hopes up with this company. Take your money and your excitement elsewhere."

This company provided flashlights and water and the breakfast at the top added a great touch to the experience.

We were picked up at our hotel early in the morning by 2 attentive and friendly staff from the trekking tour (Ketut and Waean). Despite being so early in the day (1:40 am) they were filled with energy and really got us excited about our hike. We got to the bottom of the mountain without any hiccups where we also met our guide - Jerro. Jerro was quite the character!!! He's easy going, cheerful and most important confident about his work. Throughout the hike, he assisted us with our climb and made sure we were safe in the dark. Conversing with Jerro kept our spirits high and after about 2 hours, we made it up to the top of the mountain without a scratch. At the top of the mountain, we were greeted with a stunning view that words cannot describe... Even though we were not able to see the sun rise because of cloudy weather, the experience was still spectacular. Jerro cooked up a storm of a breakfast for us, and showed us his ways of cooking eggs using steam generated by the volcano (its a must see!). The weather at the top of the mountain is a bit chilly, so make sure to dress warm!After our filling breakfast and tons of photos, we began our descent. The journey down was less grueling and with our great guide, we joked and laughed our way down. Jerro also had a ton of creative ideas for some awesome photos. Before we knew it, we had made it down to the bottom of the mountain and it was time for our goodbye. We were reunited with our 2 staffs from the trekking tour company, who had spent the morning waiting for us. Somehow they were so energized and accommodating. They stopped by many scenic areas so we could take some great photos. They even gave us a great lunch spot, where they refused our lunch offer and instead waited patiently for us again. After a long journey, we made it back to our hotel feeling tired but at the same time, incredible. Our trip could not have been so enjoyable if it wasn't for our amazing guide and the 2 young men who took us around. Thank you all for making this so fun for us, when we come back next time, we'd love to do this again!!!"

Our driver was on time, polite, and very informative of our trip and Bali. Keep in mind its a very early start to the day so get a goods nights rest and make sure you're hydrated. For the hike, our guide gave us all a flashlight and took us up. It took us probably closer to 2 hours to complete the trek as we needed to take a few stops along the way, but our guide kept a great pace and made sure everyone was comfortable. The view at the top is out of this world breath-taking. Pictures don't do it justice! We had a delicious breakfast of warm banana sandwiches, steamed egg sandwiches, steam eggs, fruit, and hot coffee. Do keep in mind that its a tough hike and proper shoes and clothing are a MUST. We wore running sneakers which were ok but if you can bring hiking boots do it. DO NOT WEAR FLIP FLOPS! Jeans, a long sleeved top, and a light jacket you can put on when you reach the summit are great clothes. It was chilly when we got to the top and our group even said that it would have been nice to have a light pair of gloves for the time we were sitting waiting for the sunrise. The coffee plantation was a nice stop along the way back. Our guide there was very informative and kind. We sampled 7 delicious warm drinks of coffee/hot chocolate/tea all included in our tour price. Be aware that if you want to try the luwak coffee its 50,000IDR a cup but we highly suggest trying it! Our group of 3 shared a cup. They also have a shop where you can purchase their coffee and other goods such as chocolate. Make sure you have IDR on you, a bag of coffee ran us 130,000IDR.

It's easier and more interesting and therefore recommended over the straight up/down walk. Collected at 3:30am from Ubud, back about 3pm. About 45 mins uphill in the dark, which is a bit scarey but manageable, to see the sunrise on the caldera rim. Our walking guide was amazing; and knew about international spirituality and practised as a Hindu and probably other ways. We had a small ceremony at the top at an ancient temple rock, which was very moving. Had our own aircon car with driver and car guide as well. Pricing was ok at $US75 each, and well worth it for the enhanced trek involved (incl. breakfast)."

The guide chose the right speed, made enough breaks and helped when there were bigger steps (my wife had some problems with one knee). On top we got breakfast and enjoyed an amazing sunrise. For the way up the guide chose the track with more stones and steps, for the way down he chose the track with more sand - very good decision!!! All in all really perfect!"

            "review": "Tough hike, but totally worth it!. My husband and I booked the Mt. Batur sunrise trek and hot springs visit and had an amazing time! I feel I should emphasize that this hike is not easy! I have hiked before, and I read several reviews before signing up for this trek, but I don't think I was mentally prepared for how challenging the trek actually was. The path is pitch dark and quite steep in certain parts, so you really have to use your flashlight (provided) and watch your footing. That being said, our tour guide was very helpful and paced us well, and along the way, we were encouraged by the cool mountain air and incredible views of the stars overhead. And of course, the sunrise from the top was gorgeous. Breakfast was plentiful, with volcano-steamed bananas and eggs! Our guide made these into sandwiches for us and also provided a couple energy bars. I noticed that our breakfast platter was much more generous than some provided for people with a different tour company, and we got a couple envious glances. The hike down was also challenging in that some of the terrain was really soft and slippery dirt. But again, there were amazing views on the way down as well.In retrospect, I liked the trek better because it was more challenging than I thought it would be. But do yourself a favor and wear your hiking shoes, as they suggest. I did not, and I slid a lot on the way down and also got my favorite running shoes really dirty.We were really glad to follow the trek with a nice soak in the hot springs. The views of the lake and mountains were beautiful and relaxing. Also, the hot springs place provides you with a locker, showers, towel, and soap - very convenient. I would suggest you bring a pair of flip flops, as the stones around the springs can be rough on your feet, especially after they've been through that trek!All in all, we had a great time!"

The hike up was strenuous, but we started out early and had plenty of time for rest. Our guide did an excellent job of pacing us, and even started a couple small fires along the hike to warm up.The 360 views at the top are simply spectacular. The sunrise was majestic, the cloud cover beautiful, and Mt Batur was grand. Hiking down was TOUGH, much tougher than hiking up. I was continually slipping and falling. WEAR HIKING SHOES. My sneakers did not cut it at all. Even then, our guide with 22+ years of experience often slid down. Be prepared.Overall, extremely highly recommended :)"

My husband and I went on our honeymoon to Bali last month and I booked this sunrise trek on Mount Batur for the last day of our trip. All I can say is that it was one of the best experiences of my life so far! Though I do a lot of walking, I found the second half of the hike quite difficult (like climbing a very steep staircase made of volcanic rock) all the while my new husband bounded around the volcano like a mountain goat. But our guide, Jerro War, was so kind and such a great help - he made sure we stopped every time I needed to catch my breath and ensured that I didn't land on my bum at any point during the hike! The hike up only took around 1 hour 45 minutes and it felt so rewarding to reach the top. The sunrise was breathtaking, having ascended the volcano in complete darkness, and Jerro War cooked us a tasty breakfast using steam generated by the volcano (AMAZING!) The hike down was also brilliant - we stopped off to feed some monkeys halfway down, and Jerro War gave us some great insights into Balinese culture. He also took some really special pictures for us at all of the different viewing stations. I couldn't recommend this more!"

We booked our trek directly through the company and paid a very reasonable amount for the trek $130 including transport, trek and breakfast and overall had an amazing day. The view are breath-taking and the guides extremely helpful.However, there are a few things I wish we'd be told before starting. Firstly, it isn't the easiest of treks with the last half hour scrambling up rocks in the dark, i'd advise wearing actual trekking shoes over trainers and bringing a pole. Also beware that it is freezing at the top so a fleece is definitely advisable. We were two women doing the trek and found the start of the trek quite un-nerving. Our driver dropped us off in an empty car-park where there no other tourist, signs to the mountain or company or briefing about the trek. In the car park we were met by our guide and taken to the start of the trek which happened to be in pitch black woods. Although, we were sure it was safe it made us very nervous especially as we got the impression we'd be with other tourist. Things only got worse when we arrived at a hut and were greeted by more local, unsure of what to expect or what we were doing we felt very unsafe. It took us 45 minutes before we saw other tourists and felt safe.Although, it was fine and our guide was brilliant (if maybe a bit forward at times) we wish we'd be told about this or giving a briefing so we knew what to expect.With in mind we'd highly recommend this over all."

Putu and Basek were our drivers and also very helpful.The 2am wake up call is well worth it, and the trek is quite easy as long as you are active. We were a bit unlucky as the sunrise was shielded by a lot of cloud cover but Radia insisted we waited a little longer than the other groups and that was well worth our while as eventually the sun appeared! He showed us all around the top of the Volcano and was eager to explain everything to us. We even watched our eggs being cooked in the hot rocks of the Volcano. Hot springs were beautiful but DON\u2019T eat at the restaurant. It gave me a bad case of Bali belly for days. Not worth it \u2013 eat after!"

We booked yesterday last minute on Balitrekkingtour.com, they picked us in our hotel at 2.30 am and at 3.30 we were ready to start our trekking to mount Batur with our great guide Adik.The trekking is easy to do. Before to book I searched a lot on the web to understand how difficult it was, because my wife suffers vertigo. In the end we decided to go anyhow and it has been fantastic.We are a reasonably fit and we did it in 1h40 to the top, instead of 2 standard hours.On the top the view is amazing but it all depends from the fog, it comes and it goes in few seconds and it is impossible to know in advance if you will find it. For us it was great, one of the best landscape and sunrise of my life - really gorgeous view.The real difference between booking through Balitrekkingtour and going with the compulsory guides is the size of the group, the way up and the place where you stop to see the sunrise. We paid 130 usd for 2 instead of 500K rupies but the route and the place up were not crowded so I strongly advice to spend some more money and get the best out of this experience.Once we saw the sunset our guide Adik proposed us to do a longer way to go down passing closer to the latest eruption. We ended up walking 6 hours through the mountains having a fantastic time together.All in all I strongly recommend this activity and Balitrekkingtour!!!"

We felt safe and it was a really good challenge. The breakfast was great - many of the other groups were just given slices of bread and hard boiled eggs cooked on the volcano, but we got a full platter of balinese chocolate bars, cooked bananas, seasonal fruit, as well as the hard boiled eggs. We cannot say enough good things about the drivers - it turned out they lived in Ubud (where we had to go after our trek), so they offered to drive us there saving us a lot in taxi money. They also stopped off and let us grab lunch at a nice restaurant in Ubud. Very personable and friendly.This was one of the highlights of our trip, and I'd highly recommend this company."

The trek was magical - the night sky filled with countless stars, the view from the top of Mount Batur, the volcanic steam that provided some relief from the cold, eggs cooked from the warmth of the active volcano, banana sandwiches for the energy much needed and more... So, thanks to Radiah and the team! You guys are amazing."

And especially seeing the hot rocks where they cook the eggs. I totally recommend doing the trek.I was just really disappointed with this company. There was only me and my girlfriend the day we went, so I would have expected the guide to go slow enough for both of us to keep up, but instead he rushed us past heaps of other walkers, even though my girlfriend was struggling with the climb. When we reached the top (first out of all the groups) it turned out we had over an hour to wait before sunrise. Even the groups that climbed really slowly got there in time.There is very little that I can see that is different between all these trekking companies - I expected that because this one was a bit more expensive it would be better, but turns out the opposite is true. Ultimately, there is a very small area at the top, so everyone ends up together anyway - no guides seemed to know the spots any better than others.Overall, definitely worth doing the trek, but perhaps with a different guide."

Feel the heat of it through fissures and cracks and see the steam rising from far away !!! its just a total different experience. And all these becomes simply superb when you have awesome people with you to guide you.Guys came to pick up from our hotel in the night and dropped us from where the trek starts. and from there a local guide will help you to reach the top !!!People are highly experienced in their work and they put in their full effort to make your adventure the best experience!!!I would thank our guide Jerro War for all his help and motivation to reach the top. For this was my first hiking ever. He is one of the friendliest person I have ever seen :) and I would like to thank him for all the lovely pictures he took of me and my family !!!

I would suggest every one take the Hot spring bath also because its such a wonderful relaxing experience to swim in the hot water bath .Loved It"

Our guide was very experienced and was able to advise us on the best route to take (we trekked up the east face, so that even if we didn't manage to reach the summit in time, we would still be able to watch the sunrise from the side of the volcano). He was also very patient, and was able to move at a comfortable pace. The trek was challenging, but not impossible. The reward at the end was priceless. Be prepared as it can get quite cold up there especially with the wind. Breakfast at day break 1717m from sea level. Imagine that!The whole tour took a good 12 hours, from 0130hrs in the morning. The drive back to Seminyak was also rather long (2hours?) but our driver was very nice to stop along the way to take some photos for us, and also bring us to a nice place for Babi Guling (grilled pork). Definitely worth booking a tour with them."

First class service from the start all the way till the end. A rough breakdown of my whole experience. Our driver Putu picked us up at 2am in the morning. Early and enthusiastic, he greeted us with a warm smile. Very proficient in English, we had conversation throughout the trip from Legian all the way to Ubud. The best driver in Bali you can ever find. If you need a tour around Bali, you can contact him too! Back to the topic, they are well prepared for the trekking trip. they have prepared water for us during the trek. When we arrived at the base of the mountain, it was freezing cold. So it's advisable to bring extra clothing such as a jacket and wear trekking pants. A good pair of trekking shoes is advisable as the hike up was be filled with slippery roads. That's where we met our guide too, his name is Nyoman. We were lucky enough to have met two guides who are very proficient in English. A knowledgeable guide, he guide us every step along the way to the mountain peak ensuring safety and ample rest. Now for the highlight of the adventure. THE PEAK! We reached the peak at approximately 5.30am and the sun is not up yet. So we waited for about an hour for the sun to rise. Finally, the sun slowly starts to emerge and my jaw literally dropped to the ground. I was awed by it's beauty. One word to describe it, magnificent. The view was breathtaking and all the hike up Mount Batur was definitely worth it. If you are thinking of giving up halfway, trust me. Grid your teeth and pull through because the view up was AMAZING! After taking a few photos here and there, we get to see the steam coming out from some holes along Mount Batur. It was truly amazing. Breakfast was also provided on the peak too. Banana bread coupled along with eggs and hot tea just makes the whole scene perfect as it was rather cold at the peak. Then, our guide Nyoman began explaining the history behind the volcano and some basic information about it. Being very experienced for years, he is the one guide you would want to have. After which, it was time to head down and Nyoman gave us three routes down. We took the route which allows us to trek along the whole volcano and see many more beautiful sites. Although it would take an hour more to trek down compared to the old route, it was truly worth it. Trust me, going down is much less tiring compared to trekking up. If you are someone who loves the adrenaline rush through your veins, you can tell Nyoman and just RUN DOWN THE MOUNTAIN!! that's what we did! and my oh my i never thought that trekking would be so fun! I would just like to say thank you so much to the awesome driver Putu and the best guide Nyoman. They are truly genuine and provide world class services throughout!"

The drivers we had to take us to Mt Batur were friendly and polite. Our guide Patu was really great - I had food poisoning on the way up the mountain and he was so helpful. We didn't quite make it to the top but he got us to a spot where we still got to see the gorgeous sunrise. The hot springs were heaven to relax in after the hike and had idyllic views. Definitely recommend this company and this trip as long as you're not fussed about being tired the next day!"

The tour was really well organised and punctual. Our guide for the trek , Carmadi or Mr Mountain to us was very patient and extremely informative, giving us a history of the volcano and the dates it has erupted.The view at the top was awesome and well worth the hard climb up. Would definitely recommend"

Booking was simple and all e-mail inquiries were answered very quickly (often within minutes). The drivers were right on time and pleasant to chat with during our 2 hour car ride to the mountain. Our guide spoke English very well, was knowledgeable about the area and hiking in general, and was obliging and friendly. Although my partner made it to the top, I got sick half-way up and I can't thank our guide enough for taking care of me. He made a fire to sit around and gave me tea and snacks and waited very patiently until I felt well enough to head back down. He arranged for my partner to head up with another group that was coming up so at least one of us would see the top! On the way down I told him I enjoyed taking pictures of insects so he took the time to find me different species and explain what they were. I would definitely recommend this company!"

Our guide was so helpful and had so much local knowledge. We were the first to arrive at the top and watching the sunrise was an unforgettable experience. If you're fit you can get to the summit in 1.5hrs like us, but others took it alot more slowly, especially those in groups. If you get a chance to do this trek, I can't recommend it enough. It was all seamless with the driver picking us up to the guide meeting us. We took the long way down across the ridge and it was stunning.

During our 13 days visit in Bali, we used Bali Trekking Tour for both driver service and sunrise trekking tour. Altogether we were with them for 5 days (3 days driver service and 2 days trekking tour). We definitely cannot explain enough in words of how amazing our trip was!First of all, let me give a big thanks and credit to our 2 beloved Balinese;1. Putu- Our driver/guide 2. Mengku- Our trekking guide  I don't think I have to explain so much more about how beautiful and fun the trek was as many travelers here have done a great job already.The one thing I have to highlight is;I have to say that the best thing about this trip is our guides. They did not make us feel like a traveler/tourist but instead like a family/friend. Through out the whole trip they have tried their very best and in every way they can to ensure that we had an amazing time as if we are family. If I have to list everything down then it would probably take up all space in this page. By the end of the trip, we had an unforgettable journey, two amazing Balinese friends and the kind of service that touched our hearts, that we have no hesitation but to spread the words that the company and their people deserved. Thank You & All The Best,Peach&Note :-)"

Then we were given a torch and asked to follow our local guides who had excellent English. The track is 3.5Km long and climbs 700m. After 1.5 hours climbing we reached the first lookout point, which we decided was enough. The hot breakfast was welcome as it was very cold up here. The sunrise was beautiful. We could see the sun rise over the ocean and the mountains. We then went and saw the steam come out of the mountain and looked down the crater. Some monkeys came to investigate us and we took lots of photos of the mothers and baby monkeys. The climb down was MUCH easier than the climb up and we talked to our guide about the local area during the 2 hour walk down. REALLY WORTH THE EFFORT but I would like to have been fitter as the climb up was exhausting."

A little late on the review but absolutely needed to write bc my tour guide was unreal.Decided to do the early morning trek with my gf up Mt. Batur. My experience was everything written in the other reviews \u2013 amazing way to spend the morning, and the icing on the cake was our tour guide, Jerro War.Tour started with a pick up at our hotel around 3am. Early but we slept most of the 2 hour ride to the mountain, where we met up with our guide, Jerro. We immediately started the trip in the dark through the jungle/forest. Cool experience seeing a temple dimly lit in the jungle in the pitch dark of the night.Jerro went above and beyond for us. He had the type of knowledge of the area that only comes with living in there and did an excellent job turning a challenging hike into a fun experience. We had some good laughs and built a solid bond throughout the day. Jerro understood how amazed/appreciative we were with the sights and never once rushed us at any point when we sat to take in the sights or snap a picture. The most important part of the trip for him was safety which was followed closely by making sure we got what we wanted out of the trip. We could tell he was a special person when we noticed that he discretely stopped to feed the local dogs at the top of the mountain and another at the bottom (something he does every day with leftover food from the trekkers). We asked and he mentioned he does it every day he hikes. Good dude.Some notes:-We opted to go to the top of the mountain first (not crater area) - Jerro recommended based on our fitness level. If you go the other route, I don't think you can go to the top bc of timing of routes.-Wear hiking or running shoes in absence of former. You will be walking up and down jagged volcanic rock.-Don\u2019t underestimate the brisk weather at the top. Our sweating turned to uncomfortable shivers when we reached the summit.-Definitely try to catch the monkeys. This was a highlight as the pack was hanging around the Mt. Batur marker overlooking the crater. Pretty surreal moment with the monkeys sitting all around us as Jerro took pictures of us sitting next to the sign.Overall, unreal experience and just another add on to the already healthy list of glowing reviews for the trekking company.Thanks, Jerro!Ryan"

The first day, we hired a private car to drive us to Ubud and the neighboring area from our hotel in Kuta. Petu was our driver, and he was wonderful! He was always right on time picking us up from our various stops and he recommended a number of awesome attractions that we didn't have on our itinerary. He also guided us during a few of the attractions and explained various aspects of the temples, etc. The second day we used Bali Trekking was for the hike of Mt Batur. Again, Petu was our driver and picked us up promptly at 1:40am to drive us to the base of the volcano. There we met Jero, our PHENOMENAL hiking guide. This trip would not have been the same without him, he was hilarious and so fun to talk to and hike with at 3:30 in the morning. He was hands down the best guide I've ever had for anything, I would definitely suggest that you request him for your hike if you want someone who's both extremely experienced and knowledgable but really fun and lightheaded as well. After the hike, Petu drove us to a great coffee plantation and an art village before we headed back to our hotel. Overall, it was an outstanding experience and I highly recommend Bali Trekking."

This trip was the main highlight for our trip to Bali.It was never a plan to hike in Bali as we were foreign to that country.Upon stumbling onto this trekking company we had made last minute plans. The person I was aliasing was Mangku, he was patient and detailed to my queries. He too took initiative to tell me about the weather and temperature upon climbing,transportation was provided for us even though we are staying far off from the place and a pretty hard to find location.Our Guide Radia was knowledgeable,friendly, patient and very funny.He welcomed us upon our arrival at the base of the climb and told us story about the volcano we were climbing, his wide vast of knowledge to the volcano awed me and my other two climbing partners as we absorbed the history of the past that has happened around the volcano and other parts of the volcano we could see from where we descend.Radia was really kind to look after us asking if we require to take water breaks and always there to loan a helping hand to guide me and my climbing partners up steep tracks and always looking out for our safety.Upon reaching the summit he immediately head off to cook out egg and bananas for breakfast in the steam a distance away from where we were located , he told us to enjoy the sunrise while he offered coffee on the house. he took the initiative to offer taking the DSLR from my partner and took really beautiful photos for us even while we were descending.He offered lots of option for our descending route to explore a little more to see other parts of the old active volcanoes (that was where we learn the history of the erupted volcanoes in the past).Radia patiently guide us through the rough trek and rescheduled the driver to pick us up at another location instead. we went through the rice field and saw another side of Bali where people are actually working in a farm.Radia too told us he is actually a farmer and he grows vegetables for himself and the family.We sadly had to depart after we have reached the bottom and Radia brought us back to the driver where we had to say our good byes. Me and my climbing partners enjoyed Mt Batur and we promised to come back to look for him again. Our driver then headed us to the coffee plantation where we were filled with knowledgeable guide telling us all about coffee beans and how it was grown.farmed, roasted.The driver and his co driver was really patient to bring us out for lunch which was not included in the itinerary, they brought us to a beautiful Bali eat out where it overlooks the paddy field and consumed our babi guling. Unfortunately both of them are vegetarian hence they could not join us, & ended our day with a bang. They brought us back to our apartment safely and said our good byes.We want to say thank you for bringing us around Bali, patiently guided us and spent additional time without a complain. We love the guide that you have assigned to us Radia, he is a wonderful guide and we are thankful& grateful for this trekking company to show us the other side of Bali from the summit.We love it and we will look forward to see you guys again.

Here the restaurant was alittle bit overrun with tourists, but the meal ok. Absolutely amazing! Visiting the crafts villages was a litte bit disappointing, because we were mainly taken to art shops. But the people in the shops stayed friendly, although we didn' buy anything, so it was ok.

My guide, Iwayan was very helpful, he called the driver to see if it may have dropped out of my pocket in the car. It hadn't, so we walked all the way down the trail looking for it. Ketut then called to say that he had found it in the car park, on the ground!! How lucky for me! And great that both Ketut and Iwayan helped me find it.Then of course, back up the trail again! Iwayan took me the first flat part by motorbike. This meant that if we just hiked a little faster we would still make the summit by sunrise...just! It was a little cloudy but still very beautiful.The way down was a little slippery in places but not too bad. The views are magnificent! On the way back to Ubud, we stopped at a plantation, where they grow coffee and cocoa, amongst other things. The people there are so lovely and very informative. At first I was not so keen to go there but I am so glad that I did. They also let you taste all the coffee, chocolate and teas. As I went alone, I had to pay a supplement.

I forget the cold night and the two vertical kilometers of climbing to get here. It is a magical moment to be at the top. I had not realised it would be possible to see the entire island of Bali in one view, as if I was in space.And this is not all. When I started the hike, I had no idea about the conditions at the top, but it turns out that the highest part of the summit ridge is a steep path of loose ash and small rocks. I pull a pair of small skis from my backpack and ski down the highest 100 meters of the mountain. There is no record anyone else ever been equally crazy, so this must be the first descent from the 3000 meter Gunung Agung on skis.And I am grateful for the mountain to be kind to us today. The night had been clear, the morning clouds were pushed away by the sun, the crater beneath us was beautiful but silent. The volcano is active, however. The 1963 eruption was a disaster for Bali. On our way up, we keeping showing our respect to the holy mountain. Every few hundred meters there's a a silent moment. Flowers. Burning incense. A small gift. Funnily enough, Oreo cookies were a popular gift. Or even small amount of money as bills. And the climb itself is interesting. The environment around the summit ridge is special. Walking here is very easy, as the ridge consists largely of solidified ash. The material looks like rock, but feels like rubber. Soft, with a good grip. Above 2500 meters we had to climb a few hundred meters by crawling over rocks. But as we started the climb from the Pura Besakih temple around 1000 meters, most of the climb went through jungle. And what a climb that was! The way to the mountain is a hiking path rather than a climbing route, but a very steep one. For the two kilometers of vertical we did only 12 kilometers horizontally. Much of the jungle portion was so steep that walking was not really possible. We held on to tree roots and lianas to hold ourselves on the steep dirt paths. In fact, lianas had been setup for much of the route, as if they had been fixed ropes. I had not used lianas for climbing before, and I was surprised how strong yet soft and easy to grab they were. Much preferred over ropes...Around 2200 meters the jungled turned into an open, savannah-like area. Except that the savannah was at a steep incline.The climb is long. I knew I would not have the energy to start climbing in the evening and climb through the night; so we left early and carried camping gear to set up base camp at 2600 meters. But I ended up not getting too many hours of sleep, staring at Bali's lights below in the clear night. And when I tried to sleep, the wind picked up momentarily to make me wonder if my tent would hold in place. Even as I was inside. The tent held on, but the wind noise kept me awake.I used Bali Trekking & Tour as guides for the trip, and can warmly recommend them."

It was the highlight of our trip, the views were amazing and having breakfast cooked from the steam of the volcano was a very different experience.The trek can be steep in places, so if you don't trek all the time it can be a bit of a push to get to the top but it is well worth it. Our driver was not our guide for the trek which we were not aware of, we saw a man in the bushes when we got to our starting point which turned out to be our guide. I was a little apprehensive at first as we had spent an hour with our driver getting to know him to then be dropped off in the dark with someone we never met. It is very safe and our guide was great, he hikes it up to 4 times a week.You will no doubt be walking with other guides and tourists, although we were left alone at the top for ages to enjoy the start of the sunrise.We then went to a coffee plantation where we tasted different home made coffees, teas and chocolate.

The tour also provided snacks like chocolate bars, cookies, bread and bottles of water. The descent was my favorite part. The mist and view was just so amazing. We had to slide down some parts of soft black sand which was fun. It was so much more relaxing than climbing up, though my ankles got a little achey. It took us around 5 hours in total. After that my bladder was almost about to burst, so be careful to hydrate but not drink too much as there are no toilets while trekking (besides the bushes).

We set it up for (3) me, my wife, and 10 year old son. The driver picked us up in a clean van in Symanek (south side of island early in the morning) for the 2 hr drive to Batur. He was \"very safe\" and able to speak some English. He also had some facts to share on our way. They supplied us with water, flashlights and walking sticks if we wanted. The guide went at whatever pace we dictated and was very helpful in some of the tougher parts of the climb. Our 10 yr old only had to rest a few times as we ascended, but he is a pretty good climber. Be aware that some places are steep, but if you take your time and are in good condition for climbing a 45 deg hill, then there will be no problem. The rocks are sharp in some places and the trails are narrow and sometimes it is very sandy and slippery. Bring good hiking shoes to be safe. The guide was very informative and was able to converse in english, especially when giving facts and dates about the volcano and viallges in the area. We really liked him a lot. Overall it was everything they stated and we felt very safe with the driver and guide and the view was beyond expectations. The sunrise was worth it!!"

            "review": "Trekking Mt Agung. This was an excellent experience. We were picked up on time by a friendly driver and tour guide. Ketut is also a priest and gave us a personal tour of the Agung Temple and led us in an informal blessing/prayer - an intimate glimpse into Balinese spirituality. Our guide Made was fantastic - she kept the pace going but also knew when we were struggling and was supportive. The trail is rigorous, not just the steepness but because these are natural trail (e.g not maintained). There are regularly 2 ft steps up and the bottom has also 1-2 ft mini ravines in the trail from erosion, so take it seriously, especially the hike back down. But it's so worth it. The sunrise, views, and monkeys greeting us in the morning were spectacular. Suksma (thank you)!!! Flossie"

            "review": "They Tried Their Very Best. I recently organized an event in Bali for a group of top management meeting and hired Ketut & his gang to handle all the transfer for our guests. Though they are not big, they give their very best to my ever changing demand. Adding and subtracting car hire at last minute can be a nightmare when you are talking about movement for 70 people, but the key contact person, Putu, though with limited English, did not screw up any crazy demand. With his team, Oky, Jesse and others I can't recall the names, Putu did an excellent job. They are always punctual at arriving and make sure everyone on the list provided are transferred safely and provided me with updates. I did not organize any tour of Bali with them but seeing how the group operate and coordinate with each other, I have all the confidence in them to make a memorable trip."

            "review": "Thrilling sunrise view from Mount Agung. Chose a more adventurous holiday in Bali and so decided on a crazy idea to climb Mount Agung, however, there are a couple of operators doing that and my friend were not sure which operator provides a reliable and decently priced service. In the end we were glad to have picked Bali Trekking & Tour Guide Day Tours whom the boss Mr Ketut Merta has been very forthcoming in making the trek smooth and successful. The arrangement was done rather last minute via email but Mr Ketut has been prompt in replying and turning up punctually in person at our hotel to pick us. The guide provided by his company was a cheerful, fantastic young lady who lives around the area and very familiar with the trail up to the peak. She has been helpful and patient along the way. The climb has been challenging, starting at 2am with moderate wind and 45 degrees rock-climbing style type of ascend after the treeline, so beginners may have some difficulties. Views along the trek and from the peak have been most memorable and thrilling as you look back and wonder how you actually got up the mountain! What impressed me about this company is that we only paid after we got down after a 8 hours trek and even received a souvenir from Mr Ketut who waited for us at the end point. Overall a reliable, easy going and good operator, would look for them again when I go back to Bali for more adventures."
