We were also taken from the base up to the Big Buddha by bus, saving considerable walking up stairs. The Buddha and statues surrounding it were very interesting, as were the paintings and displays inside the Buddha. The views back down to Po Lin Monastery were also very good. This was a fun day out."

I wish I had done more research on the Big Buddha before heading that way, we only gave ourselves 2-3 hours for the entire trip and we were quite rushed. Do yourself a favor and give yourself enough time to explore the Buddha, monastery, the shops, and walk around all the other places once you get off the cable car"

However it requires some physical effort to walk up the numerous steps to get close to the statue, especially on a hot summer day. There are cable cars going up to the site but one still has to walk up the stairs to see the statue at close range."

I'm not a big fan of heights so opted not to have the glass bottom cable car - it was one of the smoothest rides I've ever experienced in one! Once we were up at the top, it was a quick walk over to see the Buddha and have a wander around the grounds - it was really nice up there, which was helped by having such great weather."

It sits atop a mountain looking out to the Lantau Monastery, and you reach it by a long flight of steps - right-hand side going up, left-hand side coming down. You can go to nearby the foot of the steps by a variety of means - bus, car etc - but the most spectacular is the cable car from Tung Chung MTR terminal. This sweeps you over the sea and up and over a mountain, performing a couple of right-angle bends on the way. Don't go in a crystal cabin if you have height-related conditions! And be prepared to queue - one of the many interminable HK snakes. The rewards are fantastic!"

            "review": "An absolute must-see on your trip to HK, but not great to get to.. Big Buddha is definitely one of the places that every traveler to HK must visit. While getting out there is a bit obnoxious (which is why I gave this activity 4 stars), the site of Big Buddha and the nearby monastery is pretty amazing. The only negative to Lantau Island and getting to Big Buddha is the Disneyland-like line to get onto the cable car to get there. We went pretty early and still waited at least a half an hour in line to get onto the car (and then it took another 30 minutes or so to get to the location where Big Buddha is). We paid a little extra for the \"premium car\". After spending about 30 minutes trying to figure out the difference between the cable cars and thinking we had been duped, we finally figured out that the difference is that the premium cars have a glass bottom, where you can see everything going on underneath you. This was worth it, as it allowed us to see hiking trails and other things that we would probably not have seen. And the cable car is worth it because the view of Big Buddha when you drop over the other side of the mountain is breathtaking.Overall, we didn't spend much time at Big Buddha, but still found it worth the trip. Had we known about all the cool hiking trails, we probably would have made it an all-day adventure and hiked there. Next time.Even though the \"vibe\" of the whole adventure isn't great because of the long lines, commercialism and the Disneyland feel, it's still a great thing to see. The Big Buddha statue is truly stunning and the monastery is amazingly beautiful. Go early on a weekday so you can avoid the crowds."

You can take a bus or the tram to the site and I would suggest taking the tram. But make sure you either book the ticket in advance or buy from one of the guys on the street to skip the long line.

The tour takes you to a small fishing village with shops stocking all sorts of dried seafoods and then to the Big Buddha. Included is also a vegan Chinese lunch at the nearby monastery. Think twice if you are scared of heights as the journey back to your tour bus to your hotel is the Ngong Ping Cable car over the mountains - 5.7km and 25mins on the skyrail."

To get the cable car go to Tung Chung station exit b, cut across the square and you'll see the entrance. First car is 10am on a week day and I recommend you get there early to avoid queues and it'll also be quieter at the top. The cable car is good and make sure you download the free audio guide with the free wifi at the cable car station. Ngong ping village is a bit commercial but when you get to the Buddha it's incredibly beautiful. There's a great view and you feel peaceful whilst you're there. The monastery is also worth a visit."

The cable car to Ngong Ping Village and the Buddha leaves from Tung Chung station. After seeing the Buddha we took the 21 bus to Tai O (20 minutes), and from there the 11 bus back to Tung Chung (50 minutes). The scenery and vegetation are fascinating. Ngong Ping village verges on tacky, but the Big Buddha sitting in splendour on the hill above makes up for it. Tai O is not picturesque, in spite of lovely surroundings so visitors should manage expectations. Worth a visit for the scenery. We left Hong Kong, Nathan Road area, at 10 am and returned at 5 pm."

This attraction can be seen as you are flying into the HK airport but you gotta go and climb the 268 steps to truly experience this. The view from the top is great and seeing the Buddha up close is definitely an experience. They have a monastery before going up to see Big Buddha which allows you purchase incense and money sheet for an in-depth experience. They also have a set meal that you can purchase to experience vegetarian dishes. We skipped out on that however we bought some vegetarian snacks nearby. They were 5 HK dollar each. They were good and paying for food here seems like we are somewhat contributing to a good cause. We rode the cable cart to the town and back which lasted 20 minutes each way. The view was exceptional. We didn't do the glass floor but now thinking about it, it would have been a better experience riding the crystal glass cart. Also go early to avoid long congested lines which we saw as we left the station by 1:30 pm."

You can reach this place via cable car which in itself is an extraordinary passage to make, or by ferry passed several little islands which is also a good way to see the surrounding waters of Hong Kong island. When you arrive at Lantau Island you can take a short bus ride up to the site of the Tian Tan Buddha. There is a small village of shops restaurants stalls and then a stroll through gardens to the Buddha and monastery. As most places in the region it is a place of beauty and tranquillity even on a busy day with lots of visitors it remains true to dignity and peace. The steps up to the Buddha are many and the climb is steep but it is the sort of staircase that commands great views and so one can take time to make the climb and rise to the statue in all its glory."

We took one of the deals and immediately we were taken to the cashier's counter and straight onto the front of the queue. The price was the same as the deals I had seen on the web.The cable car ride is fantastic and you get to see lots of sites as you \"sail\"up to top.We took the tour that included, tea tasting, visit to the fishing village and boat ride and a guided tour around the Buddha and Temple. Not at all physical unless you choose to walk the steps up to the Buddha.Ngong Ping village is the cable car turnaround point and is tourist style in nature, but in a pleasant way. The ticket also got us head of line return, so no waiting.Ideal for all age groups"

I bought a package thru the Big Bus tours which allowed me to skip the much read about long lines at the lift. Believe it or not, but I went on a Saturday and expected really bad lines but they weren't bad at all(no really). I don't know if I'd try that again though. If you like hiking(not rough, tough hiking as there's a paved path), there's a path up to the top and around the area. I'm not sure how long they would take but could see it down below the cable car. There's a monastery at the top that's definitely worth a look(well, OK, many looks) with an area outside for followers to burn incense(it does smell nice but may be overpowering for others). You'll have many chances for picturesque photos both of the surrounding area, the Big Buddha, and the monastery. There's a little shopping village that you walk thru to get to the Big Buddha that has some small karate shows and food places. Plan on going early as there's plenty to do. You'll be outside most of the time so pick your day accordingly. It's cooler since it's up in the mountains and had a good breeze the day I went."

From the city, go to Central Station and board the Tung Chung train (orange line), ride to the end. Approximately $29 HKD and a bit less than an hour travel one way. Follow the signs to Nong Ping 360.From Tung Chung, you can ride a bus around Lantau Island to the site, ride a cable car or hire a taxi. The cable car is by far the most fun, however.If you can plan ahead, purchase cable car tickets online or at a travel agency and you will avoid lines that can run up to 1 1/2 hours to board the cable car to the top. There are two types of cable cars, one with a plexiglass floor and the othe a standard metal floor. In my opinion, the views out the windows are breathtaking enough without needing to pay the surcharge for the see through floor. Also, be careful of ticket sellers around the cable car terminal that will offer tickets. In some cases, the tickets are very good forgeries, but the scanners for the cable car are able to identify forgeries and you will be refused. Nong Ping 360 has warned that tickets not purchased from a real vendor will not be honored.There is a Buddist monastery along with shopping at the top.To reach the Big Budda, no matter which transportation you use from ground level, you will climb about 100 steps, so be prepared and wear comfortable shoes. There are terraces along the way up so short breaks can be taken along the way.As it sits on the top of a mountain, be careful going on a day with low clouds, as you may get in them at the top and lose the scenic views. As the cars are suspended from overhead wires, the cable car operation is stopped in high winds or significant weather after off loading passengers, so make a review of the weather before starting out.Site is also a fun diversion if you have some hours transiting the Hong Kong Airport with long hours between flights."

Just a side note if your not great with heights then this might not be the attraction for you as you are very high off the ground although you do feel very secure as there is very little movement from wind etc. The Buddha itself is very impressive and the views from the top are stunning. Please note that the climb up the stairs is very steep and in the humidity can be quite draining but trust me it is so worth it. My advise is to make sure you have water with you and to stop on the way up to enjoy the view."

The Buddha itself is auite impressive and humbling at the same time. Thviews are out of this world. Coming back to the plaza, you will see cattle roaming the streets.

The 5.7km cable car ride to the top is very scenic and just as enjoyable as seeing the Buddha itself. If there is cloud around your view will be limited. The string of shops leading to the Buddha are somewhat out of place, and tend to sell very similar things. There are a few temples to look at as well as climbing the steps to the top to see the Big Buddha. The steps are not too steep, and there are handrails. Not dissimilar to the steps leading to the Buta Caves in KL. A good view from the top, and the statue is impressive and imposing. We only spent a few hours in total for the round trip, which was ample. The basic price for the cable car was $185HKD per adult, access to the Buddha when you get there is free."

If you are comfortable with a substantial cable car ride then take the MTR to Lantau (last stop on the line) and catch the cable car. The only negative for me is that it was quite windy and the wind was \"howling\" around our gondola so I changed my mind about making the return trip on the cable car. The big reveal of the Big Buddha comes near the end of the ride and it is an appropriate high moment to end your ride! It is not a long walk to the Buddha or monastery, and amazingly you pass Starbucks along the way! I did not think initially that I would walk all the way up the many steps but pacing myself, I did get to the top and enjoyed not only the achievement, but the view! Once you have done that, you will enjoy the monastery's more pacific scenery. We altered our plans due to the wind and therefore took the bus down to the ferry, and then the ferry to Central. It was a nice and leisurely way to visit Lantau making it a relaxing day trip! Unlike Cat Street, Ladder Street and ManPo Temple which were all disappointing, this is truly a trip worth making while in Hong Kong!"

Bus fare are exact, and no change will be given!It was easy to find the bus terminal from the airport and all buses are equipped with storage for luggage if you have one. Take bus S1 to Tung Chung terminal (the last stop). From there, take bus 23, which is an hour's ride to the attraction. The journey although long was interesting with some beautiful scenery.I got to the Big Buddha attraction just about 10am, which was early, and before the crowds. It was just nice to walk about, and enjoy the peace and quiet of the place. The place was very clean despite being a tourist attraction. The place was well maintained. As I was alone, the selfie stick was my partner and I got a lot of nice shots. Just about 100 metres across from the entrance, is the Ngong Ping village, which has a lot of eateries and all the trappings for the tourists - souvenir shops, Starbucks, etc. The Ngong Ping 360 cable car station is also there. By the time I finished my walkabout, the exodus of tourists came, which was about 11am. The place comes alive then, but this is also when you won't get pics without someone walking into it.

I was not able to physically make the climb to the top of the 238+ stairs, but I could see the Buddha from below, and while the rest went up, I went to the movie about Buddha and his enlightenment. I really learned a lot in the movie, but beware if you have seizure issues because there are strobe lights flashing at times. There were souvenir stores aplenty, but I thought the chop stick store was unique with so many options! I also went to the tea shop for a free demonstration with Vivienne, and it was my favorite thing I've done in Hong Kong so far! The blooming flower tea fascinated me (and tasted great), and I tried 2 other flavored teas, as well. They have a place for you to sit and enjoy a pot of tea that you can purchase, but they also have all kinds of tea and beautiful tea sets to purchase.

A part of the Ngong Ping 360 experience, this and Po Lin Monastery are not to be missed. I think many people confuse this with the village which tends to be more touristy, but walk past the shops for 15 minutes and you are completely overwhelmed in the beauty of the Big Buddha.I would recommend visitors pay the small donation fee for entry into Tian Tan Buddha, that includes an option of snack or meal at Po Lin Monastery following. Tian Tan Buddha is magnificent, truly in every sense of the word beautiful, incredible and inspiring. 268 steps from the bottom, each step draws Tian Tan Buddha in closer and the views of the surrounding area are breathtaking. On a weekday at 1030am, I found many visitors went to the top step, took a handful of photos and left the immediate area. You are missing out on so much beauty, and there are great vantage points from every angle of Tian Tan Buddha. Inside (if you paid the fee) there is a beautiful staircase and what I can best describe as memorial tiles. These white tiles have a photograph and what I would assume is the person's life and legacy, very touching and personal. I did not expect this within Tian Tan Buddha, and it really made this experience even more powerful. I have seen may tour operators offer this as a package. In my opinion as I did, it can be done solo or with the family. I would only use a private tour guide if you are attempting to see multiple areas of Hong Kong within a short amount of time, and you are willing to bypass 50% of Ngong Ping experience. I spent a little over a hour specifically at Tian Tan Buddha and found that appropriate before moving onto nearby Po Lin Monastery. My visit also coincided with fog and a light rain that day. Do not worry, I found this may have kept crowds away and personally the weather added a special ambiance to the experience. A highlight of my three days in Hong Kong, you will not regret any amount of time at Tian Tan Buddha."

The size of the Buddha is incredible. Depending on the crowds you may be able to stop every so often on your way up and take some photos. Once you get to the top there is a restroom and you get a great view of the Monastery and the landscape. You don't necessarily have to climb all the steps to enjoy the trip and you can also enjoy it if you make it halfway to the top.

The cable car ride was spectacular even though it was quite foggy when we travelled. The cable car options are bewildering but we went for a simple return ticket which cost about GBP18 each, which is not advertised anywhere. At the top of the cable car is the fake village which is very commercialised. On approaching the big budda we bought tickets for GBP10 each that gave us entry inside the budda and a free lunch in the monastery. In hindsight I wish we hadn't paid out as it was actually free to go up to the budda, just not inside. Also the lunch was plentiful but tasted awful to British palettes!The monastery is very pretty but the whole experience feels hugely commercialised with constant tricks and pressure to pay for ticket options that you just don't need or even understand that you are buying.We had a good time, my one suggestion would be to buy a simple return ticket for the cable car only and don't waste your money on anything else!"

But, probably not worth paying the extra for the glass floor as you will more than likely be too busy looking out of the windows to notice the floor. Once up in the clouds it's a pleasant walk around the monastery and climb to the Buddha.As always far too many tourist shops and outrageously priced coffee shops and restaurants."

There are some people selling tickets before the entrance. It is like 5 or 10 dollars cheaper than inside so we bought it with them. The hanging car ride give you a view of what the city of hong kong looks like. It is a beautiful city. The best thing to see there is this statue of a bid buddha. a few steps to climb but not bad at all. Take lots of pictures and go inside the buddha for some lucky pouches."

It is a functioning monastery and there are monks walking around the place. The entrance area is very commercialized with lots of souvenir shops, restaurants, food and drink establishments. As you venture further into the temple area, it becomes less commercialized. There are hikes you can take leading into the mountain as well."

Recommend to go there by an enjoying cable car trip from Tung Chung Station (MTR Exit B), pass through the colorful Ngong Ping Village, then follow the signs. Who would miss the big bronze statue above your head? Need some strength to climb up the stairs though to reach the top, but you shouldn't be disappointed! Make sure you go around the statue once to see the views. On the second level of the statue there's a small museum with paintings and various articles depicting Buddha's life and teachings which some people may find interesting. If you want to avoid the crowd, go there before noon, and reserve ample time for the cable car return trip. If you missed the last cable car, don't worry as you can always take Bus No. 23 to go back to Tung Chung."

This might be the longest aerial tram ever, with the greatest views starting with HKIA airport, mountains and ocean views. The tram also reaches so pretty high peaks as you start to reach the large Buddha. As like most places in China, there are tons of shops and restaurants, but my suggestion would be to head to the monastery for dessert and a vegetarian meal. The meal may not sound pleasing to most, but man is it tasty. There is quite a bit of walking from the tram to the big Buddha and many many stairs. My recommendation to all visitors is to not take a tour from the hotel, but catch the subway, which you can find once your there, and pay for the tram ride at the station. This is a must see attraction, go early when it opens, as the lines are very long and many tour buses come all day long."

The summary goes like this: take the cable car, climb a lot of stairs, see giant Buddha statue, great photo opportunities all around.Part one of the experience is the cable car. We queued up for tickets which took us 10 minutes on a Monday morning, probably faster if he had pre-booked online. Then we queued up to get on the cable car - 45min, about half that if we had paid a bit extra to get the Crystal Car (glass floor). Then we had an amazing 25 min ride on the cable car with fantastic views. Brilliant, as long as you're not scared of heights.Then we arrived at the \"village\", which is just a group of shops, cafes, restaurants and some other activities (like watching a \"walking with Buddha\" short film). This is also where the bus stops, in case you choose to go by bus instead of cable car. Just walk through it (less than 5 minutes) and you'll reach the plaza at the bottom of the stairs for the Buddha statue. Climbing the stairs is not THAT difficult, but they are still quite a few and the sun/heat combo makes things more difficult. There's plenty of space for taking breaks, but no shade.Once on top of the stairs, you get face to face to the massive Buddha statue, which is itself surrounded by smaller statues offering him gifts. The platform goes full circle around the Buddha statue, so you get spectacular views to the valley around you.Once down the stairs and back to the plaza, you can walk up to the monastery and have a vegeterian lunch (did not try though) or just catch your breath at one of the tables and benches under the trees.Apparently there is also an option to get to a fishing village in the vicinity, but we opted to beat the crowds back to the cable car. 10 minutes later we were on the cable car and once again we enjoyed the truly magnificent ride.Expect to spend at least 3 hours for this, not including the metro ride. Apparently the queues are inhumanely long during the weekends so do yourself a favour and visit on a weekday. Remember to bring your camera and comfortable shoes. The stairs in combination with the heat can turn this into a serious physical activity, so shorts, t-shirts, hats and sunglasses are highly recommended. The Buddha statue is of course the main attraction here, but we were rather more excited with the cable car ride. In general, totally worth the time and the money spent."

You can get to the top of Nong Ping, by bus or cable car. There are a variety of tickets on the cable car available, and if you want you can bypass the crowds and get a priority type one. There are sure to be long queues but fear not, they are very goos at getting you onto a car, and they come along every minute or so. The first time I visited I went up by bus, it is an adventure in itself, as the roads are steep and the views breathtaking. Also it is cheaper. You should remember that the Buddha was built as a work of religious devotion, it was not intended to be a tourist attraction. The shops and such came along later, but unless you are on a religious trip, you will appreciate being able to get some mementoes or even a cup of coffee. The statue is atop of a big bunch of steps, so if you want to get up close either take your time or use your cameras zoom. There are some lovely gardens up there too, and when the weather is clear it is a calm and uplifting place to visit. That said of course there are a zillion tourists, and many just seem to want to tick the visited there box. be prepared to show some nifty footwork as you navigate your way around the crowds of selfie lovers. Oh and watch out for the buffaloes the poor things are very placid but after a long day of being prodded they might be a bit tetchy."

Buy the all in ticket as when you get to the top of the Buddha, you get to go round the museum ( it has the best air con in the world) and you get a celebratory bottle of water and ice-cream, its like winning the lottery .The Buddha itself is mesmerising and beautiful and the views breath taking. I could of spent all day there, contemplating! It gets very, very busy and due to where you are it is even hotter and more humid, you do not sweat, you melt.Typical HK, never miss an opportunity to shop, so as you are walking to the cable cars, from the Buddha, you walk through a mini shopping centre, complete with food, shoes and handbag shops.So worth a visit.

Once you arrive and on the way to big Buddha its best to take the tour of \"walking Buddha\" booth and then the 5D movie about the village then walk your way up.

So, it's still rather safe I must say. But It can be quite scary for ppl who is afraid of heights. The mountains r really high and steep, the side of the road doesn't come w much wall or protection. Just don't look out. It's beautiful and breathe taking looking out.Steps up to big Buddha looks far but it's actually not as tough as its shown here. Before u knew it, u were at the hill top.After seeing Buddha, u can move down and visit the temple, pray for god's blessing. Right besides the temple, there's a cafe, there's a dessert named \"tou hua\" white jelly like deserts, sweet, silky, bean curd sort of. It's a must have. While on your way back towards cable car station, u will see some souvenirs shops, if u wanna get something.Overall, it's nice and pleasant. Cater: 1 hour for bus ride - waiting time etc.1 hour for visiting Buddha walking around1 hour for the temple, prayers, bean curds deserts, shops.Afternoon sun is hot, I went at about 1pm.

The path to the Big Buddha is lined with nice shops and places to catch a snack. Many places where you can take nice pictures of statues etc. You must where comfortable shoes and light clothing as the ascend to the Big Buddha is a cardio workout. There are places on the steps where you can stop and have a breather. The ascend is doable. Once you reach the top it is peaceful and serene."

            "review": "The stuff of fantasies. The Tian Tan Buddha is one of those places where you will lose the sense of reality and tread into the surreal, if only it weren't littered with commercial shops along the access road. But those things have their own charm and serve as a excellent place to buy some cheap souvenirs. China has always been a land of myth, wonder and grandeur and this place checks all these boxes. This is a must see according to me for anyone visiting Hong Kong and will at least require half a day to visit. The Big Buddha is on the same island (Lantau Island) as the airport and is at the peak of one of the mountains on it. Access to the place is via road as well as through the scenic Ngong Ping cable car which is highly recommended. Take the MTR to reach Tung Chung station and walk out for 5 minutes from the station complex (which is a mall -- in Hong Kong any gathering of people has been transformed into a Mall) to reach the Ngong Ping cable car point. Buying a return ticket can save a bit.The Ngong ping cable car journey is an exciting experience in itself. As you start approaching the top, you will start to see the Buddha statue appear nestled within the trees serenely perched atop the mountain with the Buddha serenely overlooking the island. Once at the top, you will step into the Ngong Ping village which is essentially a shopping village and a nice place to buy souvenirs. Many items are available for a much cheaper price (albeit of a bit lower quality) at a shop right in front of the Tian Tan Buddha stairs, So make sure you check prices there before buying anything in shops before it. The statue is accessed via a flight of stairs and needs a ticket. The ticket will also include entry fee to the Lo pin monastery at the base of the statue. There is pure veg restaurant there run by the monastery with some delectable food available until lunch, which i didn't get to check.The climb is a good exercise and as you reach closer, the Buddha statue slowly comes in to view from behind the veil of trees. Standing in full view of statue is humbling and relaxing despite the puffing and panting required to reach it. Make sure to drop into Po Lin Monastery which also lets you buy souvenirs and precious stones blessed by the Monastery monks. A nice place to pick a special gift for someone near and dear. All in a all a must visit. I would rate it 4 stars."

If you are not a hiker or you don't have time to see some of Lantau on your own, take the cable car. Book on the internet the day before and get a ticket. You can skip the line which can be hours long, especially during public holidays and weekends. I highly recommend going during the week. Skip the vegetarian lunch up there. It is not that great. I would bring a wonderful picnic lunch and enjoy the outdoors, especially if there November to March. I have been there many times with guests. If you are capable, I suggest hiking. There are several ways to do it. The Rescue Trail is straight up around 4 hours, but search for other hikes that bring you up behind the Buddha!"

Just remember do not lose your ticket as it is a return, otherwise its a long walk down the hill. The village at the top is really special, great wee shops and you can at a price enjoy a tea making ceremony plus great food shops. Free entertainment at different times which is great. The walk up to the Buddha is great but only for a relatively fit person, fitness level average to very fit. The views from the top exceptional. The museum inside the Buddha is serene and peaceful and very informative. We didn't visit the monastery but people who we spoke with thoroughly enjoyed it. If you are planning a trip to Hong Kong this attraction is an absolute must see and plan for a whole day as it is very easy to pass the time away. Enjoy"

I was lucky enough to not have crowd ( I saw 10 people throughout my visit)I would say that if you visit one place in Hong Kong then make it here. It's awesome on so many levels. As I was leaving around 11.30am the coaches and masses arrived on queue. (Expect a 1.5-2hour trip from HK) Also the heat was immense and so was the humidity which by the time the crowd were climbing the 263 steps up, I was relaxing by the pool."

After climbing up, decided to go to the monastery for lunch. you can get those meal coupon for set lunch or dine outside by getting noodles and bean curd. the bean curd is smooth and nice, ought to give it a try. along the way back to the bus terminal, we saw cows...and they were really tame and seems like they are really used to crowds. Overall, I would suggest to pay a visit if you go to Hong Kong, it is a nice place to visit if you want to get away from the buzzing and crowded hong kong island and kowloon."

It made me think how fantastic it would be on a clear sunny day. Now getting to Buddha well that is where the non stop picture taking was to start.It seems everyone was taking pictures of the entire place in case any questioned them about whether they had really made the trip that they were claiming they would take this summer to see the Buddha statue. It took away from experience of the monument and the spiritual aspect of it all but overall I would do it again. Buddha in the 21 century, posing for that selfie."

Go to central and take the 'Mui Wo' ferry from pier 6. You can then either take a taxi or a bus to the Buddha. The bus to take is the one on the far left when you get off the ferry. (No 1). This in total will take you about 90 mins if you use the fast ferry.2. Take the MTR to Tung Chung, then the cable car directly to Ngong Ping village. This will likely take 1 hour depending on the queue at Tung Chung. You have the choice of a 'normal' cable car or a 'Crystal' carriage. 3. Same as No 1 above, but you can hike over Sunset Peak then Lantau Peak to the Buddha. This is lovely to do, but can be strenuous as it's fairly hilly. Bring water and food. Just follow the signs for \"Lantau Trail\" from Nam Shan. Depending on your speed this will take anywhere from 2 hours to 5 hours.4. Same as No 2 above, but you can hike under the cable car using the service steps.The Buddha itself is and excellent day out, but fair word of warning, On a nice Sunday it can get extremely busy. Go up the steps to the actual Buddha and take photos. There are also plenty of places to eat at Ngong Ping.Personally I preferred it prior to the cable car, but that's 'progress' for you."

It was so foggy, it looked like it was going to rain. We were disappointed that we weren't going to see the Big Budha. Once we arrived to the top of the mountain, Hello Kitties were everywhere. As we walked towards the Big Buddha, there were martial artists performing the dragon dance in celebration of Chinese New Year! As we began to walk up the stairs towards the Big Buddha....the clouds dissipated & became very sunny. We were able to see the Big Buddha half way up the stairs. My kids were crying once they saw the amount of steps we had to walk to get to the Big Buddha. But they were in awe once we reached to the top. It was a great experience & we were very lucky the weather came through for us. The only regret I have was not able to listen to my echo. We found out after we left. You can say something & it echoes back. But you have to stand inside the circle in order to experiment this. If you go, try it & let me know how was your experience. The circle is located at the bottom of the stairs before you walk up to the Big Buddha. Instead of making a right to the steps to the Big Budha, make a left until you see the circle on the floor. Step inside the circle, face the Big Buddha, say something & than listen. Hope you enjoy your trip as much as we enjoyed ours."

Unfortunately for us the cable car was under revision that day, so we took the bus. If you suffer of car sickness be sure you have some pills with you. The road to the Big Buddha is very nice but with many curves. And if you have the \"luck\" to be driven by a nuts driver the chances of sickness are very high.One you get off the bus you have some more steps to do until the Big Buddha.

It was so rainy that day that our socks were soaked pretty much all day long. We approached the front desk at the mall for directions for the cable car ride up. They said it was closed for maintenance so they suggested we take the 23 bus to the Big Buddha. We walked around and found the 23 bus is on the other side and as we were walking we saw a handful of people walking up to the cable ride line. Giving it a shot we found to our surprise it was still open! It costs around 47 USD for 2. And the gal at the service desk was nice enough to warn us that if we do go up there, it's very rainy and cloudy and you may only see the feet of the Buddha! We took our chances and still went!Read in previous reviews that it's not worth it for the cable ride if it's foggy. Let me tell you. It was all worth it to us! Who gets to say they got to ride a cable ride in HK to see an amazing statue as a normal thing to say? There was still plenty of views along the way and back even with it being so foggy. We really enjoyed ourselves. Bring a snack. It's a 25 min or so ride.When we got to the top there were little places you can stop and take pics. And then the walk to the Buddha. It was miraculous! So beautiful. Well worth the trip and guess what? We didn't just see the feet but the fog cleared out time to time for us to see it all. It was amazing.After we went to visit the temple and bought some incense to light. It was beautiful and well worth it there as well! Tip: You will see some dogs up there near the temple and entrance, they are the temple dogs and seem to be well taken cared of. At first I saw a little guy sitting near the entrance in the rain looking at a direction like he was looking for his human. I was so emotional and thought it was a lost or an abandoned dog. Don't worry! They are temple dogs after asking the ladies at the kiosk :) I felt so much better.Buy a bracelet from the stand :) the money goes to the temple and is well worth it!"

Just get the tickets for cable car as the visit to the temple is free. Took the crystal cable car so we could enjoy the bottom view too. Those who are afraid of heights probably would just go for the standard cable car. After gotten the tickets, it's another queue to take the cable cars . The crystal cable car queue is shorter than the standard ones. Each cable car can fit around 8 adults. And we had to share with a noisy family. Couldn't enjoy some peace. It takes about 20-25min cable car ride to the temple. Awesome view. If you couldn't capture any perfect shots, you can still take more photos when you head back. Once you reach, you'll walk pass some eateries and souvenir shops. This will take about 5min walk. Once u walk pass that, you'll be greeted with 2 rows of zodiac statues. Then get into the temple (on the right), if you want, before you climb the stairs, buy tickets to enter the museum within the temple together with vegetarian food. If not, just take the 250steps up to the Tian tian Buddha, take photos and pray. The vegetarian food/ resting area is adjacent to the temple. (The tickets do not include drinks, you'll have to purchase it there) Went there around 10-11am. Reached the temple around 1pm. By the time we finish our food, it's around 3-4pm. So, plan your time!"

Manage your expectations: 1- Walking to the Buddah is like walking through Main Street Disney. I found this interesting given this is where some go to worship and the fact that there is a monastery up there. 2- The 250+ steps is not to be taken lightly. I experienced the beginnings of heat stroke. I'm middle-aged but am athletic and in good health. Visiting the day after a 16 hour flight was part of that problem. 3 - you will most likely not get pictures without other people. 4 - the incense near and in the monastery is really bad. My friend has asthma and prepared by bringing a mask. She needed it in some areas. Tips: 1- buy your ticket before you leave the airport! This gives you a \"fast pass\" in the line if you're taking the cable 360 car. 2 - go early! It's easily a half day visit if you start at 10:00. 3- wear comfy shoes. It's a lot of walking."

A real disappointment as we were really looking forward to the ride. We opted for the cab, 40 minutes and HK$160. Once there, any disappointment evaporated. It was a rainy day. This effected our photos, but not the experience. We climbed the steps (266, but not difficult) and walked around the statue. We then toured the monastery grounds which were very nice. Saw the monks chanting (couldn't enter, but was allowed to watch through a doorway). Had a weird lunch on site at the veggie deli before we left. Highly recommended visit. Make sure the gondola is running and skip the lunch."

Catch the MTR Tung Chung line (it's the Orange line) all the way to Tung Chung. It's the last stop and costs $27HK for a single fare from Central and takes around 30mins. Exit at Gate B, walk to the left of the Citygate Mall, walk past the bus terminal and you will see the Cable Car entrance up ahead. You will be asked if you want to buy the package deal, I suggest you don't as it's easy to navigate the area yourself and you can take as long as you like rather than following a tour guide. If you don't like heights don't buy a Crystal cable car ticket as it's a glass bottom but we thought the extra money was worth it as it gave you a great view below. The recreated Ngong Ping village is very touristy just full of shops and restaurants. Walk past there and head towards the Buddha and that is when you can appreciate the beauty of the area. Walking up the stairs to the Buddha will be crowded and beware of selfie sticks everywhere but it is a beautiful all the same.Walking around the monastery and the different courtyards is where you can escape the crowds, it's a lot quieter and it is very spiritual and you have an overwhelming sense of peace. Rather than pay for the tour to Tai O Fishing Village, it's easy to catch a taxi from the Ngong Ping Village (costs around $40-50HK each way depending on if you get stuck behind a tour bus!) At the village again it's easy to navigate your way around without a tour guide & you can opt for various boat tours if you want a water view of the village or go out to see the White Dolphins.Riding the cable car back down will give you a fantastic view if it's a clear day. A truly wonderful day out, highly recommend."

The trip winds up over about 25mins of cable and offers amazing views and sets up the first viewing of the Buddha on the hill. I would advise slinking through the village and heading straight to the statue. Pay to see the relic, not only is it quieter inside the statue but you then can redeem your ticket (H$35) for two dumplings and a bowl of noodles and a drink of your choice at the monastery tea garden. The Buddha and the stairs leading up to him are worth the walk and once you've seen the sights head down for those noodles and then wind your way thru the village to buy your gifts. The shop owners all give a free gift, either on entry or on exit, to their store and they sell unique items. I would say a must visit for anyone going to Hong Kong"

It is one of the biggest outdoor statues of Buddha in the world and is fairly popular.The more famous way to reach the island is by the Ngong Ping cable car which offers amazing views of the Bay and the surrounding countryside. Of course, it is also possible to reach it by Bus.Alighting at the cable car terminus, you pass through the Ngong Ping Village which has restaurants, temples, souvenir shops and other attractions for the visitor. Past the village is a large plaza with Chinese statues on its sides. The plaza leads to the Po Lin Monastery and the mountain on which the statue is located.The statue is located high up on the mountain. So you need to be fit to climb the steps leading to the first platform which contains six figures offering various things to the Buddha. The platform offers amazing views over the surrounding countryside and also contains a museum. Entry to the museum requires you to have a Vegetarian Lunch at the nearby Po Lin monastery since the meal coupon from the Monastery serves as the entrance ticket.There are several trails nearby which you can try if you have the time. The Wisdom Path nearby takes you through tea gardens and is very good.Not to be missed attraction in Hong Kong."

Took the MTR to entry point, like most attractions, the line to get on the tram to go across the mountains was the longest wait but nothing unbearable (pay attention when they load trams, if they need smaller groups to fill a car they will stick raise their hands with the number of fingers for people they need and pull people from further back in line). Very impressive view of Hong Kong airport, the mountains, and the Buddha."

We were more interested in what there was to see and do rather than the shopping so I consulted Trip Advisor about what there was to see and do. After visiting this amazing site, I can't understand why it is ranked only #5 in the see and do category. Seriously, in my experience, it is better than the skyline which is #1 and as good as Victoria Peak (#3). In short, this should be on everyone's HK bucket list.It is easy to reach via MTR and either a taxi ride, bus ride (#11 bus) or cable car from the Tung Chung MTR station. Take the cable car - you will not be disappointed, and spend the extra $50 HKD to ride in a crystal car (glass bottom). Spend some time in the village shopping for souvenirs and then head up the 268 steps to see the Buddha in person. I am not an overtly religious person, but it was indeed a spiritual experience to see the world's largest bronze Buddha up close and personal. And the view from the top was amazing. Take the #11 bus back to Tung Chung which takes you on a very curvy road down to the sea and then back up and over the pass. It made for a very enjoyable day!"

Get there early and avoid the tour bus jams; I took a taxi from my hotel (you can easily take the subway) and got there 10 minutes after opening on a Saturday - minimal line and no problems at all. Choose the crystal car on the cable car ride and enjoy the 25 minute ride as you fly high up the mountains, then almost gasp as the Buddha appears in the distance. This is a not to be missed experience! You will never forget it! The stairs up to the Buddha are steep but it's so worth it! A magical experience in every way! BTW, the Village is kitchy but I bought a great velvet Cheongsam dress at the Vintage shop there and highly recommend it - pure dragon lady elegance for my next NYC cocktail party!

We waited approximately an hour to board the cable cars. I would suggest to pay the extra for a clear glass floor as it had a faster moving line. I would also recommend purchasing tickets online. Once at the site the views are breathtaking. Great views of Hong Kongs majestic mountains and surrounding water. The trek up the stairs to see the Buddha aren't terrible. Takes about 5 mins. It's hot. Pack bottles of water and a towel. There is a 7-11 near by and many coffee shops and restaurants. "

More impressive is the monastery located at the base of the steps. There you can have a vegetarian meal, see 10K gold Buddhas and find your zen. There are over 260 steps up to the Buddha, more around him, and inside him. If you have trouble with stairs there is a shuttle that you can pay for to take you up most of the stairs. Also, it is hot, so dress for the humid temperatures.While sunny days are best, you can go on cloudy days for a different experience. And, there are special nights when it is open. If you want more of an adventure take one of the 4 hiking trails, of varying challenge, up to see the Buddha. I am sure he will appreciate the effort."

Once at the cable cars there are several options .My brother and I chose a group tour ( was 10 in our group ) It's quicker getting through the lines for the cable cars with a group package we also chose the crystal cable car ( glass bottom) . Slightly more expensive but well worth it. The views on the way up to the Buddha are breath taking . Seeing the whole of HongKong and the close islands all from a great night . The cable car travels above beautiful country side and up the steep mountain overs water falls and streams ( there were only 5 people in our cable car) Once at the top there is a small tourist village with lots of souvenir shops and cafes .We met our tour guide and then hopped on a bus for a short drive to a fishing village where approx 2000 people live .There are many local stalls with dried fish for sale and fresh fish avail to eat at tiny market type stands .We then caught a small boat and did a short 20 min tour along the river viewing local homes built on stilts in the water. It was amazing to sea how the local villagers live right long the river some with plastic and cardboard up at Windows to protect them from the rain and wind . The village itself is somewhat protected from really bad typhoons because of where it's situated in the mountains . ( the tour guide was very knowledgable about the history of the village) We then went little bit further out on the water to view Dolphins but we only saw one pink one and only briefly . Then it was back on the bus and back to the tourist village where we climbed very steep stairs to get to the GIANT BUDDHA. Once close up its ever bigger than expected . There is a museum inside which you can enter for a small fee price includes an icecream and a bottle of water on the way out. Lots of old artefacts inside but unfortunately not allowed to take pictures . Then we went back down the stairs to an old monastery which was also very beautiful and lots of gold Buddhas inside and the actual grounds are full off large stone fires burning incense. The is a small vegetarian cafe where you can get various snacks and drinks. Then it was back down the mountain on the glass bottom cable car and again we jumped the queues because we bought the tour package and the more expensive crystal bottom for better views . The whole tour from start to finish took us about 4.5 hours but once leaving the bus after the fishing village you can do everything at your own pace so depends on how long you stop for lunch or photos etc . Absolutely a must do if in Hong Kong The tour package is a personal choice and I think is well worth it to get all the information about the area. Our tour guides name was Moon and she spoke very good English . "

Pouring with rain when we arrived but cleared within two hours. Cable car ride was good despite not being keen with heights. Long queue here but we purchased tickets from a guy selling vouchers that were cheaper just outside and they were fine. This process beat the long queue so I recommend this. Really good place to visit. Monastry is in same location and that is also good to visit. Similar buildings to the Forbidden City. We then got a bus from the terminus in the village and visited Tai O - worth a visit - returned in good time to return to the MTR by cable. A really good full day this. Highly recommended. "

We travelled up to Ngong Ping by glass-bottomed cable car which was a fantastic experience. There was a reasonably large queue for tickets so would advise buying tickets online in advance but once through the more expensive glass-bottomed ticket had the big benefit of having a much, much shorter queue for the cable car - we were in a car within 5 minutes. The Big Buddha was very impressive, as was the stunning views from the top. The Po Lin monastery was well worth the trip also, especially the Hall of Ten Thousand Buddahs."

This was the last day of our 2-week long trip in Asia and the only stop on our itinerary was the Lantau Island Buddha Statue. We took the Tsuen Wan line to Central and then switched to Tung Chung line to Tung Chung. The Ngong Ping Cable car station is located only 5 minutes walk from the Tung Chung station. It was Sunday and the place had quite long lines. After standing in queue for 1 hour we finally got on the cable car.The ride on the cable car is long (close to 25 minutes i think). I would recommend not to pay extra for the glass bottom cable car and should just take the regular car. After reaching the Lantau Island, we walked close to the Tian Tan Buddha statue and then walked up 268 steps to finally reach the top. Make sure to stay hydrated as it is hot and humid.There is not a whole lot to see up there just to see the Buddha statue up close and also the statues of the disciples.-milespointstravel.com"

From there we got in the queue for the cable car, which only took about 15 mins max. We got a one way trip on a standard car ( without the glass bottom) for $130HKD each. This was a lovely ride, lovely views, very smooth, about 20 mins of sitting back enjoying the view. We got to the top and walked through the touristy shop area to the bottom of big buddha's steps- these were very manageable, even with the sun and humidity rising. We climbed up one level of steps. You can go inside the Buddha to see a display about its construction, but if you want to get up to the top level you need to have a meal ticket- bizarre I know, but that's China! We went down the steps and walked a few yards to the Po Lin temple, very nice and smells of incense. We walked the wisdom path, about 15 minutes from the main area through a forested trail with lots of butterflies. The view here was lovely, and not many people had ventured away from Buddha. We decided to take bus 23 down, you get it from behind the shops near the cable car termnius for $17.20 HKD dollars each. The trip back to Ting Chung station went past other temple routes and beaches along the south part of the island west to east, and th eb up the centre. My one regret is not taking my swimming togs with me, and going for a dip on the way down. We got the mtr back to our hostel and were out of the heat by 5.30 I would highly recommend the big Buddha as a half day trip, lovely views of the island"

Lots of restaurants and coffee shops so no need to take too much with you. Lovely ambience here, we will definitely go again!!"

I strongly advise purchasing advance tickets as the ticket line was very long without advance purchase. The tram drops you off on the mountain near a small village area with restaurants and souvenir shops. A couple of short movie theaters are also in the small village. The village ends at the entrance to the monastery and the entrance to the steps to the Big Buddha. We ate at the monastery cafeteria for a very affordable price. Had I been younger I would have climbed the stairs to the Buddha but view at base of the stairs is a good place for memorable photographs. Highly recommend a trip to Tian Tan Buddha and the associated monastery. The temple was holding service while we were there and that was a memorable experience in itself. Take the MTR to the tram station as it is cheap and fast."

This cable cars are awesome (definitely worth every penny) we took the crystal cabin - this means the floor is glass so you can see everything that runs underneath. It's exhilarating. The cable car ride is about 30-40 mins so you can imagine how long is the trip. It goes up and down mountains - and the view of the city and the mountains is marvellous I haven't seen anything like it. I would highly recommend it to anyone. When you reach the destination - there's a small village where there are many souvenir shops - restaurants etc. Then when you get closer to Buddha you will have to take the straits (~120 steps may be) so be very sure before you commit to climb up. There a resting space after every 14-16 steps so you can stop and rest for a bit. Bearing in mind HK is very hot and humid so please carry water bottle with you. Don't get dehydrated. The Buddha statue itself is amazing its ginormous. The scenery from the top is breathtaking as well. So if you can you must visit this place."

We could just about make out the outline of the Big Buddha after we climbed up since we were socked in. It felt very atmospheric even though it was super misty.

The build up to visiting the big Buddha was such an adventure, from getting the train to getting on the crystal cable cart, to actually making it up to the big Buddha. I pre booked the crystal cable cart but I got there for 4.30pm and there were no ques. If you get there earlier then I can imagine there being large ques. Once my husband and I got on the cable cart it was just serene to take in such the breathtaking view with a 360 view. It's worth getting the crystal cable cart for a few more dollars because you can catch a glimpse of a beautiful waterfall hidden in the forest. I noticed a very long hiking trail (respect to those who actually use this route - I couldn't do it, it is EXTREMELY long). The ride is about 15-20 minutes but it doesn't feel it when you're looking at all the beautiful scenery. You must get on and off quickly as the cable continues moving round while you get on and off. Once we got to the mini village it was a short walk up to the steps of the big Buddha. To be honest, there wasn't many steps, they were just slightly steep and you do get tired quickly. Bring water, a camera, a hat and sunscreen. You don't need to wear trainers, it's not a treacherous path at all. There are also three floors beneath the statue: the halls of the Universe, of Benevolent Merit and of Remembrance. One of the most renowned features inside is a relic of Gautama Buddha,consisting of some of his alleged cremated remains. So that's worth checking out. There's lots of cows and dogs around the village and they are friendly so don't be afraid. The view at the top where the big Buddha is, is just phenomenal, the natural beautiful views that are unobstructed makes you forget about where you are and makes you feel very relaxed."

A small ceremonial area is organized inside, with a small temple. There are bathrooms around so no need to panic if in need. We visited the Buddha, the monastery and the surroundings, and small garden taking a 15mins slow walk to it. We took a snack at the monastery -- didn't buy the full lunch. It was fairly ok, but we came to the conclusion that the traditional Hong Kong food isn't as aromatic and full of flavours as we expected. Walking back to the bus a touristic village with shops, a thematic cinema and restaurants. The prices were a bit higher then what we found in HK. Strongly recommend going to the Ladies Market for souvenirs - the same magnets and whatever else are here half price even compared with Temple Street Market."

I booked this ticket online and used the one way cabin upgrade [there is a Hong Kong Summer promotion online to get this offer] on the way up so had almost no waiting time to take the cable car at 10:30am. We spent quite a long while there as the cable car stops in Ngong Ping Village which has shops and some attractions before a 5min walk towards the buddha. We got back to the station at approx 2pm and there was no line to getup there - so perhaps if you don't have online tickets, wait a while and go in the afternoon to avoid the crowds as it seems like most people go there in the morning. Getting there was really easy as its the end of the line from HK station and the cable car station is a 5 min walk from the MTR stop. If you want to do any shopping on your back its worthwhile as between the train station and the cable station is an outlet mall. In the village there is also a short show about the life of Buddha, an show on HK action movies and a 3D theatre. If you time it correctly you can do all 3 one after the other [as they have set show times. We did the buddha one at noon and then action movies straight after at 12h30 and then the 3d movie at 1pm. We then walked up to the Buddha itself. It was hot and there are many stairs but its worth the walk up as its really beautiful. to go inside the Buddha and up to the thirs tier you have to buy a 'meal ticket' which means you need to buy snacks from the concessionaire stand outside. We walked around the base of the buddha and didn't file like we needed to go higher, so skipped that part. If you change your mind, you can buy it at the entrance as well.We also walked around the monastery which was really nice as well.The only think we didn't do was the walk of wisdom which would have added another 30-45 min to our trip. We were too hot to attempt that even though I believe it to be a fairly level/flt walk."

On arrival, we quickly decided to take the coach to the fishing village of Tai O, just a 5 minute bus journey from the main Big Buddha site. We started off with a short boat trip around down the water canals of the village, and spotted some dolphins on the way. For lunch, we stopped off at Julia's cafe on the waterfront which was delicious! After returning to the Big Buddha site, we trekked up to the Buddha himself, which was a very worthwhile visit. The temple was beautiful also, lots of photo opportunities! Overall, a fantastic day!"

I could give a long history lesson on who, what, why, where and when but they don't really matter, what does is the journey and the destination. Riding the cable car above the lake and the valley rising towards the summit will give you some of the best views ever, they are simply amazing, and if you want the best, pay the extra for the glass bottomed cable car, it's worth the expense.Once you get there following the long trek up the steps the statue is awe inspiring and you understand why people all around the world travel to see it.

It is really nice, and on a good day you get a very nice view, but having done it a couple of times now, I would recommend to take the bus. The bus takes you on a route where you can see more things, and also stops by the beaches in Lantau along the way. You can take bus 23 from Tung Chung station, just walk past the entrance to the cable car and into the bus terminus. The price is around 17 HKD per ride. As you go up you can just walk around, check the small \"fake\" village there and take the stairs up to the Buddha statue. I suggest you go inside and read some of the history of how the buddha was put together. After that, go back down the stairs and then straight ahead: the temple is not exactly visible from that area, but once you reach it you'll understand what I mean. It's extremely colourful, with very intricate details, and the last room in the back hosts a huge amount of tiny golden buddhas.Once you are done consider the vegetarian restaurant just nearby the temple (looking at the temple's entrance, on the left). The main restaurant is just ok, but still an interesting meal. What I think it's rather a must is the stand outside and behind this restaurant where they sell Hong Kong street food. You should try there some of the local HK desserts like sesame balls, red bean pancakes, putchaiko, egg tart, turnip cake, and so on..."

The bus ride was about 40mins; but prolonged journey was worth it. Amazing views of the buddha and monastery. You can also have a good basic lunch at the vegetarian restaurant."

It can get quite busy up there and we managed to have a look around in relative peace and quiet for most of our visit. We got some lovely photos with very few people in them as well, so I recommend making it a morning trip. The Buddha is breath taking. Loads of stairs, so good for some exercise as well! Weather was lovely the entire week we were there in June. "

While the cable car ride to the Ngong Ping village is really the highlight of going to visit the Big Buddha, it's majesty and enormity deserves a climb up the many flights of stairs that one must do in order to get to right beneath the statue. The statue is stunning in its scale and can be seen from numerous points on the cable car ride. When beneath the statue, one can also get a long view into the South China Sea and its islands."

We saw many people walk from the station up to the Buddha village and it seemed to be a beautiful hike, which will surely take a couple hours. But then again, we waited for 1.5 hours for tickets. Please do yourself the favor and buy tickets beforehand, you will save so much time!! Up the hill it's beautiful, but take along drinks and whatever you need from the mall, as it is all priced on a tourist-level up the hill. It's surely very kid-friendly and worth it to go up and be vowed by this huge Buddha."

We arrived by boat from Central pier 6 to Mui Wo ferry pier, and then bus to Ngong Ping, preferring a lengthier journey than the direct cable car from Tung Chung. There was a bustling tourist village at Ngong Ping, where we had a tasty Chinese lunch at Zen Noodle Cafe, and then on to visit the Buddha.A walk though formal gardens past statues then led us to a lengthy stair surmounted by BB, his head lost in wispy clouds. As we climbed higher there seemed to be fewer visitors, and our visit was relatively tranquil. Afterwards we visited the monastery and lit incense purchased there for about $30, another peaceful interlude.We returned by bus and MTR from Tung Chung rather than queue for the pricey cable car. A great day out."

Don't miss this one!I booked a voucher online on Klook.com and managed to get a discounted ticket, do try that! We went on a really quiet day, late in the evening so we had a cable car all for ourselves. I have been told otherwise that the ticket lines can be extremely long, so buy ticket ahead!Buddha himself is very calm n serene. Since we went late, we couldn't climb up but am sure views would have been amazing. Basically they don't let anyone go up post 4.45 or so, so be there earlier if you would like to go up.There are some quaint stalls n restaurants nearby but quite expensive.

The Ngong Ping 360 Cable Car takes you on a breathtaking 25 min journey. Many ticket choices, we opted for Crystal ( glass bottomed cable Car ) & for the few \u00a3s more would highly recommend it. Queue is slightly shorter & staff are happy to only have 6 to a car ( I noticed the longer standard car, 8 was the norm ) . Whilst queuing you do get a lovely view of the airport with planes landing & taking off every 30 seconds. Obligratory photo was taken as we settled in the car, offered for sale at the top. TIP They were willing to sell the photo alone for \u00a310 after we declined the package.At the top it becomes rather like a Disney resort, eating areas, photo opportunities, shops & plenty of washrooms.The climb up to Big Buddha IS arduous but well worth it for the views at the top.TIP. An umbrella is very useful for keeping the sun at bay also bottled ice cold water is on sale before you start the climb. Plenty more to see around including cinema type \"history of Budda\" & children's rides,but that's all we wanted to do. The cable car takes you back down to an \"outlet centre\" but prices were no bargain for a UK shopper."

Whether you get the cable car or the bus up the mountain, you can't miss the sight of the world's largest Buddha statue gazing down at the monastery below. The steps up to the statue open at 10:00, and I would strongly recommend not ascending them at the hottest part of the day like we did. They are not too steep, but from the ground the distance is slightly misleading as one will see from further away. At the top, there are numerous smaller statues to admire as well as the main event. In the chambers beneath the statue, there is a museum which cannot be entered without a \"meal ticket\" for the local restaurant. We chose the cheapest option, which was a drink and ice cream - much needed on a day with temperatures exceeding 30 degrees. The restaurant also does good Dim Sum.The museum itself is, disappointingly, mostly in Cantonese. There are a few English guides, but these depict a general history of the site rather than Buddhism itself as the scrolls and artefacts on display do. The artwork is interesting to look at, as is the \"Bone Relic\" at the end (typically impossible to see for the ornate display case), but if you can get up to the Buddha for free and skip the museum, that's what I would recommend."

The temples are worth a visit too if you have time."

            "review": "Some tips before you get there. The beautiful Buddha is a must see when in Hong Kong, just to wrap your head around how large it truly is. This review focuses on some tips when going to visit this attraction:1. Doing a tour with a tour company is really not necessary, we did it on our own and it was about 60% cheaper than going with a company. 2. To get there take the MTR subway and get off at the Tung Chung station. At this station you can either opt to take a bus to the Buddha or take the cable car which provides amazing views of the surrounding areas. We opted for the cable car (note that the bus is cheaper but does take longer to get up to the Buddha). There's enough signage at the Tung Chung station for you to know where to go when you exit the train.3. The queues for the cable car are horrendous. Brace yourself for them. One way to reduce your waiting time is to prebook your cable car ticket online. The line is still long to redeem your ticket but it's significantly shorter than buying the ticket on the day.4. There's 2 types of cable cars, the crystal and the normal one. The crystal one has a clear floor, whilst it is a nice to have, it is more expensive. The real benefit of the crystal cabin is the shorter queues to get to the cable car.That's all the advice I have, enjoy your visit!"

On there right side over there are more busses. Take bus 23. It will take you to the big Buddha and nong ping. I forgot the exact price but I think it was 22hk$ on a Sunday and 12hk$ on the other days. Anyway it is a lot cheaper than the cable car and the queue is a lot shorter. We took the cable car back though (shorter queue on the way back). And you can go out and enjoy the beach, it comes right along the beach. Bus takes about 30 minutes. The big Buddha is fun to see. Also the other things there. You get a good view there."

And you can even admire the place alot I don't deny that I haven't enjoyed the trip to this place it was really good. But there was a problem with respect to the entry in Buddha statue. You need to take a ticket to go through the inside area of the statue. And that pass includes the food what you have to mandatory purchase to enter that area. The inside place is just a staircase up towards the end. Although it was really pretty over there to see beautiful architecture inside. Also it is made of gold and a small crystal shiv ling is also place under the statue. Which felt really very nice. But the thing is that it should not be forcefully chargeable to purchase the food for entering the area. The food was pathetic. I didn't like it. May be we are not used to eat these types of food what they eat. But it was a foggy and cold day."

This area was beautiful. The Buddha impressive in size and aura. Even though I am by no means a religious person you could certainly feel the spirituality of this place. Even my partner, a devout Buddhist, was moved to the point where he stated that he wanted us to move home to NZL together. The Po Monastery is impressively beautiful. The Hall of 10,000 Buddhas amazing. After our time there we moved on to taking the most fantastic cable car ride down the hill I've ever experienced and I have done very many over their years. The view of HKG airport is incredible. We took the glass bottom option on the cable car which turned out to be a good choice as we were able to cut the very long line for the basic car. Well worth the extra. MTR back to the hotel. Overall a fantastic day."

The big buddha can be very easy to get to by the MTR station when you have the MTR map handy with you at all times, as it has a separate line to the cable cars which you need to get up to the big buddha and lantau island. Before you get cable cars, people will try to sell you tickets for the cable cars. The people we bought them from we were not sure whether or not they were genuine, but they were. This meant that we did not have to wait for ages in the cable car queue and it went very quick. They have toilets when you queue up for the cable cars and when you reach the big buddha. The cable car ride can be quite long and scary when it is raining very heavy, but you can close the windows. You also have the option of choosing a crystal cabin for the cable car ride. This is more money but this cabin is simply a glass bottom and you can see the land beneath you. You can also purchase photos before and after the cable car ride. It is around 268 steps on the big buddha, but it is not actually that bad walking to the top. I thought it would have been a lot worse with the humid weather, but it was manageable. Overall, I would definitely recommend anyone to go there during their stay in HK as this is a must and there is not much else to do."

We stood in line over an hour just to board the cable car on a Friday morning. Once you by up to the mountain, it's beautiful. Convenient eateries and gift shops, and a short walk ( with lots of stairs) up to the Big Buddha. People pray at the top right in front of the statue so be mindful. Definitely take the wisdom trail, lots of hiking options (though some dilapidated structures on the route). The monastery is beautiful."

I must say that it was the highlight of the trip.We took the cable car from Ngong Ping 360 to the Big Budha. There is a choice of the regular cable car or the crystal cable car which is glass bottom. I recommend the glass bottom, which makes the scenic ride more extraordinary. It was fascinating to see the Budha statue, which sits on the peak of the mountain, became bigger and bigger as the car approaches the Ngong Ping village. The Budha is beautifully and elegantly made - the way the body is tilted and the way the raised arm is sculpted makes It looks so life-like. We walked past some shops and restaurants before we came to the bottom of the 260 something steps that we have to climb to reach the Budha lotus flower platform. It was quite a climb and we went on a humid and 38 degree C day. But it was all worth it.It was quite breezy up there. I find the Big Budha has the most serene, kind and peaceful face among all the Budha statues I have seen ( I am not a Buddhist ). The view from the Big Budha is truly spectacular, 360 degree of unblocked view. I didnt want to leave yet, but, alas, i have to catch the last cable car ride as I have no desire to take the bus and miss my dinner appointment. You will need about 4 hours including the cable car ride to truly enjoy this area."

While researching sights we wanted to be sure to see, my family ribbed me mercilessly about my commitment to seeing \"Big Buddha\". This ended up being one of the highlights of our visit to this cosmopolitan city! Located on Lantau Island and reached by a lovely trip on the Ngong Ping cable car (pay the extra for the \"crystal car\" with clear floor), the Big Buddha is located in a beautifully peaceful and bucolic area -- an oasis of sorts just outside the hubbub that is HK. Leading up to the statue is a small series of shops, then a lovely small statue park. The Buddha himself is even larger \"in person\" than one would think, and is absolutely awe-inspiring. There are many steps leading up to the top, which may pose a problem for those with mobility issues; however, there are many photo opportunities from below and on the cable car ride as well, so don't be deterred. Definitely a must-see when visiting Hong Kong!"

The stairs up can take a minute if you're not in really good health, but it's worth it....really worth it! When you get over looking up at the Buddha and feeling the calming breath, you can turn around and fall in love with the views around also. There's a community of monks also that do trust exercises with tourists who go to the site. Getting back to the city there are three options, the bus back to Mui Wo then ferry, the bus to Tung Chung station or the cable car to Tung Chung Station. Definitely worth it!"

Its a nice drive and as a sickly traveller i was happy to be in a cool comfortable taxi and not a bouncy coach!Once you're there, there is a whole village to explore, amazing monasteries & obviously the buddha with all the views.

But otherwise as well, the place is so serene, the architecture is so beautiful, that you will instantly fall in love with this place, The cable car was on maintenance , so we took the Bus no 23 from the subway interchange. The drive was wonderful too.Lantau island overall is a wonderful place.Some tipsa. The bus service is every 20 minutes, and it takes almost 45 minutes to reach destination, So do keep at least 2 hours both way for travelb.Do not miss the vegetarian food at temple canteenc. They sell museum and meal ticket together , but actually there is nothing much to see in museum. You can always get meal and snacks option , separately , so you may not want to spend money on the ticketd.Its next station to Disneyland on subway. If you have a two day pass to Disney , and you are free by lunch at disney or vice versa, you can club these two together"

No where else in the world can you experience such a big Buddha and the six Goddesses that flank the entry - very cool! The temple near the entry to the stairs can be seen from the top and is stately, which can be visited below, but we did not take extra time for that. We stopped for a quick snack at the Zen Noodle restaurant, which sells beer and is near the entry/ exit of the village. We had a leisurely lunch after returning from the ride back, so it was really a pretty full day. TIP: You can buy advance tickets to go with a guide, which allows you to by-pass a pretty substantial que, although we didn't so don't know of any downside if there is. The extra money for the clear bottom gondola option is worth it for the view, and a shorter wait in line.

You could upgrade to a gondola with a clear floor and some other nonsense stuff. This was my first visit to Hong Kong and we only were spending a couple days there before we went back home to the U.S. If you only have a day or so like we did, I would recommend you do something else. Instead of a spiritual experience, it was just another landmark that your are CHARGED, sometimes while they bend you over to get your wallet. I did not appreciate all the commercialism surrounding it. It made it unauthentic. When we finally got inside under the Buddha I read that this thing was not even old. It was built in 90's which even made it less appealing for me. I did appreciate the location of it at the highest point (the gondola ride was pretty long) and there is a path and stairs to walk up there if you are some kind of hardcore hiker. I imagine it would take the whole day to go up there by walking. The statues were all very lovely. There is a little strip mall of sorts with gifts shops on the way to the buddha after you get off the gondola and if you want to buy bead bracelets blessed by the monks, those are available inside under the big Buddha statue. I found it kind of messed up that they charged more for the wooden beads with a variety of blessings, than for the stone beads with only one kind of blessing. I opted for the cheaper of the two with the more durable stones with blessings of happiness. That is good enough for me but I'm not a Buddhist."

Once you get there you feel like you're in a little old china town. Very quick walk to the statue which offers a particular sense of peace. No need for buying anything up there such a food as there is a big factory outlet shopping centre at the bottom. Only thing you might be souvenirs. Lines may seem long but the traffic usually flows pretty fast unless you are there at the start of opening hours or towards the end of closing. Plan well so that you're not there in the middle of a peak time but there will always be a line. Great experience should not be missed"

I waited for one hour in line to get the tickets, I will recommend to buy the tickets in advance so you do not wait in line.You will go up to the top of the mountain in a cable car, which is an amazing way to see the mountains, the airport and other islands, it is really a very nice ride.As soon as you are there you will walk trough this small village which has souvenirs stores and restaurants.If you go during Summer time you should bring an unrelated and a very light clothing, it was 105 degrees when I went there mid June.After you walk to the village you will see the Big Buddha which is in a top of a mountain, that means you need to climb 267 steps. It is worthy , but take water with you for the climbing .When you are there you can walk around the Buddha and take many pictures of the beautiful view from the top, where you can see many little islands.The whole adventure will take you around 3 hours if you do not have the tickets and you have to do the one hour line. Please buy the tickets in advance.I went back in taxi which is great to see the city and beautiful bridges."

Up there, beside the view there are some Buddhism statues and you also can go inside but no pics allowed there.The monastery also has a vegetarian restaurant open for public which i wont give the review now.It is a great landmark spot which I strongly recommended for those who wants to have either a getaway or a religion trip."

Yes, it's new, but it's impressive. The little \"village\" at the bottom a bit cheesy, but fun. Worth a visit if >3 days in HK (2nd tier)."

So, during June, July, August (plus other months I'm sure) it is a horrible experience to be trapped in this suspended sauna for the 5.7 km ride. However, the Buddha is really big once you get there, and he appreciates and respects your suffering just to visit him. In summary, a really big Buddha who lives close to a cheesy artificial tourist village, accessed by a great cable car ride which will test your heat stress capacity in summer."

There was a large queue at the counter and we waited about 20 minutes to get our tickets - but that wasn't the tiring part. When we got through the entry gate we were in another queue and stood in a zigzag line to enter the cable car well over an hour. There were elderly folks and families with young children and the wait standing with no air con just a few fans was horrendous. There was a faster moving line that people paid more for and that was given priority along with many monks that were returning to Po Lin Monastery. When we eventually boarded the cable car it was a spectacular trip with breathtaking views. We didn't climb up the steps to the Big Buddha as we were totally exhausted standing in line for the Cable Car! From Ngong Ping we travelled by bus to the quaint fishing village of Tai O, we then returned from Tai O to Tung Chung MTR by bus . TIP: Talking to other travellers take the bus up to the Ngong Ping Village and the cable car back as it is a lot less busy later in the day. This avoids the huge morning crowds."

I spent only half a day visiting this attraction and that's all u need here leaving the rest of the day for another attraction.My advice would be to take drink with u on the climb to the Buddha as its a long way up the stairs and when it's hot you are going to need the extra!There are shops, restaurants and a Starbucks in the little village before your hike up the stairs to the Buddha which were pleasant and you can buy your souvenirs from here. There isn't much once you get to the top of the Buddha, little stalls and a shrine inside.I took the cable car 360 to get there however you are also able to reach it by coach but the journey is longer. If you do take the cable car my advise is to get there early as it can be really busy and queuing in the heat is too much. Also if you can, it's worth paying a little extra for the crystal car with glass bottom, 1. As its fun to see beneath you and 2. The queue was shorter as it costs a little more money!On a clear day you will get some great shots of the airport on the way up!"

Unfortunately, I woke up late and fearful that I may not be able to enjoy Macau for a short span of time, I immediately picked up Big Buddha as a back up plan. I packed my things such as camera, bottled water and extra shirt since my previous days in Hongkong was really humid thought I experienced a little drizzles. So the journey commenced.I took the cable car going to the Island. Cable car experience will be featured separately. I paid 185 HKD to bring me to Big Buddha and back. It offers me a breathtaking view of the the islands and the skyline. Not the mentions he lush forests with some creeks and rivers beneath.It was 25-30 mins awesome ride to enjoy.When we arrived to Ngong Ping 360 it was drizzling a bit and the Big Buddha is too shy enough to show herself as it was enveloped by a thick fog. So I visited the nearby temples at the foot of the hill. Once the fog clears, I started my 268-steps trek towards her. It was a bit tiring but upon seeing people from different walks of life, culture and race, I was determined to reach the top to see the Big Buddha with her 6 maidens. Once I made it to the top, I can't help but to adore and be amazed of the magnificent view right in front of me. It was all worth it. However, I posed a question on me when I saw the nazi sign at the center of Big Buddha. It made me wonder what is its connection to Buddhism? Something i need to look into."

Upon arrival at the chairlift 30 minutes before arrival we were glad we pre-booked tickets as the queues were already long. 5 minutes before 10 we started moving in the queue and within 10 minutes were on our way. The chairlift ride is spectacular. I would not bother paying the extra for a glass floor as u can see just as much in a standard cabin.Upon arrival we walked 10 minutes to the bottom steps of the buddah.It was already 30 degrees with extreme humidity and it did knackered us walking to the top, but we made it. Magnificent views greeted us. We then went on a boat to the local fishing village. The best part was going out to the new road they are building across the ocean to Macau. Impressive engineering as it goes partly out to sea to a man made island and then disappears beneath the ocean. After lunch we decided to head back to our hotel in Kowloon. Finally arriving back at 3 pm. A tough day, but well worth it."

Some tips: Try taking the glass floor cabin while going up and normal cabin while coming down - reasons been, firstly while coming back, invariably its more cloudy and second you are more tired and low on energy to soak in the beauty. Once up there, take ur time to enjoy the quaint village, go up 249 stairs to see the Big Buddha ( History trivia- The nazi swastik on the chest of Buddha is reminiscent of the influence of Nazi- Japanese influence during the time it was built). Once down, visit the Po Lin Monastery, then stop at the village for lunch or coffee before taking the cable back to base. Total time- 3-4 hours depending on your pace."

I've heard and read about this on Tripadvisor and from friends that its mostly foggy on this very high altitude so you've got to go on a really nice sunny day to catch a clear glimpse of the Big Buddha, it was a sunny day. so I gave it a shot with my dad on our trip to Hongkong this time round.We got caught up by the incoming mist/ fog as we walked towards the Big Buddha, the experience was still nice nevertheless, the mist made the place very \"celestial\" it just looked like a scene from the heavens, with the cool weather. grand place and this fog were like clouds.It takes over 200 steps to get to the submit. We stayed at the foot because the fog was too heavy, paid our respects and prayed for blessings. Interesting facts I got to know from our guide that this used to be the biggest bronze Buddha statue in the world until Taiwan came up with one to eclipse it's size. Another unique fact besides the full gold swastika on the chest of the Buddha is that, unlikely the conventional Chinese or religious way of placing the deities facing the South, the HK government actually built this Buddha facing North to show its respect towards China.I wouldn't suggest to follow throughout the tour if you're on the speed pass via Ngongping cable car because they do take up alot of your time by bringing you to the fishing village etc which was not worth a visit. It was a clear day until when I'm back from the fishing village that the fog caught up with us so we regretted pretty much for joining the tour."

Still was worth the trip as the crowds were down and there was only a short wait going and no wait coming down. One walks through the small village of Ngong Ping which is filled with shops with the usual tourist trinkets and small restaurants on the way to the Great Buddha.  The rain came in small showers allowing time between them to walk up those stairs which will take your breath away both in the walk up and the view. Make sure you have a pair of shoes with non slip soles as the steps can be slippery.It is a great break from the crowds of Hong Kong with amazing views of the country side.

We really enjoyed the \"wild\" cows that were found at many different places along the way, but our favorite was the giant temples that we saw, Just a surreal day.

Best to go on a reasonable clear day so you can see the views and the Big Budda. There is about 268 steps to climb to get to the Big Budda and normally this is no issue as we are reasonably fit but due to 34 degree temp and 90+% humidity, we climbed two set of stairs at a time before stopping each time due to the heat. If you do plan to go at the weekend prebook tickets due to the queues to get on the cable car. Cable car trip is amazing with views across the huge HK airport and also the countryside on the way up to the Big Budda. There are plenty of souvenir shops on the way to Big Budda including high end souvenir and more modest shops - all worth a look. There is plenty of places for lunch including Subway and a Kebab place we went to which was good.Great visit to Big Budda and well worth the trip!"

If you have some time to spare at the HKG airport (3-5 hours), you can easily grab a local bus (about 20 mins) to the Ngong Ping cable car that takes you across the water and hills to the Big Buddha. If you can plan in advance, prepay for the cable car and you can walk to the front of the queue. Otherwise, it took me about 45 mins from the very back of the queue until I was on the gondola -- consider if you can take the heat of Hong Kong and standing this entire time. The views are so lovely from the cable car with its glass-bottom, as you see people walking the trail below you, and then, the Big Buddha starts to appear in the distance. Walk through the village, and up the avenue until you can walk the steps up to the Big Buddha. Take your time and appreciate the enormity of it, plus the great views of the valley. Go over to the monastery and smell the incense burning on the way. The tiles on the roofs are so incredible on the buildings there.I wish I had given myself more time in this area.

We walked around the free section inside the base, looking at the prayer walls which was very interesting but did not pay to go in further. Going on a rainy day also helps no being bogged down by other tourists. We didn't have to squeeze through mobs to climb the many stairs up to Big Buddha nor in the shops in Ngong Ping.

            "review": "An Absolute Must-See for Hong Kong Tourism. I visited the Big Buddha (Tian Tan), also known as the Po Lin Monastery on Lantau, pretty much because it's the thing to do when you visit Hong Kong. After visiting, I understand the criticism and cynicism surrounding it, but still feels it's very much worth the visit, even on days when the view is less than spectacular.I only had a few days to spend doing touristy things in and around Hong Kong so I visited Lantau on the clearest day available, according to reports from the observatory. In late May this meant that the Buddha was shrouded in a cloud. No worries, there was still plenty to see and do and I ended up spending the better part of the day on my trip there.I road the gondola up to the tourist village at the top of the mountain. I recommend the \"crystal cabin\". It gives you an interesting view of the hiking trails and waterfalls on the way up, and I noticed the lines were shorter at both the bottom and the top of the mountain. The tourist village is, well, a tourist village. Shops, restaurants, various tourist \"experiences\". I'm told it offers a lovely view of the Buddha as well, but there was no view on the day I visited because everything was in a cloud. But it was cool and had some interesting shopping. Next to the village are some food vendors and shops owned and run by several families. They had some fabulous spicy noodles and fish balls, which I enjoyed for lunch. [There was no one available to purchase tickets from for the vegetarian lunch at the monastery, so I ended up skipping that.] The walk towards the Buddha has the 12 generals that represent the zodiac symbols, and you might find some roaming cattle, buffalo, and dogs. The hike up the iconic stairs to the Buddha isn't so bad for someone in reasonable physical shape. There are landings along the way to catch your breath. Once you get to the top, there's lots of space for a breather, and to get pictures of the Buddha and surrounding divas. My pictures turned out interesting due to the cloud. There are gift shops inside the Buddha, along with a wall of remembrance. Purchases made there support the monastery. The Buddha and stairs are relatively new, so the walk down is not so much of a challenge. I was repeatedly passed by kids counting out the steps. 268, in case you're curious. I next walked to the Wisdom Path, which contains large boards with various sayings from Confucius. This area was more \"Disney\" in my opinion, due to the knots of people in various parts. But it was a lovely walk and I finished it by doing the short 2.5 km \"fun walk\" through the forest. Upon returning to the main area surrounding the Buddha I visited the various temples. The artistry is exceptional. Make sure you visit the temple of 10,000 Buddhas to see the amazing ceiling. I then stopped by the snack bar for some sweets, including my favorite peanut filled, coconut encrusted glutinous rice balls, sesame balls, and coconut jelly. Delicious! And the best I had while I was in Hong Kong.In all, it was a fun and lovely way to spend a day. The weather wasn't perfect and I didn't get the majestic view that others have reported from the Big Buddha. And, yes, there were many other tourists there. But it was fun. One day I'll return, perhaps with enough energy to tackle some of the miles and miles of gorgeous hiking trails surrounding the monastery. The monastery and Big Buddha are free to visit, but the gondola ride has a fee."

The Big Budha and Po Lin Monastery on Lantau Island fall into that category. The Big Budha is impressive from a distance and close up and the views are fantastic. The Monastery is also beautiful. There are quite a few tourists visiting besides you so be prepared, of course the earlier in the morning that you go, the less people as the cable car opens a little later than the buses start running. We were staying in Kowloon near the Tsim Shan Tsui metro station so we left from there, taking the (Red) Tsuen Wan line to Lai King, transferring to the (Mustard) Tung Chung line to Tung Chung. (Can't remember the exact amount but approx 20HK$) After departing the metro via Exit B, we walked towards the Ngong Ping cable car to the bus interchange. Note, you will pass one bus interchange, continue past it and the signs for the cable car to find the station for bus #23 Ngong Ping Village. The bus departs every 20 min or so and is 17.20HK$ per person one way, exact change required. The bus took about half an hour. The Big Budha and temple are the last stop on the bus route. You can pay to have lunch in the Budha and/or visit the museum in the Budha otherwise there is no fee. There are a few shops and food options around the Budha and in the village. We didn't return to Kowloon, instead we went to Hong Kong Central, therefore took a different bus back but all buses leave from an interchange near the village. When leaving the monastery, walk into the village keeping an eye out to the left for a sign for the bus terminus (we saw it through an alley).To go to the ferry terminal for Central we took bus #2 Mui Wo, it also leaves every 20 min and is 17.4HK$. The ferry terminal is the last stop and the bus appears to time it perfectly for you to catch the next ferry. The ferry to Central was 24.50 per person.Both the bus from Tung Chung and Mui Wo pass beautiful beaches and if we would have known, would have packed our suits and made a day of it. It was considerably less humid on Lantau and the beaches were empty."

The benefit of getting there early was that we were one of the first up the top which was really nice and we could see everything and take pictures without masses around us. The monastery is really nice. We only stayed about an hour in all then took bus 23 to fishing village and bus 11 back to MTR. If you want to do that and avoid queues to get back down in cable car just buy one way ticket then use Octopus card on bus."

This is absolutely amazing and great fun. the only down side was the queing to get onto the cable car. We had pre purchased our ticket and we still had to wait in a line which was as long as those who had to purchase the tickets. Not certain if this was a problem on this particular day or just the norm. the only people who seemed to fast track the long queue was those with grip tickets. However, it was worth the wait. Fantastic views although on our day there was a little mist around the Buddha although this did not detract from the experience.The way down was even better as we had a cable car to ourselves.Well worth the journey."

On the other its a totally overrun tourist trap.Seeing the Buddha in beautiful, mountainous surroundings is really something special but the trek through the tourist trap village and hordes of day trippers make it tough to wholeheartedly recommend if you have to pick and choose what you're able to see while in HK. I guess in that regard it's no different than most other monuments throughout the world.I expected some degree of reverence there since the Buddha is basically part of a large working monastery but it was all a bit trampled on. Especially within the monastery at the foot of the Buddha people paid little regard to calls for quiet to respect worshipers as well as signs clearly stating no photos.All that said, the statue itself and the setting is beautiful as is the stunning architecture within the monastery. If you only have a few days in HK I think this is a skippable attraction but I can understand if others deem it a must see. All depends on your style of travel."

We visited the 'green buddha' or 'Big Buddha', formally the Tian Tan Buddha statue, on the recommendation of friends and we weren't disappointed.We got there by cable car from Tung Chung Station. The Ngong Ping Cable Car is a treat in itself and well worth taking in its own right! It takes around 25 minutes - you get the choice between glass bottom ('crystal') or ordinary cable car. We took the crystal car and got some breathtaking views through our feet - you spend more time looking out sideways at the view - so if budget is an issue take the ordinary cable car and you won't miss much.We went on a Monday and the queues for the cable car were quite light, so you'd better get advice on queue times on weekends and bank holidays as my friend from HK said there can be over an hour on a clear day. As soon as you are on the cable car and sat, a photographer takes your picture and the printed photo is waiting for you at the end of the journey at the top held by a smiling assistant suggesting you 'purchase the memory'. This happened going up and down on the cable car and it's up to you, as it's not a very hard sell.Normally the rule is 'exit via the gift shop' but in this case it's entry via the gift shop, after which it's a walk for around 10 minutes through a modern shopping plaza with gift shops and food and drinks outlets, to the bottom of the stairs to the Buddha, or the entry to the Po Lin Monastery complex. We didn't spend a lot of time at the monastery, we just entered the complex and the hall, but it is free and it's well worth visiting because of the peaceful gardens, beautiful architecture and the occasional monk (on his mobile phone?!) wandering around. You can buy incense and gifts with profits going to the monks charitable work. I would imagine on a busy weekend it's a little less peaceful, with the .We spent more time at the Buddha. We climbed the 268 steps for a closer look at this remarkable statue. We had a cloudy day with the occasional break in the cloud - make sure you check the weather because you will be enclosed in cloud if it's a rainy day! The experience of being so close to this magnificent statue and to enjoy the sweeping mountain and sea views was really special. The combination of the cable car ride and Buddha visit was a really worthwhile trip and we are left with some amazing views and photos."

From there, you can take the cable car or a bus (the bus terminal is past the cable car building). Be sure to check the website the night before, we had pre-purchased cable car tickets on line to avoid the ticket line, but discovered that the cable car would be closed for maintenance on the day we were going. I was able to contact the company telling them that the cable car was closed and received a refund for my tickets. We took the bus (#23)instead which was an interesting ride through the area but you miss out on the views you get from the cable car. We arrived early wanting to beat the crowds and had to wait about 10 minutes for them to open the gate to the Big Buddha steps. The benefit to going early, we had no other people in our pictures as we headed up the 268 steps and had cooler temperatures. Although I had seen pictures, I was amazed at the sheer size of the Buddha. At the base, you have the option of purchasing a combo ticket which allows entry inside the Buddha as well as lunch or a snack at the monastery vegetarian restaurant. Since we were there early, it was too early for lunch so we got the snack option. I don't think it was worth going inside the Buddha, there are exhibits but not much to see. I would skip the snack option as well. The lunch might be better, if you buy the deluxe lunch, you are seated in a nice dining room area versus just the outdoor picnic tables. This might be worth it if you are needing a break from the temperatures. Take some time to walk through the monastery. I would also highly recommend taking the bus from here to Tai O fishing village.

Amazing to see the Big Buddha statue perched on top of another hill. We had to climb approximately 260 steps to reach the 112 Ft Bronze statue. Inside the statue there is a prayer hall. My wife did some meditation there. We had bought the ticket with snacks coupon. So upon climbing down we went to the Monastery. In a very green, clean environments we picked up some wholesome Vegetarian Snacks. They were top quality. We also saw a very beautiful 10,000 Buddha Temple. "

Also, if you see random people selling tickets on the side - check the prices and it's only a marginal markup to avoid the mass queue.

From here, you can take the Ngong Ping 360 degree cable car to the Big Buddha. Honestly, the cable car ride was my favorite part. The Big Buddha was very picturesque and the views from the top of the surround islands was beautiful. The 250 steps is actually not that difficult. There's a short walk through Ngong Ping Village shops until you see the monastery and Big Buddha. Set aside at least 4 hours as getting to and from this attraction can be almost an hour each way (lines/queues plus the 25 minute cable car ride)."

It hasseveral buildings but the main Hall is very impressive. Unfortunately they do not allowany photo or video. On the left side there is a public eating hall where vegetarian foodis service at a very reasonable price (this is basically what the monks eat, mostly vegetables, mushrooms and none meat duck, chicken and BBQ made with dough).Best dish is the curry vegetarian meat and the ice-cream. Getting there is a little tricky,but the best way is to take the MTR Subway to Tung Chung station then the long cable car ride over the mountains. It's a tranquil ride on top of mountains in a noisy bustling City with concrete high rises every where. It's an experience! You can get detail information free from Hong Kong Tourism Board office at the air-port or at the Star Ferry on Kowloon side. They also give you all the maps etc...Free!"

The Big Buddha is exactly what the name says it is. It's big and it sits on a hill. There are many ancient temples, buddhas and monuments in China. A buddha on a hill that was built in 1993 can not hold its own against such competition..... but for some reason people keep coming to see it (including your humble reviewer). If it was a site that you could visit incidentally than sure it may be worth seeing but visiting the Big Buddha will take half your day at best.It's not all bad. The best thing about the Big Buddha is the cable car ride. It offers a truly spectacular view of the mountains and the airport (really very interesting to see). But you will have to wait so long to get on it that, like the Big Buddha, its just not worth the effort. Note I arrive at the cable car 15 minutes after it opened in the morning and still had to wait over an hour to get on."

The visit to the Tai-o village for those familiar with Asia, is not really worth paying extra, but if included, one can spend some time there with a boat ride, see some white dolphins and eat a snack or two! It is a good idea to spend tome time at the Big Buddha complex and take in the views, relax and watch the goings-on. There are reasonable restrooms though not clean compared to western standards."

Took the Ngong Ping cable car to reach here. Sadly it started raining so got a bit misty during the ride. But luckily found a friend who shared her umbrella so good for me :D Walked around a bit. It was a fun experience. There's a flight of stairs to actually reach the Big Buddha. There was a small museum like space once u reach up. Took the bus back because I could see another set of places on the way back. Overall it was a lovely experience."

You see a lot on the way, and is less crowded than the subway option.The Buddha is relatively new, but a very impressive sight. Also the working monastery next to it is very interesting to see. Very richly decorated and with a relaxing atmosphere. Highly recommended."

Each picture costs HKD 190.Walk and window shopping about 10 minutes through the 2 rows of shops and restaurants before crossing a little street to reach the entrance arch of Po Lin Monastery. From here, you can see Big Buddha at a distant. Walked about 7 minutes before arriving at the foot of the stairways to Big Buddha.Big Buddha at the top of the hill and Po Lin Monastery directly below. Many devotees burning incense, joss papers and offering flowers to their God. Many tourists, many locals and many Chinese from mainland were there. As this is in the highland and rural area, its a little cooler and saw few cows walking about. The monastery offers vegetarian meal. Many stalls sell spring water bean curd (\u6cc9\u6c34\u8c46\u82b1).Do not expect much... it's just 120 metres of pedestrian shopping mall (selling quite similar stuff), monastery and Big Buddha. Otherwise you will be disappointed.Half day required to complete this touring on DIY basis."

From the station you can either take Nong Ping cable car ride for HKD 130 (60 minutes wait if you haven't booked in advance) or bus number 23 for HKD 26 (max 15 minutes wait). You can combine the best of both, take one way cable car to the big buddha and a bus back.* Bus stand at Tung Chung is right beside the Nong Ping Cable Car Station* At the top bus stand is adjoining the Nong Ping Village.For those restless feet that love to trek, you may choose to trek up and down all along the cable car line. From the cable car you can see the trek running down through the hills. (My next to do on the list! ) Make sure you start early in the morning as this may take some time (2.5 - 4 hours depending on your fitness level)What to eat? There are plenty of food options available with Chinese, Japenese, Italian and Indian cuisines. You may even opt for a vegetarian meal at the Po Lin Monastery.What else?Po Lin Monastery that houses hall of hero temple and temple of 1000 Buddhas. You can visit the fishing village which is further away."

They are made of glass (even the floor) so it's a great green view for some cool pictures. Also, you can see the Big Buddha from afar and your way up in the sky so you can really be wowed by its size !! Once arriving to the town, it's quite touristy and you can pick up some souvenirs but walking up to the Big Buddha and seeing its immense size is what leaves you breathless. It's nice going during the day, and if it's foggy and then starts clearing up, it's beautiful to watch the clouds go through the Buddha and appreciate its solid structure. Evenings trips are even better, just before they close you can get pictures with no people !!! A must see !!!"

The walk up to the Buddha can be tiring but its worth the walk for the view and the impressive Buddha. If you pay for a meal (goes towards supporting the monks and monastery) you can walk up through the middle of the Buddha.There are a number of add-ons you can do whilst on Lantau, including visiting a fishing village and tours around the monastery and also overnight stays. Later in the afternoon the fog started to roll in and this gave the whole area quite a mystical feeling."

I visited on Buddha's birthday (14th May), you can get here different ways, I did the cable car and chose the crystal car it has a glass bottom for an interesting view, it takes around 30-40 mins and offers spectacular views. You'll arrive at Npong village and from here it's about a 15min walk through the village to the steps to go up to Buddha. Once at the tope you can walk around and go inside where there is a lot to see. Once back down you can then go over to the monastery which again you can look around, right next door is a great vegetarian restaurant. Back in Npong there are plenty of places to eat. There are various tickets you can but at the cable car ticket office, if you have the day like I did I went for the land sea sky ticket, so you get the cable car to the top, coach to Tai O fishing village and a boat tour to see Tai O houses on stilts. Well worth it, but major tip here, the coach goes from the Buddha DO NOT come back down in the cable car otherwise you have to pay extra for a bus to get to Tia O. The bus No. 21 goes from Buddha to Tia O, then back fro Tia O to Buddha then you get the cable car back down."

I have visited the Big Buddha twice, once with friends and once alone and I must admit I have mixed feelings about it.It is undeniable that the bronze statue is impressive to see - climbing the steps to the top to gaze at the statue and the surrounding views are wonderful, however personally my sense of wonder was slightly diminished by the cheap commercial feel of Ngong Ping village.Taking the cable car from Tung Chung to Ngong Ping was a fantastic experience and I did enjoy absolutely wonderful views of Lantau island. I got a crystal bottom cable car which takes you up the peaks of Lantau and shows you incredible scenery. I have to admit the trip to get to Ngong Ping was one of my highlights. But then you actually get to the village.It is undeniably gimmick-y, with many tacky tourist shops shamelessly hawking souvenirs every second shop, and offering information about the \"history\" of the Big Buddha (which felt slightly redundant as the statue is currently only just over 20 years old).However once you make your way through the tacky tourist haven you get to see the huge statue - you climb the 200 or so stairs to the top and you can wonder at what is truly a remarkable statue. The atmosphere at the top of the statue is a lot more relaxed and almost serene with a number of smaller statues to admire and some interesting information about the statue inside.But personally my favourite part of the trip was after I descended the steps again and visited the Po Lin Monastery. This was one of my personal highlights of my two trips there - the monastery is a true piece of Hong Kong history and it is beautiful. The gardens are atmospheric, the smell of burning incense is intoxicating and the view of the ten thousand Buddhas monastery is absolutely breathtaking.My advice - ignore the tourist traps, have a quick jaunt up to see the Buddha, but really take your time to enjoy the real gem here - the Po Lin monastery."

The journey took about 45 from Central.The cable car ride was spectacular, did not expect HK to be so green. The run way of the airport was visible when we were passing mountains. The gorgeous meditating Buddha awaited us when approaching the temple.Had vegetarian temple style dim sum after paying our respect, all very nice and highly recommendable for a nice half day trip"

Crystal Cabin was worth it, but all three shows - walking with Buddha (short video of Buddha's life, 15 min), 360 motion (4D video of Kowloon, 15 min) and the action movie hero show (about 15 mins) - was definitely waste of money and time. Just take a cabin, walk around Budha and in surrounding areas. I was little bummed when I found out that there are beautiful hikes everywhere around, but since I wasn't wearing proper shoes, I didn't wanna go. If you're a hiker, definitely get ready for this."

For the brave, there is a great photo opportunity - sit or lie on the floor with the sea etc underneath you!

The first thing you see are Starbucks and Subway shops if you arrive via cable car which I recommend.The statue itself is very impressive, but to fully appreciate it up close, be prepared to climb a rather long staircase. This requires lot's of people dodging as everyone stops to take photos, but If you enjoy photo bombing you will particularly enjoy the sheer number of opportunities along the way.The site is ideally located to proceed onward to Tai O which is also worth a visit. and the two combined easily can fill a day"

We decided to embark on our trip to Lantau Island to see the Tian Tan Big Buddha quite late in the day in the face of a \"red level\" storm warning. Luckily, we were rewarded by a break in the weather, and beautiful views of the Buddha, which later became shrouded in cloud. The storm warning may have served to dissuade visitors, and the complex seemed very quiet and peaceful, and not at all crowded, despite coinciding with the Buddha's Birthday period. The Cable Car was closed due to the weather when we arrived in Tung Chung after an easy journey on the MTR. There is a bus terminus adjacent to the Cable Car complex, and it was easy to locate the number 23 bus to Ngong Ping. We used our Octopus cards which cost around $HK 17 for a one way weekday trip. We were mesmerised by the statue of the Big Buddha, illuminated briefly by sunlight, and rising above the densely wooded hillside. We found the walk up the 268 stairs towards the Buddha to be a very special experience, and enjoyed walking in and around the statue (for the price of a Vegetrarian meal at the monastery, although general admission to the Buddha itself is free. The extra purchase did not add a lot to our visit, but we were happy to support the community.) It was beautiful to be able to look out over the cloud mist strewn landscape and the monastery complex. We loved exploring the monastery complex, despite the rain and mist. The Buddha was obscured by cloud on our return from the monastery, but emerged again, later. The cloud was very atmospheric, although it would be disappointing not to have been able to see the statue at all. There was plenty to see and do at the complex, and we did not even enter the tourist village area. The bus terminus and number 23 bus were again easy to locate, and there were options to taxi or bus to Tai O. Our return trip to Victoria Harbour via bus and MTR took over two hours, but we had a wonderful time."

Board the bus at the terminus outside Tung Chung MTR station. Have a tourist Octopus card with value to pay the bus fare of $17.20 one way on weekday. Pay the exact fare or overpay if you do not have enough coins as the driver doesn't give change. The trip is 45 minutes one way up a sometimes winding road. The return trip costs the same and takes as long. It's scenic so choose a window seat. At the temple at the foot of the Big Buddha, do what you need. The vegetarian deli food is mediocre and oily.

We took the cable car for the spectacular view (25 minute ride) but there is a cheaper less scenic bus option as well. Note on cable car - we hadn't pre-bought tix so we had to wait over an hour and a half to take the cable car up. This was at about noon on a weekday. I suggest getting there early or somehow buying your ticket in advance to avoid the crazy long line. Note - when you get to top of the cable car line (before Buddha and monetary) there are little shops and restaurants (subway, kebab shop, noodles, pizza, dessert, etc). Note - the mrt drops you off near outlet mall. Prices in this mall do not appear to be discounted (don't get your hopes up on any deals - more expensive than standard US pricing)."

(I also wish I had known that before eating overpriced instant noodles at a food stall.) The Buddha is set in a picturesque location, and the views are breathtaking. After, you should definitely try to catch a bus to Tai O, and get lost in the labyrinth of all of the houses on stilts! The ride is about 30 minutes. P.S.

The trip was interesting from seeing different landscapes. Once we arrived on the grounds, there were tons of shops selling souvenirs. Also funny sights like wandering water buffalo that were more than willing to pose for photos. Walking up the steps leaves one a bit breathless, but is doable for most. The gardens are lovely. We did this on a cloudy day, so it was a \"mystic\" experience. This would be something a tourist would only do once."

We used the in town check-in at Hong Kong Station and took the MTR to the Tung Chun MTR stop, where the Ngong Ping Cable Cars leave to go to the Big Buddha locaiton. If you do have luggage, you could also store it in the basement parking levels of the outlet mall attached to the Tung Chun MTR. We left some packages there of purchases we had made in town. I noticed that you need to get there early, only a few lockers were left when we got there at 11am and they were only the smaller ones.The cable car ride is great, look below on the hills on the path that people were walking to go to the Buddha. It must be quite the amazing hike to get there! When you exit the cable car station, there are many places to eat and shop. It only takes about 10 minutes to walk to the monastery and then you can begin the climb up to the Buddha. Finally reaching the top, you can walk around the base of the 112 foot tall statue, which is surrounded by large beautiful statues of Buddhist saints, in poses of making offerings to the Buddha.Inside the statue is a temple where offerings can be made to the Buddha, although we did not go in. If we had more time, I would have enjoyed having a vegetarian meal at the monastery, tickets are sold at the base of the statue. Unfortunately we had to head out to the airport."

The cable car has a pleasant view, the village is small and beautiful. To arrive at the Buddha you need to go up on a high stair but the view is nice. There is sort of a small museum with some old writings about Buddhism owned by the Monastery, quite interesting.I surely recommend."

The first day we went, we arrived at about 2:30 pm and we weren't even allowed in because it would've taken too long to make it to the front of the line. I'd say get there by noon at the LATEST! Once you wait in line for hours, you take a cable car to the Big Buddha entrance. The cable car offers great views on the way up, and you can see the Big Buddha in the distance. Once you arrive, you can see that the Big Buddha was worth the wait and journey. You'll pass a bunch of shops and cafes on the way to the steps to get to the Big Buddha. This actually worked out for us because i hadn't bought souvenirs yet, and i got all my souvenirs at this one attraction. I purchased a beautiful Lady Buddha. We also saw plenty of cows roaming that were people friendly. I saw many kids walking up to them, though I wouldn't recommend. The stairs leading up to the Big Buddha are not too bad. I'd say wear comfortable shoes or sneakers. The only negative is that the attraction is so crowded that it's difficult to get pictures without a million people in them. I'm not sure if there's a less crowded time, but i doubt it. The Big Buddha is beautiful and definitely a sight to see. Very spiritual and we saw many people praying there. There are 3 statues of Lady Buddha surrounding the Big Buddha, which are equally beautiful.There's also an outlet mall across the street connected to the train station. We took the train to Big Buddha from the W Hong Kong and found it very convenient."

It resembles an old Chinese village, though, the establishments there are now more modern.From the village, you have to walk for another 15 minutes to get to the foot of the stairs going to the Buddha.

First of all if there is three or more of you get a taxi as this will work out quicker and cheaper. Secondly book your tickets on line and again this will save you money. The third and final bit of advise is do NOT go at the weekends, make it a Monday morning if you can and get there for 10:00am and you will be some of the first up to the top. Beware that the weather can change within seconds up there so pack something small and light like a stuff coat just in case. This trip can be done in half a day leaving you time to come back down to earth and then back to the top of the Tram Peak again all in one day. Im not religious at all but this is still a great place to visit."

One of the advantages of this is less to do with the view it offers but on your return journey you can avoid lengthy queues.The site has many shops for food and souvenirs that complement rather than detract from the attraction. We ate sone good Chinese food at the garden restaurant although the shops did not do enough to part with our money.Then of course there is Big Buddha. The attraction offers excellent photographic opportunities although there are more than 250 steps to climb and can be slippy when wet.A lot of people advise going early to avoid the numbers: we didn't and went around lunch time and the site was not too busy. This was probably due to the wet weather showers. This provided awesome views of mist during the cable car ride that only added to the day."

If you don't take any thing from this post its PURCHASE AHEAD OF TIME! The last time I went I spent and 1 hour and 45 minutes on line. And it could have been much worse. You also share the cable car with other people if you don't have more than 7 people in your party. The tempature is a like chillier up there as well.

Just the walk up the stairs and around was enough spiritual enlightenment for me.Lunch was interesting, walk to the temple where they serve vegetarian meals. Its low key, i guess humbling in a way. Noodles, lentil cakes breads. Not too bad and good for the budget.Walking, walking, souvenir time. Plenty of souvenirs to be seen, some expensive too.Compared to other souvenirs at other attractions these were interesting. A couple came home with us.I guess the walking totalled 12km just at the Budha and temple...If I recall there is a Starbucks so a brew is certainly left until the finish line,,,,then its a walk to the cable car.Oh yes, HUGE factory outlet shopping near cable cars a must visit on the way home.Waldoeview"

It was so foggy, even at Buddha's feet, we could not see his face. You can pay extra to get inside and have a vegetarian meal. Afterwards, we did the wisdom path and then the po Lin monastery. To get there we took MTR toTung Chung station. There you can catch the cable cars ( check out their website for pricing nong ping 360) or the bus up to Big Buddha.

As you get closer it's just surreal. There are over 200 steps to get up to the Buddha and then you can walk around the perimeter of it. There is also an Exhibition Hall underneath that is worth a look. This is well worth a visit when you are in Hong Kong."

We took a day trip to Lantau Island, and took the cable car up to Ngong Ping village. Pay the extra for the \"crystal gondola car\" - it is very cool looking straight down for the ride up. The Buddha is pretty spectacular. It's several hundred steps up, and worth it for the 360-degree view of the island. The statues around the Buddha I found to be more interesting than the Buddha itself (himself?).2 thumbs up!"

It was so foggy at the top of the mountain that we couldn't even see the Buddha. I've been there before and it was amazing. Was disappointed that I couldn't see it clearly this time, especially since it's my parents and my husband's first time. Public transportation: take any MTR, but essentially you want to get on the Orange line to end of the line Tung Chung station. From there, follow signs to the Ngong Ping 360 cable car. You have the option to hike up Lantau mountain (4 hours or so is what I've been hearing) or take the cable car up (20 min). One way $155 HKD or round trip $185 HKD. The crystal car has a glass bottom but is $255 HKD. The queues are also shorter. If you go during busy time, it might be worth paying extra just to get there faster. I believe you can take a bus back down if you don't want to do round trip cable car. We went on cloudy day, so for extra $30 we just decided to take the cable car back down. Once you get there, you have to walk past the Buddhist monastery and then up a few flights of stairs to get to the Big Buddha. We went on a foggy cloudy day (it's rainy season april) so wasn't much we could see but it was still pretty cool to walk through the fog."

You can walk the mountainous trail to the Big Buddha but it looks exhausting. December trip. We got views of the Buddha about the last third of the cable car. We paid to go in the museum inside the Buddha and it was well worth the walk up. April trip: We saw nothing through the fog. We could barely see anything in front of us and even when we are next to the Buddha the details were obscured. This time I paid to go in the museum and eat vegetarian lunch at the monastery.

This then crept up a flight of stairs and along the overhead gangway. We were in the queue for 2 hours and the queue was at least that long ahead of us. And, as it's a cable car, the queue coming back from the top will be the same. 6 hours in a queue - no thank you. We bailed out having wasted that long and paid another $25 taxi back to Hong Kong. It was made all the more annoying in that some people have priority tickets and just walked up to the front (well - near the front!)

The tour company was quick to respond to my emails, and they picked us up right on time at the hotel (Salisbury YMCA), and transferred us to the tour bus. We didn't pay until that morning. We had an informative and friendly guide, and the fishing village we visited was interesting. When we arrived at the Buddha, it was just starting to get misty, but by the time we got off the bus and walked to the base, we could barely see the Buddha; parts would appear and then disappear in the fog. It was still interesting, even though we certainly didn't get to see the view that they show on the brochure. There are two temples that you visit, and the large one is beautiful. But a highlight of the day was the vegan meal served in the restaurant. They served (family-style) a variety of delicious dishes, and as a vegetarian I didn't have to keep asking what I could eat. My husband can't eat gluten, and there was only one dish out of nine that had any wheat in it. The best meal of our trip! There is a new \"shopping mall\" area, which seemed so out of place. The tour included the cable car, which I think would normally be a great trip\u2014with the fog, we couldn't see the trees underneath our cable car, so obviously couldn't enjoy the view. The weather forecast had said there might be a little rain, which wasn't a problem for us, but the dense fog was a surprise and certainly put a damper on what we could see. So check the weather carefully before heading out to Lantau Island."

So amazing and well worth the trip.I was told to \"arrive early\" so as to see the Big Buddha without dealing with crowds, but no one defined \"early\". I showed up at the bus stop a bit after 8:00 am and caught the 8:15 bus to the top, arriving around 9:00. (I would preferred the tram but it was closed for maintenance). 9:00 didn't seem that early to me but at this hour the Po Lin Monastery was practically deserted and barely waking up. I got to explore the grounds, take photos without anyone in the background, and peruse the souvenirs in a most leisurely way being the only one looking at the merchandise. Be aware, however, that the food stands don't open until 10 and the restaurant doesn't open until 11. So, yes, you do want to go early but eat first! Walking, exploring, climbing 256 steps up to the Big Buddha, walking around the top, descending 256 stairs back down, walking around some more - you'll need a good breakfast to fuel your trip. Enjoy!"

Inside the buddha is a muesum too. Lots to do. Recommend paying for the muesum $38Hk per person as this gives you snacks at the monastery as well.You have a lot of steps to climb to get there so take tour time. Ignore the fog, it comes and goes and you will get clear photo opportunities. We took oir 4 and 6 year old with no issues. Highly recommended."

Cheaper than the shops in Hong Kong but better quality then the Markets.Took a glass bottom cable car worth the extra - enjoyed our stay at the top. Plenty to look at. Took the bus to the fishing village had lunch and then back on the bus to Mui Wo Pier. Had a couple of drinks at China Bear which I would recommend then caught the ferry back to Hong Kong Island. Can catch the cable car back down which I think might be more calming as the bus trip was quite an adventure however overall with the bus then ferry home added to the experience."

            "review": "A few tips for the trip to big bhuda. For sure a must see activity in Hong Kong. 3o minutes on the MTR to the base of the gondola. Tip 1: go early and you will avoid line ups and crowds. We were at the gondola by 10:00 am and there were no lines and the tour busses were only just arriving. Tip 2: buy the crystal car, not just for the glass bottom experience which is absolutely awesome, much more exciting than just looking out the window (I am scared of heights but after a minute or two I was so glad to have chosen the crystal car. The number one advantage to crystal car is hardly anyone else was choosing it so on the way back we by passed the 60 minute long line for the return trip and we were on the gondola within 10 minutes. Tip 3: combined with early arrival take the trip down to Tai O fishing village. If you beat the crowds you can see the village with ease and comfort. The boat ride is a nice break from the heat but don't expect to see dolphins, just enjoy the ride. if you want a break from the heat get a Vietnamese coffee at Espace Elastique B&B.....in this old village it is a gem with air conditioning, cold beverages, great ambiance."

Ours swayed in the wind and at some points we had no visibility. The 'village' that you walk through to get to the Buddha is an overpriced tourist tacky 'village' which is ironic considering what you are walking to. It is defiantly worth the trip, if your feeling healthy you can ever walk up or down, I have no idea how long that would take, but plan carefully as there's no lights and we saw some people who I am sure would be walking in the dark."

Everyone seemed so focussed on taking pictures of themselves with their selfie sticks - it seemed so jarring at such a spiritual site. As did all the shops selling trinkets. I know it goes to support the monks but it feels a little strange. We took the boat from no. 6 pier and the bus that goes along the beach road. We were going to take the cable car back but due to the bad weather it wasn't running - the boat and bus is a really lovely and much cheaper option so we didn't feel we missed out too much. On a sunny day you could stop at the beach and that would be a wonderful day out. I'd recommend getting there as early as possible to miss the crowds and have a more peaceful visit."

The journey up the mountain is quite sightful, you will see cows roaming the roads and not letting the bus pass at some time and also go past a very scenic reservoir with pretty clear waters.At the end of the journey, will see the buddha on top of the staircase after walking for about 150m. I didnt think that the buddha was particularly appealing but the climb up was quite worthwhile for a good view out into sea. I didnt purchase the meal vouchers as they were quite expensive. almost 100HKD/person for vegetarian food. Instead we went to the vegetarian cafe and had some noodles and curry (didnt think it was worth the 50hkd spent)Do check out the wisdom path. It is further down from the steps of the buddha. its a good 20min walk and you will arrive at a little garden with massive tree trunks with inscriptions. although i could not read and understand most of the sayings, it was quite a beautiful scenary. There are many trails that lead up and down from the wisdom path, the trails should take anywhere from 2 to 4 hours to complete so do check them out if you have the time. We walked back to the bus depot to go down via the same bus 23 to citygate outlet mall for some shopping!ps the cows are very friendly and photogenic HAHAH"

If you are fit you could walk up the 268 steps but we chose the bus up and walked down. Take time to go into the Buddha and look at the artefacts including the 'icon'. Part of the tour included a vegetarian lunch. We were quite apprehensive however we were pleasantly surprised. There are a lot of tourists each day but there is plenty of room to find a place to sit.

First you need to get to the Lantau island using MTR is the best choice. If you use the straightforward approach and ride the cable car you will get scenic views and huge queues and prices. However, there is a Bus Terminus right beside the cable car station. From there you can take the bus 23, which goes longer, but is much cheaper, not that long to wait for and the route is quite scenic as well. The Buddha and the Po Lin monastery are really beautiful and relaxing (except the 260 steps you need to climb to reach Buddha :)Keep in mind, that in the evening there are a lot of people willing to leave the place, so the queues to the bus and cable car can take more than an hour."

Luckily the day I went to see the Big Buddha it was lovely weather, I was took a ferry from Peng Chau to Mui Wo (Silver Mine Bay) and then from there you walk across the road and wait for the coach. All very easy! And clearly visible which coach goes to The Big Buddha - lots of tourists around so ask someone if unsure. The coach is around 40 minutes, I enjoyed the ride, the views are wonderful, I paid with my octopus card, I think it was $27 HKD. It's one of the top tourist destinations, there were lots of people there, and also a few cows! You make your way to the bottom of The Big Buddha and start the climb of nearly 300 steps!!! Once up there the views are incredible! It was a clear day so I see around for miles. Even though there were a fair few people I managed to take some brilliant photos. The Big Buddha is amazing and you get to see all the finer detail from the top. You also see the Monastery from up there, you must also have a look there too. Beautiful & wonderful smells from the incense sticks. The monastery is quite something, I enjoyed wondering around. Its quite peaceful place considering the amount of people there also, and lots of photo opportunities to have if that's your kind of thing. I would recommend for anyone to go there, it's a lovely day out. "

As we were a party of 5 we got the taxi down for $50 as we had just missed the bus, we didn't buy return cable car tickets."

The extraordinary Tian Tan Buddha statue (informally known as the Big Buddha) was erected in 1993. Sitting 34 metres high and facing north to look over the Chinese people, this majestic bronze Buddha draws pilgrims from all over Asia. Climb the 268 steps for a closer look at this remarkable statue, and to enjoy the sweeping mountain and sea views that can be seen from its base.

If you want to get there you can use MTR ( which is very easy to use ) by orange color and use it up to last stop Tung Chung. Then go to cable car ( I have no queue ) if you have queue you can wait even two hours. To avoid one queue to buy ticket do it by Internet day before. Smaller line is when you buy ticket for crystal cabin ( crystal cabin means floor is made from glass ). It is more expensive ticket but more fun. When you get ticket you go have to go ahead to another line and wait wait and wait to get cable car. Trip takes 25 minutes by cable car. If you want avoid problems with queue you can take taxi or buses. It takes 45 minutes by these transport. If you already on top you are lucky and you can enjoy with Buddha and his temples ;)When you finish sightseeing this place you can go to visit one of old style fishing village Tai O. To get there you must back close of top stop cable car Buddha and take bus no. 21. It ride once per hour you can check time table when you arrived to Buddha. I took taxi to get this village because I didn't check time table and I was to late ( taxi costed me 51 HK$)Tai O is really old village and there you can see how fisher family lives. It is nice to see but it is also pity how bad they live. To back from this village you can again back to Buddha by bus or taxi or you can directly use taxi or bus to get Hong Kong MTR station. I back to Buddha and then cable car. I like it."

I love the boat trip over to the island not only because of the deity; I really love the food they serve in small little restaurants at the bottom of the hill. If the size of the Buddha is directly proportional to the blessings you get, well, it is well worth the trip. If not, you will be well compensated by the beautiful scenery from a high vantage point. They also serve nice vegetarian meals at the food hall. Wonder around at the little shops and small forested area would be a bonus for your trip. If the idea is to relax in body and spirit, well, you got it there. Night life is good for sea food there. Going up to the top of the Buddha requires an entrance fee. However, I think the fee is well worth it if being able to get inside the Buddha would make you more holy. Lots of Buddhist artifacts are also available in the bowels of the Buddha. I guess getting into the bowels of Buddha is ok since he is vegetarian. There are many steps to get into the Buddha so it maybe somewhat too demanding for the old and disabled. Dont think there are elevators into the Buddha but there are cable cars to cross to the island if you dont like taking the boat."

The monastery below the Buddha also has much to offer, but you definitely want to visit this attraction early in the day. The stairway to the base of the Buddha statue is not very large, and the area becomes congested and a bit noisy as the day progresses. If you get there early enough though, the area is fairly empty, easy to navigate, and peaceful. This site is a must while in Hong Kong, and the tickets/start for the cable car ride are about a block away from the Tung Chung MTR station. There is also a trail to the Big Buddha, but it looked difficult, and the majority of the people on trail seemed to be training for an athletic event."

The flora and tracing the walking path pretty cool. As is looking down on the array of the biggest passenger jets in the world, that look like they've been made by matchbox.Fear aside it's a comfortable and visually stunning trip. Avoid getting in a car for 25 minutes with 10 year old boys who have 'what if' scenarios on every way to die in a cable car.Ps I came back down alone - it was great.I should also mention as you reach the final transit point before reach the top station, the wind does come as a shock as it rattles you inside the car.The visitor centre and exhibits are very good. Prices are hugely inflated and it's about a 10 minute hike rather than stroll up to the toes of BB or Big Buddha. They offer various tour packages with your tickets all well structured and I'm guessing efficient. Nice day out with brilliant views and mountain air.

It does take a while to get there on the cable cars...It must of been at least half hour we were in the air.... Quite windy but I love all that. My friend however was petrified! Obviously do not go if you are scared of heights. But getting to the Big Buddha via cable car is breathtaking!!! The Big Buddha is definitely worth a visit. It was hard to fathom how large it was. Beautiful. highly recommended."

The cable ride in ferocious wind but gorgeous scenery. the Buddhe looks more spectacular from a distance because up close, it's so huge you cant quite see it. Lots of steps up to the Big Buddha so not for those with weak knees or achy joints. It is a visual feast, if you can ignore the throng f fellow tourists around you.Worth the visit but i found it very touristy. Not as peaceful as i had imagined given the setting."

The contrast between the stark presence of a huge statue of Shakyamuni Buddha and the opulence of gold laden 10,000 Buddhas within a range of less than a kilometer is something to be experienced. The weather was so amazing. When we de boarded the cable car, it was raining and there was this oriental music playing in the street shops.

Low lying clouds can completely hide the statue on cloudy days when viewed from the grounds surrounding the Po Lin Monastery below. Strangely though, the sudden glimpse of the statue between breaks in the cloud, even for a second or two, can make this still a special view.

This is one of the essential day trips out of Hong Kong, where you will see far more white faces than in most other destinations away from Kowloon and Hong Kong Central, which you may or may not regard as a good thing. Tung Chung is easily and rapidly reached on the MTR. On the day we visited the cable car was closed, but extra buses had been put on and they provided a more adventurous ride than the cable car, as they slowly climbed the hill and then plummeted down the other side and then up again. You are dropped off at the village of standard tacky souvenir shops, so find the steps to the climb to the Big Buddha as soon as possible and join the parade to the top. Once at the top you can admire the Buddha and the view, and see even more souvenir stalls hidden under the Buddha. Once back down do make sure you visit the Po Lin Monastery, where you can buy reasonably priced local food, and more souvenirs, and view the fantastically decorated monastic buildings. Do not be boring and return straight to Tung Chung, go for a walk if you have plenty of time or a least take a bus along the coast to Mui Wo, where there are local sea food restaurants (the clams in black bean sauce was particularly good, and take the ferry back to Hong Kong Central."

When you finally do, it's really nothing more than what it claims to be, a big bronze Buddha. Nice for a few pictures but not more than that. The area is pretty, although as said the walk from the tram to the stairs is nothing but overprices souvenir shops and cheap restaurants. Keep in mind, the ticket line for the tram moves a glacier speed, so plan on a 4-5 hour trip from HK and back. Go early and see if you can by tram tickets in advance."

During our visit to Hong Kong and after 5 days of skyscrapers and extensive MTR travel, the Big Buddha at Ngong Ping village and the cable car ride provides a soothing experience of Mother Nature's bounty.To reach Ngong Ping, the fastest mode is to travel by the MTR till Tung Chung. The cable car station is a 2 minute walk from Tung Chung. A good advice is to book the cable car ride tickets in advance (online, Klook, i-Venture card) as queues can be pretty long (wait time of over 1 hour). There are 2 separate queues for those who have booked prior. We were fortunate as we had taken the i-Venture card and jumped the queue.The 5.7 kms cable car ride is fabulous. Ngong Ping is a local village and there is a shopping cum walking street of about 800 metres stating from the cable car station to the Po Lin monastery, created for tourists and visitors. Local restaurants, cafes and souvenir shops line the entire walking street.Weather was cool, at-least 2'C lower than Hong Kong. Enjoyed the views of the Big Buddha however couldn't go to the monastery due to a packed schedule for the day. There's a Starbucks near to the Ngong Ping 360 cable car station. Took the cable car back to Tung Chung in about an hour.Overall, good experience. Couples an families with small children also will enjoy especially the cable car ride."

I would recommend getting a bus there so you can see some of the countryside and then get the cable car for the return. Food and drinks are available on the mountain but there also a small number of picnic tables if you want to byo. Remember a hat, sunscreen and a scarf in case it is really sunny or windy."

First tip - hire a bus tour that drops you off at the TOP of the mountain where the Big Buddha is located. The Buddha itself is inspiring, as are the many incredible smaller statues around the walkway. The only disappointment here is that there is very little information on the history, creating and religious meaning of the Buddha. While you can see limited areas inside, many are roped off and not accessible for tourists. We toured around the Buddha and then made our way down the SUPER steep stairway down to the valley where the monastery and village are located. Take pictures on the way down and give yourself plenty of time. Once in the square - don't bother with the souvenir stands - there are better ones coming. Second tip - eat lunch at the monastery! Yes it's all vegetarian, but it was bloody fantastic and we all loved our meal. Next take your time walking through the other buildings that are open. The color, artwork and scenery is stunning and again I was craving more details on the history. Light your incense candles and join the tradition of offering prayers on your way out under the giant walkway arches. Bearing to the right, head down the walkway lined with the warrior statues - and don't be surprised when the wild giant cow/buffalos 'nudge' you for food (BTW do NOT feed them!!). Now you are in a lovely shopping area that was super fun to stroll through. Found a super cool chopstick store and bought absolutely gorgeous and custom chopstick sets for family and friends. Everyone adored them and I wish I had purchased more. Toward the end you reach a gondola ride that takes you back to the base of the mountain and the nearby MTR station. While I'm not crazy about heights, it was a fantastic view of the area and others in our car said it was better than The Peak. Make it a day trip - it's worth it!"

Now keep in mind that this shouldn't effect other visitors because cable car service is rare. Nevertheless, we eventually made it to the top and were amazed. Below the area where the Buddha itself is there is a very cool traditional temple and scattered tourist shops. Beware for the cows which just seem to roam around. The climb to the Buddha is free and doesn't take long (about 200 steps). The views are amazing. Hopefully you get a chance to go on a clear day because there are many opportunities for photos. If you are going to HK this is something you simply must see."

You are sometimes given a timeslot for you to turn up at so best get there early so you dont waste all day.In true HK style, the top of the mountain which used to be very remote, you are presented with a shopping centre. A starbucks, an ebeneezer kebab shop. No need to do this.The buddha itself is vast, amazing to walk around and take pics of. Lots of selfie action happening so watch out for pointy sticks. Pace yourself walking up the steps.You can eat veggie at the monastery for a couple of $ which is great value. Queue for cable car back down again will reflect the journey up, weekends and holidays will be heaving.

The cable car takes about 30 minutes to get there and I would also recommend pre purchasing the tickets online to avoid the queues. On arrival we walked through the village and arrived at the bottom of Big Buddha which was an awesome sight you have to walk up over 200 steps to reach the top but it's worth it. We also visited the temple and could hear the monks chanting which was beautiful"

We drove to the cable car terminal to take the much anticipated and celebrated ride only to discover that the cable car was not operating until after the 20th of March for repairs/upkeep. We were disappointed but discovered we could take bus #23 from the terminal to the shrine and Big Buddha. We thought it would be a quick trip but it was about a half-hour journey by bus. There were plenty of buses coming and going because the cable car was down. After an interesting and scenic ride in the bus, we arrived at the compound. We loved the friendly and sweet temple dogs roaming around. And, we did not LOVE the climb up the 226 steps to the Giant Buddha, it was definitely worth it. If you can do stairs, go up. By the way, it is FREE to go up the stairs. The tickets that they sell below are for the vegetarian restaurant. We also skipped a little museum up in the base, but we did look at the free displays and memorials inside the base. We also went to the monastery and looked around.

Visiting the large Budda, I took to the MTR to the end station (yellow line), where there is a gigantic Outlet, and a Starbucks - by the way.There is a cable car going all the way up the mountains. Queuing is a nightmare, waited for 60 min. before I got to the ticket office, pay extra and by a crystal carriage with a glass bottom, not because of the view but because you will save 60 min. of queuing, going back down again!!It's a nice Budda, and just nice to have a couple of hours away from the vibrant Hong Kong. Be aware of the cows roaming freely on the square, and enjoy som of the small street food dealers that are hidden away between the warrior statues on you left, when you walk towards the main square / view of the Budda. Don't pay money for visiting the very top level of the Budda, wast of money, and not worth it.Beautiful place, go there on a sunny day."

We were lucky and saw two and that was a definite highlight. The cable car journey was long and spectacular. If you don't like heights don't get the see through floor one.The Big Buddha was amazing and worth the 256 steps up there. Ross was a great tour guide with good humour and full of information.

The cable car up had beautiful views, definitely get the crystal car (only slightly more expensive and much cooler to be able to see below your feet as you go up). The little town, although created for tourists, was lovely. Lots of shops, exhibitions, shows, cafes, restaurants and tourist information. The Big Buddha was breathtaking. Definitely try and go on a clear sunny day, as many people who go on cloudy days fail to see the Buddha which defeats the purpose of the whole trip! There are a lot of steps, not as many as I would have thought, so the climb up is very do-able. However some of the best photos are taken only a few steps up so unless you want to see the museum at the top, you don't have to climb all the way up. The monastery was incredible, the best I've ever seen. Gold encapsulates it and 10,000 Buddhas are inside (some on walls, painted, different sizes etc). The temples themselves are also beautiful to walk around. A really nice day trip to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city!"

Once you alight at the Ngong Ping village, you will already be entertained by the place itself. Just walk till you reach the bottom of the steps to the Big Buddha. We cannot see it clear down the steps because of the fog. Even when I'm already at the top, I still can't see the Buddha clearly. It's so BIG! After the struggle from the 200+ steps, you will find peace on the top. The place is very peaceful, it makes want to stay there and pray that time stops so we don't need to rush back to the airport and go home.They say that climbing to the Buddha will grant you a wish. True or not, I don't care, I keeps on thinking about my wish while climbing. It will surely motivate you up there. If you went to HongKong, please do visit this place.

This is a must do trip but try and arrive for 10am and you won't have to queue so much. It is possible to take a bus up to the top which costs considerably less, but the cable car makes the visit special once you finally get on it. If I go again I will not pay for the 360 fun package and just pay the cable car fare, the walking with Buddha tour was poor and it was hard to find the other things included in the package. Very commercialised which took the shine off the experience, but despite that, you must do it while visiting Hong Kong."

And then the night before we were going to go, I realized it was ~2 hours on transit from where we were or a big, all-day tour and everything was saying that Lunar New Year's Day might be a complete tourist-overrun disaster. We came SO CLOSE to not going. We finally decided to just take a cab (it's pretty close to the airport, I think it was around $35 USD each way and less than a half hour) and we left before 9. We didn't have online tickets because you can't buy them the same day. We were wondering if we made a mistake.We didn't. We actually waited in a shorter line than those that had online tickets (because there is still a line for them). We took the glass-bottom gondola because the wait was shorter and it wasn't that much more expensive.It was a beautiful, sunny day. We brought a picnic lunch and a bottle of wine from our hotel. Even with that $60 USD, we still spent less money than we would have on tour and we got to make our own schedule.We had a great time wandering around the property. There is a lot of touristy stuff, be we are tourists, so it was OK. There were VERY VERY long lines for the food options located near the monastery. We were grateful to have packed our lunch. If you're going just because you feel like you need to see a Buddha statue, it may not be worth the trek for you (though it is beautiful). But if it's a nice day and you want to go enjoy sunshine and beauty and a nice few hours, I would really highly recommend it. It was my favorite day in Hong Kong and it would have been really sad to miss it."

The ride takes about 20 minutes and you arrive at a complex of souvenir stores, coffee shops and restaurants which were not there fifteen years ago when I last visited.The Big Buddha itself is impressive and after climbing the steps you can visit the exhibition hall beneath it to see photographs of its construction. The monastery is a working institution and you can observe monks going about their business and devout Buddhists burning joss sticks and praying before different deities. Parts of the monastery are naturally cordoned offAlthough I was a little dismayed to see so many shops, we were glad to make use of possibly the most picturesque Starbucks in Hong Kong, before the return cable car journey, which was as memorable as the ascent.

I recommend going on a tour - we used Tour East (Hong Kong) Limited (aka Lantau Tours Limited). The very comfortable and cool bus picked us up at our hotel on Kowloon, went to Victoria Harbour to catch the ferry to Lantau Island (hint sit on the right side of the ferry when facing forward) to have a great view of various islands on the journey. Quickly get on another tour coach and hear all about the history of Lantau, a short ride and stop at a beautiful pristine beach on the China Sea - Ceung Sha. Then it's on to a unique fishing village - Tai Q. Many of the homes here are built on stilts. It was high tide when we were there so all were in the water! Our tour included a small boat ride so we really got a view of the homes. There is a really old Temple in the village worth exploring as well. Back on the coach, up a very steep and winding road to the Ngong Ping Plateau and the Big Budda. The advantage of this tour is you don't have to stop at the bottom and climb all those stairs to get to the Budda. The bus goes right to the top, out you step, and behold - Budda and the 6 goddesses that surround him! The scale and size of Budda is hard to fathom unless you are there in person. You can walk around him and get different angles and lots of selfies. The property also contains the Po Lin Monastery which you should also take time to visit - don't miss the stunning Hall of 10,000 Golden Buddas. Lots of shopping between the site and the Ngong Ping 360 - a 5.7KN Skyrail journey that shouldn't be missed. Again all included in our tour (this takes all day but was a highlight of our trip)."

It's well worth the crystal cabin to skip queues on way home. Visit the factory outlets back at end of cable car/mtr station on way home. Great value."

Once merely a remote monastery hidden by lush, mountain scenery, the Po Lin Monastery made it to the world map when the extraordinary Tian Tan Buddha statue (informally known as the Big Buddha) was erected in 1993. Sitting 34 metres high and facing north to look over the Chinese people, this majestic bronze Buddha draws pilgrims from all over Asia. The eyes, lips, incline of the head and right hand, which is raised to deliver a blessing to all, combine to bring a humbling depth of character and dignity to the massive Buddha, which took 12 years to complete. Climb the 268 steps for a closer look at this remarkable statue, and to enjoy the sweeping mountain and sea views that can be seen from its base.Opposite the statue is the Po Lin Monastery, one of Hong Kong\u2019s most important Buddhist sanctums . Home to many a devout monk, this monastery is rich with colorful manifestations of Buddhist iconography and its pleasant garden is alive with birdsong and flowery scents. You can also enlighten your appetite at their popular vegetarian restaurant. Try it you wont be disappointed"

From there we were planning on taking the gondola to the top to see the Big Buddha, but it was closed for repairs. Unfortunately there weren't any signs or notices informing people of that prior to actually arriving at the entrance to the gondola. Now, Instead of the gondola, you could take a bus to the top. We decided to do that. The bus was like a public city bus. People filled the bus and we were on our way. The bus itself was freezing. It had started to rain as we rode to the big Buddha and people inside the bus were visibly cold but there wasn't any heat. The driver eventually after about 50 minutes stopped the bus and started yelling. No one on the bus knew what he was saying but he seemed quite upset. We all got off the bus and he drove away. Unsure of where we were and what to do the bus riders started to meander and walk in all directions. Come to find out the Big Buddha was literally right in front of us. It was so foggy from the cold temperatures and the rain you couldn't see the top of the mountain or the Buddha from where. We were standing. Climbing all the stairs wasn't the ideal situation but once at the top the weather conditions allowed for some interesting photos. Even just seeing the Buddha partially through the fog was impactful."

I can feel the minutes and hours of my life slipping irretrievably away, caught in a shuffling heave of humanity. Having read the reviews about the long queues for the gondola trip to the Big Buddha we made an effort to go on a weekday, and to arrive just as the gondola opened at 10am. My limited experience of HK thus far had been that the city doesn't even wake up until 10, so I was sure we'd be ok.I was wrong.We got there at 10:06am and boarded the gondola at 11:26. If I had seen the extent of the queue as we joined it, I would have opted for the bus immediately. But, Disney style, most of the queue is hidden and there's no effort to communicate waiting times. Even if the bus takes an hour to ascend, you'll still save a lot of time and get the full experience by taking the bus up and joining the shorter queue for the way down (actually, at 12:30pm there was no queue for the way down on the gondola).As for the Buddha itself, nice views, but too touristy to feel like it really mattered. The temple/monastery was probably the highlight, with a nice vegitarian cafe. The \"village\" that you have to walk through to get to the buddha is a big fat tourist trap, and the current \"Hello Kitty\" promotion made the whole Buddha experience very kitch and a little surreal.If I had my time over I'd probably still do it, but I'd get the ferry to Mui Wo, bus up to the Buddha, and gondola down, and all in the morning."

Some signs would be nice...Once you have bought a ticket at the ticket office, don't get all elated - here's a 40 minute queue just around the corner. 2 hours 40 minutes in total.The cable car itself gives 25 minutes of spectacular views of HK, the harbour, mountains and airport. You also see the Buddha as the cars get nearer.Once you arrive, if you are expecting a spiritual experience of some kind, forget that notion.... large scale commercialisation has spoilt the attraction; it is tasteless and tacky. I am not a religious person, but I like to learn about religion and culture; I was expecting some peace and serenity...You can buy a nice cup of tea made from local grown tea leaves, but again, I have this unreasonable expectation that the price of what I buy is in some way linked to its value, so I kept with my water on this occasion.Only a 25 minute queue to get the cable car back down.I note on this site that there are many reviews which rate the Big Buddha site very highly; I guess the Monday I went the queues were huge and the village was tacky.

I suffer from vertigo and would not have been able to go there by cable car, so we opted for the local bus. The bus station was right next to the cable car station, just a short walk from the Tung Chung MTR station. We caught the number 23 bus, which was clearly marked for the Po Lin Monastery. The bus fare was 17.20 HK$ each and you had to have the correct money as the driver did not give change. The journey of around 40 minutes there and 30 back (as it was mainly downhill) was quite interesting. The weather was very bad that day and it was misty all the way. We passed through an attractive seaside town and past several beautiful beaches, but naturally it was far too cold to go and sit on the beach.There was no entrance charge to go to see the Tian Tan Buddha. It was rather unfortunate that we couldn\u2019t even see the Buddha from ground level as he had \u2018his head in the clouds\u2019. We mounted the 230 or so steps to go to view the statue. The statues and the ornamentations were very attractive, but it was evident that everything was relatively new (finished in 1993). We decided that we liked the monastery buildings more than the mount with the Buddha and our photographs were better, as everything wasn\u2019t obscured by cloud. The visit was worthwhile, but it would have been much better if the weather hadn\u2019t been so bad. We were pleased that we went on the bus trip as we saw more of Lantau Island."

The cable car ride, the height, the stairs, the \"in-buddha\" monastery, the 10 000 buddhas \"nearby\" monastery and the bus ride down from the mountain. It is just one of the best tourist days out I\u00b4ve had. The Buddha isn\u00b4t some very old religious monument, it is fairly new, but that makes it even more out of the ordinary. These kinds of religious symbols are usually older and from a different \"time\", so this Buddha is partly fascinating because it is so recent. There is a 280 step walk up to the actual \"statue\". It is not a problem for most, but if you suffer from any disability that would make this difficult, then check beforehand if you can get some assistance. I\u00b4m out of shape, but managed this fine. The \"in-Buddha\" monastery is a \"no photo\" zone and boasts two souvenir shops (the earnings go to the monastery) and \"endless\" shrines to whomever have opted/paid to have their names/pictures here to be prayed for. Including deceased and here buried Chinese superstar \"Anita\"."

Is it worth the climb? Oh yes in deed, the statue is quiet incredible and gives Christ Redeemer a run for his money. There are of course 6 statues offering up to Buddha for wisdom, peace, etc (you need to have a study if you wish to know what all six offer and what they receive in return).The views from the top of the stair case are also incredible and you cans either look across the mountains to the Monastery or out to sea where several islands float above the sea mist. I'd like to remind all travllers that it is frowned upon to attempt to take photos within the structure its self as it is a religious site where people go to offer thanks and reflect on daily life. Oh and I must also let you know that there is also quiet an important Buddhist Relic at the top of the building, its in a glass vase and that is all the clues I am giving"

We splurged on the cable car with transparent floors which was a great call as the view was spectacular. Excellent for photosI understand that the lines are often long but we must have lucked out because we waited for less than 10 minutes. Once there, we enjoyed the great food and desserts. Would have liked to spend more time there hiking and being with the Big Buddha but it was getting late and we were worried about the wait for the return trip. Again we were lucky and didn't have to wait long. The gondolas were quite chilly on the way back so bring a sweater. On the outgoing trip an employee was snapping photos. When we returned, the gift shop has souvenirs with the photos ( like Disneyland!). Which was a little odd but then again it is a big tourist destination as well as a Buddhist center. I recommend it if you are not in a hurry - 1) because the wait times can be so variable and stressing about that if you are in a tight timetable would ruin the experience And 2) because there is a lot to explore there.

I went up and down with the Cable Car, just the regular cabine which will give you a great experience. The glass cabine is a waist of money. Book your tickets in advance to avoid the long queues. You walk through a tourist village first. After that enjoy how Chinese people worship the Buddhas. There's a magnificent view if you are ready to climb the stairs. There are many platforms to catch your breath again. On the top you can walk around and look at other symbolic buddha sculptures. There's also a small museum, all in Chinese, but you get some free dim sum at the caf\u00e9 near the temple when you give your ticket. Back again you can take the short route to the Wisdom Path, a beautiful walk. Too bad that Path isn't called Silent Path as well! Not many tourists go there, but the serene place is disturbed by noisy, chatting tourists. Along the route and in the area near the Buddha, you'll meet several holy cows. After that short trail go to the right to the Temple area, a very beautiful place with several temples. I loved to watch the Chinese people perform their burning and incense rituals.This place nourishes my heart and soul. It's a perfect place to visit when you have a long time to wait for your next flight, located on the same island as the airport. Next time I'll take the bus or walk back and visit fishing villages as well."

This was especially true for me when I was close to it. I would like to visit again on a clear day. General comment about crowds. Tips:Disclaimer: There area lot of useful info online. This is just my experience. 1. 7-11 Shops sell the cable car/gondola tickets (but not in the Ngon Pin area). I would recommend getting the crystal cable car tickets (more on this later)2. Get there early. If you did get tickets at the 7-11, you'll be able to pick them up at the cable car terminal (queues are still involved). There are a lot of things to do and I would recommend visiting the fishing village, Tai O. Tai O gave me a different side to Hong Kong. The buses depart from the station quite frequently and it was only a short ride. 3. When going home, do line up early. We started lining up at around 5:15 and our wait time was close to an hour. Keep in mind that we had crystal cabin tickets. The line was straightforward while the regular cabin snakes around quite a bit. This was the reason why the crystal cabin was worth it for me. The novelty was lost quickly but having a \"shorter\" waiting time after a long day was a bonus. Both queues we're well over the 1h30m wait time when we finally got in."

We opted for a tour due to time constraints, a desire to see a fishing village, and convenient transportation in cold, rainy weather.The tour included four major stops - bridges, a beach, Tai O Fishing Village, and the Big Buddha. I had the sense that the stops at he bridges and the beach were simply to consume time and, from my perspective, while the bridges were interesting, both stops could easily have been eliminated. The result of the two stops meant that we had very, very little time at the Big Buddha - probably just about 30 minutes at the Buddha. Museum and adjacent temples - we arrived at 12:30 and lunch was at 1:00. Was quite disappointing - having been there before, I know how much there is to see - time would have been so much better spent here than at the bridges and beach. We were given about 20 additional minutes to shop and take photos - then took the cable car back down the mountain. While the Big Buddha is to most people, I would think, the primary reason for taking this tour - be aware that you actually spend very, very little time there.Tai O Fishing Village was interesting. We spent time, with the guide, touring the village and taking a boat ride. A bit of free time was provided to explore and take photos.Finally, we were a bit disconcerted that there is not heat in the tour company shuttle buses - none. This was a very cold day and, when we asked the guide to put the heat on in the bus, her reply was \"we do not have heat in the tour buses\". As a result, we were wearing heavy coats, gloves, and hats - and still shivering on our return trip to Hong Kong.Tour was OK - but be aware of the how the time is allocated."

However the views from below are also equally good and can be enjoyed without taking the climb. There is also a mall with some factory outlets in lantau which one should consider visiting on the way out. Overall a good half day trip.P.S. Dont eat the buddhist food...does not taste very good"

This isn't any cheaper but will save considerable time as it allows you to 'Jump' the 'queue for the queue'! We were there at 1000 ish and waited around an hour to get through the process and on to a cabin. But it is worth it. The views are stunning and the Buddah is amazing. The steps are fairly easy - they just never seem to stop!"

Overall, it was great fun and amazing experience. on an average its about 4 to 5 hrs trip; half day tour including the waiting time. We visited big budda in Jan 2016 and took a cable car ride both way. Alight at Tung Chung MRT and follow the direction to the entry of the cable car ride. We arrived at cable car station at around 1 PM and had prebooked the ticket from klook.com , however the waiting time to get the boarding pass was 45 mins. If you are booking tickets at the counter,then the waiting time may be more than an hour or 2. Suggest to prebook the tickets from klook.com. once you get the boarding pass, boarding cable car is less than 5 to 10 mins. There are toilets available just before boarding the cable car. Cable car ride is approximately about 25 mins and is amazing, breath taking view above ocean and mountain.. Airport is clearly visible on a bright sunny day.We could easily climb the steps and reach big budda in less than 5 minutes. if you are travelling during winter, beware of falling ice cubes near big budda statue. Lots of options for dining is available in Lantau Island. Indian vegetarian food is also available in lantau island near the cable car station in lantau. Chinese vegetarian snacks and food is available near Po Lin Monestry. Chinese vegetarian available in honkong is completely different from the chinese veg food in singapore. I would not recommend the chinese veg food near Po Lin Monestry as it doesnt taste good and suspect that the reason of my husband sickness during our stay is due to the chinese veg food."

We went on Tuesday 9th Feb over Chinese New Year and got a beautiful blue-sky day. The Ngong Ping 360 cable car to get up is expensive but you get some great views. You can also see the bridge being built between Hong Kong and Macau. You go through a Hello Kitty-themed \"traditional\" village at the top, complete with plastic cherry blossoms, a Starbucks and Subway of course, and a cement wishing tree. The prices there for food etc are very high.However the actual things you actually came to see (Po Lin Monastery and Tian Tan Buddha) are free. The Po Lin Monastery is not functional (no monks live there) and clearly has a short history but I really enjoyed visiting. It was well-done to create an atmosphere of calm and was reminiscent of older Buddhist temples I'd seen when living in mainland China last year.The Tian Tan Buddha itself was also great. You have to climb stairs to reach it but there are not too many and definitely surmountable for people of all ages. Not wheelchair accessible obviously. The Buddha was built in the 1979-81 but is beautiful in itself as well as having great views."

The 25 min cable car ride was one of the best I've been on, with astounding views! I didn't pay extra for the \"Crystal\" car with the glass floor. Go early in the day to avoid the lines.Just walk past the touristy \"village\" at the top, and head to the Big Buddha. The steps are not that difficult if you are in decent shape. After the Buddha, be sure to take the easy walk to the interesting Wisdom Path, where I snuck off on a side trail and found an amazing viewpoint all to myself. Unfortunately, I didn't have time to hike to Lantau Summit. BTW, I didn't think the HK$98 was worth it for the vegetarian meal (albeit pretty tasty) in the plain windowless dining room at the monastery. You can just get take away at the stand outside near the patio tables for a more pleasant experience. I would definitely return to hike more of Lantau Island next time."

I took the 25 mins cable car ride from Tung Chung to reach Ngong Ping 360 Village. Big Buddha is just a short 10 mins walk from the Ngong Ping cable car station. Besides the Big Buddha, one should also visit the Poh Lin Monastery and have a nice vegetarian meal from 11.30am onwards. It is definitely worth the price. My advice is to go there early to avoid the large crowd. Travellers who has luggage may deposit it at the Tung Chung Cable Car Station for a cost of HKD80 per piece. Approach any of the crew at level 1 for assistance."

While he had been to Hong Kong a number of times before, he had never gone to Lantau Island.Our venture started from Kowloon via the subway. This method was very easy. We did have to change trains at one station but it consisted of stepping off the train and across the platform. Exiting the subway at Tung Chung, we followed the well marked signs for the cable car tickets. If the line was too long, we would take the bus, but our preference was to rode the gondola. We were extremely lucky since the weather was clear and no long lines.The cable car ride over is very easy and picturesque. We took many pictures. As you board the cable car, you are handed two pamphlets. One tells you which sites are available at each of the gondola towers and which provide the best viewing. I recommend perusing that before you get too far into the ride.Once you get off the cable car, you wall through a Chinese Village with many stores. We had no desire to shop or eat so we headed right for the buddha and monastery. I would recommend you do a little reading ( very easy) ahead of time on the statues you will find both on the walkway to the base of the stairs buddha and those up the stairs around the buddha. It adds to the experience.The monastery is worth a visit. The building and 10,000 buddha room is quite beautiful and stunning to see.

You can choose between a normal cable car and one completely see through. We chose the standard one because it seemed like they were even more people waiting in line for the see through.After a long time of standing in line we were quiet happy that we decided to take the cable railway. it was worth the wait also the ride was very pleasant, we had a very beautiful view for around 25 minutes (approx.4 km).At the top you first arrive at a souvenir shop where you can buy also photos of you (because they take them before and after you enter the cable car) so you have some kind of memory. We did not take it because we had our own equipment of cameras. You have to walk a little bit and go through a town like part where you can eat/drink or buy souveniers than you arrive at the big buddah and a temple. We went to see both. It was nice, definitely something you should go and see when you are visiting hongkong. The view is very nice, at the top of big buddah we even had some trays of sunlight.All in all a very nice place to go if you want to escape the crazy city."

Having reached the statue the PO Lin Monastery is only a short walk away. Ngong Ping village is a bit of a 'tourist trap' so beware! That said the LI-Nong Tea House was a haven of tranquility. Those on a tight budget could purchase a single ticket on the cable car and walk back to the Tung Chung terminus. This 4 mile walk is mostly downhill through the Country Park but is probably not for the unfit or faint hearted."

Our flight landed at 10.30 in the morning from Bangkok and I kept my luggage at the Airport and paid for 4 hours @ HK$ 12 per piece of luggage. And took a shuttle bus ( S1) from right outside the Airport which would dropped us at Tung Chung Station. There are shuttle buses every 5 mts . Don't forget to buy Octopus card, the counter is on the way too..Across the road, you would find the Cable car boarding point ...In case its crowded take the bus (Bus bay is right beside the cable car terminus) Taxi or bus , its winding roads so would take the same amount of time. Approx 30 mts and drops you off right outside the main entrance of Big Buddha ... It was terribly windy and cold in Jan , so be prepared for breeze that would make you fly. It was a great experience, steps are too many or difficult to climb. My dad is 70 and Mom 65, they could easily climb it and it was worth it. The day we went it was foggy and chill weather , else you would get an amazing view of the hongkong island from the top.One - two hours you could invest in seeing the monastery and the village. Take a bus on taxi while returning. Buses are there every 20 mts. Will drop you back at Tung Chung Station and take the airport shuttle (S1). Its very convenient. Saw some people dragging the luggage ...not worth it. Don't miss it !!!"

Suffice it to say that visibility was about 25 feet! The weather made our trip a bit more other worldly? Because of the altitude, climbing the 300+ steps IS NOT EASY! Be mindful if planning on taking strollers or elderly people. Once at the top, I'm sure that the views and the Buddha are sight worthy. We were barely able to make out the outline of the Buddha even at the top of the stairs! The walk down was much easier as long as your knees are healthy. I didn't see any ramps for wheelchairs, but again, we had limited visibility. We enjoyed snacks from the vegetarian restaurant at the monastery. We also enjoyed watching a cow (yes, a cow!) eat the offerings of fruit that people had left for the Buddha. It started raining and I noticed the cow under a covered area by the warm incense burners. Smart cow! There were also some random dogs running around. The village by the tram station is touristy, but we were grateful for someplace to warm up our tummies and bodies. Lots of choices of eateries. We didn't use any of the coupons in the coupon book given to us with the tram tickets, but wished we had. Definitely check them out!"

Wasn't sure about using up a day to see the Big Buddha but as it ended up, a great day, being a group of 7 ranging from 54 to mid 20s down to 10 years off age it's not always easy to please everyone as most parents would agree. We took the MTR from Jordan to Hong Kong station and transferred to the Lantau Island line. Arriving at the station it is only a 100m walk to the cable car. Arriving we were concerned about wait times that had been mentioned often by other reviewers but really waiting for approx 30mins is not a big deal, your on holidays, enjoy the scenery, talk to each other, people watch and your on the cable car in no time at all, remember your on holidays so why the rush, plenty of time to do that when you get back home. The cable was a great experience even on a fairly windy day, the slight rocking added to the thrill of the ride. The view all the way up is fantastic and well worth the cost. Great to experience an opposite side of Hong Kong, green forest covered mountains from above, absolutely beautiful, reminds you that Hong Kong is more than a mega city full of skyscrapers. Reaching the top it's rather odd to see the spectacular Big Buddha and Monastery and a Starbucks! But hey it was cold and a good cup of coffee never goes a stray, right. The walk up the steps is an easy walk, if your not that fit, just take your time, I did. The Buddha is impressive as is the view, the Monastery is worth a look see also. Cows walking amongst the crowds added to the uniqueness of the site. The cable car ride back down is a nice way to finish off the visit. I know there are cheaper ways to get to the top using local buses but if you can afford the cost of the cable car do it, offset your costs by having a couple of cheaper meals somewhere that night. With 4 of our group in their 20s back at the base is an impressive outlet shopping mall. Even with size 13 feet I managed to pick up bargain boots a Timberlands at half the price I would pay back home in OZ. So as some have said you may have to wait for the cable car, but don't we need to wait for most things worth trying, no lines would indicate it's not worth it. So the cable car isn't the cheapest thing you'll do in Hong King but it's not a deal breaker either, not even for a family of 7. A great experience, the cable car, the view and then Big Buddha, you won't be disappointed. Remember if its cool back in Hong Kong it will cold at the Buddha so rug up."

Buy a ticket with the clear bottom as it's a pretty intense view. Not that it matters, I like run and hike, so instead of getting the round trip ticket, I purchased a one way and hiked down ( 10-12K, a little less than 2 hours ). The views and exercise were exhilarating. So in summary a great alternative to the hotel treadmill, just bring enough water and a camera for sure"

There is a tourist village on the way from the gondola station to the Buddha that's full of souvenir tat and needs to be negotiated past. There are good toilets here though.We visited from the airport and were advised initially to get the MTR airport express train then change to another train. However, fortunately we were then told by someone else it was better to get the bus. The train costs around \u00a36 whilst the bus is only around 70 pence. Both take around the same amount of time but the bus is a single ride rather than having to change trains. The bus leaves the airport from near the bottom of the ramp between terminals 1 and 2. They are around every 10-20 minutes.The next piece of advice is book your gondola tickets on-line first. This way you save money and you can jump the queue. Finally check the weather and try and go on a clear day if you can. We were lucky as we only had one chance to visit and the weather was very good and the views were spectacular from the top and in the gondola on the way up and down."

We went about getting there a bit differently - we first caught a ferry to the other side of Lantau, wandered around there for a bit, then caught a taxi up to the Big Buddha, and then went down in the cable car. While the cable car was very impressive (cool to have the aerial view of the airport too!) I think getting there was more fun. But the Buddha itself was very impressive and I took way too many photos! The cheesy, resort style town that you have to walk through to get to the cable car is cheesy and touristy and kinda gross, but they had some nice souvenirs that I hadn't seen elsewhere so I don't know? Give it a go if you want? But it felt like walking through a film set - and not in a cool way. But the Buddha is definitely worth the trip, especially to just get out of the madness of HK for a while."

WE had been told that a visit to the Big Buddha was an absolute must when in Hong Kong and I am so pleased that on this my second visit to that city I was able to do just that. The journey to Lantau Island is straight forward via the MTR. The Tung Chung Line takes you direct to Tung Chung and the Ngong Pingable cable car. The cable car ride alone is out of this world and I gather it is one of the longest 2 cable rides anywhere. We had almost an hour wait in the queue to take the cable car and with hindsight I would buy the tickets in advance as there was hardly any queue for ticket or voucher holders. If you read this take that advice 'BUY TICKETS IN ADVANCE' The visit to the Buddha is what you make of it, we loved it. The area is lovely and the Buddha is awesome. OK it is commercialised but what isn't? There are a lot of steps up to the Buddha but it is not a race so enjoy the view every couple of steps and you soon reach the top.this is 100% a must do if time prevails when in Hong Kong."

To get tickets for the cable car there are some touts who offer genuine tickets outside the tung chung mtr station which are cheaper than if you buy them from the counter. BEWARE, IF YOU BUY THESE TICKETS FROM THE TOUTS OR AGENTS, YOU MUST HAVE PASSPORTS OR IDENTIFICATION TO SHOW AT THE COUNTER. The cable car ride is magnificent, with lovely views. There is a special cable car as well with a see through Base for better views. This is more expensive than the regular but one can do regular one way and see through the other. The big Buddha Is gorgeous. Calm. And serene. And the ngong ping village has some tiny stores, a subway, a Starbucks and a couple of eateries. It's a lovely way to spend the first half of the day.

My trip worked out perfectly and my tips are,1) Subway - I took the subway there to the cable car entrance and it was well worth the scenic ride and significantly cheaper than the tours I saw which all started at $110 USD and don't really have much built into the agenda. 2) Crystal Cable Car - Pay the extra few bucks for the see through car! Outside of the see through bottom the biggest perk is that most people do the regular car which leads to a long line so by paying the extra I was able to walk right into the car going up the mountain and on the way back have my own private car with no wait. 3) Snack - When you pay the entry fee to the big Buddha it includes a snack and definitely take advantage. The snack to me was a meal (and I'm a 6'4 guy) but includes 2 sides, noodles and tea so it's worth making the quick detour to pick up."

When you first get off the cable car you'll see cafes and tourist shops. Walk past these to see the real beauty of the island! The climb up to the Buddha is great, as is the monastery.

You can opt for a pod with a glass floor, which was good. I thought the cable car was a little pricey though.When you get off the cable car you arrive in a small village (one street) with some shops and restaurants. From here it is about a 5 minutes walk to the budda, then however long it takes you to ascend the steps.It's worth going for half a day as you are combining the views from the cable car, the budda and the monastery.Its also really easy to get to, just go all the way to the end of the orange MTR line (Tung Chung). From central this cost us about 25HKD each (~\u00a32.50)."

It met all of my expectations.Took a cab from HK airport to the Nongping 360 cable cart ($50 HKD).Waited in line for ticket about 1 hour.Got one way ticket to big Buddha about $200 HKD.Got in line for the cable cart; another 1 hour.It took about 30 min up the mountain with breathtaking view of the LanTau island.The Ngong Ping town is very touristy with many shops and restaurants including Starbucks.Climbed up 268 steps to the statue. It is beautiful from the top and breezy!The Po Ling Monastary is in the same vinicity which is a good place to take a break and have a picnic.I took a cab back to the airport. It costs about $100 HKD ($25 USD). It was a nice drive down the winding scenic road and took about 30-45 min.It was a good way to spend 4-6 hours when you are laying over in HK with budget.Total spending: $400 HKD or $60 USD (including food and snack).Experience: priceless!Things you should know:- there are many people at the cable cart. It opens around 10 AM. There are already people in line. So, you might want to buy tickets ahead of time.- get a good shoes to climb up the steps.- there is a ice cream stand at the top...you can reward yourself!- it is hot on the way up and gets breezy and windy at the top... So layer your clothes... - I did not have time to explore the town..So plan your time before you go!"

Still worth doing, a peaceful place to walk around the area including the temple, and the Buddha is impressive. The wind was at \"winter monsoon\" levels on our return which made for a very scary return gondola trip, with the gondola swaying in the high winds and stopping several times in mid-air. Not for the faint- hearted or those nervous about heights on a windy day! Get there early as the queue is slow."

Quite disappointed because we expected to have the cabin to ourselves (considering we paid more). But because it was Christmas, there were loads and loads of visitors so we ended up sharing with others. It was difficult to take photos with others inside.Reaching the village, we walked around first, took photos, had lunch and then started our way up. The Buddha was really huge and going up is not that difficult. You can have rest periods every so often. We were fooled when told we have one free photo but have to go to some place to claim it. They took so many shots where in the end they want us to buy the extra shots. Of course it's really up to you.The experience was nice. There's also the Po Lin Monastery that you can visit within the area."

Much have bees said about the Po Lin Monastery and the Tian Tian Buddha, so for the traveller on a budget, below are some tips:1. The usual way up to the Monastery is through cable car, which is a little expensive. Instead from Tung Chung MTR, walk towards the Tung Cgung Bus Terminal and take bus 23 to Ngong Ping. This way, you can save around HK100.2. Food is cheap in Po Lin, but vegetarian. Meat lovers, be warned. But hey it tastes great (coming from a mostly meat eater too)3. Bring water. Loads. It's a long way up to the Buddha, and water for some might be a requirement.4. Take a side trip to Tai O fishing village. From the Ngong Ping bus terminal. Take bus 21 straight to Tai O."

An attraction not to be missed, but you must calculate a half day for it.From downtown take the Tung Chung mtr line to the last station (around 30 min OW). Exit at the B exit and from there are three options to reach the Buddha:1) Cable car is the most interesting and beautiful option, but most expensive. It takes 25 min OW with stunning views over the island greenery, bay, airport... If not on budget opt for the Crystal cabin which has a glass bottom floor which makes it even more exciting. Whatever the cabin you choose, BOOK IT ONLINE ON KLOOK.COM You'll save some 15-20% on the regular price and skip the lines, specially if you choose Crystal.2) Bus is the cheapest and slowest option, around 45 min OW winding through the lush greenery to the top.3) Taxi is something between, reasonable if there are 4 of you sharing expenses.You can mix the means of transport in going to and coming back, but one way should be the cable car for the complete experience.Once up, you'll easily spot the Big Buddha and your way to it. Avoid the shops along the way. It became a very touristic and commercial spot with souvenir prices on higher side. Same stuff you can buy half price in downtown HK.Climb the steep stairs to the statue, pics from the stairs are best and also the panorama from the top.After completing the Buddha statue visit, go on the opposite side for the beautiful Po Lin monastery."

Handsome views of the Hong Kong city and the airport along the way. You can really spot how the city is growing ala reclaiming land. The big Buddha shows up as you near the spot and also the Po Lin monastery. The place is a buzz with mostly tourists as you get down. Prices of souvenirs are high, so avoid. There are a lot of attractions as you walk up to find you Buddha moment. We had a hello kitty fest going on as well. There is a Hollywood museum as well. Shopping not recommended in this place.

A good 250+ steep stairs will you have to conquer to get to the statue. Its a great spot atop for camera lovers but remember why you are there. Selfie mongers will be there all around you. Great statues circling the Buddha as well. Take a pause, and pray. If you have the meal ticket you can make way to a level higher inside the statue base. Way back is much easier. You can then go to the Po Lin monastery across the road and enjoy the magnificence of the culture and the architecture. Have a meal in the restaurants in the compound. The veg fried vermicelli noodle's are a must try here. Head back and you may take a bus ride as well."

Think its about 268 step to the top and we were definitely struggling to walk up. This is a free attraction, but we did pay to go on the ferry from HK to this island then took the local bus up to this attraction. Once at the top, the view is beautiful. The Buddha looks serene and the all the other status are pretty too. You can walk inside and see the mini tombstone. This is typical of Buddhism where you can cremate your loved ones and put them in the temple where they'll receive prayers everyday. Must See!"

Walk up to the big Buddha is a bit of a challenge if you are not too fit. Lots of stairs but manageable. Plenty of heavy breathing going on on the way up. The Buddha is HUGE & beautiful. Again as with most of the main Hong Kong tourist sites the queues have to be seen to be believed. By the time we got down there was a 75 minute wait to catch the cable car up.

There is also a kind of tourist village/street that has sprung up from the cable car to the Buddha, This is best quickly negotiated and to arrive at the Buddha.If you are taking the bus to leave the Big Buddha, it may be best to check bus departure timings when you arrive as these buses are infrequent and probably leave every hour or so.You could combine this trip with a trip to Tai O, the fishing village on stilts. this requires and extra 45 min journey from the Big Buddha."

If you're so inclined, take the cable car down as there is almost never a line. The crystal bottom is fine, but not necessary as it's actually just an aqua-tinted Perspex bottom.

After 15 hour international flight with a baby, we decided to go visit the Big Buddha since it was close to airport and we land at 7am. My friend tell me it's crazy but this is how it went.After landing in the morning, we freshen up with a shower and breakfast at the Premium Plaza Lounge ($27 w/ membership). After getting HKD currency, octopus card and local SIM card, we took our luggage to Tung Chung station/City Outlet (S1 bus, 10 min ride). We store our two luggage into the jumbo locker storage (automated payment, 20 HKD/ hr). Then we took bus 23 to up the hill to visit Big Buddha). The bus station was hard to locate due to construction in the area. My wife didn't want to take the 360 rope cable car up due to heights. Once we located the bus stop, it was a smooth ride since it's still early (10 am at the time).We arrive at the Bottom of the Buddha around 11am. The bus ride was 45 min. The baby and wife had a quick nap. Once there, we purchased the vegetarian meal and inside visit of the Buddha tickets (recommended). Otherwise visit is free. At first look there seems to be a lot of stairs and I had to carry a 23 pound baby up. About mid way, it wasn't that bad and seemed shorter than it look. The view was nice from up top. The baby slowly walked back down after the trip. The vegetarian meal was very tasty and service was great. I would not their restroom as it is very old style. We caught the bus back down and was at the City Outlet around 2pm. Originally, we were going to walk around the outlet since it's pretty big. However, we were both very tired and took the taxi straight to our hotel at Tsim Sha Tsui. Overall, I would do it again. The trip would've been better if we didn't have to hunt for the Bus 23 station. We thought it was a good place to go since we probably can not get a hotel room after landing that early. Maybe next time, we will visit the outlet. The variety of stores seem pretty good. I notice there are modern restrooms with baby changing stations at the outlet."

We picked to go in a glass floor cable car, and it was amazing looking down at the harbor, seeing planes land and all of the skyscrapers from above!!.When you reach the Big Buddha, there is loads of little souvenir stores, restaurants and coffee shops however I would recommend buying your souvenirs at the famous Hong Kong Ladies Market, where you can haggle (exceptionally well if you can speak even a little cantonese). After you have gotten your selfie with the Buddha and admired the views, there is an option available to you to visit a small fishing village called Tai Q, and you can eat some of hong kong specialities such as deep fat fried fishballs and squid. We got a boat ride from a local man, he brought us right out into the harbor and on clear days you can sometimes see dolphins!!! Strongly recommend it!!"

It takes 25 min by cable car and 1 hour bus ride. Technically the waiting time already over takes the bus time but buses are also about 30-40min waiting time for each bus. Not much different. The cable car has better aerial mountain views though. HKD185 - you can order online buy tickets are limited. When I tried to do it, the system was down so had to Q. I been here almost 8 years ago and a lot has changed. Now there's like a movie exhibition , village with many souvenir shops etc. it's quite touristy now. The area is scenic and can feel quite serene (but too many tourists now). There are also many cows wondering about now getting food from tourists and rummaging rubbish bins. The climb up to the Buddha can be quite strenuous for those who hardly exercise. The view from above is lovely. All round good experience but pretty tiring. Make sure you wear comfy shoes!! "

We approached the village from the cable car (well worth doing).Now it's quite a walk from the cable car to the Big Buddha and we didn't walk to the top of the monument itself as we were travelling with a 5 year old who was suffering from jet lag and had been queuing for an hour for the cable car.However, plenty of people did and the walk didn't look to strenuous.When you approach the village from the cable car you walk through a \"village\" which is actually a purpose built full of cafes and shops selling souvenirs.

We did a guided tour, was interesting to learn more about Buddhism as a religion, if your going to learn this is one of the spot to do so. The temples are beautiful and art work is simpler outstanding. However when your going to leave by cable car, you soon realise how commercialised it has become. People constantly try to get you into the shops and part with your money. I found this part of the visit too much. The cable car ride down the mountain isn't for the faint hearted, last about 25/35 mins. The views are great, but down look down at your feet!!!!!"

We showed up an hour before our designated ticket time and no one seemed to mind -- so don't feel locked in to the exact time on the ticket.

We just googled the route on our phone, the beginning is just roads and a bit rubbish (could get a cab?) But the hike up is very quiet and easy to follow. Theres a toilet block at the start of the trail. I would say that it was pretty steep at times, although not unmanageable. Probably one to avoid with young children etc. Theres nowhere to buy refreshments en route either. When you get to the top pick the wisdom path rather than the fun path.. It's got more to see!"

Specially if there are people visiting the Disneyland then i would recommend covering this as well. Coming from India its interesting to see the subtle changes in the statue of Buddha, there are short number of steps so i dont suggest for people who want adventure its more of a light trek/walk up the stairs and also it was a treat to eat at the vegetarian canteen present... There are also some statues of generals, the temples and a garden of sorts which can be visited but i dont suggest buying anything...also i would suggest taking the crystal cabin for ropeway... its fun,different and offers beautiful views...so lost to do and lots to click as well...:)"

THAT's where miracle starts!!Lantau peak direction is long, exhausting and mysterious. You reach 900sh m height. On the road to it you hate yourself for choosing it, sweating, hardly breathing..but reaching it makes you feel proud of yourself, gives you a unique feeling of unity with other people you meet on its top. Then uou descend, feeling the wind from the sea and observing nature in its pure state. In the end of your route swim in the sea, doesnt matter if its cold (we swam in January), walk along the beach looking at sunset, eat dinner in a local cafe and take bus 1 or 2 to the feery to Cental.

The actual trek up the hundreds of stairs to see Buddha is not difficult. It only takes 5-10 minutes. Even though visibility of the Buddha with the fog can be difficult, there's more to see here. Including an amazing temple of 1,000 Buddhas and the monastery. Overall just a beautiful escape from the city, even in the harsh weather.WEATHER:Often it can get foggy and misty/rainy on the mountain, but don't let this stop you! If there's a chance of rain, bring umbrellas and wear rain ponchos! They do sell them at the gift store for $20HK dollars if you forget.TRANSPORTATION: We are budget travelers and so we took the MTR orange line from Mongkok to Tung Chung station and then walked past the Cable Car lift (more pricey), found bus #23, and rode it all the way to Big Buddha. The bus ride is 30-40 minutes each way. We took the bus back down to Tung Chung station and caught #S1 strait to the airport, which was only a 10-minute ride. So overall the whole trip including the bus to the airport was well under 100HK each! So worth it."

From the Buddha you have amazing views over Lantau Island. Worth spending time there. The Po Lin Monastery is not too far away either so you can also go there. Plus you will probably be surprised by cows roaming the area freely :D When I wanted to leave I took a cable car down. If you take the crystal cable car you don't have to wait in line. But it is also more expensive than the normal one. It has a glass floor so if you are not afraid and want to have a view under your feet you should definitely try that out."

            "review": "extraordinary experience. Unless you are on a prebooked tour you need to get here close to opening if you are using the cable car to get there. The queues build up very quickly and move quite slowly although there is a periodic attempt to entertain . There is also free wifi but it seemed to have limited capacity , I was unable to log on although another member of the group , if you do log on there is a free audio description available to download.The cable car ride is super , the day we went there was quite a lot of mist so the views were not a good as they could have been but it was still very enjoyable. The actual site has been swamped by commercialism , which sits a little oddly with Buddhism ; the organisers have obviously spent some time studying theme parks elsewhere , on disembarkation one is offered photos of one's group in the form of snow globes or portrait photos and the walk through the 'village' is almost entirely given over to selling or eating opportunities , there are a couple of other things on offer including pink dolphins and a couple of shows. Having navigated through all that there is the a fairly steep set of steps up to the big Buddha , these are very crowded but orderly , most people want to take photos of members of their group on the way up so the climb is truncated by the stop / start nature. Having reached the top it is again pretty crowded but worth the effort in spite of the crowds , Buddha has a very calming effect. The descent is much quicker.There is disabled access but as I had no need of this I don't know how one would access it but it is certainly available.The return journey was straightforward , very short wait but I expect if you went later in the day the returning queues would be pretty long.Depending how long you are visiting Hong Kong I would include a visit to Big Buddha in your trip but it is all a bit Disneyfied."

I recommend buying tickets online so you can skip the entire line which I didnt do and I waited 2 hours but totally worth it. The gondola ride was amazing I did the Crystal Cabin which has a see through glass bottom, the ride takes about 15-20 minutes. It provides spectacular views. Once you get up to the top there are restaurants and stores. This is where i mostly bought all of my gifts and the Matsusaka Restaurant is real good if you like sushi. Now to why you went up there, the Big Buddha is a sight to see and it is absolutely amazing, you do have to walk up almost 300 stairs to get up to it but if you cant do that dont worry you can still get great pictures of it. There is also a monastery up there which is beautiful. If you go to Hong Kong this is a must do."

The Cable car ticket office is close to the Citygate outlet. We saw 100s of them queueing up for the cable car and then decided to take a bus uphill. its a couple of minutes walk from the cable car ticket queue. We took the number 21 (costed around 27 HKD for weekend adn holiday, weekday is much cheaper) and it was a smooth ride. I loved the view ooutside. i dint miss the cable car much as i had experienced it in Ocean Park which was an amazing ride. the tickets to cable car ride is very expensive and we let that go. we arrived to the big buddha temple complex and there was hardly any visibility. it was completely foggy and loved this weather. We looked our way to the big buddha and climbed through some 100 steps...its manageable! I could see elderly people climbing up and so motivated, that made it easy for me as well! the buddha was covered with fod until we reached the top and it cleared for coupe of minutes. you could see the crowd clapping and enjoying with the spectacular view of Buddha. So we kept on waiting to get the best glimpse and were successful. You need to be patient to experience the clear view! After the temple visit, there are lots of shopping options for handicrafts, local gifts, etc ans some 3D motion video experience, we missed that as well. we took the bus back to Tung Chung and it was a hassle free experience. All the travelers must try this option, all you need is just 3 hours and not more than that to cover this sight unless you want to spend the entire day."

The cable car ride was good, and you can see Buddha on your ride up, but the queue was phenomenal. Walking up the steps to get to the Buddha's podium, there were thousands of people stopping to take selfies and as a person that doesn't like people it was a bit annoying. Nonetheless, when you get up there, it is strangely peaceful, despite the hoards. We also queued again on the way down, for about 2 hours. All of the shops and cafes close at 6, and we were starving but having got back down to Ngong Ping (the very touristy village below where the cable car alights) at 6.15, there was only Starbucks, (God bless Starbucks) who stayed open past their closing times to fuel queuing tourists with coffee. We also got the last ciabatta and shared it. ITs probably worth noting that we went on Jan 1st, not sure if this is a public holiday in HK or not but it certainly seemed like it."

The size was impressive but there were a lot of tourists. It was a fairly easy walk up the stairs and a lot of people stopped to take photos along the way. When we got there, there was a lady at the bottom that asked us if we wanted to get a vegetarian meal for 135hkd or just a basic meal for 35hkd. Since we were not that hungry, we got the 35hkd meal which ended up being a lot of food (vegetarian noodles, soy bean dessert and a choice of two dim sums per meal).

The steps to it are many and require a little fitness, but it is worth it. The views are spectacular too. The nearby monastery is a busy place, a working monastery with monks participating in daily rituals while tourists explore and watch. The nearby wisdom walk is also worth visiting and does inspire reflection, trying to 'let go' as the inscriptions suggest is a noble goal although a difficult one to achieve. The vegetarian cafe in the monastery supplies yummy snacks for incredibly cheap prices, about a dollar an item. Don't bother buying food in the very commercialized Ngong Ping. Good if you want tourist souvenirs but that's about it.It is worth the line up for the cable car or if you are really fit and have a few hours you can hike your way up. There is a bus too, it is much cheaper and a bit of a thrill ride itself, very winding road and a bus driver testing the bus's cornering ability. I caught the cable car up and the bus down, it was a good way to go.Definitely give yourself at least a full half a day to visit this very special Hong Kong site."

This was built by the government, and is widely advertised. Let's get real. To get to this area from the Central Station will take about 20-30 minutes on the MTR. The line (queue) to buy tickets is very long, so that you can stand in a slowly moving line for at LEAST 2 or 3 hours. If you have never ridden a Cable Car (funicular) it is a nice long ride, about 25 minutes. But the view is of industrial areas, the Hong Kong International Airport, and some mountain scenery ... NOT the Hong Kong skyline. There is a 'fast lane' to use if you must go. The signs say for Travel Agent vouchers (which equates to online ticket purchases). DEFINITELY buy tickets online in advance if you go! The fast lane line is only a few minutes, rather than a few hours. You must select a time when you purchase online, and then figure backward for your arrival via MTR or other method, depending on traffic, to get there on time. Also, remember that you must wait in line again at the top for the return trip. This may not be faster even with online tickets purchased, but might be faster if you may a bit more for the Crystal Car (glass bottomed Car). This line can easily be 30-45 minutes. The weather, especially on top, can be windy and cool. Once there, numerous restaurants of various quality and price are available. (After standing in line for 2-3 hours and the 25 minute ride, many people are hungry! You may need to stand in line at a restaurant, and seating may be limited.) The walk to the Buddha is not far (just past the 'village' that is simply new buildings which house souvenir shops), a few hundred meters. Then the climb up the 200 steps is okay because this is all new, the steps are spaced evenly and consistent; although hand rails are limited. The actual Buddha is very large and there is a walkway around the base and up a few steps for a higher platform. The view -- looking down -- is nice, but not at all spectacular; a view of the monastery below among green hillsides. This is one sight that is just NOT worth the hours of effort, unless for sincere religious reasons (a few monks are there, but others are almost all tourists). Oh, as for the widely advertised Fishing Village boat tours and such ... just suspect that the villagers are fishing for bank-notes from you pocket, and you'll get what you expect. It is contrived, on a grand scale, and can be a HUGE disappointment and waste of time."

Had a quick meal at the mall, which provides lots of food choices.Found the cable car station nearby after asking for directions. The queue was not long and it moved quite fast as many counters were open to cater to the visitors. The trip on the cable car was peaceful and beautiful. Could see the airport easily with the plans taking landing.After alighting from the cable car, walked through a street with shophouses. Found another eatery and ate japanese food. Continued our walk and found Po Lin Monastery and Big Buddha. The Sun was just nice in the Dec weather. Walked up the stairs to the Big Buddha. The view up there was amazing! Would definitely come back again! May try the guided nature tour next time when my kids are in their teens."

I recommend arriving early and purchasing the cable car tickets before arriving, so as to reduce queuing time. The crystal cabin is also not worth it, since you'll be seeing mostly green plants only through the glass panel on the bottom of the cabin.Though you have to climb lots of stairs to get to the top of the Big Buddha, the view from there is rewarding. But beware of the cows wandering around at the bottom of the Big Buddha, as they tend to rummage through unattended bags."

This place is a great place if you're seeking peacefulness when visiting Hong Kong. Moreover, you have to try the vegetarian set menu in the Po Lin Monastery (right across the Big Buddha). While the price of the set menu is not the cheapest one, but I would say you get what you paid. Even for me who don't like vegetable very much, the set menu (I recall that I have the most delicious mushroom and fried taro as part of the menu) taste really delicious and really worth the price. Other than that, after seeing the Big Buddha, you may want to spend 1 up to 1.5 hours in the Ngong Ping Village. In there, you could find various restaurants and souvenirs shops. Don't worry, the price for the souvenirs are all fixed and no need to bargain in the shops. For visiting the Big Buddha, you could go either using the 360 Ngong Ping (cable car) or by Bus (both ways are from Admiralty MTR Station). As I never enjoyed riding the cable car, I took the bus to avoid the long queue (yes, the Cable Car is more famous than bus :D) and it took about 40 minutes."

I would recommend leaving HK central at around 8am otherwise be prepared to wait for hours before getting on a cable car. The cable car up to the top has great views if its a clear day(it's worth the extra cash for a glass bottom cable car). The Buddha is big - but for me the journey and scenery was more impressive. It is well worth walking the track back out - it gives you a much greater appreciation of the views and I would rate it better than dragons back walk. Note it is quite steep in parts but by waking out you have more down hill sections. It took me and my GF (reasonably fit 25 year olds) 2 hours to walk from the top back to the MTR station - it was 7.2km according to my Garmin and we set a moderate pace with a few stops for photos and drink breaks."

One can visit the island via 2 options either by Cable car from tung Chung or by bus 23 again from tung Chung mtr . If you are really wanting to go by the cable car to experience the cable car then it's suggested else take the cheaper bus option. The cable car does give some breathtaking views of the hills along with views of Lantau island and the adjoining Hong Kong airport terminal. Once inside there is the monastery and lot of shops and restaurants . The climb to the giant Buddha is quite exciting with about 250 steps and you get some great vantage points for some selfies and photo-ops . Do carry jackets during the winter season as it can get pretty cold up there .All in all a good option for a day outing if you are a first time traveller to Hong Kong "

Buy your tickets in advance, bypass the queues, and spend as long as you choose visiting the attraction! Cable car ride is a bit scary, it's 25 minutes and goes REALLY high, but as someone who doesn't like fairground rides or heights, it's really not that bad and gives you a great scenic view of the Big Buddha on approach.The 268 steps are also not too bad, and the statue is pretty impressive.Well worth the visit, but it is definitely a tourist hotspot so don't bother if you're trying to get a flavour of what Hong Kong is all about."

The views are outstanding but not for faint hearted if you're afraid of heights. Once you're up the whole site is fantastic. You take a walk up to the base of the statue and then the steep walk up the steps which does take your breathe away. Once up the Buddha is just amazing and well worth the trip.

The cable car ride from Tung Chung to the Big Buddha is an absolute delight and one with an amazing view. The small tourist village at the foot of the Buddha is a bustling pace with lot of food & shopping options. Dont get demotivated by the number of steps you have to climb to get to the Buddha..it is totally worth the climb. SO peaceful, serene. And the small museum below the Buddha is a must see as well"

First of all: even in the low season we spent about 2 hours waiting in a line to get into the cableway (about 180 Dollars / person). So, if you really want to see the buddha, you shoud arrive at the cableway station very early, when it opens. Or try to book tickets in advance, this seemed to be possible. By the way: you need about an hour to get to the cableway station from the city centre...The ride with the cableway was probably the best part of the trip (some decent views of the airport), but the area arround the station uphill is just some touristic nonsense, an accumulation of souvenir-shops and some \"attractions\" like \"3D-cinemas\" and so on. The buddha itself: if you never have been to asian countries and Hongkong ist the first and only stay and contact to the culture, you may be somewhat impressed, but otherwise (and if size doesn't matter): it's really not worth the money and time! You will just loos a big chunk of your day! I really don't get it, why there are so many positive reviews...Note: this is just a review of the cableway and the buddha, we haven't explored the whole island, maybe there are some nice hiking trails or other placed worth to see..."

Do try to enjoy your way up instead of running.The view from the top is beautiful and the statue is so magnificent. You may consider visiting Po Lin Monastery next door.

I arrived early on first cable car so not many people is a good tip if you can book online to jump the queues :) went straight through all the inevitable shops of the village and straight to it. Most precious memory is of around 15 Buddhists ( not monks) kneeling and praying up each of the 286 steps. They were just starting and I held back a bit trying to be respectful and they were very kind and insisted I went first :) The profane came later with camera clicking tourists oblivious (me too !) to what the Buddha really was about. Understandable as this and the monastery are clearly packaged in a tourism package. Recommend the vegetarian cafe and also getting the cable car one way and the bus from behind the shops near the cable car to either Mui Wo Ferry terminal in the east or if you have time to Tai O in the west. 170 HK$"

The cable car was not in operation that day so we had to take the bus no. 23 and it was quite a long ride of about 45 min around the windy road up. Do have your Octopus card (about HKD34/adult, child is half the price I think) with you or purchase the bus tickets at the ticket office of the bus interchange/terminal prior to queuing for the bus. Cannot remember if the ticket includes return, but just keep it with you till you reach back at the bus terminal. We reached the destination and got off, to be received by a strong gust of cold wind, followed by drizzle. Do bring a windbreaker / jacket when you go there. It can be quite chilly. If you do not have trouble walking or climbing stairs, recommend that you do climb up the 100+ steps. It is definitely achievable and I must say as a non-Buddhist, the scenary and the Buddha sitting on top was quite an impressive sight. Didn't regret bringing my mom there. I suggest to climb up the stairs first, before proceeding to the temple across to rest and have a vegetarian meal or beancurd. I was taken in by the positive reviews of the vegetarian meals and bought meal ticket at HKD98 / pax to have a standard vegetarian meal but am disappointed with the taste/quality. There are 3 dishes with unlimited soup and rice, but i didn't find it tasty at all. In fact, some of us who did not buy the meal found that the small shop at the back of the hall served vegetarian bee hoon and snacks (sweet and savoury) and beancurd (a must-try)and it was much cheaper and more tasty! Therefore, my advice is do check out the small shop first before deciding if you wish to purchase the meal ticket. This is a 1-time trip for me. Do not think I will go there again in the near future, but this was a trip that I did not regret including in my itinery."

I had a 9 hour lay over in Hong Kong on my way from the U.S. To Perth, AU.I arrived at the Hong Kong airport at 7AM and passed through customs and immigration fairly quickly.I had my carry-on back pack with me but my big suitcase wasn't, it was automatically transferred over to my connecting flight so that was nice.Anyway, once you pass through customs and immigration there are signs everywhere pointing you to the bus terminal.The bus terminal is right outside the airport doors so you don't have to walk too far at all.The bus from the airport to the cable car(that you ride to the big statue) is the \"S1\" bus.It cost 3 dollars and 50 cents to ride from the airport to the cable car.The driver does not give change. I only had 20$ bills and so I lost 16.50 on that trip(make sure you have smaller bills)....Anyway, the bus was a double decker bus and the ride is about 45 minutes.The end of the line is the cable car station. I believe the cable car to the statue is called tung Chung 360 or something similar.Anyway, I arrived at the cable car station about 40 minutes before it opened so I decided to just catch another bus, this time from the cable car station to the big statue.The bus terminal is right at the cable car station so it's not like you have to walk far.The statue is at the end of that bus line so it's very obvious where you get off.you can see the statue very well from the ground level and you really don't need to walk all the way up all those stairs,,,,but it's great exercise of you do decide and it's a great view.Anyway, besides the statue there is a monastery and other buildings.A lot of souvenir stands as well.I took a taxi back to the airport from the statue and it cost 200$ Hong Kong dollars....that may sound expensive, especially if you compare it to the 3.50 the bus cost...but 200$ Hong Kong is maybe 20 or 25 American so it's really not that bad at all.Anyway, I highly recommend seeing this.

Taking the S1 bus from the airport (where we left all our luggage) it took around 20mins to reach Tung Chung where you can get a cable car to Ngong Pong village. MUST DO - visit any 7-eleven and buy your tickets beforehand as the queue without doing this can be up to 2 hours long! Getting your ticket this way allows you to join the vouchers queue which meant we only queued for 20mins! The ride in the cable car was fun but not for the faint hearted and if you can stretch your budget the crystal bottom cars are great and allow for some incredible photos. The journey takes around 25-30mins and once compete you reach the Ngong Ping village which hosts plenty of gift shops and food outlets (including a Subway) for any less adventures with there food! You can then walk to see big Buddha at your own pace but will need to climb the 200 or so steep steps to see him in person and obtain some great pictures. Don't forget you will need to queue again when your head back (crystal bottom cars tend to have a shorter queue if time isn't on your side). We then opted to get a taxi back to the hotel which cost $50hkd and meant we weren't late for our check in! This attraction can be done within around 4 hours if that's all the time you have and you get your tickets early! It's a must in Hong Kong and you won't be left disappointed."

However, my partner did go and offered me his opinion which only made my disappointment even greater! This was his view: seeing the Big Buddha with your own eyes is incredibly overwhelming. All the photos you see of it don't do it justice and calling it big is a massive understatement as the statue is enormous! The view of the Buddha from the bottom of the steps and the view from the top are equally breathtaking. I would have given this 5 stars if it weren't for the huge number of tourists making it difficult to get decent and personal photos and the fact that the cable car was not running at the time due to maintenance. However, I don't regret going, it's a sight I will never forget. If you like beautiful views and you enjoy being overwhelmed then you definitely have to see the Big Buddha.

We drove & parked the car at Citygate Tung Chung which is a 10 min slow walk to the cable car station. Some people do the cable car one way & bus the other way but to keep it simple, we decided to do the cable car both ways since the views are fantastic. We took the crystal glass bottom gondola going up which was breathtaking & the normal one back down.Once up there, its an interesting walk through a man made Chinese village with restaurants, coffee shops & souvenir shops to the base of the structure. From there you have to climb approx. 250 steps up to the base of the actual statue. Its doable. My mom who is 83 did it albeit slowly & stopping many times on the way. Once up enjoy the views which are stunning.There is a huge vegetarian restaurant run by the monastery & many people like to eat there but I have eaten there before & the food is greasy, cold & pretty tasteless so we ate at Ebeneezers which does great kebabs, pizzas, shakes etc & after that we browsed through one or two souvenir shops.One of the highlights was feeding the cows & they will eat anything. They even followed a lady around who gave them some cake.Then we came back down. NOTE: Check on the website before you go because the cable car may be closed for either maintenance or if the winds are too high, they can stop too.Also DO book your tickets online which is what we always do. Print out the acknowledgement & this will fast track you to get your tickets. We got ours in 20 mins whereas people who just showed up had to wait for almost 2 hours because of long queues. First there is the queue for tickets & then a queue for getting onto the gondola so try to go early & avoid the weekend & public holidays if you can.You will need the better part of a whole day but it is worth it- every bit."

Ngong Cheng itself has an appeal if it is a bit commercial and 'Disneyfied' but the Buddha statue is impressive and set away from the shopping village. Remember there are lots of steps to get close to the statue and you need to be very fit to undertake the mountain walking trails up from the north coast and down to the west coast monasteries and villages but if you are very fit and like challenges this is a wonderful way to see the hidden Lantau ans step back in time."

We went on Saturday so lines very well may be shorter during the week but it took us 1.5 to 2 hours to get on the cable car and 1.5 to 1 to come back. If you buy your tickets on line you would save time as we waited about an hour just to buy the tickets."

            "review": "A MUST!! COOL ATTRACTION!. Great experience, a must in HK. In my personal opinion this should be #1 in Tripadvisor (we went to the first ten places in the ranking). Let's move on the recommendations: 1) BUY YOUR TICKETS ONLINE, do it, do not hesitate, we didn't do it because we went on a \"casual monday\" and overconfidence was our sin. The line was for 3 hours just to get to the top! (1 hour to buy tickets, 1.5 hours to get to the cable car, 0.5 hours to get to the top), if you buy tickets online is only about 15 minutes because you get to crossed in a VIP line. 2) IF YOU DON'T BUY ONLINE TICKETS, get a special package (some options include movies, shows, etc) you'll pay extra bucks but you get to the \"VIP\" line as if you buy online tickets (we did that and save us like 2 hours), just tell the guy that receives you in the front you would like to acquire a package. We saw 2 movies and it was good. 3) GET THE METRO/ SUBWAY, from kowloon or HK you can get from the station to Disneyland or Gran Buda. It's the cheapest and best way to do it. The cars are clean, with air conditioner, and excellent service. Literally you walk straight to attraction. BEWARE: there is an outlet store next to the entry of Cable car so if your boyfriend or girlfriend likes to shop go with extra time (my wife stop for a couple of hours and almost missed the cable car!)"

This probably has some nice views when you take the cable car. I prefer myself to do the walk of the Ngon Ping reqcue trail for 3 hours. Getting to the starting point of the walk requires some research before you go. Once you get there, it is an amazing walk with very nice views and no people at all. The buddha itself is not a big deal, but the monastary across is so much nicer.The walk down is also very nice and is on the other side than you walked up. I liked this very much.The cable car is quite expensive."

            "review": "Well worth the time. This was the one thing I wanted to do during our Hong Kong Trip and we almost did not do it because we saved it for the day we were leaving, it was kind of rainy, and it was more involved to get to than we had originally thought. Give yourself a full day to appreciate this experience fully. However, this worked out well for us because the Big Buddha is ridiculously close to the airport. So if you travel light, you can check out of your hotel, visit the Big Buddha and pop over to the airport no problem. BUT some taxi's may charge you and extra 'baggage fee' so watch out for that. If you have time, plan it so you can catch a public bus over to the airport. It is a great traditional/ancient compliment to your big city Hong Kong experience. We went later in the day and on the chairlift ride back we got some very nice sunset over the Buddha pictures.Take the metro or bus to Lantau Island. From there, near the bus terminal is the ticket counter for the chairlift. They say it takes an hour to get to the Big Buddha but it is more like thirty minutes. Waiting in line for the tickets takes just about as long as it takes to ride the chairlift to the Buddha. But it is a worthwhile experience in itself. You rise up over the island, get a fun view of the airport, the mountains and then some nice distance shots of Buddha as well as the ocean and scenery. If you look down you will notice a winding mountain path. If you are a hiker, you might try your hand at the lengthy, rustic climb. We took the 'economy' cable car and it was just fine. Be aware you will probably share the car with strangers. Remember to give yourself time to wait in several lines (the line for the chairlift, both ways, as well as at checkout counters int he stores)You disembark in Ngong Ping Village. It is a cute but very touristy little changeover town. There are souvenir shops and places to eat. It will take time but it was worth it to cash in on the free souvenir picture that came with the chairlift ticket. After walking through the village it is a more cultural little hike to the Po Lin Monastery (Which was fun to pose in front of and take a few scenic pictures of but we found it unnecessary to enter since we had already been in more than a few monastery's.) Spattered with statues and 'photo-ops.'The main event was climbing the steps up to the Buddha, it was tiring (we did it with all our gear with us since we had checked out of our hotel) but enjoyable. Take your time, stop and look back and enjoy the view of the mountains. It was worth the climb to the top and since it was a rainy day, not crowded at all. The hike back down is all down hill so will not take nearly as long."

I gone there via cable car, which I feel is the best way to travel as it is 25-30 minute journey with great view of Hong Kong and Lantau Island. You can take this cable car from Tung Chung MTR station. There is another 268 steps you need to take to reach at Big Buddha and it's worth when you are there. You can see nice scenery from that point too.There is a vegetarian restaurant in \"Po Line Monastery\" which has quite reasonable price. Do not forget to visit this monastery and Tai O Fishing Village which is also near by. It's worth day trip.I could recommend not to take return cable car ticket if you are planning for whole day, instead head to Tai O Village after Big Buddha. Go to Mui Wo by bus from Tai O and take ferry back to central."

To avoid the cable car queues make sure you pre-book on line and book the cable car BOTH WAYS. We had a Crystal cable car on the way out which has a glass floor. The queues are shorter and every third car is a crystal car. We should have booked a time to return and probably a crystal car because leaving at 4pm took 2 hours in the queue. The village at the top is utterly synthetic but charming none the less. The big buddha is....big! Very interesting place to see and charming views at the top.If you buy a meal ticket you can go into the buddha where there are art works and relics. We bought a snack meal HKD38 and that was pretty substantial vegetarian noodles, dim sum and a drink. A bargain."

Bus will stop just at the entrance to the Big Buddha and Po Lin Monastery. Getting back is pretty much the same route, the bus interchange is behind Ngong Pin Village, the ride back costs HKG$23. Not sure if the rates are different during the weekday though.The walk up to the Big Buddha is about 250 steps, we lose the count somewhere along the way.

This was our second time in HK, decided to visit, but after all we can say - it is not really necessary.First - huge lines to the cable car;Second - prices for the bus were increased as high as 54 HK dollars round-trip because of Sunday;Third - to go on top is free, but to go inside - you have to pay (coffee and dimsum is included)Fourth - Becomes very crowded, no atmosphere, no religious feelings;Don't recommend."

You really must go on a clear day otherwise it is a waste of money. You can see the airport and Hong Kong city and countryside and mountains in between. Very pretty view! This is a really awesome experience! Not to be missed while in Hong Kong if you get a clear day!There are a couple of ways to get to the Big Buddha:-you can take the MTR to the small town and then a bus to the fishing village and then a bus to the Big Buddha-you can take the MTR to the small town and then take the gondola to the Big Buddha (more expensive to do it this way and long queues for the gondola both ways)We did the bus one way and the train the other.Huge Buddha and many monks everywhere. Lots of walking around so be prepared and there is a large shopping outlet mall in the town as well as some small shops up at the Bug Buddha.We found that many people speak english as this is widely visited by tourists.Enjoyable activity for any age group"

I was terrified beforehand, but was so glad we chose the crystal cabin -a clear, see-through floor - , for two reasons. First, we had not prebooked and had to wait in line. About an hour but still worth it. When ready for the ride back down, the regular cable cars line was easily an hour and a half, the crystal cabin line was only about 30 minutes. Second reason to do the crystal cabin is that it's awesome! We took turns sitting and lying on the floor, great photos and videos. The walk up to the Buddha is long and steep, but well worth it to stand under the massive statue and take in the views."

Lantau Island is wonderful, if you are going to Hong Kong, make sure that you find the 3 - 4 hours (minimum) to get to Lantau Island - you won't regret it! Big Buddha itself is very beautiful and obviously has deep religious meaning for some. The climb to the top of the stairs is quite a feat, but the view from the top of beautiful. The monasteries are also very interesting to walk through - some parts will be off limits to visitors, but still very beautiful.A tip for the cable cars - you can buy your tickets online a head of time to avoid the ticket line. You will still have to wait in line to get onto a cable care, which was about ~45 minutes in the day that we went, but you can avoid the long line to get tickets THEN get in line for the cars :) Some paid for the more expensive \"crystal cabin.\" Lines for the crystal cabins were less than half what they were for the regular cabins, so if you are really in a time crunch it is probably worth it."

Not only you get to reach Big Buddha in comfort in a mere 25 minutes but you also get the magnificent views and the thrill of this mega ride. It is advisable to book your tickets online beforehand as the queue at the station was quite something when we arrived there even on a Monday morning when we had not expected to much of a crowd... could not be more wrong... And when you get to the top, Ngong Ping village greets you together with Big Buddha.. What a magnificent sight even on the rather hazy day we went there. Take your time to explore the 260 steps to the seat of Buddha and the amazing interiors and decorations of the Monastery. On the way back you can stop for a quick snack or drink at one of the many venues in the village which cater for all international tastes.. A must-do attraction when in Hong Kong."

Buying Octopus card to travel around HK is the best. Get off at Tung Chung Station and the 360 cable tram is right there. Make sure to buy the tkt for 360 ahead online to avoid lines. 360 tram with Crystal car (basically bottom glass view) is worth for extra cost. It took us 5-6 hour to the entire trip, we had to do this quick due to our short stay in HK. Getting the 360 tram early is a good way to avoid the crowd."

It's been almost 8 years since I last visited the Big Buddha, back then we got a coach up, missing all the fun of the cable cars, paid our respects and then off we went to continue our jollies in Hong Kong. This time round we decided to take the cable car up...We got there just after 10am as we were warned about queues, unfortunately this still wasn't early enough. The queue for tickets was worryingly long, heck, even the queue with pre-booked tickets was almost as long.So, we waited, and waited, and waited some more, at about the hour and a half mark we were almost on the same level as the ticket office. At about the two hour mark we were buying our tickets.Now tickets come in all shapes and sizes, we opted for a return standard cable car fare (non crystal (glass floor) as prices were even more exorbitant) and the Motion 360 pass for Ngong Ping (which I'll review separately, as technically you could argue that it's a different attraction, just in the same area...) This came to just under $500, not particularly cheap, but it probably won't make a massive dent in your spending money.After buying our tickets, we joined yet another queue to await the cable car up. At around the 3 hour mark (remember this wasn't a weekend or at the height of the holiday season, it was just an average November day) we were in a cable car on the way up, and man, what a view you get. You get some amazing vistas as you round the peaks of various mountains, you can see the airport from up there, and there's nothing quite so stunning as when you catch glimpse of the Tian Tan Buddha (Big Buddha).When we finally landed we had a quick peek at part of Ngong Ping but we made a beeline for the Buddha instead. The Buddha is nothing sort of epic, sat on top of a lotus and surrounded it are six smaller statues called \"The Offering of the Six Devas\", each one is making a different offering to the Buddha.There are apparently some 268 steps up to the Buddha, but, of course, progress is hampered by other tourists/visitors/selfie-sticks/and random people dropping to their knees in prayer without so much as looking behind them to make sure that they aren't in the way of someone else making their way up.Whilst in the area we hit Ngong Ping as mentioned and the Po Lin Monastery which I'll review on their respectively pages on Tripadvisor.At around 5pm we started to make our way to the cable car station (is station the right word?) as the last car down was 5.30pm, if memory serves. Perhaps a better, a more cost effective way would be to get the cable car up and then a bus back down or vice versa?The Tian Tan Buddha is well worth a visit, particularly if you like stunning views and places of religious significance, but if you're thinking of getting the cable car up then think about going early. Once you have a time in your head of when you want to arrive then go earlier than that. I can't stress just how bad the queues are and I've wasted time in line for an iPad 2 way back when!"

I showed her my printed ticket, and she said to go in the special line up on the right and that will put me right in the cable car queue. (Note: I purchased a ticket for the 10:15am cable car, but that means nothing. As long as u arrive for the right day, u can go anytime). I still did have to wait 30 minutes to get on, but that is probably because I arrived in the morning. When I came back down after lunch, I heard someone say it was 75 minutes just to get to the ticket booth and the roughly 45 minutes to get into a cable car!! Yikes!I usually never write long reviews but I want other travelers to know that by buying your tickets in advance, it will save you tons of time and u will get your ticket emailed to you.Oh, and the Big Buddha was awesome!!"

You should take the cable car from Tung Chung terminus. But queuing to buy ticket was crazy! Took about 30 minutes to buy the ticket and another 30 minutes to board though travelling on the cable car just took around 20 minutes if I remember correctly. And the advice is you should buy the ticket online. Because I've seen people who booked from the internet could board directly and they had to wait just 30 minutes.But when you get to Ngong Ping terminus, you will have to walk to the Buddha Hill. There are many stalls like SubWay... etc. And there comes the tired part. You will have to go up through the stairs which was a bit tiring. You will see several souvenir shops under the Buddha which are reallllllyyyyyy expensive."

And it was indeed very good when we tried. We took a crystal cable car (with a transparent glass floor). If you are ready to pay little extra do choose this as it is very nice experience to see the landscape beneath your feet. It is also less crowded compared to standard cable car. The advantage of booking online is that you save time and effort of standing in long queues. While going we shared the car with another small group but return journey was only 4 of us. (maybe since there was not much crowd.) Hence enjoyed it to max. They also have private cable ride which is very expensive but this unexpected surprise was very good.The cable ride crosses almost 3 mountains/hills and reasonably long ride 20/25 min. You can see HK airport which is very close by.Once you reach on top you have to walk a bit and take steps to the big statue. That may be bit tiring. We initially wanted to take 360 guided tour but were happy that we didn't as it may have become more tiring. Do check their website and choose suitable option.The toilets here were amazingly clean and nice. There are some food joints. We even got a place where they had quiet a few Indian options like fish biryani, chicken tikka pizza, etc."

It was a beautiful 40 mins bus ride from Tung Chung to Ngong Ping - scenic hillside views. Big Buddha statue itself is magnificent, enough said, but what really takes my breath is the scenery from the top. You'll see Po Lin Monastery from far with mountains and plants around it, or if you go around it, you'll see the beautiful earth-line. Tips:- Go early in the morning (we arrived at Ngong Ping village at 10 AM - it was not crowded and you can take many beautiful photographs and you won't get annoyed with selfie sticks).- I went with my daughter - she could climb the stairs up to Big Buddha but and asked me to carry her to the ground level, which is very difficult since it is like 200+ stairs."

Well, if you procrastinate and forget to book online for your round trip cable car ride you may be in for a long and boring wait. But fear not, you may be able to avoid the lines if you are willing to take a different route to the Buddha. Since the Tung Chung MTR stop is the closest to the Buddha head that way. When you arrive access the line and if it's too long to tolerate, head to the taxi stand outside the station and get to the Buddha that way. If you are going early enough in the day you can see the Buddha, shop a bit in the village and then head back before the incoming cable car crowds are heading back.As the steps to the Buddha don't open till 10am you can get to the Buddha by 930am leisurely walk to the Buddha ( the souvenir stalls closest to the steps open before the village shops) and be on a cable car back by 11am, depending on how much you like to shop. Sure you will pay for a cab and then a cable car back but you won't be wasting time standing in a long and winding line. The view is worth seeing so you will want to do the return via cable car, you'll just be in a better frame of mind without the frustrating wait."

The glass bottom car sounds interesting on paper but, once your in it wasn't frightening nor picturesque as all you see are tree tops through the bottom. Also, we were told that the line is shorter for the glass bottom cars but, didn't notice that much shorter of a wait to get through the line. Once to the top you take a trek up to the Big Buddha and can view the Buddha up close by taking a long set of stairs to the statue.

From this point we queued over 3 hours, then once you've bought your ticket it's another hour at least to get onto the cable car. All this to view a statue which should symbolise a higher more enlightened way of life......ironic.With regards to the queue we did one hour downstairs, and two hours upstairs, then the extra hour once we had the ticket. Also if your buying a standard ticket there will be about 400-500'people that will walk ahead of you because they have bought fast track/queue jumping tickets so be ready for this..........again a nice policy for a honest enlightened being.My advice......set yourself a time limit and if it seems slower then walk away.....you could waste a hole day here. It's about \u00a316 for basic cable car ride and although the view is nice as expected.....for a family this would be a very expensive 20 minutes.There is a bus you can get up for a fraction of the cost in about 30 mins giving you a few extra hours at the top if you want, then if the queue is shorter get the cable car down.Worth a view but not worth a whole days holiday. Disappointed with the expense and policy of this organisation."

Lots of tourists and locals cant be wrong. This Buddha sits kind of up a mountain a little with a couple hundred easy steps to climb to get close. You are inspired to climb up because you can see the Buddha the whole way and from a few miles away some certain vantage points as well.You can walk around the outside of the Buddha and up a little bit.

It was a serene and peaceful experience which took some travelling to get to. Back in HK all this time later - took a ferry to Discovery Bay, bus to Tung Chong and was appalled at the queues - not just for the cable car (1.5 hours wait) but also the bus (1 hour wait). We decided not to go as I'd rather treasure the previous memory than getting there to find crowds queuing up the steps. This by the way was a non-school holiday and mid week day. We got the bus instead to Mui Wo to catch the inter island ferry and had a great walk/meal on Cheung Chau.So here's the travel tip:- if you really want to get up to the Buddha take the central-Mui Wo ferry. At Mui Wo there were no crowds waiting for the bus up to the Buddha. The bus stop is right where you get off the ferry and is clearly signed (bus to Buddha!). The buses - even the minibuses - all take Octopus cards. Mui Wo also has good places to eat at the 'cooked food market' at the ferry terminal. If you do get up there give my regards to the big Bud and wish him serenity."

Even if coupon said only for 360 option, my friends got 10 percent off on a regular ride. Paying online is marginally faster. I would suggest taking the ferry over and riding the cable car out. It is less busy that way. Either route is expensive.View from cable car is great if it's a nice day. At the base of the Big Buddha, you have a choice of \"snack + going to top\" vs \"Meal + going to top\". You have to buy a ticket to see the relic. The meal is not very good.

If you are really brave, you can book a glass-bottomed gondola on the cable car... not for vertigo-sufferers. Then on the way home, why not try the walk down the other side? Walk along the so-called 'piazza', past the small tea plantation, past the tea garden 'restaurant', and locate the starting point at the rather odd \"Wisdom Path\", which is a series of strange wooden poles that almost look myserious with a bit of mist around. Follow the track downhill to Shek Pik reservoir, about an hour and a half walk. By the time you reach the road you'll be hungry, so jump on a mini-bus and head to Cheung Chau beach for South African-inspired lunch and beer at The Stoep restaurant.

The 23 bus is actually in a separate bus terminal up and around the corner from the bus terminal directly across from the MTR station. I stopped and asked for directions. Anyway I did not have to wait to catch the bus there were no lines. Overall the ride took about 45 minutes and was a great way to see some of the island. A bit of the ride is along the coast. Once at the top the bus stopped at the village which to me seemed like a tourist trap. It was all souvenir shops and food. The Buddha is just a few minutes walk from the village. There are close to 300 steps to get to the top under the Buddha but is worth it to see the views and fully grasp how big the Buddha really is. The views are magnificent from up top. The monastery below is very peaceful and beautiful as well. I highly recommend seeing this."

The number 23 bus from the bus station which is behind the metro terminal is the one to take you to the Big Buddha....also a big line up with buses running every 20 minutes...again a waste of time. ( I estimated an hour and a half at least and it was a Tuesday) What I did was take a previous trip advisor members advice and take a cab there and back. No waste of time at all and almost the same price as the cable car and you are there in 30 minutes for a cost of $170 and return the same way for the same cost. The cable car is $138 per person, return, so for an extra $32 each way (for a couple)you will truly enjoy the experience !!!! So, when you exit the Tung Chung metro station head for the taxis outside. The ones directly outside are the RED cabs that service the urban areas only.....they do not go to the Big Buddha. You need to take the BLUE and WHITE cabs which are located at a smaller taxi stand to the left of the Red taxis stand. Between the 2 stands, and separating them, is a walkway to the road. Walk to the left of the Red taxis and past the walkway and you will see a stand like a long bus shelter painted blue and white...that is the pick up location. There are fewer of these cabs but they do arrive on a regular basis as we only waited 5 minutes and saw many more coming back to the MTR station as we headed up, but the wait could be longer but hang in there! At the top for the return there were plenty of taxis. Time wise......it took 30 minutes to go up and 25 minutes to come down. If you have been on cable cars before...this is the way to go!!Enjoy your day instead of lining up like a Disneyland attraction! Hope this helps a lot of fellow travellers!"

Only erected in 1993 so a mere 22 years old. Would advise to go first thing in the morning to avoid the crowds at the cable cars and even the buses to it plus it is also cooler than walking the steps up to it in the noon sun. Last thing is there is a huge circle in front of the big buddha steps. Go to the centre of it and speak. Listen to your echo."

I highly encourage everyone to go see it, even if you're not Buddhist or all that interested in temples for the sheer fact that it's an incredible sight, not to mention the views from Ngong Ping village are fantastic. Getting to the Buddha can be a bit of a hassle, and everyone on here will offer their opinion of the best way to go. All the routes to the Buddha are somewhat time consuming and ultimately it comes down to how much you want to spend. The easiest, and most expensive (if traveling in a group) is the cable car which picks up Tung Chung MTR station. The cable car is about 180 HKD round trip per person for a standard car. This can be a little troublesome due to the extremely long lines that form to take a cable car. Another option is the bus, which I have no experience with so cannot speak to how great it is. There is also a hiking trail that leads to the summit from near Tung Chung. This hike takes a good amount of time but is worth the views. The final option, and my recommendation, is taking a taxi from the MTR station or a nearby hotel. You have to take a blue taxi and the cost is about 200 HKD each way. This is a great time and cost saving method to get to the Buddha if you have multiple people on the trip to split the fare. If you're traveling alone or with just one person, the other options are likely more cost effective. The great thing about the cab (and bus) option is you get to see some small villages on Lantau Island in addition to some great views out to sea. The Buddha itself is an impressive engineering feat. You can see it from far away and it only gets more impressive. The surrounding temple grounds are also some of the well kept and meditative I've seen. Great sights, highly recommend!"

It is right up there (literally) as Buddha's go but the location does it all. We first went up there when visiting Silvermine Bay on Lantau Island which is about 30 minutes drive to the CLK Hong Kong Airport. We took the bus which was interesting as we stopped a couple of interesting places on the way. Once up there we enjoyed the market and a lovely simple Buddhist lunch then looked at the Stature in awe admiring the perfect location and magnificent work to make the presentation complete.Now there is a better way up and that is on the Cable Car a short hop from the airport. You can get there by Bus, taxi or even walking. Pick-up the tickets at the base of the Cable Car and enjoy what must be around an 8 kilometre ride over the bay then up and up the mountain...........views spectacular over the airport watching the planes take of below.

To make our visit to the Big Buddha, we took the cable car to the top and then walked through the 'village' which is a bit too touristy, but there were some fairly decent restaurants as well as gift shops. At first we planned to spend less than half a day doing the whole thing but the wait for the cable car was quite long. I recommend getting your ticket online first--those people were able to bypass the ticket line. The cable car ride is quite long and the views are breathtaking. Definitely worth it. When we got to the top of the island and made our way through the village, the shops and the photo opportunities, we finally found ourselves at the base of the Buddha. We began our ascent up the 200 or so steps. It is completely manageable because there are landings every so often for those who need a break.once you get to the top, you won't regret it. It is so beautiful and only from there can you appreciate how large the Buddha is. For about HK $30 you can go inside the Buddha and climb some more stories and see the relic. Keep in mind this is a holy place and contains a relic of Buddha. The fee includes a bottle of water and ice cream when you leave. We spent a good bit of time walking around the Buddha to see it from all sides.If you have time, even on a short visit to Hong Kong, I recommend heading up there and making the effort to climb to the Buddha."

There's also a vegetarian restaurant within it. There's loads of shops on the complex and restaurants too - some are over priced so watch out.

Lantau is reachable by ferry, a pleasant 30 minute ride across the harbor. We made a split impromptu decision and we were off. From the ferry, we took a bus up the mountain. This was another 30 minute drive up harrowing ,curvey roades and well worth the $14 per person round trip. The bus drops you off right at the base of the village, with the Big Buddah statue shadowing everything else. The Big Buddah commands the area, bringing worshippers out from all over the world. It is relatively young (1993) but serves as a spiritual source of worship and luck for the devoted. Along the grounds of the statue are walking trails, ornate temples and oddly feral extremely tame cattle. They share the paths with stray dogs, the docile Monks on the property and annoying tourists, poking their steers and appallingly posing for selfies. Yours truly has a video with one as I made blubbering conversation and inquired if she-he spoke English? After viewing some of the temples, we made our way to a vegetarian counter and purchased some authentic Asian light fare. Incents permeated the air causing a foggy visual residue. After much debate, I climbed the 268 steps in 90 degree weather to fully grasp the size and scope of the statue as well as the impressive views. And, indeed it was. Little old ladies with hunched backs and escorts bypassed me on one side, as blind men tapping their canes sidestepped me as I clung onto the railing heaving my chest and silently counting my pulse. Eventually, I made it to the top. The hubs and I rejoiced (being as August I had knee surgery and had to relearn how to walk up and down steps). We soaked in the sights and slowly scaled our way down the steps-going down much easier.We toured the grounds of the village, making a few purchases eventually finding our way back to the bus, down the 30 minute journey to the ferry.  I highly recommend!"

Our second adventure to the Ngong Ping Cable Car and Big Buddha was more organised than the first 3 years earlier - we learnt from experience - and that is what I shall pass on to you ! Firstly - buy your tickets to the cable car from your hotel concierge or travel agent before you go !!!! This will enable you to not only go into the priority pre bought ticket queue, but also will save you a little money. Make sure you go on the MRT to Lantau Island early enough to get you to the ticket queue early !!! MTR Tung Chung Station, Exit B. Walk for approximately five minutes to the Tung Chung Cable Car Terminal.At different times of the year it opens at differing times, so I would recommend checking with your concierge desk the night before and plan to get there at least half an hour before opening. The queues are enormous and it is very hot waiting. There is no need to buy tickets to the glass bottom deluxe cable cars.. This is an extra cost and not really worth it. The normal cable cars offer 360 degree views from expansive windows and really...... do you need to see straight underneath your feet?? Especially when you are so high up and over water!! The cable cars are quite stable, although in breezy weather the do sway a fair bit. If the winds are too strong, the cable car is closed and the only way to the Big Buddha is by bus - a very long trip but extremely interesting. The trip is 7kms long and absolutely a must do !!! The views are amazing...... you can see the whole airport island, the fishing villages far below and the sight of the Buddha coming into view as you pass over one of the last big hills is incredible. Now, when you arrive at your destination, you will be plied with all sorts of souvenirs to buy with your photo taken in the cable car........ they are pricey but good quality. The walk up through the village (this is a very commercialised area now) is quite interesting and there are a myriad of shops selling touristy wares and tokens.... again - nothing you cannot buy at the markets in Kowloon of you really want it. The drinks are cheaper as you near the Buddha..... after going past all the statues of the 12 warriors, look to the left and you will see a very run down shack selling all sorts of lovely ice cold drinks at reasonable prices. You WILL need at least a bottle of water each person to tackle the 268 steps for a closer look at this remarkable statue, and to enjoy the sweeping mountain and sea views that can be seen from its base.You DO NOT need to pay the extra ticket prices asked to view the Big Buddha - the extra ticket is to go INSIDE the Buddha where there is an extra exhibition and another very expensive shop. It is FREE to walk up the steps and explore the outside - please don't feel you need the extra ticket. As you descend the steps again, please take the time to go explore the Po Lin Monastery. This is absolutely beautiful and again FREE. Take your time, and if you like go visit the monks and have a vegetarian lunch in their traditional grounds - beautiful. The cable car trip back is again amazing - and is a great way to get back to Lantau and its many shopping and eating opportunities. Located at Tung Chung MTR station and near Novotel Citygate Hong Kong, Citygate Outlets is the ideal starting point for an adventure on Lantau Island. The Ngong Ping 360 cable car is just a few minutes\u2019 walk away. Citygate Outlets houses 16 food and beverage outlets and entertainment facilities. The Square is specially designed with an outdoor dining space located right next to one of the Asia\u2019s largest outdoor kinetic fountains.Citygate Outlets is the largest outlet mall in Hong Kong. It features more than 80 international brand names and discounts of 30 to 70 per cent. Shops include designer fashion, accessories, sports, children's wear, beauty and home accessories."

The bus station (New Lantau Bus Terminal) is located between the Cable Car Terminal and the Citygate Bus Terminal (near Tung Chung MTR Station). The ride was only HK$17 and it took about 50 min.I arrived there at about 9 am and only a handful of tourists were there. I have heard that the place around the Buddha can be really crowded. People started coming from 10am (that is the time the cable cars run). Since there weren't many people I could take my time and enjoy the view up there next to the Buddha. Near the statue is a small shopping area called Ngong Ping Village. I have seen many (Asian) religious sights but this place seems very artificial and I understand travellers saying that the Buddha is a \"tourist trap\". Nonetheless it was nice to see the Giant Buddha with my own eyes."

Suggest you book a ticket in advance (our guide had done this for us) as the day we went the queue was extremely long. You have the option to book a 'Crystal' cabin which has a glass floor. The 'village' is commercial and has many small outlets and cafes. You walk through this to the foot of the Big Buddha itself. Approx 268 steps to the top - you can't get this far and then not climb up! Also visited the Po Lin monastery. A great half-day trip."

That was a gross underestimate. It was eventually 2 hours and 40 minutes to get on and a further hour queue to get down. The ride is brilliant and takes about 30 minutes each way an the views up there are stunning. The temple is authentic and very elaborate. To get up to the Buddha requires some exertion up lots of steps but the view is fantastic and the sheer size is very impressive.My tips to avoid the queues. Buy your ticket before you get there if you can. It features in packages and the queue to the ticket office was the longest. As noted by others the Crystal ticket means you get to the ride a lot quicker than standard and those with standard tickets join a long queue after the ticket office (just when you think you are done queuing). At the other end the Crstal line moves much quicker and is shorter as well.You can get a bust to the top and of course getting there earlier than I did will pay dividends."

You do need to be fit as there is quite a climb to the Big Buddha but we were told there is a road and shuttle if required.A must see."

Took a day tour to the big Buddha booked through travel agent using Buffalo Tours, which had a few positives from what i have heard : Saw some of the beautiful Lantau isle - fishing village etc and got driven to top of the Buddha (avoiding lengthy morning lines). Lunch at the monastery was included - a multi course vegetarian meal which was amazing. The cable car line to return was huge and would have been 2-3hrs, fortunatly the tour operator got us on as a priority."

My photos turned out beautiful (no photobombers!)You get to walk around the temples and perform your prayers in peace, watch monks sweep the floors and just sit and - most importantly -be zen You'd need to pay if you want to visit the small museum located just below the buddha (scriptures and a bone relic). The ticket comes with a vegetarian meal (not great, but the soy bean drink is creamy and smooth). Recommended if you are into the Buddhist culture. "

From Mongkok we took the MTR all the way to Tung Chung Station (last station near airport & Disneyland). Once you arrive you will see a big outlet mal (Citygate) and Novotel. There are two ways to go to the Big Buddha: You can take the Cable Car (around HK$115 one way) with an outstanding view over the lantau island and the bay. If you want to save some money you can also take Bus No.23 from the bus station to the Big Buddha. But be prepare for an Andrenalin Bus Ride - the road is steep and curvy and the driver not aware that he is driving about 80 lifes - from all of my experience they are all using maximum speed. The Bid Buddha is just Amazing - first walk the stairs to see the Bid Buddha closely (about 200-300 steps). Once you get on top you can witness the great view looking at the bay, the resevoir and the mountains. Dont forget to visit the Monestary after the Big Buddha."

Along the way, you would also pass by a bus terminal where you can take a bus to go Mui Wo, and Tai-o.The climb up the steps to Big Buddha can be done in 20 minutes with short rests in between. The fitter individuals can possibly ascend in a shorter time. The view up there is spectacular. The way to Wisdom Path is just at the base of Big Buddha. When we came down from the Big Buddha, we turned right. We followed a narrow path and walked on for 15 minutes or so before we came to a clearing where various stone pillars could be spotted. Bring mosquito repellent as there are many huge insects and mosquitoes along the way. From the bus terminal, we took bus number 21 to go to Tai-O, a fishing village, which is only a short ride away (less than 20 minutes). We had a ferry ride and walked around the market. From Tai-O, we took bus number 11 back to Tung Chung MTR. You can use Octopus Card on all the buses.Allow 7-8 hours for this trip if you don't want to rush."

I must warn that it's very plain and tasteless food, they don't provide chilli and soy sauce, and it's expensive to get the set lunch.

So I suggest you to get there on the first day after get out from airport or last day before get in airport. You can go there by cable car from Citygate Outlet mall which is you can reach by MTR and stop at tung chung station (last station). There are locker room at Citygate Mall, airport, and some other place. But locker room at Citygate Mall is the cheapest one so you can just drop your bag there before going to Buddha Statue without bringing too many luggage.About the place itself?? Hmm.. Because I went there on the last day before got to airport, I've seen some others similiar view with this one in my whole trip in Hongkong Shenzhen Macau and Guangzhou before it, so i couldn't say I was very impressed. But still, you can feel the sensation of get on the longest route cable car in Asia (or maybe in the world) with a crystal cabin which there is no blind spot on all-over that thing. You can see the 360 view of the islands around Hong Kong (most of it are sea and skyscraper again!!). The price is quite high, but some people said it was worthy. I don't know, I just don't think the same way though.The Buddha statue itself is quite impressive. Maybe it's the largest Buddha I've ever seen. But to be there, you need to climb the stairs about 10 minutes to going up and up. Not a big deal to be honest.To save some money, you can pick a public bus on the way back to Citygate mall then pickup your belonging in the locker room and go to airport. I think four hours is enough to do sightseeing there then back to airport."

Big Buddha is sited near Po Lin Monastery which is interesting to see as well.View from the top is great as always in HK and don't worry, you can go up stares within 10 minutes.How to go there: take a ferry from Central HK, pier 6, and then take a bus (first from the left side of bus station).Also on your way back I recommend to grab Mexican meal in small cafe near the pier, girl cooks all fresh and it's delicious!"

If you love sightseeing this is a must visit. There are different ways to reach the place by sea, train then cable car.1. By SEA: you have to go to Central ferry pier, Pier number 6 (HK$15.20 ordinary ferry Mon-Sat, HK$22.50 Sun-Pub. Hol.) to Mui Wo island and you can take bus no. 2 (HK$ 16 Mon-Sat, HK$ 25 Sun-Pub. Hol.) it takes around 50mins. 2. By MTR train: you have to take the Tung Chung line going to Tung Chung station (HK$21.9 single journey) take Exit B walk about 5mins to Ngong Ping 360 (it's next to the bus terminal) from there you may take the cable car (HK$115 single trip) for standard cable car. ***All fares mentioned above are Adult fare.**Access to the outside of the Buddha is free of charge, but there is an admission fee to go inside the Buddha.I suggest you to get a \"Octopus card\" a very convenient reloadable cash card, you may get this at the airport for HK$150 - usable $100 then $50 is deposit. You may use the Octopus card on all public transport like bus, trains and ferries, convenient store like 7-11, McDonalds and selected shops. You can top-it-up at any MTR station or any 7-11 and minimum reload is HK$50. At the end of your trip you can return this at the airport and get the balance money from the card.I hope this help!"

We skipped the cable car as it was expensive and the queue was very long. The bus takes around 35 minutes to reach and its HK$34 for two way trip by bus. Make sure you do the easy to do trails like \"path of wisdom\" as the scenery is amazing and almost anyone can easily walk there. We had a sumptuous meal at the outdoor vegetarian restaurant at a very reasonable price. it was a day well spent."

Inevitably we therefore had to queue for nearly 2 hours to get tickets and board the cable car. Moral of the story: go on a week day unless you have no choice!That said, the cable car was awesome (fantastic views) and the monastery and Buddha themselves well worth the time spent waiting in line. The 'tourist village' at the top of the cable car can be pretty quickly left behind! Useful for picking up a bit of refreshment...Overall a great way to spend a day. The monastery is very interesting and you can buy incense to burn before heading up the steps to the Buddha itself. Great views all around and a marvel in itself!"

We took the crystal gondola which had stunning views of waterfalls and the river. Once you get up there, be prepared for all the tourists and them selling you your picture for about $28 usd. Not sure of the exchange rate. I was very disappointed to see a Starbucks there considering the beauty of the temple. It's more like an outdoor mall. It was worth it though. It's an engineering masterpiece. You have to pay to go inside the temple at the big Buddha but not to go up the stairs and outside to see the devas. It's worth it."

We took the cable car despite being frightened of heights, because it is part of the experience. However, we didn't take the glass bottomed cable car; possibly a step too far. Top tip; book on line! We queued for approx. 1 1/4 to get a ticket a ticket and then we queued for the car. If you book on line, you just queue for the car. The views were fabulous; not only can see the planes taking off and landing beneath you but you get a fantastic view of the island. Once there you are greeted with a a pleasant youngster trying to sell you a photograph, key ring and snow scene of your cable car experience. Not for me, but lots of people bought them. The next challenge is to get through the small retail park with llots of shops and eating options; we just walked straight through and headed for the Po Lin monastery where we knew that we could get a good lunch. We were not disappointed although it was a very basic canteen style eatery. The food wasnt Michelin starred, but it was , very much what you would expect in a monastery refectory. Having eaten at the monastery we were given special access to the upper floors of the Buddha, with even more spectacular views, so keep your receipt.The rest rooms were the least pleasant aspect of that trip; shall we say Old French style! I thought they were a thing of the past .The monastery is lovely and well worth visiting an then you can sit under the shade of the trees in the courtyard whilst contemplating the 268 steps that will take you to the foot of the Buddha. Having climbed the steps, with as many views stops as required you will be well rewarded with an absolutely stunning view . Use your ticket to go inside the Buddha and you will get a potted history and even better views . Typical of Hing Kong; despite the height, there are several shops that you can buy trinkets and memrobelia in. Going down is much easier ; once you get past the compulsory touristy shops, there are no queues at the cable car. We enjoyed our day; it is enormously touristy but if you ignore that and focus on the main attractions, it is very well worth while. Once down, there is a retail outlet mall to entertain you further!"

Even though the place was teeming with tourists there seems to be a certain peace and calmness about it. We got to the Big Buddha via cable car and it was seriously mind blowing. Since we opted for the round-trip ticket, we got to see the views both during the day and at night. The views from the top of the Big Buddha are stunning too. We paid money so we could eat the Buddhist vegetarian feast at the Po Lin Monastery (which was pretty hearty). The same ticket also got us access to the tiny museum at the top, right under the Buddha. The museum is filled with some seriously lovely etchings in wood and great art, if that's an interest of yours definitely spring for it. The Po Lin Monastery will leave you mesmerized. As you sit outside in the garden opposite it, you'll see tons of tourists lighting sweet smelling incense as they say their prayers. The inside of the monastery is beautiful, quiet and filled with a thousand buddha idols. We also walked the Wisdom Path which is in the woods and is a nice little hike where you see scripture carved into giant pieces of tree bark. The views again will take your breath away. The coolest part of it all was this circular structure directly opposite the Big Buddha. Turns out if you stand right in the center of the circle and say something it echoes inside you. It's kinda freaky but really really cool. Some people stand in the center and say a prayer facing the Big Buddha. I asked that Big Buddha help me find the wallet I lost. You'll see my dad testing out this echo-ing thing in the picture attached. Pro Tip 1: If you plan on taking the cable car upto Ngong Ping Village buy your tickets online. We waited in line for over an hour and a half. The line moves quickly it's just that it ends up being so dang long. Pro Tip 2: If you have the time and energy you should definitely try the hikes they organize around Lantau Island. A group we rode the cable car with apparently come up to Ngong Ping Village on the weekends and hike back to where they caught the cable car from."

The actual cable car was fantastic, the views over the city and the airport were incredibly interesting., and having the glass bottom you looked down on the water and land and watch the people walking up to the Budda which was a very long steep walk - not for the faint hearted! On arrival we had an ice cream which cost about $10 (Australian) each. Instead you should buy a drumstick which was about $3!! The walk up to the Budda is about 200 stairs, not difficult to do and the views at the top spectacular. We spent time walking around the Po Lin Monastery which was very interesting saw a holy cow trying to eat a plastic bag and was very tame. We got a single chair lift seat and caught the local Nus No 2 back to Mui Wo and then caught a ferry to Central. It was a full day but well worth the visit."

            "review": "Amazing spiritual place a must when u in HK!!. This place is really amazing and worth visit when you in Hong Kong, be sure to clear your day for this if you up to see everything there, my recommendation is first of all buy the \"cable car\" ride there and back from the Internet a day before, we didn't and we waited more then an hour with a master queue that I never saw before so be sure to do that and don't make our mistake! You can choose between a regular booth or transparent booth, we took the regular on the way there and transparent on the way back, well they both amazing and of course the transparent one u have a \"crystal floor\" so u see all from above and it's beautiful but the only reason I upgrade our way back with the crystal booth is because when u will see the queue back u will understand, I added a bit more money and we just pass all the queue (cause it's kind of Vip queue and worth to buy it if u don't want to wait 2 hrs just to get back)So after we finish talking about how to get there let's talk about the place.When u arrive u will see lots of shops, that kind of ruined my \"spiritual\" feeling that u suppose to get in the place cause it's suddenly felt really commercial but one good thing I can say about the shops that they offer really beautiful things to buy so enter each shop and check if you like something.When u arrive the big Buddha it's kind of hard to make a picture with it even if u up all the way, unless u have a really good camera with zoom.DO NOT buy a ticket there to go up doesn't worth the money, I thought you can access the upper floor of the Buddha so I can get a nice pictures of the landscape and the Buddha but u just see some pictures and that's it, not worth it.Be sure to visit \"the wisdom path\" it's amazing place and from there u can hike to the pick (around 1.5-2hrs walk) really really beautiful walk but be careful since the way is not that safe specially be safe when you do any selfies so you won't fall down the mountain Also be sure to visit all the monastery there (I think there is 2-3 places) Try to go there early cause they close the place around 17:00 and I think the last cable car is around 18:00 I can't remember the price we pay for the cable car but just search it over the Internet and buy the ticket before. Enjoy there"

            "review": "Here's the facts, by CEP. First of all yes it's worth the visit! Do you like queuing? It opens at 10am to get the first cable car at the end of the orange line, takes about 40 mins from central. Then you see the queue, this is to buy the ticket, so others are right in saying book the tickets in advance and save yourself 40 min. BUT then you join the normal queue to get on the cable car which has no quick route for those that have bought the tickets up front, this can be another 30-50 mins. The cable car takes 25 min to the top OR you can walk a very well defined path underneath it which will take min of 2 hours and not sure where you start the walk as the cable goes straight over water to start with. So you get to the Budda and more crowds and beware being hit by the selfie stick! So much for the encounter with the inner self and listening to nature, it's difficult to hear anything above the noise of people and that includes the Wisdom path ( but worth going on!). Need to cling 268 steps so trainers advised. OK so your not fed up with queuing as yet, so you decide to head down during the quite lovely sunset about 5pm. Well the queue for the cable down started at the signpost saying wait time 1 hour 30! . BUT there is a way round all the queues, it costs a bit but you get the return cable trip, a trip to Tai O village, a boat trip, and yes I did see the white Dolphins, and can spend as long as you want with the Budda. The trip is called the culture and heritage tour by 360 holidays but costs $360 HK, BUT your ticket is like a magic wand and one wave and you are passed easily along to the very front of any queue, to me that was worth the price. So, happy hols to you all!"

We bought the vegetarian lunch option which came with a meal of noodles, a drink and 5 side items. This was simple and filling. I suggest eating before walking up to the big Buddha which are about 156 steps. Then you can also climb the stairs inside the Buddha as well. Very enjoyable this can be an all day excursion. Be sure to visit early when the sun is not beating down on you as there is a lot of walking involved. Also, buy tickets for the tram online to avoid the very long line about 1hour wait without the online ticket. The stage pass to see the behind the scenes of major motion pictures was not worth the purchase."

Before leaving for Hong Kong, we had made up our minds to visit the Big Buddha statue at Lan Tau but on reaching Hong Kong we were disappointed to find the cable railway of which we had heard so much praise was under maintenance for a few days. So we had to catch a bus from a bus stop right next to the cable railway station. The bus journey up was a little less than an hour (return trip was about 40 minutes, being down slope). The statue was awe inspiring --- more than a hundred feet from the base and made of bronze. As it sits on top of a hill, it is even more impressive. If you are up to climbing up the stairs to the base of the statue, the view around is rivetting. One can also see the Pau Lin monastery from the top of the hill which incidentally is a not-to-miss part of the trip to the Big Buddha (you have to come down from the Big Buddha hill and walk about 200 metres to the Pau Lin monastery). All in all, a fascinating day trip. There is no entry fee anywhere in the Big Buddha or the Pau Lin monastery. A vegetarian restaurant is available on the path leading to the cable railway station at the Big Buddha end so no need to carry food even if you are a vegetarian. As can be expected, there are endless outlets for souveniers. The cable railway and the bus service permits use of Octopus card and the cable railway station has free wifi service available."

Other options are to take the 40min bus ride to the Buddha, but I recommend the cable car with the glass bottom. You get some spectacular views of the Big Buddha on the cable car as you approach the station. Its very commercialized at the top, so no need to take a lot of stuff with you. There is Subway up there... what else can I say?The walking is not a lot but if you're going right up to the Buddha, you'll need good walking shows as there are plenty of stairs. Don't forget to check out the temples also. They are as interesting, if not more, as the Big Buddha. All in all, you can do the whole experience in a couple of hours although I think without rushing its really a half day attraction."

Travelled by cable car which the kids loved especially with the crystal bottom for a great view going over the people and animals below. Quite amazing as the big Buddha comes into view sitting on the mountain top. It is very serene as it looks out over the island. As you arrive at the big Buddha after walking through a tourist village it feels like there are almost a million steps to the top. It is crowded with a lot of people but it does not really matter. Take it slow, it is worth the effort. The view is great from the top over the island and it's nice to see the big Buddha up close. Worth a wander over to the monastery after you negotiate the steps down as well. Interesting to see how different cultures worship. Enjoyed our visit to big Buddha as a family, both adults and kids found it a good part of our day out."

Try some snacks from Taste Citygate (estimate $8-15 per pop) if you have time. The bread could even suffice as a light meal, if you're not one who needs to eat a lot to be satisfied. If you're budget is limited and the crystal cabin (which is better) is a no-go, you can still enjoy the standard trip, but be sure to book online or go very early to avoid the long queue. I'd personally go the earliest possible time (10 am) to also enjoy the scenery without the big crowd.There are various restaurants within the area, with the price of a meal going as cheap as $25. The more expensive ones are quite near the tram landing platform, while the cheaper places are by the Po Lin Monastery. The $100 vegetarian meal is so-so, but was good enough that we ate until we were full.Don't bother with the picture souvenirs - they're a bit expensive at $80. You could probably take a better photo with your camera phone and a bit of friendliness to let the other guests on the cabin take your picture. Finally, the Big Buddha could be a lot for the elderly (so many steps), which was also a bit challenging for a sedentary person like me. But without trying to tackle the long stairway, the base still can offer a great vantage of the Big Buddha.We went at 10am and took the return cabin trip by 1 pm. 3 hours is quite enough for a relaxing stroll (until the giant stairs) and some picture taking - we even checked the stores out."

Where you get dropped off from the bus to the bottom of the stairs will take you a few minutes. In saying that though, the walkway to the stairs is lined with statues among other things, so there is some other photo opportunities. Once you climb the stairs to the base of the Buddha, you will be amazed of how big this statue really is. You can completely walk around the base of the statue, with some other photo opportunities as well. There is also little shops underneath the statue, where you can buy items that have been blessed by the monks in a proper blessing ceremony. We bought several items from there, they were not overly expensive either.So pay the big Buddha a visit next time you are in Hong Kong."

Set out in the hills , very tranquil place, be prepared for the steps up so ensure you are wearing comfortable footwear! The monastery is beautiful inside with such amazing detail. You can pay a small fee of 35HKD to go inside the Buddha, personally I wouldn't recommend as it's not much inside & only 1floor, but you do get a free water & icecream with this ticket.I would definitely recommend taking the cable car up, stunning views! After visiting the Buddha, we took a bus on site to Tai O fishing village. A lovely local village definitely worth seeing!! Local foods, boat trip where we seen white Chinese Dolphins; this was amazing & can 100% recommend! Very cheap too at only 25HKD per person. From there we took the bus back to the metro station!

It was a super hot November day but we still managed to climb the huge stairway up to see the Big Buddha close up. The view from up there is pretty mesmerising and as for the Big Buddha - seeing is believing!The restaurants up there are fairly pricey but we were happy to grab a quick ice cream before taking the bus back down to Tai O where we had a nice walk around the village.

There are two ways (options) to get there. First, catch the MTR to station Tung Cheung where take the cable cars. The cable car journey is about 20 minutes long and it gives fantastic views of that part of the island. You can buy a return ticket or, if you want to visit Tai O as well, buy a single ticket. From the Big Buddha bus station, catch bus No. 21 which will take you directly down the mountain to Tai O. Tai O is one of the few remaining old fishing villages in Hong Kong. In the narrow streets, there are shops/stalls selling fresh and dried seafood. There are a few cafes for food and drinks.From Tai O, there is a bus which takes you back to Tung Cheung where you can catch the MTR.Second, catch the ferry to Mui Wu on the Hong Kong side. Mui Wu is on Lantau Island where the Big Buddha is. The ferry is close to and alongside of the Star Ferry. From Mui Wu catch the bus to the Big Buddha. The bus journey is quite long , about 35 minutes. This used to be the way to get up to the monastery and the Big Buddha. It's a lovely journey with views of the sub-tropical forest of the island. When you finished your visit you can return in the same way or the other way as described in option 1."

Make your way thru Ngong Ping Village and the crowds, well maybe stop for a drink and a snack and than head to the Tian Tan Buddha. On your return, head to the bus stop and take bus no 2 down the hill to Mui Wo Pier and the local fish restaurants for a cheap and delicious lunch before taking the ferry back to Hong Kong. And yes you get to take in the spectacular skylines as you approach pier no 6 in Central."

Buddha in many countries is an important religious monk who taught several great things to humanity .He is truly considered MYSTICAL and so it is in my title,the next part of mistical - you will realise once you see the pictures !Visiting Big Buddha was definitely on my list as I had missed this on my several earlier visits to Hong Kong. This statue is made completely with donations from the Hong Kong people. We got into the bus to make this trip and our guide started his discourse with the usual introductions,there was a slight drizzle ,rain is quite common and unexpected in this part of the world.We were told that the Big Buddha is on hill on the Lantau island and to reach the top we have a picturesque cable car ride lasting about 25 minutes but if the weather is bad it would be a bus ride - a big disappointment sigh came out of all in the bus , we kept ourt fingers crossed and hoped for the best,We were lucky indeed,the cable car ride is indeed amazing - taking us through several stations and over several ranges.From the cable car station it was a short bus ride to the base of the Big Buddha hill.Our guide gave a complete story of the place and hints on where we would get the best pics,The sight of the Buddha being revealed out of the mist every now and then was GREAT (see pics).A flight of steps takes us through 3 levels and at each level are several prayer halls and offering to Buddha,The stairs wind around a huge Brass bell given by the Chinese government on the occasion of the inauguration. A great view awaits you as you exit out,although it was raining we couldnot be bothered - such is the spell of the place.There are several statues of various divinities around - ll beautifully sculpted. As you go around one can see the great Buddha from different angles ,but one never feels that one has seen enough,so reluctantly we left the place,looking back and taking pics."

The views from the cable car were spectacular and having quite a bit of mist around helped to enhance the beauty.Once you get to Lantau - what an amazing place! While there were lots of people, it didn't feel too crowded as there was a lot of space. The big buddha on top of the hill was a beautiful sight. One thing we didn't know and had no information about was that to go inside, you have to have the ticket from your meal at the vegetarian restaurant. Therefore we were uanble to go inside the statue.What I found more amazing was the Lotus Pond Temple. This is a bit away from the main area and is very serene and peaceful. I felt extremely spiritual, probably because there wasn't a large crowd unlike in the main temple. the shrine was also simple. All in all this was a great day out and a must visit place."

Visibility from the cable car was non existent once we gained altitude and the only time we say land was when we arrived at the station. The Big Buddha was also covered fully in mist and all our photographs even from as close as 10 meters gave only a small outline of the statue. The climb of nearly 250 steps can be tiring and exhausting. On a clear sunny day, the views should be great and worth photographing. The village at the bottom is cute and have a variety of restaurants as well as shops. Do visit the temples, monasteries nearby to soak in the divine experience.

It can be a bit of a wild ride arond the mountain side so wouldn't recommend if you get motion sickness.

From there the visitor has two options:1. Cable Car. It takes 25 minutes and costs $165 (single cabin) or $255 (crystal cabin) round trip.2. Take bus 23 to the monastery. It costs $17 on weekdays or $27 on weekends per person. They don't give change, but you can pay with the octopus card.We took the bus, it was cheaper and we are not big fans of heights. The bus is comfortable with a quite strong air-conditioning. It takes about half hour on a very sinuous road, my sister felt bad on her stomach. The bus arrives just in front of the monastery, close there is a 'village' made for tourists with lots of souvenirs shops and western restaurants, we decided not to eat there.In the monastery, there is a vegetarian restaurant super expensive in my opinion ($ 98 per person) and a snack bar were we found several dumplings, spring rolls and noodles. It was very good. A trap is the advertising of the 'Tea Garden Restaurant', we went there and it is horrible.The Buddha is quite a trip up, lots of stairs. My mom has a problem to walk and decided not to go up. From the stairs it is nice to take pictures, from the top there is not much to see, but the mountains. It is for sure a must see! The monastery is huge and full of details, the Buddha is super impressive!"

(I live here, but take all visitors with 3 or more days out to Lantau for a number of reasons). Take the ferry to Mui Wo and from there the bus to the big buddha. You can also take a taxi from the ferry, it's not expensive and allows you to stop for lunch along the way. On the way down, take the cable car, just be prepared for a bit of a wait. From Tung Chung, the best way to get back is of course the MTR, approx. 40 minutes. Or if you're not tired yet, swing by Disneyland on the way back."

The ride across Lantau Island, with views to the airport, bays and country park was great. We paid a bit extra to hold crystal..glass bottom but don't think this is necessary. At the village, usual restaurants etc. stairs..255. Is worth the effort, even in the dire humidity. The views from the top are interesting and worth a photo or two. I don't think it is over touristy, people have a genuine interest in seeing these remarkable sites in such locations. Just remember, there might be queues, do your homework in relation to 'if' the cable car is running. Check the weather..there are walks and other things to look at..like the temples and the temple of the 10,00 Buddhas. Reasonable good if there for lunch."

The wait at the ferry drop off is great to unwind from the bustle of HK itself (45 mins or so). Have a coffee and visit the bakery. 45 minute bus ride and you are face to toe with a large, newly made large Buddha (no historical monument). Didn't wait for the return bus and caught the cable car to the MTR near the airport.$20 Aus each worth it. Then rail back into the centre again. We passed a line of people too long to guess waiting from the MTR trying to go the other way."

It's about a 35 minute train ride (34km) from central HK to Tung Chung station, from where you have the option to take the cable car, or the local bus number 23 to Ngong Ping. When we visited the Big Buddha on 17/09/15, the cable car system was shut-down for maintenance. Fortunately the MTR, cable car and bus terminus are all adjacent to each other.The HK$17 weekday bus ride to Big Buddha at Ngong Ping is only 21km, but driving uphill takes about 50 mins. It's a scenic ride through winding roads, and passing a few quaint villages. Arriving at the Big Buddha, you have to climb 268 steps to the top. The monastery and temple are at the bottom, and apart from this being a tourist attraction, it's also a place of worship. Photos are not permitted inside the temple. A monastery restaurant serving vegetarian dishes is on the premises, and, other restaurants, kiosks and shops are located next to the bus terminus, just a few minutes walk away."

Make sure to catch a gorgeous view of the Buddha a top the mountain from the right side of the bus. Once there, the hike up the 250 stairs are worth every breath! Take your time up and make sure to pause and look up and because you don't want to be so caught up with the stairs that you miss the chance to gaze up at the beautiful Buddha (you can also use that as an excuse to stop for a breathe, haha). Once up at the top, it's rather peaceful despite the many people around. Take a minute or two to soak it all in. Because we were short on time we didn't go into the base of the Buddha neither did we look around the monastery but I'm sure they're well worth looking around. A donation for a ticket is needed to go into the base where there's a relic of Gautama Buddha. Once you've taken in the Buddha, there are plenty of shops for souvenirs and street food. There are also shops in the base of the Buddha but they're quite expensive."

There is so much to see and learn! i have to make it back there!"

Do go visit big buddhist by Ngoping 360 Tram and together with TaiO (it takes around 20mins bus ride from buddhist)!TaiO is an old fishing village worth for spending 1-2 hours ( very good for having lunch, so many good hong kong food)A suggested itinerary:Arrive TungChung Station in the morning >> Take Bus 11 to TaiO (50mins) >> Lunch at TaiO and wander around >> Take Bus 21 to Big Buddhist (20mins) >> Sightseeing >> Leave by 360 Tram ( may take crystal cabin if you are in hurry, much shorter line just a bit higher price but it worths as the experience is different as well with crystal cabin! )"

When we started planning our visit to HK, our friends informed that a visit to the Tian Tan Buddha (Big Buddha) would be incomplete and so we started searching things over there.When we visited the place, we were awestruck. The statue at its first site is mesmerizing and make you fall in love with it. Attached with it is the Po Lin Monastery.You can visit the statue via ferry, cable car or bus. We preferred the bus as the cable car had a very long queue. If you visit either via cable car or bus, you have to take a train to Tung Chung from Central. Tung Chung station also has a locker facility, so i you are with luggage, you can store it here. However, do not come with full faith in it as the lockers are limited in number and can get full. From the station, less than 5 minutes of walk is the bus station as well as the Ngong Ping 360 (cable car) station. The tickets for the cable car can be bought from klook.com.You can also go inside the statue by paying a small fee where a relic of Buddha and a museum is there.The Po Lin monastery also provides food. Take a look inside the monastery which will surely calm you.ALTHOUGH IT MAY BE SERENE, BE AWARE AS THERE ARE ABOUT 150-300 STEPS TO CLIMB."

The views of Lantau Island were excellent and I would recommend at least taking the cable car in one direction (if not both) to reach this attraction.As far as Big Buddha itself, it's nice to go to see it and the monastery within the village. I found the rest of the area to be too touristy for my tastes. Perhaps combine the Big Buddha visit with a trip to Tao O to make it more worthwhile. Time was limited for me so I could not make it down to that fishing village. Overall, it was okay (not great or terrible). If your time in HK is limited to just a few days, there are other things I would visit first before coming here."

You can do this in a morning or afternoon, but allow at least 4 hours for your visit. There are a few ways to get to the Buddha. Most popular is MTR to Ngong Ping Cable Car, but you can also take the MTR and then a bus or a ferry from Central and then a bus. The cable car is the most expensive option, but also the most scenic and quick option. We visited on a Monday, we did not pre-purchase anything. Lines were minimal. But if you go on Sat., Sun. or holidays, buy your passes on-line. There is also a 10% discount if join the Ngong Ping email list. Save the email to your phone, to show at the ticket counter. Not a place to visit on rainy or windy day, as the cable car will close for high winds or typhoons.There is no elevator to get to the pedestal of the Buddha. Climbing the steps is the only way, so for the physically challenged, getting up to Buddha may be impossible. The Buddha exhibit with the museum and relic was very interesting. Scenic views are also excellent.The cable car ride is very enjoyable. The village has many shops and restaurants that are not expensive. So souvenirs and eating won't be costly. I mean if you get hungry, eating here is possible at an affordable price. We also did the \"Walk with Buddha\" attraction which was ok, a little too expensive, for what it was."

If you go early in the day on a weekday, it is not crowded at all. It is kind of a trek to get there by train (past disney land), but once you get there you can take a cable ride up to the Buddha. This way is advised because apparently the bus takes longer and obviously is much less picturesque. You can also get a very cheap vegetarian lunch through the monks at the foot of the Buddha.

The cable car trip was quite long but you won't get bored with the magnificent views of Lantau island. Of course like any tourist spot, you always land and exit at the souvenir shop. Avoid the long lines at the cable car ticketing booth by purchasing tickets at the Hong Kong Airport. If you are sure about the trip, best to buy them from the travel agencies there for pre-booking. Check the weather, bring an umbrella if it's raining or especially when it is super hot. Prepare yourself for a lot of walking so wear comfortable shoes. Souvenir shops and a Starbucks still line the entrance but Buddha's presence brings some kind of peace and tranquility to the place. I think it is still a must-see place, something to experience while in HK."

The Buddha itself is amazing, quite a few steps to climb, as is the house of 10,000 Buddhas. Plenty of interesting shops and restaurants but the area has been a little commercialised though tastefully IMO. Word of warning, choose your day carefully, we were lucky as it was clear and bright so we managed to finish the sights, but within 10 mins a rain storm appeared from nowhere and visibility was zero!"

Children will enjoy this as much as adults as there is always something new to do or see.If you are coming from HK Island, the MTR will take you to Tung Chung (get off at the last stop on the MTR line) in just 30mins. From there, the cable-car up over the mountains is absolutely stunning. On a clear day you can see for miles and the lush greens forests on Lantau Island make a stark contrast to the hustle & bustle of HK Island and Kowloon.Note: If you are scared of heights, this may not be for you!When you arrive there are a few lovely little cafes & shops as you walk through a little village on your way to the Buddha itself. There are many different dining options so you will always be able find something you like.Walking up to the Buddha you are faced with around 250steps. They are so big that you can do them at your own pace and if you have elderly or injured people with you there is always space for others to walk alongside or overtake. People of average fitness will walk up with no problems and will probably do it fairly quickly: 10-15mins, they are not steep.Tip: Entertain the kids in the way up by getting them to count the steps on the way up - they love this and it takes away the monotony.If you can't make it up the steps it is still worth getting to this point, the Big Buddha certainly does live up to its name - it is strikingly large and looms over you even from the bottom of the steps making for excellent photos.At the top you can walk round and see many different statues and views - both of the Buddha and of the island. You can walk up a few more steps to get closer if you wish and on the ground floor there is some kind of mini-museum (you need to pay for a ticket at the bottom of the steps before you do this though - so make sure you've bought it before walking up all of those steps if you want to go in!).You could spend 30mins to a couple of hours looking around the Buddha itself. On the way back down you have options t go and see a couple of ministries which are free and fairly impressive. Each one has 1000's of small Buddhas inside.This trip is something you could do for a whole day and have a fantastic time. Equally, you could spend just half a day here and still feel you have seen everything.Tip: It is definitely better to go on a week day if you can as you will avoid any big queues for the cable-car.This is a trip that is definitely worth doing that the whole family can enjoy. It's just lovely seeing such a different side to Hong Kong. We live here and have been up to the Buddha about 4times - whenever we have visitors - we never tire of this lovely day out :)"

I had so much fun just on the cable car alone. This I believe is a must do if you are anywhere near hong kong. You'll be surprised that someone takes your picture as soon as you get in the Cable car. Yes they will try and sell them to you as soon as you land. They are a bit pricy and I was thinking gosh, what a wast. They would sell a lot more if they were 1/2 that price. That's the part I don't think the monks had anything to do with. (LOL) Get the meal ticket before walking up to the Buddha and you'll be able to go inside the belly of the Buddha. It's like a museum in there. No pictures allowed buy worth it. I'm a vegetarian so the meal for one was only $98HK and right up my alley. See the 10K buddahs and the wisdom path as well.

Once you get to the Big Buddha, you get to actually go inside of it. There, you'll find some information about some ancient Buddhist manuscripts. The pathway leads you up and out where you'll have the opportunity to take some great pics. If you're on Lantau Island, skip Disneyland and definitely go here! And, I'm not really sure how you'd get here on your own. I imagine you could simply take a bus, or rent your own car, but mine was just part of the tour!"

Walked through the village then the promenade of generals to the Buddha made it up the steps and did not feel the stress of the steps as I was filled with the excitement of reaching this wonder of the earth called Big Buddha. Got there close to closing time so as not able to spend an extended period just basking in the spectacular view. Definitely recommend the journey for the able traveler."

We've some fabulous photos off the children lying on the floor as we swung over sea, trees & waterfalls. The children made wishes & put them on the tree, the outdoor show was lively & entertains & all 3 children were fascinated with the Big Buddah. We bought quite a few souvenirs which gave us a vouchers for free photographs, we used 4 vouchers & the photos were - free!!! (So many times we've fallen for the trick of the freebie which then costs fortunes!) The photos had great back drops & ensured we had a few good photos of us all together. Even though it was busy there is a calming serenity around the Big Buddah, my 7 year old was mesmerised by it & insisted he bought a statue out of his own money to take home. There was a fairly good choice of food in the village, we had Pizza at Ebeneezers which were very nice. It was a lovely family day & one we'll treasure for ever."

Even though it's more money, it pays for itself by skipping the busy line for the regular cable car.The actual Big Buddha itself is incredible and a sight to see for sure.

I visited in August when it was extremely hot and humid so I decided to miss the village and head straight up the 250 steps to see the Buddha. I was treated with fantastic views of the island and the big Buddha. After I came back down I had some lunch in one of the village restaurants then got back on the cable car. When I got off at the other end at around 1pm, the cue for the entrance for the cable car went all the way back to the MRT station and would probably take around 2 hours. Lucky I got there early!"

Fortunately, it was bearable due to careful planning. It is a good idea to visit the Ngong Ping 360 website.We took the MTR to Lantau Island (or commonly called 'Tai Yue Shan' by locals), alighting at the terminal Tung Chung station. The signage to Exit B is prominent. Next to the MTR station is the outlet mall which is a good place to stop by to browse and more importantly, to visit the restrooms. From Tung Chung MTR station, it is a short 5 minutes walk to the Ngong Ping Cable Car station. Fortunately, I have purchased the Ngong Ping Cable Car tickets about 2 weeks before and skipped the long queue. You can choose the time of departure and the type of cabin, all via online booking with credit card. I chose the crystal cabin at 11am. After 15 minutes of queueing, we got into our crystal cabin cable car which has a clear cabin floor allowing direct view below. It was worth paying extra for the view. At Ngong Ping village, we alighted and the staff have prepared souvenirs with our photos. The whole NP village was too touristy and we walked through briskly.We head straight to the Po Lin Monastery, a leisurely 10-min walk. There are 2 vegetarian meal option and we chose the more expensive 'Deluxe' meal tickets. I strongly recommend this option because the dining area is air-conditioned whereas the non-deluxe is not; the deluxe set meal has more variety than the normal set. Anyway, we had a wonderful vegetarian lunch. Like many reviewers, I too highly recommend to have a vegetarian lunch here.Suitably fuelled and rested, we walked over to Big Buddha. Taking slow leisurely steps (268 steps in all) and a long time, we reached the foot of the Big Buddha. The meal ticket includes entrance to the museum inside the Big Buddha. It has an interesting collection of old Buddhist manuscripts and artefacts. Plus point, it is climate controlled so it was a good respite from the severe hot weather. Leaving the Big Buddha, we walked down the steps and to the bus stop. We took bus (#2) to Mui Wo. On hindsight we should have gone to Tai O (bus #21) to visit the fishing village and then to Mui Wo because there was plenty of time. The air-con bus is comfortable and along the way we saw paramedics attending tourists down with heat stroke. We reached Mui Wo around 3pm and we can feel the blast of hot wind. Luckily, we were well prepared with hats, shades, adequate water, walking shoes and a healthy attitude to enjoy the day trip. Having said that, it was still a good idea to duck into the McDonald's while waiting for the next ferry back to HK."

I write this review having just recovered from climbing the 260 steps from the base to the Buddha [it felt like a lot more steps]I arrived and it was partially covered in cloud/mist which added to it awe. It is easy to forget [especially with the tourists there] that this is a shrine (Had the same feeling at the Vatican). There is a sereneness to the site when one gets away from iPhone and selfie sticks but it is worth itLike many sacred sites there is a certain level of commercialism [I was glad to be able to buy bottles of water in the 30C temperature and the high humidity] but how else can they find the funds for upkeep?"

Take the cable car to the top and not the bus, it's quicker and you get very impressive views of the city and the Buddha. There's a little shopping village before you get to the Buddha, and then you climb a long staircase up to the statue. Inside the Buddha is a kind of small museum about how it was made (very interesting) as well as memorials to families. Across the courtyard is the Monastery and a courtyard where people light incense (massive 5' tall incense like you've never seen). Perhaps the neatest part is something people may skip... the Wisdom Path. It's a short walk through the woods to a clearing with GIANT wooden pillars with prayers inscribed on them. The setting is very serene and mystical, with clouds/mist enveloping the beautiful mountain top. Don't miss this part!"

You would hardly believe you are so close to Hong Kong when you undertake a trip to the big Buddha.We caught the underground to the end of the line at Tung Chung and then caught the cable car to the top. We pre booked our tickets and this saved us a very very long queue (do this!)From the cable car, it is a short walk to the Buddha - we counted 278 steps to the top - totally manageable by all in our party (including 5 and 6 year olds).Coming back down we checked out the monastery - lots of incense! But the ornate nature of monastery is worth a visit.We took a trip down the hill to Tai O which is a traditional fishing village. Beware the boat tours as they claim you will see the pink Dolphins but I doubt you ever do! The trip around the fishing village was more interesting anyway.On the way back we caught the ferry from Mui Wo. This was really fun for everyone and we saw the city from a different perspective.I would recommend this day out to anyone."

There are lots of steps but apart from getting a bit out of breath its nothing to worry about and everyone is stopping to take photos anyway. The small museum underneath the statue has a small entry charge but they waved us through without paying so I guess it depends who is on duty. When you visit the temple alongside the statue make sure to eat in the small cafe/food stall serving vegetarian foods .... some of the best food we had all week and SO cheap ! Amazing surroundings to eat in as well. The temples are awe-inspiring and everyone we were with was very respectful of the no phones / no cameras rule (which is understandable - place of worship after all)."

It's 2 hours (starting at 13:45) and we took the Crystal Cabin which cost HK$315 adult & HK$235 for kids. I nearly died when I arrived at the cable car station to see the MASSIVE amount of people queueing up. We said to the staff we wanted to go on the 1.45pm tour - and they took us straight to the ticket box - jumping the entire queue. As we were on a tour...we also got priority getting on the cable cars. The Crystal Cabin was worth paying the little extra. We arrived early so we went shopping and checked out the little village. Then met the tour guide at the designated place. Turns out we were the ONLY people taking the tour that day! Our tour guide was LOVELY. Very knowledgeable and had great English. The tour include \"refreshment\" at Po Lin Monastery.... and I thought that may be a glass of water, or some biscuits. But it was an ENTIRE MEAL!!!! We each got a big plate of noodles, spring rolls, doughnuts, and because we didn't want their dessert - we got drinks as well. And it was all delicious!!!This was a great day, and I am so glad we took the 2 hour tour."

It's really worth it if you are longer at the airport and have the possibility to go out (not transfer). Take the elevator behind Starbucks at Terminal 1 to the 3rd floor and just infront of it wait for the bus S1. For 3.5HKD it takes you to the lift, wait in line (there is an alternative to take bus) pay 160HKD for return ticket and off you go. The views are wonderfull. You can see the whole airport, surrounding see, skyscrapers and beautifull nature. Once you'll see the Big Budha you'll be amazed. Despite the long line at the bottom station, the place is really large thus not overcrowded, which is good. Go and see also the Po Lin Monastery, it's really beautifull."

Very long and extremely high with stunning view. Above mountains and bridges, one of the best. The line however was awful so I would suggest taking the bus to the top, which takes about 50 minutes but beats waiting for the cable an hour and a half. Take the cable down instead - the experience is better and the line is much shorter."

As soon as we got to the village, we got a sense of the tourist trap. Fish balls were 5 times the price as those at the regular market. The \"gelato\" was overpriced and tasted like ice. The big buddha didn't feel very authentic. Mostly a large statue that day top of some stairs. It only liked cool because of it's large size.

I would recommend booking the cable car ticket online and turning up before 10:00am as the wait can be longer than an hour if you don't. Those who had done so seemed to boarding the cable car at least 30-40 minutes sooner. Use the bathrooms before getting on the cable car or the trip up which is fantastic will seem like an eternity. There are plenty of great places to eat once at the top of the cable car, take The time to explore the alleyways and back streets as the have some pleasant surprises. The 200 or so steps up to the Buddha are not so difficult, even in the hot humid weather of July and the view an sense of accomplishment is well worth it. Wear sensible shoes, travel light, take water and as always be respectful.Enjoy the postcard views."

Thanks to other reviews we got the early 10.30am and only queued for 30 mins max. Top tip if you book online before midnight on the day you book you can jump all the queues. Glass bottom cable car is worth the extra money especially on the way out. At the bottom of the steps to Buddha you can buy an extra ticket for around \u00a33 to enter the display under the statue.

Free admittance and easy to get to: Just take MTR to Tung Chung and interchange to bus 23 to Ngong Ping. The terminal station is next to Big Buddah. The ride takes about 45 minutes. HKD 17.50 for a single journey (HKD 27 on Sundays and public holidays) is not cheap. So avoid the island on Sundays! You can buy a day bus pass for HKD 35.00 at Tung Chung station. Just look for the New Lantau Bus (NLB) ticket office next to the bus stop. Check the NLB website for a detailed bus schedule (www.newlantaobus.com).From Ngong Ping you can either take the cable car (expensive!) or the same bus back to Tung Chung. There's also a bus to Tai O village (map of bus routes attached as picture).I recommend to go here first before the sun gets too hot, then visit Tai O for a nice lunch and afterwards enjoy the afternoon sun at Cheung Sha beach or Tong Fuk beach (bus line 1, 11 and 23). Makes a nice day trip to Lantau Island. Enjoy!"

Cross the road and follow the crowds to the cable car station. Believe me this is the best way to get to the Big Buddha as the 20 minute or so cable car ride is fantastic as it gives you a great views of HK as you cross over several mountain tops. However, be warned that the long lines for the cable car tickets are ridiculous. Even though we were aware of this and bought tickets from our hotel, it still took us about one and a half hours to reach the ticket counter. There are 2 lines, one for purchasing a ticket there and the other for those who have a pre-purchased ticket. The latter was much shorter but still ridiculous. There was another line which said \"Tours\" and that one had no waiting time at all but I've no idea who gets those tickets. After reaching the ticket counter you then separate into the \"crystal cabin\" line for those who chose the cabins with the glass floors vs the normal cabins. We decided to go for the cable car with the glass floors which was cool. However, also worth noting that there are more of the normal cable cars which come around faster so the lines for the normal cars will move faster. My recommendation, if you're not in a rush, is to come early afternoon vs morning as we noticed upon return that there was no longer a line for this attraction (no lines for return rides either). Anyway, if you've not visited the Big Buddha before it is certainly worth it. Upon arrival there is a small village with restaurants, Starbucks and shoppes selling souvenirs. The Big Buddha is located at the end of the village and the stairs will provide good exercise for those in need of it! However if you are disabled or have problems going up many many steps then this will be a huge challenge. After returning from Big Buddha do stop at City Gates outlet which has tons of restaurants and shops to keep you cool."

So much for the advice that advance cable car tickets are not needed. It turned out that the system was down and the cable car company couldn't process credit cards, so everything was slowed way down. I wish they had explained that to all of us waiting in line. I would have opted for a change in plans for the day, but we had no way of knowing that a two hour wait is perhaps not the norm, even in tourist heavy August. We eventually opted for a crystal car to jump the queue somewhat, but I don't think this made much difference in wait time as there are fewer crystal cars than standard. We got our tickets sooner, but had to wait longer to board. The ride was fine, but other travellers in our car walked all around, sat on the floor, stood by the door and generally made me quite nervous with their energetic photo taking. I was glad to get off.Buddha site on the whole was totally Disney - very artificial feeling. Very disappointing. The site had none of the reverance I've experienced at other monasteries, such as 10,000 Buddhas also here in Hong Kong. Ngong Ping Village was a plastic tourist trap (although I admit I needed the Starbucks after the too exciting cable car ride.) We did have the vegetarian meal at the monastery which was quite filling and good. Po Lin Monastery was an improvement over the Buddha site but I still missed seeing monks, hearing chanting and seeing worshippers which I have found moving when I've been privileged to visit other temples. The experience was such a disappointment that we tried again, two days later thinking things must be better than our first attempt. This time, we took the bus from Tai O. Unfortunately, I still had the same impression of artificiality and tourist attraction rather than religious site. We did enjoy hiking the Wisdon Path and the Fun Walk. I will not be recommending this site to friends traveling to Hong Kong. Try the 10,000 Buddha Monastery instead."

The day we went the gondola was down for servicing so we had to line up and take the bus....not a great way to get to the top of the hill. The windy roads made the bus accelerate and stop suddenly, you can't really see much except the trees along the roads and it took about 45minutes.So that was not a fun way to start but we got to the top and the views were impressive. We toured around the base for a bit before doing the long climb to the Big Buddha. I know it's a newer statue only about 10years old now but it is still pretty cool. We took our time climbing the stairs as my wife has bad knees but it is not a very taxing climb.Take lots of pictures while you are there as it is pretty awesome and you know the Buddha is big but once you are right up there you realize just how immense it is!Once you have done the Buddha climb and th ePo Lin Monastery underneath, don't forget to check out the Wisdom Path just over the hill, it is awesome. We caught the bus back down the hill and it was very shaky and my wife and I got off the bus about 2/3s of the way down because we felt ill. Got some fresh air and flagged down a taxi that took us the rest of the way. The Buddha climb is great if you can get the gondola up to the top, if it is down for servicing and you have to take a bus, you might want to reschedule for another day.

If you're in Hong Kong even for a short amount of time, put BB at the top of your list!Now, some insider PRO TIPS for your visit. 1) The BEST way to see BB is to take the cable car, not the bus, and certainly not a taxi. 2) Choose the Standard Cabin. It is cheaper than the Crystal Cabin and the views are just as magnificent. 3) BOOK YOUR CABIN ONLINE, in advance. We booked our roundtrip in the standard cabin 2 days in advance for $165 HKD per person and it saved HOURS IN LINE. (Just google Big Buddha Hong Kong and the official website should be the first link.) All those unfortunate tourists who didn't book in advance waited 2+ hours in the sweltering heat and we walked STRAIGHT TO THE FRONT OF THE LINE. All because we booked online in advance, at no extra cost I might add.4) Pay the $38 HKD inside BB to walk to the top. It's an incredible photo opp AND it includes a bottle of water and ice cream bar!5) If you have more than just the 2 hours that we did, figure out how to see the nearby fishing village. The houses are on stilts and I heard it's a super cool local vibe.That is all. Thanks for reading and enjoy!!"

So we had a good time taking pics without lots of people behind us and it was really good.We also went to the Monastery and Wisdom Path. Even it was a Sunday but since we were there so early, it was quite empty and we enjoyed the peacefulness there.And then we went to try our luck to get the cable car. And there was no queue at all! And with HSBC credit card we got 10% off so it was a really good deal. When we got back to Tung Chun we saw the very very long queue.So tips:1. Go there early - try to get the second/third earliest bus (the first one is 8.10 then 8.40, 9.10 and so on).2. Get the cable car back to Tung Chung. It seems to me that most people will take the cable car up to Ngong Ping. If you have a Hong Kong HSBC credit card it gives you 10% off."

The views from the top are also spectacular. Definitely one for the to do list when in HK."

The grandparents took the kids to Disneyland, also on Lantau Island.We went one train station further and then stood in line for the cable car and after a fairly long queue we began our trip over the mountain. On arriving at Po Lin Temple we saw the huge Buddha and it is a very impressive sight. There are quite a few steps up to the top of the hill on which the statue is built and there is a ticket booth at the bottom, we thought we might have to pay to visit the statue close up but if you tell the attendant you only want to look from outside it is free. We didn't want to visit the museum inside the statue. The views from the gardens surrounding the statue are lovely and you get to appreciate just how much of Hong Kong is still undeveloped wilderness."

Wonderful place for a day out of Hong Kong, the temple hill has many small attractions and shops at the base where you can buy souvenirs and relax. Note that one needs to walk up the stairs to reach the Big Buddha's complex, however, the walk is worth the view on top. The temple of thousand buddhas, which is a 5-minute walk to the left of the base of the statue is a must. The cable car ride to Lantau is a great addition to the reasons to visit the place, the glass bottom ones in particular. The queues for the cable-car get longer after 11 am (onwards) and 5.00 pm (return), so starting early will save you some time."

They sell poncho's here if it's raining.There was a short 10 minute walk to the Tian Tan Buddha, at the bottom there was a kiosk to buy a ticket to get into the Tian Tan Buddha and a meal, personally I wouldn't recommend this as the food was vegetarian and the inside of the Budda is not very interesting if you don't speak or read the language.The climb to the top was very intensive 268 steps, powering up it was good fun, but most stopped every so often so had to squeeze past crowds.View from the top was great, would recommend buying a drink from the local shops near the bottom as they are cheaper and there are no provisions for this at the top if thirsty.Overall, its an impressive structure and was interesting to see, but I wouldn't go back, been there done that as they say.

Don't get the ice cream (it's only a small tub ($40 Ridiculous!). The climb up to the Buddha is not too hard.

The walk from the cable car is fairly short and the \"village\" is really just a group of modern shops, quite pleasant and worth a browse if you are not in a hurry.

For closer shots, either climb lots of stairs or bring a good telephoto lenses. The Monastery and small village can keep you occupied for another 2-3 hrs. To avoid spending hours in queue for the cable car, there are 2 ways - 1) take the bus (cheaper but not many views and buses are not frequent) to go for crystal cabin (expensive but provides the best experience).Actually my preference has been to take the bus to go up and then come down in crystal cabin (best experience at the cheapest price)"

The flight of steps up to the Big Buddha may be a challenge for some people, but it is definitely worth going up to get a better view of Lantau island. Spent half an hour checking out the shops near the cable cars station for souvenirs. I took a cable car back to the MTR Station."

I got a standard ticket, enjoyed a nice, if not misty, ride up to the top. Views were still great -- someday would like to hike up or down, but the path isn't so straightforward from the MTR station. The fog obscured the Buddha for much of the time, but contributed to a mystical atmosphere. Walked to Po Lin Monastery and the Wisdom Path -- both worth wandering for a while. Arrived back at the bottom at noon and the line stretched for at least an hour's wait. Glad jet lag led me to get an early start!"

If you are visiting, or passing through Hong Kong for at least 8 hours break, then Tian Tan Big Buddha in the Lantau Island of Hong Kong, is a must see attraction. You can take the cable car (Ngong Ping 360 Cable Car) near the Tung Chung MTR station, which is very close to the Hong Kong International Airport (40 HKDollars by Taxi). The Cable car ride is for about 30 minutes, taking you through breathtaking views of the Tung Chung bay, HKI airport and the rolling green mountains. Alternately, you can take Lantau bus2 to Ngong Ping village - an hour's drive over thrilling hill roads. The climb to the Buddha from the base is about 300 sieps. If you have time you can visit the museum and the Po Ling monastry there."

Amazing view from the cable car, I've got some great pictures. Once there there are a few gift shops and things to do and OF COURSE... A STARBUCKS, like everywhere in Hong Kong lol. Our tour guide reminded us no alcohol or meat near the monastery as its disrespectful to the Monks. We had a vegetarian lunch at the monastery and it was ok, some of my friends thought it was ok just not for me personally. The Big Buddha itself is very impressive. The steps took just over 5 minutes with stopping to take a few pictures. There is a path you can take that takes around 15/20 minutes to get there too. It was a very hot day and not a lot of shade there so do take care :)"

The trip is amazing in itself. The view and the changes of the weather is breathtaking. I even did the trip in the thickest fog where you couldn't see the next cable car and not even the top of the Buddha, but it just made it all magical. There are restaurants at the top.

Getting to the Buddha is easy, from the MTR station(its the next stop after Disneyland) its well connected by the ropeway and buses. We took the buses coz they were much cheaper than the ropeway. The bus ride is beautiful, although the drivers may often get you nervous with their speeds on single lane roads.The Buddha in itself is magnificent, the steps are pretty easy to climb up. There is a museum of sorts beneath the Buddha where you can see how it was built. There's an option of having a Buddhist vegetarian lunch there, but we skipped the same. Once we saw the Budha, we came back down the flight of stairs and went round a couple of monastries adjoining the Buddha. Theres a particular one with 10,000 Buddha figures and with 5 Buddha poses in the centre which is magnificent. There are places for the more religiously inclined to pray and give offerings and incense to the Buddha. There are a few trails starting at the base of the Buddha which we would also recommend. We didnt have the time and did just the short 'wisdom walk'. It was great fun. Would have loved to do the longer trails, but having done the peak and the dragons back on the days before, we said we had enough of trails.There's also this Buddha village near the base which is nice for shopping. However, most items were overpriced. If you have taken the ropeway, you will pass through the village to get to the Buddha. The bus stop is also adjoining this village. All in all, a very enjoyable trip."

It is quite a magnificent site and there is a lot of artifacts as well as touristy stuff to see and do. There is a good chinese vegetarian restaurant, if you are into chinese vegetarian or mock meat dishes, made mainly from tofu or soy. The base of the buddha is also a cemetery where the true believers can have their names inscribed, along with other contributors to the cause. There are also many fine art objects and artifacts in this same museum at the base.Other touristy things to do is to contribute to the stones than pave the walkways, etc ....For anyone not interested in a great religion that originated in India and was brought to the east by the famous chinese folk tale of the Monkey King, at least by the monk called Tong Sam Zhon, it is just barely interesting....

The views from the cable car over the airport then over the mountains and finally to see the Buddha are amazing. 6 to a cart in peak times is to bad either. On arrival you walk through a labyrinth of shops and cafes in a high street well designed and obvious there to greet the tourist, but it was well laid out and designed. There is a few steps to the Buddha so take water but the views of the Buddha and the land around are worth it. It can get very busy and the introduction of the selfie stick does not help but walk around and you will find a quieter spot for photos. Well worth a visit and there is a.sp the monestry that can.

The Buddha was impressive and the kids enjoyed running up and down the steps. We also walked down the Path of Wisdom and had fun watching the abundant butterflies. A scoop of gelato back at the less-than-authentic village and we were headed back down and on our way to our next hotel to meet friends for the rest of our week in HK.

The views from the top are amazing, there is a great little museum on the inside (there is signs stating no photos to be taken inside and it is annoying to see tourists completely ignore this) and there is lots of photo opportunities with all the statues surrounding the Buddha along with the Buddha itself. Even if you are not religious, or Buddhist in particular, it is a wonderful place to stop and reflect on some of the positive aspects of this peaceful way of life. The monastery is amazing and I was able to participate in a Buddha cleansing ceremony (it was Buddhas birthday whilst I was there), and the restaurant serves excellent vegetarian food. Take the time to walk further up towards the Wisdom Path. It is very thought provoking."

This is part of Ngong Ping 360 attractions where you take a cable car from the Tung Chung station. At the bottom area of the immense figure is where important religious artifacts and memorabilias are displayed and very solemn. Walking up the steps to reach the giant figure from the ground level can be quite taxing for those who are not so fit as there are numerous steps but it's all worth it when one reaches the upper portion as the views can be breathtaking when it's not cloudy.Ideal picture spots are aplenty here."

After taking the cable car up to Ngong Ping Village, we took a short walk to a massive flight of steps, over 250 of them which I took my time in walking up, to get up close and personal with the Buddha statue. Once you get to the top, you get amazing 360 degree views of all of Hong Kong and there is quite a bit of history to take in as well. Although getting there was a massive effort on my part, I\u2019m happy I went as I had an incredible time there. Once you got back down there were ample places to go and have a drink, coffee or ice cream before heading back down, so don\u2019t let the sweltering heat put you off."

We were disappointed as it was really commercialized and there wasn't much of an opportunity to get any physical activity in despite a few stairs leading up to the big Buddha from its base.We took the subway from Jordan Station out to the end of the subway line to take the cable car to Big Buddha. The subway part was quick, however despite it being a morning on a weekday, the line up at the cable car station took about an hr (not exactly the \"hike\" we hoped for). We took the standard car as it was cheaper which ended up being a bad idea because the wait for the standard car was way longer than if we did the glass bottom/crystal car. The cable car ride was really beautiful and we spotted a hiking trail below but couldn't find out any info on how to get to it, and in fact it appeared to be closed at the Big Buddha end.Once we arrived at the end of the cable car journey, we were funnelled through a gift shop where they try to sell you snow globes with your photo in it. It reminded me of a theme park atmosphere. You then walk past Subway, Starbucks and a series of other shops to the base of Buddha where you take a set of stairs up.Glad we went to see the big Buddha...but definitely not worthy of a top/must do attraction in Hong Kong in my opinion. Ten thousand buddhas monastery was a better experience in my opinion (easier to get to, better hike, etc.)"

You can enjoy a Chinese vegetarian meal at a very reasonable price.

You can go back to the city by taking a bus and going to Mui Wo and transfer to Central using the ferry."

The cable car ride is breathtaking where you ride above the see, the hills and the village. It is a 20 minute ride where you have exquisite views of the airport, the sea, hiking trails and rivulets. The Buddha is huge and imposing with a peaceful serene face. You can either enjoy the sight from below or climb some 200 odd steps to reach the top which is even more beautiful. You can take a walk around the Buddha and visits souvenir shops. Make sure you choose a clear day to visit, though a bit of cloud could add to the beauty! On your way back you can either take the cable car or bus or avail a package which takes you to the village and also takes you to see the pink dolphins in the sea. Make sure you choose the package before you embark on your journey at the Tung Chung cable car station"

Watching Big Buddha is an entire experience that also involves a host of other sites at Lantau Island, hence it is important to plan your trip accordingly.For going to the top:Cable car is the best way to reach the top, I would strongly recommend the crystal cable car with glass floor while going up for fantastic views of the sea and greenery. You can save money and book the standard cable car on the way back. The last cable car on the way back is at 6 - DON'T MISS IT - because then there is no other way of going back except the bus. While on the top:Number of shows to see. I saw the stunt show, which was quite interactive as well as I went up to the stage and even interacted with some of the artists. overall a very nice experience - the last show is around 5 - so make sure you don't miss it.Big Buddha:There are 15 flights of steps and it takes some doing to get up to the statue but it is completely worth it. The view from up there is mind blowing so make sure you take your camera (and lots of water with you).Overall the premises are very well maintained and quite tourist friendly with washroom and water facilities. The monastery also closes at 6 after which the whole place is a ghost town, so it is important to start early and reach on time to make fully enjoy.IN CASE YOU MISS THE LAST CABLE CAR BACK - Bus is the only other option and leaves around 30 minutes after the last cable car, so don't miss it (talking from personal experience here)."

The statue is impressive and the views are amazing. The surrounding area also has picturesque points.We traveled with our 2 daughters, ages 7 and 12, and the trip was a breeze. I will admit that we have fit girls therefore the climb was not as challenging as it is to most. The challenge was in dealing with the heat. The hot sun was one thing but the humid, muggy climate was horrible. Umbrellas, sun block, and water are a must (highly recommend camelbaks). Although the climb is free, if you want to go inside, you must pay. There is a small area on the side of the stairs before you climb. I don't recall exactly how much it was but for our family of 4 we ended up paying about 20 U.S. dollars. Although not much to view inside the buddha, the benefit is the cool-down with cold AC inside the buddha. Additionally, each person of your group ends up being able to get a water and an ice pop at the top. Highly recommended as it ends up being a big relief in the hot weather."

Even though it's packed with tourists you still get the spiritual vibes.Be sure to book the cable car ticket in advance from your hotel or a travelling company - you'll save about an hours worth of queue. We booked in advance and passed maybe 70meters of queue past the ticket office. If you book crystal (glass floor) there's even less queue. We had the standard cable car ($165). You will still have to wait a good 20 minutes to get in the car but it's soooo worth it. When you get to the top, and walk to the monasty and Buddha, amazing views is awaiting you. Also they only sell vegetarian food which is *heaveeen*. Be prepared for a good amount of stairs to the Buddha, bring a lot of water! A very, very good 1/2 day trip."

The ride is about 30-40 minutes to Tun Chung station. Once there, there is an outlet mall nearby if you are interested in shopping. Otherwise, you can walk to the cable car station for a great view of the surrounding area and airport as you go up. Once in the peak, there are various restaurants, shops, and other areas to visit; but honestly, most people want to see the Buddha. You can go up the stairs, about 268 of them, to get to the Buddha. It is quite a workout. However, the effort is worth it. We were there on a foggy day but lingered around for a while and the weather got better. Overall, a good experience. I would recommend to others."

The views were okay, I did prefer the views from Victoria Peak however. I also think that the cable ride to this area was much better in terms of interest. I feel that you will end up going here just because it's the tourist thing to do. But you may leave thinking hmm. My wife and I did do the 360 vacation package. This includes a cable car ride to ngong ping, as well as a bus ride to the Tai o Village as well as a boat tour of Tai o. One caveat is that the tour only really takes you to the area of the Buddha, it does not take you to the top, as the group size can be large enough that they cannot account for the differing stair climbing rates that people have. If you are interested in seeing a very large Buddha, by all means spend more time here. You can take an additional tour inside the Buddha itself for an additional fee. We did not choose to do this."

Don't bother with the glass bottom car unless you're really pumped to look down; the views are all to be seen out the windows though. Save yourself the $90hk ($12US) surcharge, even though that's not a ton of money. The lineup for the regular car seemed to be going faster too.You want to go as early as possible to avoid the lines, or maybe late in the day?

The big buddha is a huge tourist complex with restaurants, , market style eating area (lots of little stalls and you choose what you want and pay for it) and a tourist bazaar. there is also a vegetarian restaurant in the big buddha building itself. When you arrive at the big buddha building, the ticket counters try to sell you the tickets for a meal in their restaurant. i almost fell for it as i thought there was no other place to eat in the complex and the lady at the counter almost had an urgency about it (another sales tactic). but i decided against it. The views from the top are amazing! there is also a small museum area where you can find out about the construction etc. Next to the museum is this vegetarian restaurant and when i saw it, i was glad i didnt buy the meal ticket as it is a big hall with no windows and almost like a factory style eating which i do not enjoy.My tips would be to:1. try and take the bus ride one way time permitting as it is 1/3rd of the cost and is a very nice drive2. skip the meals here (both at the big buddha building and the market style restaurants in the complex) and rather eat something from one of the many places at the base("

The actual village is very modern and full of gift shops and you have to walk through the centre of it to get the cable car back down.We opted for the glass bottom gondola to come back down which, if you havent got high blood pressure, is a must! it is a lovely sedate journey and you do climb to about 550m above sea level and then gradually start your decent. HK airport is to the left and you are actually above the planes as they are landing - wonderful views across to mainland China and beyond. As we approached the end of the ride, we were amazed to see the huge queue's waiting to board - they were so long, you could not see the end! We disembarked and chatted to a few Brits in line who said they had been waiting for over 2 hours!! You would be better off taking the route we did via the ferry.The MTR station is about 200m from the ride and we were whisked back to Mong Kok in about 25 minutes - fab day but depending on the time of year (we went in December) the temperature in the mountains was noticeably chilly in spite of the bright sunshine so perhaps an extra light layer of clothing would be advisable."

I decided to buy my voucher after coming down and missed a chance to enter the place on top. By the way, do go early to get ur cable car tickets because the queue was ridiculously long. Try to go early or buy online. I hated the horrible queues to first buy tickets and then to enter the cable car. You could tremendously reduce queueing by buying tickets online the day before and choosing the crystal cabin. Practically no queueing if you choose these options."

The gondola was closed due to renovations and we took a bus from the city, which was very easy to do. The site is impressive enough being the largest Buddha statue in the world. We climb up the stairs, did the panoramic vistas. While cruising around the site, we took a hiking trail past the big white gate. It took us to a remote forgotten area with closed up restaurants and some wild camp sites. It was left to decay years ago based on the fact that many buildings had trees growing through them, which was a great treat for my camera. There you are completely away from the hustle and bustle of it all which is nice after having all your senses overly stimulated by the metropolitan city of Hong Kong."

It costs 165HK dollars for return cable car or 255 HK for one with glass bottom floor. We opted for the ordinary one. After all you can see the terrain below.. Get there early as queues are long. However the cable car does not open till 10 am but there are shops around and mostly outlets I.e puma, Levi's, Adidas etc..

Was able to view the Buddha's relic after buying a ticket sold at Hkd39 which included a snack meal. Redeemed the snack meal from the Poh Lin monastery.It was really delicious and filling.

It is an impressive sight, both from a distance and close up. Be aware that that it is quite a climb up the many steps from the bottom to the level of the Buddha itself.Once up, the views are impressive too; and there is a pleasant breeze that helps one cool off.It is interesting too to visit the Po Lin monastery at the base.We went on a ferry from Central to Mui Wo (one way costs HK$17 or HK$25 (US$2-2.5), depending on the day/time). We used a taxi from Mui Wo to the buddha because we did not want to wait in the heat - the drive is surprisingly long and takes about 20 minutes, costing the equivalent of about US$20. For the return we used the bus, which is air-conditioned and cost about US$3 - a perfectly good option if you don't have to wait long in the heat for a bus.The image that most people have of Hong Kong is of a fabulous skyline with amazing, architecturally-interesting skyscrapers, dense, urban-jungle, all lights and noise and activity. That is perfectly true of Central and of Kowloon. But there is another side to Hong Kong and the trip to Lantau shows it: Hong Kong is surprisingly green and lush and rural in places, and quiet and even peaceful. Spending half a day to visit the Big Buddha is a great way to see that side and understand Hong Kong a bit better."

Take your time to visit the monastery, the gardens, the great hall and don't miss the ceilings. Around the central place, there is a sort of \"food court\", the larger restaurant offers a 4/5 sets menu for a cheap fare, plenty to eat and not spicy as we would think. On our way back, we decided to hike the downward 4 miles. It was a very hot and humid day and we had only 1 bottle of water (not wise for 2 adults brains) The path and views were beautiful, there were some monasteries/temples on the way where we stopped to rest and refill for water.

It can be a little tricky to find but the instructions come with photos cues and are perfect. It took about 30mins to walk from the MTR station to the start of the trail.http://runlily.blogspot.com.au/2012/01/how-to-hike-to-big-buddha-ngong-ping-on.htmlThe first section of the trail up to the first tower is steep and really has your calves and hamstrings working hard. Just take it slow and take plenty of breaks. It gets progressively easier from the first tower onwards.The path consists of stone sections and wooden planking sections - take care on the planking as it can be treacherous in the shaded area. The walk up took us 2.5hrs and down was 2hrs. To this you can add 30mins in each direction from/to the station. TIPS:1. A reasonable level of fitness is required so conditions your legs prior to attempting2. The wooden sections of the track can be slippery so a walking pole would be an advantage. Alternately take it carefully.3. Take plenty of water - three bottle minimum.4. If travelling up early then be aware that you will walk through some cobwebs in the areas where the trees are low. One of the locals taught us a cool trick with a badminton racket which he waved in front of him. We replicated this by using a small branch from the bush.5 Take your camera it's worth recordingIf you want to take the non tourist approach to the Big Buddah then this is an enjoyable full day excursion which deserves a foot and calf massage to finish off."

One has to be careful on the steps when wet.Shops at base are the normal pricey food and souvenior places.View worth the climb, but watch where you put your feet while around the base, lots of cows wandering around dropping what cows drop on a regular basis."

I took the Crystal cabin to and back from the Island. The cable car itself was a 25 Min ride and it was so serene and beautiful. The day i choose to visit was slightly misty with a light drizzle, but that didnt take away anything from the mystical experience of the place. If anything it added to the whole experience. Once you reach the top, you have shops and restaurants complete with a starbucks. Keep walking and you reach the big Buddha. Do not miss having lunch at the Monastery. I think the whole experience was simply beautiful. Climb up to the buddha itself was not a challenege. I'm not sure older people and parents with toddlers/ infants can do the climb, but other wise pretty much everyone else can. And while you;re here - DO NOT MISS THE WISDOM PATH. It was a serene walk and i could understand how it got its name."

Nice visit and vegetarian lunch + dessert and cable car ride.If you'd like to spend a morning and lunch at a less crowded place other than in those shopping area, it's a good option to go to Lantau Island. It's very easy, just take the MTR subway from Central station (Tung Chung line) to Tung Chung station, then take the NgongPing 360 cable car up to NgongPing. Enjoying the short walk around the small village (with shops) then you can find Po Lin Temple.You can easily purchase the vegetarian lunch coupon at the counter - you cannot select the dishes, but they'll arrange for you according to the no. of persons at lunch. (either normal set or deluxe set) - the difference is sitting at restaurant area or VIP room setting. Afterwards, enjoy the toru (bean curd) dessert, before you leave.From there, you can take the cable car back to Tung Chung, or take bus to Silvermine Bay or bus to Tung Chung, or even take the bus to Tai O (fish village)....and continue your next stop...Very nice experience."

We climbed all 250 steps to the top stopping several times to take photos - it was an awesome sight. Luckily is wasn't crowded so we managed to get some great photos.The views from the top are amazing - a full 360 degree experience and worth seeing.We also visited the Po Lin Monastery which was perfectly preserved but parts of it were closed off due to some religious ceremony.All in, worth a visit whilst in Hong Kong - make sure you get yourself an Octopus card though as this makes travelling around Hong Kong a doddle - just like an Oyster Card but better and accepted in most shops, buses, coffee shops and the complete MTR network.The"

The Giant Tian Tan Buddha but especially the neighbouring Po Lin Monastry are nothing short of amazing. The monks living there prepare a very tasty and decently priced authentic vegetarian lunch - try it!The cable car at Ngong Ping makes this spot located in the middle of a thickly forested mountain area easy to reach while at the same the journey is almost a little bit adventurous. Thus, it is possible to make it up there on your own (you may even walk all the way up to the monastry, it's gonna take at least 5 hours, though!) but I still strongly recommend booking a guided tour (for instance with GrayLine) as they will arrange transportation from and to HongKong and also allow you to jump the really long queue at the Cable Car Terminal.On the downside it should be mentioned that Ngong Ping Village at the Buddha's feet is an entirely artificial area built to cash out tourists: sales shops and souvenir stalls are framed by the obligatory coffee shops (Starbucks of course!).And finally: only do this tour on sunny, good-weather days. In the rainy season it will often be so humid and foggy that the entire area is covered up by mist and clouds. In this case you will literally see nothing - or at best catch a glimpse at the Buddha's feet."

It is a lot of steps to the top, we had a slight view to the monastery side, but couldn't see the sea or any other islands as we were in the clouds. I wasn't expecting anything other than a view as the little village is tourist trap and I didn't really care about seeing the statue. Since it rained I was a bit disappointed. We took a cab from Tung Chung station (blue for Lantau Island) for 160 HKD one way and our driver waited for us (at no cost) for about an hour to drive us back. There were no other cabs there for a return at the time we were there. It was nice to see the countryside and a different part of the island by cab. We chose not to do the tram as it looked way too high, and long for my comfort."

From cable tower number 3 you can get an amazing view of Chek lap kok airport, thats assuming that you HAVE a view. Special signs will inform you that tower 3 is a good view point and that you should take a picture there or you will be thrown out of the car. Well not really but they do encourage you to snap a photo there. While you are in the car in mid air, recorded bird sounds will help you to get into your nature zone. How's that for a tweet? When the car reaches the top the doors open and you will have to walk through a maze of souvenir stalls. There is no way to go around them. Why wait till the end of the tour to buy the souvenirs, When you can start buying them as soon as you arrive?. Exiting the cable station you will find yourself in a square full of, well, Shops. And after that you may begin ascending to the big buddha. While walking you may see some dogs resting under \"No dogs allowed\" signs and coins scattered next to \"Don't throw coins\" signs. Other than that the place is very neatly organized. Speaking from a non Chinese point of view and with all due respect, there seems to be a constant race for who builds the biggest buddha. There are several categories to this obsession and keep in mind that the Buddha you have just checked in at may be the biggest of its kind in say, bronze while there is another bigger specimen made of wood and so forth. the biggest sitting Buddha is in Leshan in China mainland. It's toes are bigger than you!Personally I would recommend getting a good book on Buddha rather than taking a selfie next to one. With all that said, most people seem to like this mini day trip, add the convenient transportation and plenty of services on top of the mountain this makes a leisure activity hard to resist. There are also plenty of trails for hikers seeking a more active visit."

The statues of the Divine Generals are interesting, and beg for further explanation. The stairs on the final approach are strenuous, but truly fit into the experience.The museum under the Buddha is mostly in Chinese and seems faded and is certainly a missed opportunity to explain a culture and a religion and the significance of the current temple, its location, etc. If you are already Buddhist and Chinese, i guess that's fine. But this site is open to the world. Indeed, the shops and the concessions seem slightly superficial, as well.The vegetarian dinner at the temple consists of soup and four courses. But the number of meals served and the attitude of the waiters makes it more like a huge Los Angeles Chinatown restaurant than a monastery. That's probably unavoidable, but it was a slight disappointment. However, if you make it this far, go to the fishing village of Tai O. It is truly amazing and a step into another (more real and vanishing) world."

This has always been my choice, even though the price is much higher. The countryside that scrolls beneath your feet is mesmerizing. It is possible to reach the Big Buddah by bus as well, but I\u2019ve never tried.Once you arrive at the final station of the cable cart, you will walk across a tourists village, full of restaurants and souvenir shops. Not really my cup of tea, but many tourists might like it. Then you walk along the Horoscope Characters avenue, where each of the 12 Chinese horoscope signs is represented and briefly described.Finally you\u2019ll reach the stair that climbs up to the Buddha itself, which is really big!All around the main attraction, at ground level, there are temples, gardens and forest trails, all worth to be checked."

I never thought it was that BIG, and it was BIG, when you try to get close to the Buddha, as possible. But beware, you need to walk about 200 steps before enjoying the scenery! I highly recommend that you buy your tickets ahead of time in order to take transportation to the Big Buddha. There was a really long ling when we went there, but luckily, my dad's friend booked the ticket ahead of time, so we just cut in front. And dress comfortably (lots of walking). And the food is amazing! And a little advice, if the weather is not good or even windy, they will close the attraction because it's a long ride (air trams??) to the Big Buddha. It is worth visiting there, I promise!"

This is not a single attraction but is a combination of quite a few. Beside visiting the big buddha statue you also cover Ngong Ping village, Po Lin Monastery, Lantau Cable Car, and Lantau hiking Trail.How to reach: Reach tung chung by the orange line of MTR and get off exit B. from there you can either take a bus for 28 HKD for aa very beautiful ride across the lantau peak to reach big buddha. You can also take a blue taxi but it will obviously cost more.However a more popular way is to take lantau /big buddha cable car from cable car station right near the Tung Chung station. The cost of cable car is about 120 for one way and 165 two way per person for a standard cabin or about 300 per person for a glass floor cabin also known as crystal cabin.A third and more adventurous option is to walk along the lantau hiking path from Tung Chung promenade up to big biddha. its a long and hard walk but worth the effort if you are into hiking.No matter which mode of transport you take the view is breath taking and serene. with greenery all over and view of mountain and sea on other side. All you get to see is nature in blue and green. truly awesome.Once you reach the top either by bus/car/cable car you get off into a small artifial village called Ngong Ping.. which is nothing but many eateries, souvenir shops and some fun activity points. From there you get to walk towards the big biddha. The buddha sits at a height and you need to climb about 250 stairs to get to it. Its not necessary to do so if you dont fancy a up close pic with the nirvana man. you can instead keep walking along the side to get to a beautiful trail called wisdom path which will take you thru a serene path and lead you to a break out zone right in the middle of the greenery from where you have a good view which u can enjoy sitting on the benches there. or may continue to go along the trail to reach the lantau peak. its quite a hike and you will need lots of water etc. There is also the monastery right in front of the buddha with buddhist temple. you cana get into the monastery and walk around. its really beautiful n calm there.Tip: weather can be a spoiler. If its cloudy then there is no point in taking the cable car since you wont get to see much in the cloud. take a bus or a taxi in that case.."

We choose the cable car from Tung Chung station.From Ngong Ping Village the Tian Tan Buddha statue is already clearly visible. The climb up the 268 stairs was easier than I thought. The stairs aren't too high and there are rails on both sides to hold on. There are several little things to observe, and anyway, no one forces you, to climb up in one go. You can stop, look around, catch your breath, while Buddha with his mysterious smile, is patiently waiting for you.On the top level are six statues, the Six Devas making offerings to the Tian Tan Buddha. From this level you can have a closer look at this holy golden boy with his blessing hand, and who originally wasn't on my bucket list, but I\u2019m glad that I was able to see it. Also this is the level from where you can enjoy a beautiful country side view and a glimpse of the Po Lin Monastery. There is a little shop where you can by religious souvenirs and the toilets are on this level as well.When you finished giving your respect to the Big Buddha, it is worth to look around a bit. The Po Lin Monastery is very close, and it is one of Hong Kong's most important Buddhist sanctums. A pleasant garden surrounds this colorful Monastery, so it is really worth to make a little stroll around.Now you\u2019re probably hungry already, but no problem at all, there are plenty of restaurants waiting to serve your culinary pleasures.We went back with cable car again, and it was an interesting ride despite the rain, since now we were able to concentrate on Lantau Island, Ngong Ping Plateau and the South China Sea under us, since the Tian Tan Buddha was already behind us."

Overall, the trip took us a full day but it is possible to do it in half a day. We left around 9:30am from our hotel, rode the MTR to meet my uncle, took our time around the Cityscape outlet mall then went over to the Big Buddha. The Ngong Ping 360 cable car is a must-ride and if you wanted to pay extra, you can get the one with the see through floor. We went during the weekday so it wasn't overly packed. After the Buddha, we rode bus 21 to Tai O and took a boat ride around the fishing village and walked to check out the Tai O Heritage hotel which use to be a police station. You can catch a bus back to Cityscape outlet mall. The big Buddha is amazing and you should see it if you have time!"

Since this is a frequently visited location by both tourists and locals the buses get full quite fast but the bus service is regular. You could use an Octopus card or the exact in change for the bus which cost approx HK$17 pp. Unfortunately the cable car was closed for maintenance hence we missed this. The bus takes a good 45 min to an hours to get there but they are pretty regular. However, the bus ride up the hill is quite scenic. It can get foggy earlier in the morning so ideal time would be after 10.30AM. It was a very peaceful and serene environment and the climb of 250+ steps is fully worth it. Can be a challenge to a less physically fit person but an average person it is not much of a stretch. Lot's of photography opportunities if interested. Entrance to this attraction is also free and is close to the Po Lin Monastery."

The bus trip there was very scenic and thrilling, as like most HK bus drivers, they drive fast! The Po Lin Monastery is directly opposite the statute and really worth a visit. The monastery surroundings are beautiful, tranquil and well kept. The steps up to the Buddha, might be a little bit challenging to those who are less mobile, but an average level of fitness will not struggle. the view from the top was blocked by the fog, and we could only get a few good shots of the Buddha, whilst waiting patiently for the fog to blow in the wind. It was well worth the visit, and easily accessible by bus. A great break from the hustle and bustle of the dense city and Free entry to the statue and monastery."

From Kowloon we bought an Octopus travel pass from the MTR office in Tsim Sha Tsui station, travelled to Central and then to Tung Chung. There is clear signage and helpful people if needed. The cable car is easy to find. You can avoid the queue by buying a ticket online, but the queue didn't take long. We were charged a little more than the online price for our one way ticket. A crystal cabin has a glass bottom, but I didn't think it was worth the extra. Ngong Ping Village at the top is a delight with a variety of eats to try, and some exquisite items for sale. Beyond the Vilage I gained enlightenment and sore legs by climbing the 250 steps to the Big Buddha which was certainly impressive. The nearby Lo Ping monastery is also impressive with gold statues and decoration. Everything is neat and clean and cared for. We then used our travel pass to take the bus to the forgettable fishing village of Tai O, and the ferry back to Tung Chung, and then the trains back home. Without rushing, we took seven hours. An excellent day, and highly recommended."

Unfortunately for us, it was very cloudy and did rain a bit, so we were not able to fully enjoy the trip. We did enjoy Po Lin Monastery, right next to the Buddha, which is a very beautiful and peaceful monastery. There are real devotees who come to pray, and I did enjoy witnessing their rituals. There is a vegetarian restaurant in the monastery which did serve cheap and decent food.I guess it was the bad weather that did ruin my impression a little, but it is still worth a visit.

The statue is located on Lantau island near a quaint little town which is pleasure to peruse through. Try the street side shops selling steamed/boiled corn along with other snacks. Climb up the stairs to the Buddha spend some time taking in the lovely views (when we went there the whole island was covered by a dense cloud like fog so while we couldn't catch a view of the scenery the silhouette of the Buddha in the fog was a great site) and then walk back down. Roam around the island, catch lunch at one of the numerous eateries at the village. Enjoy your day :)"

When you're about to ascend the stairway to the giant Buddha, staff at the foot of the stairs will ask you if you want to get your meal ticket. Do not get the food there unless you want to visit the tiny display of Buddhist paintings and the Buddha bone relic both of which are within the pedestal of the giant Buddha and the giant Buddha itself. HKD98 can get you better vegetarian food elsewhere (like on Fa Yuen St; HKD50+ for one main). For the record, there is tasteless bitter gourd soup, greens with mushrooms, tofu with corn bits and deep fried crispy yam(? no idea, but this one is still decent). You will be eating at a windowless restaurant, next to waiters wheeling in food and wheeling out dirty dishes. No comment on the deluxe meal, which supposedly has \"sharks' fin\". Maybe eating at Ngong Ping Village itself is a better option (I think there are veg options)."

We took a guided tour around the island. It wasn't worth it. They take you to see a small fishing village and a 20 minute boat ride around the village. You can see it once but I'm almost certain no one goes a second time. The main attraction is the Buddha himself, the monastery and its kitchen. The food was great too but its all vegetarian. Works for me, maybe not for everyone. There are 260 odd steps up to the Buddha so if you have knee issues don't bother looking for the lift or escalator.

Once arrived there is a precinct where you can buy food and souvenirs, or just take in the Buddha and other surrounding statues and picturesque scenery. Worth doing. About 200 or so steps up the the Buddha itself, but most people including elderly managed by taking it steady and taking rest when needed."

Make sure that you have exact HK coins because the bus has no change for big bills or larger coins. The entrance fee into the monestary includes lunch at the buddhist monestary. The scenery was spectacular. Clean fresh air and so much peace and solitude. A true highlight from my trip to Hong Kong!"

The day was really misty so the expensive cable car seemed like a complete waste of money. Once there it was a nice easy walk to the Buddha up the steps. The Buddha was nice to look at, but after about 15 minutes it was a done deal. Given the Buddha is not actually old it seems to me like me it is just really a tourist trap for the tourists. The actual temples nearby were nice to stroll around and the cows and dogs were a friendly variation to the landscape. I do not regret going but was not impressed either."

Don't fall for the all inclusive package for $399hkd (\u00a336ish) it says it includes the monastery, big Buddha etc but you actually don't pay for these things anyway!!We decided to go for the $245hkd which included the Tai O boat excursion and return bus ride there and return cable car. We only went for it because the return cable car was $233hkd anyway so not much different!!! we didn't save anything because the Tai o boat excursion and bus ride is really cheap anyway!! Big Buddha is amazing, walked up all the steps to the top! Beautiful view from it all the way round! It was a lovely sunny day as well so clear skies! If we were going to do it again differently we would definitely pay for the upgraded \"crystal cable car\" it is glass bottomed but it is mainly for the queue to be honest!! We had to queue half an hour to buy our tickets then waited from 10.30-11.30am to actually get on the cable car! The crystal cabin people waited 10-15mins at most! We started to queue again for the cable car back at 3pm and got on it at 3.30pm. I'm not sure how much Extra the upgraded cabin is but it is worth doing!! Cable car takes 20minutes. You can get the bus up which I heard takes 40 minutes! It is worth doing cable car for the beautiful views - unless your scared of heights! Fantastic day though! We loved the boat excursion in Tai O and we spotted the Chinese white dolphins!! Amazing!"

The walk up, with landing areas where one could light incense sticks or simply admire the view and take photos, made the going easy. Once up top there is quite a bit to see inside as well as the various statues surrounding the Big Buddha and of course the Tiantan Buddha.Once back at the monastery, one can choose a vegetarian meal at the monastery or go to the stalls outside which sell meat products which true Buddhists will not.We travelled up by bus and passed numerous buffalo which according to signs along the road are feral. The bus drivers are pretty good at negotiating the steep bends and the wandering buffalo on Lantau island. Lovely views of beaches along the way.Things close down early so make sure you leave in time to catch the bus back to the depot, walk across to the mall and enjoy a good Starbucks coffee before commencing your journey back to Hong Kong."

I first visited the Big Buddha in Hong Kong in 1999 and things have changed a fair bit since then!Most notably, as of April 2015, there is now a cable car to take you to the Buddha, whereas previously I remember a lengthy and rickety bus journey, that would certainly not have suited the young children who were with us this time around. The cable car is fabulous and well worth the money. We paid a bit extra for a glass-bottomed car, which is not the the faint-hearted but we thought it was excellent (and so did the kids!). Regardless, you get amazing views from the cable car as you travel up (it's quite a long journey still), especially of the planes taking off and landing at the airport. Its all good fun. Below, you can see an alternative - a long, winding path, that I have been informed takes several hours to walk! Once you arrive at the top, you're greeted by another new addition since 1999, a 'tourist trap' village of sorts comprising mostly of souvenir shops, cafes, places to eat etc. We stopped for lunch and had a bit of a look around in the shops before making the short walk to the steps of the Buddha (with more shops, places to buy ice cream etc on the way).The Buddha itself is an impressive sight. When you visit, you'll know why it's a 'must do' in Hong Kong. There are plenty of good photo opportunities to be had and it's a nice place to just wander and take it all in. The climb to the top is perhaps a little hard work for some, but we found it fine with our 7 year old and a baby in a carrier, you can just take your time. The views from the top are good (if the weather is clear, of course!). You can see the monastery below, and there are various other statues to look at around the top. We took a look inside (no photography allowed) as well.We didn't visit the monastery this time, but if you're there and you have time, it would be good to take a look.Overall, a visit to the Big Buddha is one of the things you simply must do if you visit Hong Kong. You probably only need a couple of hours / half day, but combined with the cable car trip it is well worth it.Incidentally, we rounded off our day with dinner in the Disneyland hotel Enchanted Garden restaurant (where the characters come around the tables), which really isn't that far away from the Buddha cable car if you're driving - fabulous if you have kids."

To be far away from the maddening tourist crowds, long queues and frayed tempers and commercialism, why not seek the quieter way and road less traveled. It's not a difficult walk from Shek Mun Kap village (see my other review on Ngong Ping Village for directions). Upon reaching the end of the walk, you will see a car park. Choose the Wisdom Path way on the left. There are signs beside the steps leading to a camp site. This path leads you through shaded route for about 300m before emerging at the entrance of Wisdom Path.If you are interested in Buddhism, Wisdom Path is calligraphy masterpiece on The Heart Sutra, inscribed on wooden poles. Walking on the path, (and reading the sutra if you are so inclined), breathing in the clean air with sweeping vistas of Lantau Peak is pretty awe inspiring as you take in the nature around you.Walk on towards the Big Buddha when you have your fill of solitude. Fill up your stomach at the vegetarian Deli (snack corner beside the restaurant) at Po Lin temple which offers fried vermicelli, dim sum snacks and soya bean drink at reasonable prices. Then visit the Ten Thousand Buddha hall in the temple and proceed to the piazza where you can view the Big Buddha before attempting the climb. We left for Tai O fishing village after a great visit to the Big Buddha via Bus 23 at the terminus in Ngong Ping village."

It is much cheaper than buying at the gate and you get ushered ahead of the line which you could stand in for a couple of hours. Even though the website says they will email the tickets, they do not, you follow the signs for tour tickets and pick them up at the prepurchased ticket window. We took Hong Kong MTR there, their MTR system is great. The 25 minute gondola ride up the mountain offers breathtaking views and for an extra fee you can ride in one with a see through floor. Atop the mountain is the largest sitting bronze Budha in the world. There is a cute little village with shops and restaurants at the base. The 45 degree, 225 step, climb up the stairs to the statue is quite a good work out. You can then walk around and through the base with a little museum. For an addition fee you can go into the area with the \"relic\", which we felt was a waste of money as it is just a litt piece of bone and you can not actually see it directly. Our guided tour included a bus ride and visit to a little fishing village with the fishermen's homes built on stilts in the water and a 20 minute boat ride out to see the pink Dolphins (we did not see any, and I think it is pretty rare to see them on that trip). If you really want a chance to see the pink Dolphins, I think the 4 hour trip with the researchers would be a better bet, but the boat ride was a nice tour of the fishermen's homes. Our guide took us through the temples and explained about their beliefs. The 3 temples on the mountain with the Budha were quit elaborate. Had some good vegetarian dim sum next to the temples. You need some good walking shoes and plan on an all day excoursian. The tourbook states that this trip is best for children 7 and up, but you could do it with younger ones, although Disneyland Hong Kong would be a better choice."

Many dogs are lying around - they are not dangerous and so used to to the tourists they seem not to react anymore to noise or people talking to them which was pretty funny.

After taking a subway to Lantau Island, the 25 minute cable car ride up to the area of the Big Buddha was breathtaking and amazing views of the island, airport and HK. Once you get to the Big Buddha area - Ngong Ping there are shops to buy souvenirs and places to eat, even a Starbucks. After walking through that area you get close to the Big Buddha and it's an amazing sight and truly massive in size. It's a significant place for many of the Buddhists in the area, so you will see many people praying and it's a very peaceful and serene place. The walk up to the base of the Buddha is 200+ steps but definitely worth it. There is an additional fee you can pay to go inside the Buddha which is a small museum and it lets you go two floors higher for some additional views. Since I'll probably never go back again, it was worth the small fee to go inside. The fee also includes either just a snack or you can pay to get a meal outside the Po Lin Monastery which is at bottom of the steps. The monastery is also a symbolic site to visit and the snack is worth it to experience some authentic food from the area. I would definitely visit this site as the #1 thing to do when visiting Hong Kong. Now my advice about visiting, go early in the day! I thought I had left early (it was Good Friday and many people had off which could have been caused higher crowds) but I reached the Cable Car around 10am and it still took about 30+ minutes to buy my ticket before getting in the cable car to head up to the Buddha. I got back to the cable car entrance around 2:30 - 3pm and the line at that time was at least 1.5 hours long to buy a ticket so definitely go early in the day to enjoy this attraction! Another side note - Souvenirs can be bought much cheaper at the Temple Street Night Market."

The cable car was undergoing maintenance while we were in HK, so we took the ferry from HK Island to Mui Wo on Lantau Is. and from there caught the bus to Ngong Ping. This enormous statue/shrine appeared suddenly as our bus rounded the last of many hill-hugging bends in the road. The bus let us off about a half mile away, and we walked via a pedestrian avenue lined with the statues of famous generals to reach the bottom of the stairs that takes you up to the site. To us, the military figures were incongruous, since their warlike presence seemed in conflict with the message of peace projected by Buddha. The stairs up to the Buddha rise in a straight line \u2013 no switchbacks \u2013 and the ascent begins not far from the Po Lin Monastery that offers more cultural exposure and education. The view from the Big Buddha\u2019s base and upper levels is quite nice, overlooking a fairly underdeveloped region of land. This is an impressive site, worth the effort and time it takes to get to it."

We rode the totally enclosed jet taxi across the harbor and took the subway back to the mainland ... under Victoria Harbor! When it rains on this Lantau Island it really pours. And, we're from the Northwest. Take an umbrella and get ready to walk a bit. The monastery nearby is also interesting and great grist for photos. Fabulous time!"

I hiked up to the Lantau peak this time. When we started descending and went by the Wisdom Path and saw Big Buddha at last, it felt like a great accomplishment. If you are planning on purchasing a bracelet, when you get to the top of Big Budda, there are a couple stores 'inside'. If you purchase from them, the bracelets have been blessed by a monk and the proceeds go towards restoring the area and for the upkeep."

Our first evening, we had the best Tim Sum in Mongkok. Next day, we took the Ngong Ping 360 Cable Car to see the bronze sitting Big Buddha standing 34 metres high. The over 2 hours queue was worth the experience as we were rewarded with bright sunshine although the heat can be oppressive. Do not forget to try the Deli Vegetarian snacks at Po Lin Monastery. On the second day we took a bus to Sai Kung, small seaside town.Here you can find seafood restaurants lining the seafront streets.On the third day, we took a ferry at Pier 5, to Cheung Chau, a small island on the northeast Of Hong Kong. The island is famous for its seafood restaurants and local delicacies such as fish balls on sticks and delicious durian & mango moichi.Cheung Chau is famous for its Bun Festival celebrated on May22-26 to drive away evil spirits besieging the island in ancient times. Competition is held to climb to the top of a tower of buns in front of Pak Tai Temple. Don't forget to visit the Tung Wan Beach & Kwun Yam Beach all within walking distance. You can only see bicycles on the island except for one Police Car & an Ambulance.We witnessed an ambulance sending a patient to a waiting helicopter near the beach! On our last day, we had another Tim Sum at Paramount Restaurant in IKEA Shopping Mall in Kowloon Bay before leaving for the airport. The food was Michellin Star but the price was very reasonably cheap!"

I stayed 20 minutes and went to bus stop to return to Lantau Island MTR and NO BUS WOULD STOP FOR ME. They were all crowded with ppl coming from Buddha. It started to turn dark and I thought of calling police cause it would be a 7 or so mile walk back to Hong Kong. I started to stand in middle of street so buses would have to swerve to miss me which 3 did. I almost started to cry and the next bus due to opposing traffic could not serve and picked me up. I had to stand but what a way to end a beautiful few minutes on the beach. I will never do that again. Big Buddha hands down is 1 of the biggest attractions in China, and it was worth it.

There is a monastery that has to be seen to be believed with so many golden buddhas that it is mind boggling. One tip is you can buy a special VIP package which isn't all that much more money and be placed ahead of the crowds and right up the gondola with no wait. Being there on Easter Sunday the wait for the regular price ticket was a mind numbing 2.5 hours."

It is only when up close that one appreciates the sheer size of it. As with any attraction of this sort, a fine day helps so, if flexible, do try to pick a clear day to visit. The cable car to Lantau from Tung Chung is very enjoyable and lasts around 25 minutes. Take a 'crystal' car at least one way if you dare (and you aren't too afraid of heights!). The bottom is made of clear crystal and is completely see-through. It is quite an experience although not if you don't like heights!!"

It's is on the beautiful Lantau island. Once you reach at the top there is an \"artificial\" village (ngong ping) which has good eating options and shops.

After visiting the Big Buddha, Ngong Ping Village and Tai O several times with all of our guests, we still love it. While the village is commercialized, there is great diversity, the Buddha is a standout view from the cable cars and is fun to climb up. There are about 260+ steps up to the Big Buddha so you will likely need to carry small kids and may be tough for older folks. There is no stroller parking so we just left it at the bottom and it was fine but that would be an improvement in the future. The cable car tickets should absolutely be purchased online or ask the hotel to book ahead as the line can be 1-2 hours depending on the day and time you go. It is 30min or so with the standard tickets and < 5min if you do a VIP cable car (private car but quite pricey). From the Ngong Ping villiage, you can also do a 1-2 hour hike near wisdom path if you want up Lantau peak, you can do a shorter walk just to wisdom path (30min), you can check out the new temple, have good food and also take a 20min taxi to Tai O which is well worth it so it is definitely a full day of activities. The MTR is very convenient for all ages (~ 1hr from Central Hong Kong)."

When we arrived at 10.30am, we were told that it would be at least 2.5 hours until we would make it on to a cable car ... So with our 4 and 2 year olds in tow, we purchased a \"package\" to fast track us up to the front of the que ... And are so glad we did. The cable car ride was really great, and my 4 year old son really got a lot out of it. However, when we arrived at the summit, the 1.5m giant popcorn container, that people were queuing to take photos with, really indicated what lay ahead ... Massive commercialisation that really ruled out any sense of authenticity. We were aware that the Big Buddha had been built in the last few years, and therefore has of itself no historical merit, but we were however expecting some degree of cultural or spiritual feeling ... Unfortunately it was just throngs of selfie obsessed tourists, with lots of sovenier shops, and a Starbucks and Subway thrown in for good measure!The monastery was lovely, and was much quieter, and was the only redeeming aspect of the summit. Spend lots of time in there, enjoying the peace and tranquility, and marvelling at the Buddhas (including the Hall of Buddhas) ... That is the real attraction ... And completely at odds with the circus outside.Worth a visit if you have a day to spare and don't mind being surrounded by lots of other tourists, but please don't expect peace, tranquility and enlightenment! ... This is really more akin to a theme park experience than a spiritual / cultural experience."

We climbed the stairs and enjoyed the view from up top. The monastery is nice. They have the 10 000 buddah hall that's worth a visit.Don't miss the wisdom path. It's an easy walk and it's an interesting path to walk. There is opportunity to take some cool photos from there. We were lucky and got free cable car tickets from a guy who didn't want his return ticket and I have to admit that I loved it. A breathtaking view and without doubt worth the waiting time in the queue. It's a bit expensive, 115 hk, and we wouldn't have done it if we hadn't got free tickets. But if you have the funds, take the cable car!"

Me and my brother explored the Big Buddha on a trip to Hong Kong and must say we enjoyed the experience much more than we expected.We took the Ngong Ping 360 Cable Car up the mountain from just outside Tung Chung and luckily we planned this early in the morning as the line for the cable car was huge and we heard from a member of staff that it is an even longer wait if we had chosen to go up any later during the day. We were impressed with the scenic views on the cable car and it can be an amazing experience in itself, however it didn't take long for us to reach Ngong Ping Village where the Buddha was situated but this was a very pleasant part of our trip.The village itself was very vibrant and lively with plenty of eateries and gift shops to explore. Following the signposted path through the village we worked our way up the hill and ascended the long line of steps up to the Buddha which was an amazing structure we could see even whilst walking through the village.Inside the giant Buddha there contained a lot of educational areas which teaches visitors about the holy relics of the Buddha which have been separately stored in different locations around the world. Their significance and their importance is also described, making this a great trip for families with children also as we learn so much we previously did not know just from exploring the inside of the giant Buddha. We finished our trip by exploring the many caf\u00e9s and restaurants back at Ngong Ping village before heading back down to Tung Chung.Overall we thoroughly enjoyed the trip to the Big Buddha as it was a combination of peaceful, traditional environments combined with an educational journey with lots to do and see along the way, all at the cost of taking the Cable Car up the mountain only making this a cheap yet enjoyable day out with both friends and family. Highly recommended if you are nearby the Hong Kong Airport area and have half a day to spare."

It was a cloudy day when we went but that only added to the mystery we felt as we acended into the clouds to a serene village type area. There are a range of places to stop off and eat as well as loads of souvenir shops. It was understandably busy but it didn't really have an effect of the two of us. Approaching the Buddha was spectacular and with every step we took (and there are a lot of them!) it got bigger and bigger! The surrounding landscape is also beautiful and it was very easy to sit on one of the many benches and get a little bit lost in both the views and your own thoughts. One of the best places we visited, words don't do it much justice you just have to see it for yourself!"

Though we too visited during quite poor weather conditions this only added to the mystic and misty aura that leaves one quite speechless with the sheer magnitude of this spiritual structure. To visit the inner sanctum is a must to really embrace the very soul that is this great Buddha. To finish a visit to the monastery along with a purchase of incense sticks to place and pray makes for a complete experience. Your journey is complete with lovely food from the monastery cafe. Sadly our cable ride was void of any great viewing of Buddha. Just means I'll have to return to complete the special journey."

Since the airport is pretty close by, people would actually replace their bore transit time (if they have quite a few hours (5-6 hours) to kill) in the airport and take a mini trip down to visit this renowned touristy site.The 34- metres tall bronze statue faces the North, overlooking the sprawling land of Chinese people. This majestic statue is one of Hong Kong's most famous tourist hotspot. People from land near and far, the East and the West, would come to this place and immerse in the most galvanising cultural experience of a lifetime.For a detailed article with LOADS OF PICTURES on Lantau Island, The Big Buddha, and awesome walking trails to take, visit: http://travelwhenever.com/treks-lantau-peak-hong-kong/"

We took the public bus instead of the cable car (#23, HK$17 one-way, $27 on weekends) from the train station and enjoyed the local scenery on the winding mountain road to the site. Once there, we climbed the 200-odd steps to the statue, stopping oftentimes to photograph the stunning views of the Buddha and mountainside. Try to avoid going when it's warm as it will make it quite uncomfortable climbing. Although you have the option once you reach the top of purchasing a vegetarian meal for lunch later on and/or entry to the museum, I would suggest you do neither unless you're devout. Photos are forbidden inside the museum and there is nothing of interest there to anyone unless they are deeply devout Buddhists or interested in that. As for the meal, the quality is low. I would recommend you buy something from one of the few stalls instead. After making our way back down, we strolled around the monastery which has the workings of a functioning Temple but also several tacky tourist-friendly stalls selling food, ice-cream and the ubiquitous souvenirs. Although not really anything special, we are glad we did the site as the Buddha really is quite impressive but it was more the scenery that seduced us."

Unfortunately there were too many people standing in my line of sight so i could not see a thing.. i would say mainly locals there enjoying the day.The big Buddha ( Tian Tan Buddha ) It has been made from bronze and has a very interesting history / story. There are quite a lot of steps, but the view both from below and the top are breathtaking and well worth it.Our last venture of the day was a 25 minute - 5.7km bi-cable ropeway - ride down in the Ngong Ping Cable Car , the cable car travels on the cable towards North Lantau. Truly a beautiful site."

It was a nice ride there, with beautiful panoramic views of the city. Enjoyed the serenity of the heights and then the Big Buddha came into view. Quite a surreal moment.Over at Ngong Ping itself, took a walk around the village and then walked up to the Big Buddha peak. Plenty of photo opportunities along the way. The climb up was not very steep - although can be bad for those with poor knees. But the view up there was nice, made up for all the tiredness. A must go for tourists."

Once you get to the top there is a junky village which is nothing exciting and just had lots of tourist gifts etc. The location of the Buda is great and the statue is beautiful and surrounded by great views. The surrounding temples are also very nice. After spending some time there, we got a public bus down (using our Octopus card which was very cheap) and headed to the small fishing village on stilts (Tai O village) for lunch. We then took a bus to another small village to get a boat back to downtown Hong Kong. We had a great day out and would recommend it for visitors to Hong Kong. If you are short on time defiantly buy your gondola tickets in advance online."

The queue was over an hour and we paid \u20ac165 each for a return standard cable car: (suggested site)http://www.citsmacao.com/en/hong-kong/Attraction-Ticket/hong-kong-ngong-ping-360-round-way-3.htmlIf you don't like heights, maybe this isn't for you. Catch the bus but definitely don't go for the crystal (glass bottomed) cab where available. The cable car often speeds up and is a little spooky for people with a nervous disposition.Also, please check the official website for closures due to maintenance (13-20th March 2015?):http://www.np360.com.hk/en/I think it's cheaper to book on the CITS site, but I'll leave that to you to work out. There's a purpose built tourist village between the cable car drop off and the Buddha, fab for collectors of tat. Plenty of places to eat, at tourist rates so take your own if on a budget.The steps aren't a killer and you can take a standing break if required. No wheelchair access here. This is a religious place, so please don't eat, drink and definitely no alcohol or smoking up here!Smokers should find more comfort off the paths, away from the crowds.You can go inside the Buddha and ignore the no photo signs for some history once you've done your selfies. TOP TIP: Take a photo of the Buddha with a profile view including the clouded mountains around from the Cable Car to Wow your mates back home. Selfie sticks dont add much at this venue."

One has to climb up some 250 steps to get to the top of it, so be prepared for that!The journey to the statue is also worth a mention. One takes the MTR and then a cable car, which travels at a high altitude and on its way, shows a great view of Hong Kong International Airport, in addition to the pretty hills and mountains in the neighbourhood.Another nearby attraction is Po Lin Monastery, just beside the Big Buddha. The monastery has two main halls, with stunning Buddha statues. It also has a vegetarian restaurant and cafe, something which a lot of fellow vegetarian visitors would yearn for, as it's not easy getting vegetarian food in Hong Kong.Lastly, the walk from the cable car terminal to the Big Buddha also warrants a special mention, as one walks through Ngong Ping Village, with its many eateries, souvenir shops, a special Wishing Bodhi Tree, multimedia displays and an exhibition of cable cars from across the world.Truly a day very well spent!"

Stairs not daunting at all -- so crowded we had to take them slowly. We went during Chinese New Year, so crowds were huge. Planned to take cable car up and back, but when we arrived there was a 2.5 hour wait to buy cable car ticket. Even pre-purchased ticket holders had a huge line. Instead, we waited in a long, but quick moving line for one of the many buses that constantly arrive to take visitors to the top. Bus wait was only 20 minutes. When we came down, there was no line at all for cable car. Glad we used both methods of transportation because views are different (around the mountain, vs. straight up), so we got to experience both."

            "review": "Big time investment for not much to see. If it only took 20 minutes or so to get it it I might feel differently, but the Big Buddha is not worth the close to 4 hour round trip plus expense (I'm factoring in time waiting to buy tickets for the cable car and then the wait for it). Here are my gripes: -The whole area around the Big Buddha is heavily commercialized. To get to it from the cable car station you have to walk through what's essentially an open air gift market. -There's not much to do at the Big Buddha but see it and take in the view. The few other sites that are on Lantau Island are miles away. That's why there are so many packages offering transportation around the island. -My further complaint about the commercialization is that the reason they don't just have a kiosk to buy cable car tickets -- which would save you a ton of time -- is because they want to try and sell you the transportation packages face-to-face. You're time is essentially being wasted so they can market you.There are no shortages of places in Hong Kong that offer incredible vistas which do not require wasting half the day to coming."

But it was worth it. The cable car ride was fun and the view was amazing. The village was very touristy. And the food was very expensive. However, the statue was amazing. Don't forget to climb the buddha from the inside of the statue. You can access this from the ground floor. We didn't have much time to explore the area. Hopefully next time we can hike the trail to the Buddha and walk the wisdom trail"

So when I was in HK for a week to see the city, visit my friends and do some sightseeing I decided to go see the Big Buddha.We were crazy to do that on Saturday noon at Chinese New Year Holidays when all China seemed to do the same. Have not seen such long queues for ages...But my friend was a wise one and we managed to get to the fast queue to the cable car paying just 145 HK dollars more than a regular price. We got some 360 Hong Kong Ngong Ping special pass which included all fast queues and some other stuff, and also a return ticket.Cable car ride was fun and worth it. We were cracking jokes about \"where are our skis\" as it funnily reminded us of skiing adventures. Floor of the cabin was not glass (as I saw in some ads and reviews) but was still nice to look around. The views vary from foggy Hong Kong, sea, tracking trails on the island to a huge airport that you cannot even see at one glance. Views are really picturesque and remind more Himalayas than the the Hong Kong islands :)When arriving to the island one should look to the left to enjoy the big statute sidewise which makes quite an impressive view.The small village that was build around Buddha is very touristic and very new so if you don't like it (as my friends) - go to Buddha and see if you like it. I did.The huge statute - yes, though it was built just only 20 years ago - looked quite impressive, and I was admiring its magnitude. Maybe every Buddha built in such size and such place can be that kind of admirable :)There were many tourists around just having fun and making pics, so this place did not seem and feel that spiritual. Though I saw some people praying heartedly, and actually there is a beautiful monastery just in front of the big statute which has services.I enjoyed walking around the statute and also looked inside - there's some museum, at both levels: near the base and up in the stairs. Making nice pics and trying to pray - but that's it, nothing really special felt. We slowly went down the stairs and went to the monastery for a quick look.Nice to see but definitely not must for those who look for authentic spiritual experience. Good for family day with kids."

We booked on the Internet to avoid having to stand in a long queue. This worked well and once we had collected our tickets we were allowed through to board the cable car. It is 4 miles long and travels over water and forest. We got some great photos. As the big Buddha came into view everyone went quiet. It was quite a sight. We got off the cable car and made our way through the village to the temple. It was very busy but there was room for all. We stood at the bottom of the steps and marvelled at the statue above us, then we began our climb. It is not for anyone with mobility difficulties! We arrived at the top quite breathless but it was worth the climb. You could buy a lunch ticket and be served food by the monks if you wish. It was a special place In a lovely setting. After we had seen the temple we took a bus to Tai O, an old Chinese fishing village on stilts. There is a converted police station there that is now a hotel and restaurant. We had afternoon tea. The village itself was fascinating, crowded and smelly but a place to see real life! We took a bus back to Ngong Ping and then the MRT back to our hotel. You have to be careful with bus numbers and times and you need the correct money to travel on buses. A great and memorable day and a trip that we would heartily recommend."

But hey, we are tourists , so we enjoyed looking at all the trinkets!We walked over to the steps, enjoying some \" street snacks\" of corn on a stick and sweet bean curd along the way. It was Chinese New Year, so it was very busy , and the temple was full of people making their offerings.This was a great day trip. We had plenty of time to walk, sit, see what we wanted, shop and we were still back down in 3 hours..Very important!! Buy advanced tickets for Gondola!! Otherwise you would be waiting for hours in a line. We walked right up to the front with our times tickets and only waited 2-3 minutes for our turn.All in all a great day for us!"

While in Hong Kong, the Ngong Ping 360 Cable ride and the visit to the Big Buddha were both trips highly recommended to us by friends and on Trip Advisor. Like any mountain top visit, a clear day will make the view that much more enjoying and magnificent. We decided to take a different route to the Big Buddha by taking a local Lantau taxi (those are the ones in Green vs the red ones that can only take you back to HK) up to the top of the Ngong Ping 360 peak and base of the Big Buddha. There were 3 of us and the ride up (more like around the island and then up the backside of the peak) only cost $160HKD total. There is also a bus that goes the same route (I believe it was the number 11 bus) which will bring you up to the top with no wait.queue for the gondola ride). This avenue saved us both time (the wait was not insignificant for the cable ride up) and money (Cost for taxi $160, cost to take the cheaper gondola was $115HKD single way) to take advantage of the glass bottom ride back down the mountain. The visit to the Big Buddha was great with time taken to make the trek along the Wisdom Path and to check out the 12 Divine Generals that represent the 12 signs of the Chinese Zodiac. The trek up to the top of the Big Buddha was a bit steep but worth the 300+ steps to the top. The day we went, there was not a lot of visitors so there was plenty of time to stop for photos, selfies and those common holding the Buddha in your hand pics. We did not check out the Ngong Ping village as those places tend to be tourist traps in terms of pricing and items being sold but it was nicely laid out and clean from the short walks I did around the area.On the way back from the peak, we took the glass bottom gondola which was both exhilarating and freaky at the same time. Beautiful views of the surrounding area, include the Big Buddha and the HK airport make that portion worth the trip"

This statue is 112 ft tall and its presence dominates all the surrounding areas. We were told that on a clear day (which we missed) from this altitude the visitor is able to see as far as Macau Island. The Buddha is majestic, powerful, serene and inspiring.

Easy to do in half a day or extend and do a whole day out."

Despite the fact that we ended up going on a crisp and windy day in December, it was well worth it (there were also plenty of little spots to get a hot cup of coffee/tea to stay warm). After the cable car, it was a pleasant walk up to the Big Buddha where there are many great photo opps to be had at the bottom, along the stairs and from the view up top -- as a result, realize that this is the most concentrated spot so watch your step. We didn't pay the extra fee to go inside and felt we had a great experience. On a clear day (these are becoming more and more limited in HK) you can see so many great views. It was peaceful and quiet at times at the top, which was a nice change from the hustle and bustle of the city. After you come down, I also suggest you walk around and over to the temple they're renovating. The colours painted on the outside are beautiful and again we encountered some peaceful spots to sit and just take it all in. We also had a great lunch at the vegetarian restaurant near the temple. We took our time walking around so we spent some hours in the area; it's not really some place you go to for just an hour or so. A few tips: * Go on a weekday morning, if you can, as weekend crowds will have you waiting endlessly in lines and pushed to and fro. * Also, even though the glass-bottomed cable-car is more expensive, it's well worth the view and much shorter lines (we never waited more than 10 mins or so). * Finally, after you've seen the statue, I highly recommend having lunch at the vegetarian restaurant up by the temple. Very reasonable price and plenty of homemade food."

There are different tickets, some attached with vegetarian full meal, vegetarian light meal or entrance of the big Buddha museum. Check it out underneath the Buddha.There should be some package tickets for Nong Ping 360 which you can buy from some main MTR stations ticket office in down down, with that you are in another queue upon arrival at the Nong Ping cable car station......since things change very quickly in this city, check it online or with the concierge ahead."

The most scenic way to arrive at the Big Buddha is via cable car that can be picked up near the City Gate Outlet Mall in Tung Chung (adjacent to the HK International Airport). it is worth it to take the cable car with the glass floor as the views are spectacular. The village near the Big Buddha is quite touristy, but if you quickly pass through you are rewarded with better sites and can climb the stairs to the statue. After visiting, I recommend heading to the nearby coast to visit Tai O. This is a traditional fishing village with all of the homes built on stilts over old salt pans. It's definitely an interesting site and feels very authentic. You can try your luck at one of the many boat cruises to see the famous pink dolphins. You may or may not get lucky. if you want a more solid chance, head back to Tung Chung and schedule a trip with Hong Kong Dolphin Watch - you are nearly guaranteed to see them then....and as advertised, they are bubble gum pink!"

If you get the chance to visit Hong Kong make the time to see the Tian Tan Buddha and the Po Lin Monastery! Start with the cable car that starts from Tung Chung, crosses out over the Tung Chung Harbor, goes past the Honk Kong airport (spectacular views of plans coming, going and on the ground!) and ends at North Lantau and the beginning of this area. If you're lucky the smog will be down so you can also enjoy spectacular panoramic views of all of Hong Kong! Cable car takes about 25 minutes. There's a fee for the ticket but this is the only thing you have to pay for on this trip. Once there you'll find restaurants and cool shops. Go ahead and eat but save the shopping till the end. Head over and start the 268 step climb to the Buddha! He is 34 meters or over 111 feet in height and nothing short of awe inspiring. Inside the base you'll find lot of interesting information about his construction and dedication and even if you don't speak Chinese you'll enjoy this very much. Then walk over to the Po Lin Monastery and take in the stunning architecture and statuary. Hike over to the Wisdom Path where you'll not only find cool split in half trees inscribed in Chinese but unbelievable views. You can spend the entire day here really taking in all of the details and history and find it to be well worth your time! I'm really happy I went!"

Located in Lantau island, you have many options to choose from if you want to go but the most interesting and touristic is by cable car. The trip is not long but allows you to see the magnificent area around and to take pictures of the Buddha from far away.Just before the Buddha, there is the Monastery and a small touristic village with lots of shops for souvenirs and some street food. The Buddha itself is located in top of a small hill and its reachable after climbing a considerable amount of steps. A big thing to consider is the weather and the time of the year to see this place. If its winter you might encounter lots of fog and if summer the heat of the day will cook you. The place has a lot of offer so take comfortable shoes, a hat and a lot of patience to walk around the surroundings and the temples. For me, its one of my favorites things to do in Hong Kong!!"

One could see the old ancient path taken by the monks many years ago (or maybe even till today) that would have taken them at least half a day to walk to the monastery. Be aware of the time of year you visit \u2013 it was very cold for us, as we were not prepared for the altitude. Once there we took a 360 degrees tour down to a fisher village that was well worth the visit albeit too short \u2013 one needed more time to look around. The monasteries were beautiful as were the surroundings: a little touristic though, but still worth seeing. The Big Buda you see on your arrival via cable car, which prepares you for its size once up close. Take deep breaths as the walk up the many steps to the Buda take your breath away in many ways than one."

The gondola line coming down is incredibly short and the view is just as spectacular going down - and you will be rewarded by coming into the station at the bottom and seeing the two hour wait when you walked on at the top.

Advise would be to buy a plastic poncho before you go up as you do get ripped off for theirs.The trip up there on the cable car was fun - again we didnt get to see much (if anything) however I understand the views are stunning. Whats more important was that we didnt have to queue hardly at all for the ride which was nice, then only shared it with 3 other people.On getting up to the village we were pleasantly surprised. There is more to do than just see the Big Buddha. There were restaurants, temples and statues. The Big Buddha itself was good too, we walked to the top and inside however not sure it was worth the money to go inside. On paying, you get a free drink and ice cream or dim sum. We chose the ice cream as we couldnt find the entrance to the restaurant - wonder if it was closed that day. It therefore wasnt worth the extra money.We then went on and walked through the back paths to the path of wisdom - this little area is very pleasant as very quiet. The paths were exceptionally muddy due to the weather but that didnt put us off.I think there were other paths to take as well, so there is plenty to do up there.Advise getting the metro to and from Lantau. It is so simple with a map and only a couple of stops away."

It really is beautiful especially in the sunlight.You can pay to go inside or just appreciate the outside for free, the climb up is intense but should be manageable for most people. There are many people selling drinks and icecream as well as souvenirs around the base of the hill and there is a nearby village where you can enjoy lunch.Go to the nearby monastery and take a walk down the \"wisdom path\" if you have time."

The 1-day trip was a refreshing change in scenery from Hong Kong Island with its mountain view and cooler weather. The walk up the fleet of stairs to the Big Buddha should be manageable although a fair amount of climbing is to be expected.Tip: You can stop by at the Citygate Outlet Mall before/after the Ngong Ping 360 ride to Lantau Island for some discount outlets shopping."

Remember to eat at the vegeterian eatery... They do serve some great food!It's recommended to come in the morning when there's less crowd, have brunch and lunch and then go down to the City Gate Shopping Mall (where all the outlets are) to shop the afternoon away.Directions: Take the MTR to Tung Chung Station. The fastest and easiest way to get up to the Big Buddha would be taking the Ngong Ping 360 cable car. Book in advance online to avoid queuing for the ticket."

It is high on a flat piece of a mountain surrounded by trees, grass, and a view of the water. If there was ever a place to bring you camera this is it, its just a wonderful place scenically.

The cable car ride itself is impressive, even for those in our party who don't like heights. Once you reach the top, there is a small village with shops catering to tourists. After a short walk, you will reach the stairs leading to the Big Buddha. As long as you are reasonably prepared, the walk up/down is not a big deal. There are many opportunities for excellent pictures in all directions when you arrive at the top. When we visited the weather was sunny and clear which made for stunning pictures (earlier in our trip, the days were overcast and rainy.) This is a must-do if you are planning to visit Hong Kong."

We (family if four with teens) got the ferry from Central then a bus up to Lantau and on the way back took the cable car to City gate which is an amazing trip.Back to the Buddha. The striking thing for us was the wonderful peaceful vibe of the whole area, the gorgeous clean mountain air and the wafting aroma of the constantly burning incense was inspiringEven though there are lots and lots of tourists visiting this extraordinary structure, there is a lovely calming feeling throughout. The steps up to the viewing platform were not as daunting as we thought and once climbed them we were rewarded with stunning views of the beautiful island. This trip in our opinion is a Hong Kong must do, and a wonderfully welcome break from the shopping and commercial intensity of Kowloon and Hong Kong Island."

But all is good, this was what I had hoped for and more.We took the cable car- 25 minutes each way, after quite a lot of travel and we should have aimed for 2 hours earlier for it was worth it. The cable trip moves you away from the industrial HK over mountainous terrain which is wooded and catches the sun beautifully. At a cable point I could see what looked like Tibetan mastiffs as outdoor guards, very exciting.On arrival you will already have seen the sculpture from some distance to get a sense of where you go on arrival. The outer area is not too spiritual- Starbucks, 3d cinema and tourist stuff. But walk on! The statues of guards, Saints, lining the walkway towards the monastery and Buddha are worth examining- and there they were- what looked like Tibetan mastiffs, snoozing under the statues.We did the trek up the steps, the statue is stunning and impressive with a small exhibition underneath.For about 35p you can buy meal tickets to eat veggie food within the monestry grounds, but we were late. I would have done this is time. The temples are lovely, beautifully designed.But what I enjoyed was the atmosphere- lovely monks, lovely calming atmosphere, happy mastiffs and some cattle pottering around. All is calm and well here, bliss."

There is a wonderful village up the top, with a range of quality souvenir stores, along with cafes and restaurants.

Tai O and Mui Wo by themselves are worth a visit and at that point you may as well tack on a stop at the Big Buddha. If you are looking to save money you can take a bus from the Tung Chung MTR Station rather than pay for the cable car.

And also pay a little extra for the crystal package cable car because lines are shorter etc. We waited in line to buy tickets almost 2 hours...afterwards it was pretty quick with the cable cars, about 15 mins, great view also!! Once across there are restrooms and restaurant. Very nice fresh air. You would definitely notice the difference in air compared to central HK or Kowloon. Very nice view. The steps are not steep and offers great interval stops to rest before reaching up. Overall, a great experience!!!!!"

Just take the subway to Tung Chung MRT station and follow the signs to the cable car station (less than 5-minute walk from the MTR station).The cable car ride offers stunning views of the sea, the airport and the city. At a certain point, the view of the big Buddha dominates the horizon, making it a unique experience.There's a lovely touristic village between the cable car station and the big Buddha statue. Before going up to the mountain top where the Buddha sits, make sure you buy a meal voucher for the monastery vegetarian restaurant as it will allow you to enter the statue and to visit the small museum, which includes a Buddha relic. This statue was inspired on the 700 year old Daibutsu (great Buddha) of the Japanese city of Kamakura, which I visited in November 2014. I can assure you that both sites are worth the visit. I found it hard to go away. I had to go up and down the stairs 3 times, as I wanted to make sure I had seen all possible angles. The view of the mountain top is fantastic too. After visiting the big Buddha, make sure you visit the Buddhist temple. Best time to go is in the morning. I advise you to take the subway at Central station no later than 8am, so you will have plenty of time to enjoy the place and still have lunch at the vegetarian restaurant and then have a coffee at the lovely village of Ngong Ping."

The walk up the stairs to the top of the Budda offers quite a hike, older folks like us had to take a couple of breaks! It was worth the view up there though, you could see for miles around. Winter time be sure to wear warmer clothes as it was windy and that just made it colder. Walk the grounds of the Temple of 10,000 Buddas, beauitful buidings with such intricate detail.

That way, you can avoid the queue for buying tickets and can go straight to the cable car boarding area. Spend the little bit extra for the crystal car (the one with the clear glass floor). It makes for a more interesting view, and because it costs a little more, the boarding line is shorter than the standard car.When you get to the other side, skip the shops (which will inundate you at first). If you want, you can buy a souvenir on the way out. If you buy a ticket for the vegetarian meal at the monastery, they will give you a pass for the museum inside the Big Buddha. I'm not much of a vegetarian, but those in my group who are thought the meal was great. Do a quick walking tour around the structures in the monastery. The ornate-ness is incredible. And then, of course, walk up the huge staircase to the Big Buddha. We were hoping to find a place to meditate there. Don't count on it. There really is no places of solitude around the Buddha.

All a little theme park in design, especially the shopping area. Its worth a look but go after you have been to the Buddha and temple. You will be offered a lunch option at the base of the buddha available at the temple. It was okay and if you don't have a lot of time worth it.

Packages are available, which include entertainment (which we did not chose).At the top are a variety of shops and eating places plus entertainment theatres.

We visited a few of the temples before heading up the steps to greet Big Buddha. Unfortunately at the time of our visit, the temples were closed off to public due to prayers in progress. But we could view the proceeding from a distance with the monks chanting endlessly. Exhaustion by the time we walked up the steps which i believe more than 200 steps. The big buddha bronze statue simply magnificent. Took quite a few photos closed up of buddha and from a distance when in cable ride. Definitely worth the visit regardless of what religion you are. Would have liked to stay back for the vegetarian restaurant which is next to the temple but running out of time. Maybe next time."

The bus will take you over the mountains and up the backside of Lantau Island to Ngong Ping Village. The ride up takes about 30-45 minutes and is the best option to get up fast. The long lines for the cable car (unreliable) require long waits. The line for the cable car down are shorter. It you are sensitive to heights do not take the cable car down - opt for the bus."

The queues for purchasing tickets on the day are extremely long."

The attraction doesn't open until 10AM but it takes ~30mins on the cable car to arrive. Would highly suggest being at the cable car station before 9:30AM. We had no wait and were able to see the statue and head back by 11AM. On the way back, there was a huge line for the cable car that would have taken at least 2 hours to go through. The statue is nice but not worth a 2 hour wait. Go early."

Reserve a full day for it and try to go with good weather. Recommendation: To get there you have to take a gondola lift (Ngong Ping 360) which offers 2 kind of cabins: a standard cabin and another one with a glass floor (crystal cabin). I strongly recommend to take the crystal cabin for one of the ways. Now the catch: take the standard cabin in the way up and the crystal on the way down. The majority of people takes the crystal on the way up and the standard on the way down, which causes some major delays in taking the gondola on the way down, take advantage of this fact to avoid huge queues on your way back."

The Buddha was the highlight of the day and is genuinely impressive. We arrived by coach at the back of the Buddha and then walked through the inside of the statue and out onto the base. The surrounding smaller statues get overlooked from a distance but are also worth seeing close up. The views from the Buddha across the valley and over the monastery are excellent. The coach conveyed us down to the Monastery which is quite impressive inside. The views back up to the Buddha, in particular along the access steps, really let you appreciate the huge scale of the monument. The assorted shops and \"attractions\" on the way to the cable car are nothing special but the cable car journey gives great views across the island and down onto the airport. The whole site is undoubtedly geared towards tourists but is non the less really impressive and well worth a visit."

We traveled by local bus from Silvermine to the big Buddha and the trip, in itself, was very pleasant and the scenery through the Lantau rural area very interesting. The Buddha is an awesome sight and as you approach the statue you become more and more aware of the sheer size of it. I also thought that it was very much a tourist thing but watching people pray and burn their sacrifices I realised that it had a very deep religious meaning for those of the faith. The Big Buddha also had a real meaning for me but not in a religious sense. I took some great photographs of Buddha and on downloading these onto my computer after returning home I was surprised to see a \"swastika\" on the chest of Buddha! I could not believe that there could be a link between this sign on Buddha's chest and the hated and feared emblem of the Third Reich. Imagine how surprised and relieved I was when my further investigations revealed that the \"swasika\" emblem has been around for many, many centuries and for many great ancient civilizations it was the emblem of good - not bad. What a relief to know that the emblem was merely copied and that those who copied it had no understanding of the true meaning. Pity that the bad association will always remain."

The ticket box opened at 10am and we lined up from 9:20am, there were about 100 people head of us. They opened the ticket box at about 9:50am and we were on the cable car before 10am, so it was really quick. The glass bottom cabins (crystal cabins) only come every 4/5 cabins so you may wait for one to come along, if you're there early then you can choose either and not wait. Go straight to the Buddha and see everything else on the way back, after all, that's what you're there for. We left at about 12:30pm and were in a cabin by ourselves, we got the 1+1 ticket which is a standard cabin one way and a crystal cabin the other, you need to decide which direction to have each cabin. I would suggest the crystal cabin on the way back as you're more likely to have less passengers meaning you'll get a better view."

I do not recommend going to the Big Buddha, friends encouraged us to go and we regrated it so much.It\u2019s overpriced, it\u2019s basically a massive Buddha statue, there was nothing cultural or spiritual about it\u2026 it was just fake and a tourist rip off. Unfortunately, if there was some interesting history to the area / statue I wouldn\u2019t know, because the experience was so irritating and underwhelming. The queues to get back were incredibly long; it was so painful waiting in line for an hour. There was so many screaming children running around, it was hot and everyone was very irritable. And that was just the line up to get out of the place. The place is full of overpriced gift shops and cheap nasty food. The one good thing is the cable ride there and back, beautiful views; however the views included smoggy air, dirty water, and rubbish along the coast line. Save your time and money \u2013 don\u2019t go!"

So, eat before you go and take your own drinks.Having got there, it's 268 steps up to the statue.There's not much to say except that it's a big statue of Buddha. However, nearby is the fishing village of Tai O. You can take a bus there from the Buddha. If anything, more worthy of a visit than the Buddha. A working fishing village where you can buy the local produce at less than town prices.

Of course, the Big Buddha in itself (whether by tram or a 1 hour bus ride) is also a must-do tourist stop for any Hong Kong visitor. I would say avoid the extra tourist packages offered by the tram company - it is easy enough to explore the monastery for free on your own in my opinion, and I'm not the sure the fishing village tour is much of a tourist draw as well."

The Cable Car ride is amazing, you are able to see the airport, the ocean, and as you continue to clim you get to see Big Buddha up in the distance. From the Cable Car Station, it is a little walk to Big Buddha about 10 to1 5 minute walk. There is a Subway by the cable car station if you get hungry. In order to get up close and personal to big buddha, you need to climb some steep stairs. Once on top you are able to go inside Big Buddha and walk around and see the surrounding scenery.

We just skipped the enormously long/serpentine queue at the Cable Car entrance.Lantau island is quite cut-off from the main island/city and is very close to the HK Airport.

If you plan to take the cable car up to the Big Buddah, pre book/ pay for your tickets as the queue is a killer. I waited for two hours to finally get a ticket on the cable car. Not a good start to what should have been a relaxing, enjoyable day. Once I got there though, it was all worth it! But there are 268 steps up to the top of the Buddah so take your time! Well worth the effort though."

The whole experience was very nice. Must take the crystal cabin ride at least one way. It is nice to see ground 100 feet below. Feels like flying over the seas, mountains and forests.The views from the cabin are excellent. You see the whole airport. And get to see planes take off and land. Great view. The climb of the big buddha is a little tiring for a fat person like me, but is sort of purifying one. I felt cleaned after the climb. It was nice to touch the Buddha and felt connected. The monastery has another temple and vegetarian restaurants.Great experience"

I usually go up with the cable car (we usually pick the crystal cabin for the \"flying\" sensation) then go down by bus. This helps to reduce the cost plus bonus view to the lake as the bus will pass this lake. This lake actually can be seen on top of the Big Buddha. Prepare some energy to climb to the top of Big Buddha, since the stairs are quite too steeps. If you're not Buddhist, you can enjoy the view. If you're Buddhist, you can see the story of Siddharta in the small museum inside the statue.There are a lot of shops and restaurants here, so don't worry to get starve in here. You should try the Gelatto shop, whose Pistaccio ice cream which is so good! From some snacks, you can drop by to Starbucks or subway.Since it's so near to the airport, you can spare some times to come by before catch your flight. You can put your luggage on the luggage locker, under the cable car station in Tung chung or at the citygate outlets nearby."

We got the meal because we wanted to try their vegetarian food, so got the entry ticket into the statue as well. They have some artwork inside the statue but it's not that impressive. Nothing you can't find at a typical asian museum. Besides, you go up to the statue for the views anyway, not to visit inside. Only get the meal if you plan on eating. Which was a pretty decent amount of food for the meal ticket.Around the statues had many other attractions. There are some nice temples with very, very detailed interiors.

This is a temple site so there are pagoda's that are beautiful, incense burning and many places to buy treasures. I stopped in a really nice 'chop stick' boutique that specializes only in decorative chop sticks. There is something in the boutique for everyone.The Big Buddah sits uniquely above a musuem but you must climb at least 300-400 steps to get up to see it. I opted not to do this feeling I could get better pictures from afar. If you have a full day and don't mind waiting in a queue for more than an hour it really is a must see. After waiting in the long lines once you reach the temple--you actually forget. I also suggest the cable ride. A day well spent!"

If you want to go inside the Buddha and a few stairs further up (the real inside, not the gift shop under the Buddha), you can have the option to buy a lunch offering at the base of the steps before you start the climb up. Keep the receipt and bring the food as an offering once you get inside. Go early so that you can take pictures of the Buddha with the sun shining at the face. If you go late, the sun will be pointing straight at your camera when you want to take a picture, which makes for poor photography.If you like to hike around, see the fishing village and give yourself a few hours for the hike.To get there, take the MTR Tung Chung line right to the end, at Tung CHun station. Most people line up and pay a lot to take the cable car for a scenic approach. If you are scared of heights or want to take the bus one of the ways back (or both ways), take the route 23 bus. It is a 45 minute ride.If you have time, go to see the fishing village. That gives a real sense of historic Lantau."

The train journey takes about 45 minutes, and then you arrive at (surprise!) another mall. Cross the street (there are plenty of signs) to get to the cable car entry location.If you know what time you want to get on the cable car, you'll save a lot of queuing time by booking online in advance. While the \"crystal cabin\" isn't really amazing, the lines are significantly shorter because some people are afraid of the glass bottom. The cable car takes 25 minutes (hope you don't get stuck in a car with super whiny people who are afraid of heights like we did) and has some really nice views.Once you arrive, pass the fake (but attractive) village of restaurants and souvenir shops, as there are plenty of authentic (and inexpensive) food options once you get closer to the monastery. We chose the \"snack\" option at the monastery, which included some delicious noodles along with a choice of two snacks (most items are baked dough filled with beans and taste the same, but whatever). The \"dinner\" option looked like a choice of a couple curries along with the snacks. Buying the monastery food also gets you inside the big Buddha, which isn't all that interesting except you end up higher up when you exit the Buddha, and the view is nice.The Buddha itself is quite impressive and worth seeing, and it's also nice to escape the crowds in Hong Kong for a few hours."

Be careful going up the steps to the Buddha, as if it is rainy as when we went, it can be slippery.Up close, the Buddha isn't awe-inspiring (compared to say the giant housed Buddha in Nara, or the reclining Buddha at Wat Po), its positioning atop the mountain makes it a small gasp sight when approaching up the cable car. It's also a nice respite from the hustle and bustle of HK and Kowloon."

If you go early in the morning, everything will be quiet and misty since only later in the day the markets will open and the tourists come storming in. The jungle too is a great place to see with stray dogs and feral cows. Don't worry, they are quite harmless (unless you walk around at night, the dogs seem to be in barking mode then).The stairs up to the Buddha are quite tedious but the view is worth it. Up at the top you can see the big statue up close as well as many other smaller statues."

There is a line to buy a ticket and a line to ride the cable car. We made the mistake of going on a Sunday at 10:30 am with no advance ticket purchase. Once we got to the ticket counter at noon, we decided to spend the extra $10 US on the Kung fu show just to get the express cable car ride and jump to the front of the line. But the Kung fu show was a hit with my 5 year old! And it was short enough that my 3 year old liked it too.The cable car has amazing views. I'm too much of a chicken to do the crystal bottom one but I bet that is very cool. They have a walking path to avoid the cable cars but the ticket agent told us it could take 4 hours to hike and what we saw of the trail looked long and steep!! Definitely not something to do with kids or when it's hot.The area around the big Buddha also had great views. The town between the cable cars and the big Buddha is really small but has stands selling drinks, popsicles, beer and other souvenirs. We did not add on the tai O fishing village or anything else but with standing in line and the 25 minute cable car ride each way, this is easily a half day event. The proximity to the metro station is nice and only a minute walk to the cable car area.I thought the views on the cable car were better than Victoria's peak."

You need at least 4 hours for this experience due to it's location, the waiting in line, the cable car transport up the mountain side, the walk to the Buddha and the climbing of the 252 stems up to the Buddha - then perhaps a meal or refreshments while you are up their prior to your return cable car trip down the mountain.BUT ITS WORTH IT!! SO DON'T MISS IT.You will need to take the metro across to Lantau Island where the Big Buddha is situated and this is a very easy journey. When you get off the metro there is a great shopping mall and eating area and the cable car station is just across the road. At certain times of day (mid morning to late lunch) you can be in line at the cable car station for up to 1.5 hours so be prepared for a long wait!The cable car trip gives an amazing view of the island and indeed the airport as it rises above the vegetation - this ride costs about \u00a312.00 per person for a return trip but it is well worth the money and remember, there is no cost involved to see the Big Buddha. The traverse to the top of the mountain takes a good 20 minutes.On arrival at the top, you can enjoy the tourist shops that are set in a superb walkway - it's really pretty and well thought out. There are well maintained washrooms along the way and several good eating houses.As you walk to view the Buddha, it is set very high and you have the choice of viewing it from the walkway or climbing the 252 steps right up to the Buddha. Either way, the experience is very good.This trip is well worth the travelling and time it takes to get here - enjoy!!"

It is one of our most popular attractions and can visited as part of a 1/2 day or full day visit to Lantau Island or as a during flight layovers due to its close proximity to Hong Kong International Airport.The Big Buddha (free to visit) was constructed between 1990-1993, the seated Buddha statue is 34 metres tall and made of bronze. It can be reached via a 268 step climb from just outside the Po Lin Monastery, for which the statue has formal ties. At the base of the statue are the Six Devas statues, each posed with unique offering to Buddha. These are attractive and worth seeing in addition to the Big Buddha statue. Views of the surrounding area from here are very good, especially on clear days. Within the Big Buddha are several halls and a viewing gallery (HK$33 includes water bottle and ice-cream). You can purchase these tickets at the bottom of the steps as you approach the Big Buddha. Within the halls you will find a Buddha relic on display, a large carved bell with buddha inscriptions, some religious artworks inside the gallery as well as information about the concept, design and construction of the Big Buddha. Tip: It is logical to further visit the Po Lin Monastery along with the Big Buddha as well to experience the Ngong Ping 360 cable car. The accompanying Ngong Ping 360 Village includes several minor, fee-based attractions as well. The most popular way to visit the Big Buddha and Po Lin Monastery is via the 25 minute Ngong Ping 360 cable car ride from Tung Chung. You can also take public bus 23 directly to the Ngong Ping Village, 3-5 minute walk to the Big Buddha statue.While on Lantau Island, you can further include visits to the Citygate Outlet Shopping Mall back at Tung Chung, the nearby Tai-O fishing village (bus 21) or Mui Wo beach and village (bus 2). If visiting to/from Central, there is ferry service between Central an Mui Wo as well. For those with layovers in Hong Kong, you can take bus S1 between the airport and Tung Chung, just outside the Ngong Ping 360 lower terminus. The bus ride is 12-15 minutes one-way. Just be aware of the cable car opening hours (10-6pm weekdays, 9-6.30pm weekends) and potential queues at both the lower and upper terminuses. Note taxi service to/from the Big Buddha is readily available at the airport but be prepared to wait for taxi service from the Big Buddha as service is far more limited there."

Once you at the end of the road you can walk past 8 pillars of wisdom engraved with knowledge (it is written in chinese). I feel even if you don't understand what's written just take the journey upto that place as that shall give you a feeling of wisdom on its own! Must visit place in HONG KONG!"

We thought our trip there would be ruined because it was raining, but it was so magical, even in the rain. We took a cable car to get there (though we would have rather taken the long scenic hike instead to experience the foresty charm had the weather cooperated). When we arrived, I was in complete awe at the enormity of the structure and the beauty it added to the city from the moment I saw it. As we approached closer and closer, the massiveness of the buddha overtook me. Walking up what felt like hundreds of steps from the base to the summit was so worth it. What a marvel to behold. Absolutely & completely breathtaking."

Take train to Central which is one stop then go to Hong Kong station and take train to Ngong Ping. This is where you get the cable car. We were cajoled by woman on walkway to buy the 360 Ngong Ping tour and we were so happy that we paid the extra bucks for this. First we plumped for the crystal cable car which has a glass bottom! This was fab as you pass over water and forest and also cause we paid for this 360 tour - we didn't have to wait in any queues which suits my partner down to the ground! The cable car journey is as good as seeing the Buddha - fantastic! Then on arrival at the top in the village we were taken on a coach tour to the fabulous little fishing village Tai O where we taken on a boat and looked for pink Dolphins and yes we did see them!! Back to the picturesque village for a walk round then back on coach to Ngong Ping Village where we then went to the monastery which felt extremely peaceful and saw the new monastery with 10,000 Buddhas - amazing. After this we went up to see the Big Buddha which was fabulous to see. The views were beautiful and the whole feeling was extremely tranquil. Back down to the village for food and some shopping then back down in the amazing cable cars. This is a must day out!!"

Ha!We took a cable car going to Lantau coming from the city and the experience was breath taking. The view of the island of HK from up in the cart was great. The ride took longer than usual cable car rides so I think the $$ they charged us was worth it. When we got to Lantau, we walked along Ngong Ping Village where there were several souvenir shops and restaurants as well as photo op sites. So if you're the selfie / groupie type of person / family, you would enjoy this site. There were also a lot of activities you can do in the village. We had lunch at one of the restaurants serving your typical Cantonese food. It was quite pricey but since it was a tourist spot, this was expected. At the end of the village, we approached the base of the Big Buddha. Some of us (elders and our 7month old baby), including myself, did not brave the 300 steps up the Big Buddha. My sister and 13 year old son and his cousins went up for photo op and sight seeing. A short distance from the base of the Big Buddha was the Monastery. Here we met monks and got a glimpse of their everyday life. This area is best because the size of the place is just right for a 1-day adventure. The walk was not overly tiring since the village, monastery and buddha were close to each other. The place offered a variety of activities that caters to people of various ages and not just for kids. I would recommend families to spend a day at Lantau Island."

We got there around 9:30 ish and walked straight in to the ticket booth. The Budda has an impressiveprofile against the sky from the cable car and is even more impressive when you get close. You can enter a hall under him and get some of his background, and for a small extra fee, you can go up and inside him. The cablecar ride is as impressive as the Budda and makes the trip well worth the money (I think around $20). The ride takes about 20 minutes and smoothly changes direction twice to get you to the peak. The super long spans and height give you some great views. There is a hiking path that will get you there, but from the cable car it looks long and really hard work, I didnt do that! If you get to Hong Kong and have 2-3 hours, take this trip."

At the top you have some necessary tourist rubbish to navigate (Starbucks, Subway etc.), but there are some pleasant souvenir shops, a museum and good toilet facilities to follow. The Big Buddha is quite majestic and there are some steps to climb to get up close and see the best views of all. Try lunch at one of the canteens adjoining the monastery where the food is prepared by monks. There are often beautiful flower displays and impressive incense coils to photograph.

But once we got through that it was definitely worth it. The views in the cable car and when you get to the Big Budda were nothing short of amazing. We ate at one if the eating places while there which was average, can't remember the bane of it though, it was one of the first ones on the left as you get there.If we didn't have the kids we would've done the other attractions while there, I think you can purchase a 3-in-1 ticket which includes visiting a fishing village or something.There are loads of steps to get to the Budda which our older kids managed no problem (wear good shoes as things not so easy) and our 2 year old (almost 3) had a piggy back ride up and down - great workout carrying an extra 12kg up and down steps!!

It's a steep walk to the top, but take your time and walk the 260 steps. However, for me, the highlight of the trip was seeing the temples. I compare them to St Peters In Rome. Three temples, one more magnificent than the next. The small town you walk through after getting off the cable car has a few shops and restaurants, but nothing special - very touristy. The crystal car was fun if you aren't afraid of heights, but you can get a discount if you book that just one way."

They've really changed this location from when I was younger, definitely for the better. Before you head up the steps, do take the time and purchase a ticket which includes a tour of the inside of the Buddha, and a vegetarian meal at the cafeteria - I suggest the luxury package as it can feed 6 people with many different varieties of vegetarian food, and you are in an air-conditioned environment. The meal ticket and tour inside is not mandatory, but I do recommend it ^_^After you walk all the way up to visit Him, you are awarded with a beautiful 360 view of part of Lantau island and statues of goddesses that praise the Buddha around Him. Underneath the Big Buddha, there is a timeline of His story, and with the meal ticket you also get to explore inside the Big Buddha, with relics/Cetiya, artifacts, and pieces of art. There are also gift shops with blessed prayer beads and other items you may invite home.Don't forget to visit the temple, and check out the HUUUUUUUUUGE incenses that they present to the gods. A beautiful place, calming (except for holidays or special occasions) and elaborate structures. Just the Big Buddha was probably 3 hours for us :)"

I found most of them took the cable car or bus up to the Buddha and return. While the cable car ride is gorgeous, especially the Crystal Car, but the waiting time could be long. For this who don't mind walking a bit, I would recommend you to hike along the cable car rescue trail. It is 5.6km long and the view is fantastic. This trail is one of the local favourite trails and signs are clear.Please be prepared for going up or down the steps and spare around 2 hours for downhill. However, even for downhill, there is still a bit uphill to do, but definitely manageable. For those who are physically fit, 2 hours would be enough for uphill and 1.5 hours for downhill. Once you reach the bottom, you will pass through a small village and a local community and you can either take a bus to subway or another 15 minutes walk."

This is a very enjoyable and long tram ride to the Big Buddha, and there is also an nice fishing village you can explore (an smell), and a beautiful monastery. We visited on a beautiful Saturday, and it seemed every tourist in Hong Kong was in line for this tram.Hot Tip - If the line is very long for the tram; you may want to pay more to ride the \"Crystal Floor\" tram cars, which are simply the same trams with a clear floor panel. They promote this option as enhancing the viewing experience, but I think the greatest advantage of taking this option is that the tram line is around 80% shorter than the regular tram line!"

I would suggest a half day as it takes a good 30mins cable ride to get to the top, or if you are a fitness enthusiast then a walking trail is also an option. The area surrounding the Buddah is very simple and a little on the dirty side, not much to see except for a monastery with impressive temples and inner design of the temples, but other than that it's about all. The stair climb up to the temple can restrain those with limited fitness as not disability access available unless you go up with a tour bus. It is more for the spiritual experience and to see the Buddah. It can get very busy."

The Buddha itself was impressive, however, it didn't feel peaceful or sacred due to the amount of tourists with selfie-sticks trying to get the best pic of themselves and the Buddha in the background. It seemed as though there were quite a few walks around the area which would have been more relaxing and enjoyable than the Buddha itself."

For those who never have enough of the shopping experience enjoy the outlet mall locate a short walk from the cable car station; you\u2019ll find all the major brands as well as high end name brands for relatively nice prices.

The Buddha is accessible by no less than 260 steps. Take your time making your way up and take in the view. Everyone looks hot and sweaty at the top so no need to worry about that.The Buddha itself is quite remarkable as are the views from the top. The surrounding temples are also worth a visit. They are beautiful and so serene and tranquil.Be on the look out for signs leading to other temples out of main tourist area.

Perhaps I just missed the 'spiritual thing'. For believers, this is obviously an awesome experience and I was well aware that fellow travellers were deeply affected by the place. The cable car there and back is well worth it, although the wait is a pain. We got it wrong by arriving late morning (one hour before we boarded). My advice would be to either arrive early at opening, or 2.30pm. By then, the crowds have dissipated and you can walk straight on (even securing a car all to yourself) and that still leaves you a good couple of hours atop (although you might have to queue to return?).

I simply love to come here, do much that every trip I will set aside a day to visit this place and the outlet mall.Out from the MTR station, on the way to the cable car station, there is a bus interchange.You can take a bus here, which is much cheaper than the cable car but there's no view. Just queue and pay by tapping your octopus card.Travelling time from my experience is about the same, cause you need to queue to purchase the cable car ticket and then queue again to board the cable car. Time spent on queuing easily takes up to 45 minutes. Unless you are willing to pay more for a \"Crystal Cable Car\" (means the 'floor' of the cable car is glass, hence it's see thru). Due to the price of the ticket, the crystal cable car usually have a very much shorter queue.Normally, I'll take bus up and take cable car down. So I get to enjoy the experience both mode of transportation.The Buddha is amazing and the view from the top is fantastic! Enjoy the view and have so peaceful moments.Done with sightseeing, you can shop around for souvenirs and eateries are around the area near the bus interchange & cable car station."

It was going over the sea/ mountains/ boats was fun. Buying this option also had a smaller Que so it didn't seem like you waited around that long. Once you get off the ngong 360 you then come to the big buddha attraction. Firstly you come to the trinket shops ( a good look around for afterwards) and you then you reach the buddha. We came of a friday morning about 12 and it was busy but obviously couldn't tell you any better times. Its a great few hours out. You get some great photos and experience some proper architecture. Theres the 12 generals before you reach he buddha and a few random dogs ( guessing owned by the shops) which were friendly enoughAll in all we loved it from the cable cart ride and views right up to the buddha and trinket shops!"

THE STATUE OF BUDDHA WHICH WAS BEEN ERECTED ON 1993 IS BEEN SURROUNDED WITH SIX STATUES OF FEMALE WHICH ACTUALLY ARE WORSHIPING THE Po Lin Monastery (buddha).There is also a pathway through the bushes from TUNG-CHUNG to The Big Buddha those who are interested to go for a trekking can choose this option.There are also certain shopping centers which offers gifts and post cards which you could buy for your loved ones. And in Hongkong you can also find Kodak team which actually helps you to get good pictures if you are intrested.It was worth visiting this place and it took a whole day for this visit it was worth and we really enjoyed."

A camera is thrust in your face as you join the cable car, and then a hard sell as you step out at the top. From then on it is trippery in the extreme, no taste at all, maybe Butlins in the UK in the early 60's! So having looked at the steps up to the Buddha and thought twice, visited the temples, we thought we would visit a tea garden and pass by the youth hostel. I should have taken photos of the signs and then more photos of the decrepit and closed buildings, which should have been demolished years ago.Don't waste your time or money!"

You are welcomed to an open area with a pricey village which i believe is purely a tourist attraction... You could miss this and head directly towards the climb to the Buddha.

Big Buddah is always a fun place to visit after all the overwhelming population of the city, you can get back a bit of peace and quiet. I've been there more than once as a local and as a tourist, here's some tips for my tourists.There's always going to be a line up to go up and to get down the cable cart (unless you get a rainy day) buy the crystal cart for back and forth trip, definitely worth skipping the line for. For rainy days, buy your poncho at the 7-eleven that's on the island...1/10 of the price from the gift shop.If you want to try some monastery food (i.e. vegetarian meal) there is no need to buy the tickets offered at the entrance of the stairs. If you walk further down the island there's a small \"buffet/fast food\". Get what you want to eat.For you to discover: across the big buddah stairs you'll see this round \"stage\" step right in the middle of it and talk out loud. Those who've done it would know ;)Have fun & enjoy!P.S. it never hurts to pay your respect and donate some money at the top of the stairs"

It is easy to get the train from Hong Kong Central to Tung Chung then take the cable car up to Nong Ping and walk to the Buddha. It is a short walk from the train station to the cable car but the queue was ridiculous as it was a Saturday. I strongly suggest you prebook the tickets online the day before to save yourself 90 minutes in the line. There is a bus you can take instead of the cable car but it takes a long time and the cable car affords terrific views even from a standard cabin. HKD150 return for an adult. The 'village' at Nong Ping is a bit naff and just an excuse for selling souvenirs and you will have lots of opportunities to buy photos of yourself on the cable car if that is your thing.The walk up to the base of the Buddha is easy but the 200+ steps to the top can be an effort on a humid hot day in Lantau. Be prepared to be sweaty afterwards! Well worth the effort though as the views are amazing. The temple at the base of the Buddha is very beautiful inside and out and there were lots of locals burning joss sticks for the ancestors and praying outside the temple. If you have a half day free in Hong Kong please make the effort to do this trip."

Once you get to the top there's still a short walk and a large number of stairs before you get to the Buddha, though there's a number of shops and cafes to entertain you.Cows walk passively around the area and incense burns around the temples.All in all a lovely day, my husband especially loved and wants to return often.if you don't enjoy heights there is a trail, albeit a longish walk.Round trip ticket in the Standard Cabin costs 150 HKD.The ticket line was extremely long, as was the line waiting to take the cable car, both there and back, but the lines do move relatively quick.I believe you can buy the tickets prior to arriving, which could probably save you quite a bit of time."

The buddha is impressive, and there is a fun climb up stairs (not too hard) to get a closer view. Big photo op for everyone. Next door is a monastery where you can eat lunch or a light meal and check out more Buddhas, light incense, pray etc. There are plenty of public bathrooms here and places to buy water, so don't worry. There are quite a few trails here too, short and long. Lantau island has plenty of other things to do, so get there in the morning and check them all out. Bonus: Tung Chung is 20 minutes from the airport (by bus S1) so you can make it a stop going in our out if you aren't hauling a ton of stuff."

I purchased the day pass for transport and this also allowed me to take in a side trip to Tai O fishing village on the same ticket. The Buddha is an engineering marvel and a very scenic place to spend some time away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Scenery, tranquility, and a pleasant day out. Walk quickly through the tourist trap village and hold on to your wallet. The prices are scandalous and further unnecessary proof that there is a prevailing opinion that tourists are easy marks and stupid with their money. Don't let that ruin the experience, just look straight ahead and keep walking to your destination and you will be fine...... ."

The bus service instead of the cable car, was an easy option and very cheap - we had our octopus cards. A typhoon (of which we were blissfully unaware) was forcast during the next 24 hours - these 2 things may have influenced the lack of crowds we were anticipating. The Buddha is amazing - not too many stairs and the view on the way is worthy of several photo breaks. Buy your ticket for the vegetarian restaurant at the monastery at the bottom of the Buddha stairs. Dont miss the Wisdom Path - an easy walk to 38 timber columns/sculpture with the buddhist Heart Sutra inscribed. The food at the vegetarian retaurant was great - 4 of us said we would never miss meat if we could eat like this evey day. We got the deluxe option, which we think meant we were inside in airconditioning which I'm sure, if it was very hot, would be a great relief. Overall great day and would recommend as a side trip from Hong Kong."

We bought some cheap souvenirs here at the fishing village and saw some authentic families in the village.

There are a significant number of stairs to negotiate to get to the base of the Buddha which can be challenging for some particularly on a steamy, hot day. If it is a clear day and a weekend - get in early! As well as the buddha, there is also a village area with some other related attractions and the Monastry. Enjoy the best part of a day there."

I recommend riding up in the regular gondola and then the taking the 360 glass bottom gondola back to get the full experience but to also avoid the long line up on the gondola on the way back as the glass gondola is a much shorter line."

The bus is a cheaper option but its like sitting in tour bus. You get to see amazing sites, though the cable ride has better view. Always carry umbrella when going there coz it is pretty hot when the sun is present. Don't pass on going up to the Big Buddha, the view is so beautiful. You can see the peaceful side of Hong Kong. A different view compared to the Sky Tower. The climb up is very tiring but think of it as a way to a healthier future (hehehe!). There is no entrance fee upon entering the whole place but there is on the top of the Buddha.There are a lot of food to be found here. So don't you worry food lovers.

MTR from Central (Hong Kong station) takes about 45mins to Tung Chung station. Arrive here earlier and enjoy lunch and shopping at 360 City Gate (where the Designer factory outlets are located) if that takes your fancy. Take the glass-bottomed cable car (it\u2019s worth it for the awe) about 3pm-ish. The cable car station is a short walk around the corner of the shopping Centre, which is immediately at the exit of the MTR. The Big Buddah park (which is free), and shops, close at 6pm, which allows enough time to walk to the Buddah, climb the steps, and enjoy the temple (but you could spend longer). However, it\u2019s a bit cooler at this time, and photo opportunities are better because of softer light and less people. Book the cable car only one-way and take the last bus (6:20pm) to the Ferry (approx. 40 mins). Ferry departs at 8:30pm. Delight in the lights of Hong Kong Harbour by night as you return. The Buddah is big and beautiful and the park and surrounds tranquil and calming. This is a must-do in Hong Kong. Make a full day of it."

The Buddha itself, which you see from afar as you approach, is 112 feet tall. It was only finished in 1993 - so, compared to much of Hong Kong's history, it is quite new. The path to the Buddha, once you arrive, is lined by 12 Divine Generals. When you pass the Generals, you will begin to climb the 268 steps to the Big Buddha. It truly is awe-inspiring. It is surrounded by 6 smaller statues, Buddhist deities, that are also lovely - and from which you will have beautiful views. There are three floors below the Buddha - the Hall of Remembrance, the Hall of Benevolent Merit, and the Hall of the Universe. Make sure to allow time to visit them.We took public transportation to get up to the Buddha, but took the glass bottom cable car back down - and that, in and off itself, was a wonderful experience!This is definitely a \"must-see\" on a trip to Hong Kong - don't miss it!"

It is a massive tourist trap, obviously built to make as much money as possible which is a bit of an insult to a non materialistic religion. As a Buddhist i didn't feel any religious connection to the site. The only monks I saw were a couple of tourists. You can see far more spectacular statues in Thailand, and they don't charge you exorbitant fees to see it. Go for the cable car trip up to get fantastic views across the islands and airport. Avoid the pressure to buy a million photos and overpriced trinkets and just go for a relaxing walk around the gardens instead."

            "review": "Day Visit. I used the cable-car up to the top and it offered some really great view and experience. One can see parts of Hong Kong that is not normally accessible to visitors unless you have someone local to guide you. The Big Buddha offers an excellent perspective to the Buddhist Philosophy if you go inside the Big Buddha itself. The walk up to the Big Buddha may not be ideal for the older folks or even those who are not sports conscious. However, if one is game for the challenge, the the way to walk up is a nice long slow walk. Once can stop at anytime to savour the scenery and take a rest as well. Once you are up at the time, take your time to walk around and to go inside the Big Buddha to have a look.Do remember to bring an umbrella or hat if you are going during the summer, also plenty of sunblock will be a good idea too as there is not much shades around. I f you are planning on visiting the Big Buddha, the ideal time whether it be using the cable-car or bus is to go as early as possible. This will allow one time to really walk around, to digest every attraction and to see what is available without the need to rush things through. There are plenty of places to sit down for a drink or a meal as well as of course things to buy."

It was nice to see the view below from the cabin, we got to see the clear blue sea and some forest. However, it's quite expensive from the normal cabin, so my recommendation is better take the crystal cabin when going up as you can take photos and enjoy the view below and take normal cabin when going down as you probably be tired from the hot weather. Check out the Ngong Ping 360 website as they usually have some promotion."

To get there, take the MTR to Tung Chung station then get the spectacular 6km long cable car to the Buddha. If you're not scared of heights, pay a bit extra to get a 'crystal' car - i.e. with a transparent floor. The return trip for a crystal car cost HKD$235 (about USD$30) and was definitely worth it. The scenery on Lantau Island is stunning and the Buddha itself and the associated monastery are beautiful. A great half day trip."

The cable car ride to the Big Buddha was my favorite part. We paid a little extra for the glass bottom cable car and it was worth it. The lines were very long for the non-glass bottom cable cars but were very short for the glass bottom (not really sure why). The time saved was very much worth the money but even if there was no time saved, it was still worth it. The views were fantastic. The walk to the Big Buddha was about 10 minutes and you go through a bunch of shops selling souvenirs (reminded me a little of Disney World). But, we liked it and we even had a good meal which surprised us. The Big Buddha itself is just OK but good. There are some pretty gardens around there. It was a good use of 3 hours of our time."

Inside the Big Buddha are relics and a museum showing how this mega-structure was created. After having some pictures and quiet time at the Big Buddha, it is now time for lunch. There are a lot of vegetarian restaurants to choose from around the area of the monastery.On our way back to Tsim Sha Tsui, we took a bus from the Po Lin Monastery to Tung Chung.

The cable car itself was well worth the cost and we upgraded to a crystal cabin with a glass floor, no good if you do not like heights. The trip is lovely and last at least 40 minuets providing you with some great photography shots. I must stress it is worth paying the extra for the crystal cabin if you do not like queuing as this is the case from both sides. The big buddha is spectacular as is also the grounds around the area.

The views from the top are spectacular on a clear day. Can be quite windy up there too so dress appropriately and with good walking shoes. The aerial tramway was opened when we were there so that is another option. It actually travels across the sea so it is an entirely different experience for those game enough to try it. With the 3 kids, we opted not to do it this time. Once back down on the ground, after visiting the buddha, there is another temple on the opposite side. It was a Sunday when we went so lots of locals around praying and worshipping. Huge incense were being burned in and around the area. Lovely gardens surround the complex.

The cable car ride is about 20-30mins and shows you some really amazing scenery and photo taking opportunites so a completely see through cable car is amazing. Get there at least an hour before opening to avoid long queues or you can take the bus which circles the mountains and goes along the ocean front. There is also a \"Special\" kiosk or ticket stand which sells the VIP tickets. You can skip the lines and go straight to the front of the queue for an additional cost.  The buddha itself is amazing!!! bring a bottle of water during autum/summer for the stair climb though. There's also a functioning buddhist monastary on site and they have vegetarian-only restaurants which have some unique but non-the-less tasty food which is a must try. The Ngong Ping Village where the cable car drops you off has all the modern amenaties and modern shops as well for your souvenirs. There is a starbucks and subway too. The Village is also the starting point for the Tai-o village tour if you got that in a ticketed package. Tai-O is a remnant of the old fishing life of the island before commercial fishing took over. There's still plenty to see. Definately a must for a HK visitor. It's probably a day tour for the newcomer. Also, as a tip - If you're catching the MTR train it drops you pretty much at a Direct Factory Outlet type mall :) So you might want to consider that in the planning. Outside is where the busses and cable cars up to the mountain."

We caught a taxi (blue) directly from the airport and were able to check our luggage at the base for 70HKD. We rode the crystal cabin up and down. The views were awesome and we got a clear day. Once we reached the top, it was immediately like an amusement park; too overly commercialized for us. Big Buddha and the monastery were what we enjoyed. There's also the wisdom path and a hike beyond that if you're interested. I think it was around 200 stairs to get up to Big Buddha and everything is spread out, so wear comfortable shoes!"

The statue is divided into three floors. The bottom is the memorial area where individuals and/or families can purchase a memorial for a loved one either living or deceased. The memorials are rented for a ten year period for 50,000 HKD. Families are given the option to renew it after ten years. The second floor has art works and the depiction of the life of Buddha and the third floor is simply the altar with the crystal containing the bone fragment from the Buddha provided by the Temple in Sri Lanka. Outside the Buddha statue are statues of the six women each with their gift for the Buddha. I took a guided tour and the bus dropped us off at the Buddha. We did walk down the stairs to the monastery area for lunch, but it was an easy walk down. There are some great views and photo opportunities not only of the statue, but also the surrounding mountains and ocean.There are souvenir shops and restrooms at the bottom area and going toward the cable car."

Although the walk up the stairs looks short, actually given the heat it was quite hard work, so I'd recommend you take some drinking water with you!At the top you get a great view of the surrounding countryside and there are the ubiquitous tourist shops selling ice cream, water and souvenirs! The statue is really very large and impressive close up and set amongst some beautiful gardens. There is a museum inside it which charges to enter, however, I believe there is a large cut that goes to the local monastery!Well worth the hike, but remember to pace yourself!"

We saw people below us hiking towards the Big Buddha. When you finally arrive at your destination, you see a modern white (buildings) village. These buildings are where you find the public toilets, ice cream parlors, souvenir stores, etc. I recommend purchasing some of the street food after the village section. Follow the path up, and you will arrive at the Big Buddha. After you have ascended the stairs, you will see the magnificent views!

The tour included a bus trip, a boat trip and a trip to the village. Well woth the investment in my opinion. The cable car is awesome, it really is beautiful, the views are amazing. Staff generally speak English and Chinese. The gift shops sell up market stuff, but this comes at a price. The Big Buddha is HUGE, and involves a huge climb to get there. It is worth it and it looks more difficult than it is. A fun day out, it closes quite early (7pm), you can stay late and get a bus back but my guide told me that everything closes anyway and there will be nothing to do so I took the cable car back which I had already paid for anyway."

I have been to Hong Kong a few times and decided on this visit to leave my partner at the airport and go to visit the Big Buddha whilst they went onto work. This was a great idea and I had a super day. So pick up an 'octobus' card at the airport.You go to the bus terminal to the right of the taxi rank and get the S1 bus to Tung Chung. Its easy to know when you get there.Then you have a choice of the cable car, but today was cloudy and there was a long queue (and the online tickets were fully booked) and you have a choice of 2 buses #23 goes to Big Buddha and you CAN use your Octopus card, although I wasn't sure initially. Then enjoy the 30-40min trip, the bus has 2 seats one side and 3 seats the other side so quite tightly packed.The drop off point to Big Buddha is very obvious and easy and off you go. I went up the steps to the Buddha and discussed with the ladies selling tickets a lunch (they have a list of whats served) and a museum ticket. Lunch is served in a restaurant away from the Buddha and to the left of the monastery and past the washroom block. There also appeared to be a snack cafe and you probably could get a combined snack and museum trip as well., you will notice it as it has bright yellow tablecloths and if you have your blue docket/ticket in your hand they will come rescue you and put you at a table revive you with a large pot of tea and a pot of soup. it's a vegetarian restaurant and the food is more local, but I enjoyed it. a Small bowl of the soup is advised (an acquired taste!) and I enjoyed the vegetables and rice enthusiastically.I had bought some incense sticks ($10HK/ >\u00a31) as I got off the bus and passed some shops and I lit them and planted them in the designated areas and knelt and spent time thinking of a close relative have surgery that day. It felt good to do that and spend time thinking about my family. Then I trekked up the 200 steps to Buddha and it is lovely view, made more interesting with the ominous black clouds and mist enveloping us. I then went into the little museum inside of Buddha and was interesting, but make sure you look at the glass displays at the edges as I saw many people walk round in less than a minute and didn't see the scripts written in Blood!! or read that Big Buddha was built to unite Hong Kong China after the 30 years of separation.When I exited, the forecasted rain and ominous clouds unleashed the rain. I had a poncho and umbrella so rolled up my trousers and waded through the river of rain. The shops do sell ponchos but you have to get to them! So come prepared if rain is predicted.The bus back to Tung Chung is through this makeshift town/village of shops. It was a shame it was so wet I didn't stay to browse, but plan to come back on a clearer day to take the cable car trip which goes to the shopping village.Look out for the bus depot it is on the left as you walk through the beginning of the village, after the first few shops. There is a bus back to Tung Chung, but unlike me you are probably heading back to Hong Kong Central I caught the bus to Star ferry Terminal at Mui Wo. I'm sorry I can't remember the number of the bus but its the first stop on the far left. Again you can use your octopus card to hop on, I think there is a bus every 20mins.Again, its obvious where you get off and the star ferry is directly opposite you and it goes to 'Central' terminus on the Island. You use your octopus card to get you on the ferry and settle back and relax, its about a 25 minute journey. If the gates are open then get on the ferry, no loitering, as it will go without you!Once at Central you can get the MTR to your destination (follow the signs) or a taxi whichever you prefer.I would say there is building work with scaffolding, happening at the Po Lin Monastery, near the restaurant, but Big Buddha is not affected at all. These works will continue for some time. There is also a Ngong Ping 360 ticket which get you on the buses, cable car and to Tai O the fishing village. www.np360.com.hk but I decided after a 5am get up and 4 hour flight I had done enough. I will go back and do the fishing village next trip from the airport again."

Anyway when you're there, there are a lot of steps to climb but you can see the Buddha from far off so it's pretty awesome. It's free to climb up and enter the Buddha but if you want to enter the museum of some sorts you have to get a meal ticket which also entitles you to a meal at their restaurant. As usual with most tourist spots things sold are overpriced but the temple cafe sells pretty good vegetarian food and snacks. So I'd recommend that."

If you want to visit the Big Buddha you should buy in internet an affordable 1 day ticket at http://www.np360.com.hk/ for 225 HKD to avoid a 3 hour wait in the queue. With this you can pick the cable car in Tung Chung, taking a fantastic 5.7 km bi-cable ropeway, to near the Big Buddha, after you can go by bus to Tai O, a little fishing village where you can take the included boat excursion to see the village and also explore it by foot. At the turning back you should go to the Buddha explore all in the neighborhood and turning back at the end of the day. It\u00b4s great and not expensive!"

The crystal cable cars have glass bottoms for about 100 HKD more. The standard car is $150 HKD round trip. Once you reach the Buddha there's about 200 plus steps to it's base. It is a really big and beautiful statute, surrounded by other statutes. Simply breath taking. There is a fee to go into the museum located beneath the Buddha. I arrived at 9:00 when it opened and there were no lines and less crowds. There are eateries and souvenir shops as u approach it. Returning, I noticed a long line at the cable cars. Get there early!! I definitely recommend this attraction."

The meal that comes with the ticket was vegetarian and also very substantial for what they call a 'snack' --- easily a lunch.

You had to get the bus up from the ferry and when you arrived there was a monastery and a big buddha. This time I got the cable car, as it was not too far from my hotel at the airport, and arrived at a mini-disneyland! The cable car is good although I can't see the point of the glass bottomed cabins. The views are all around, not down at your feet. Save your money and get the standard cabin. The raft of tourist shops that now greet you at the end of the cable car are perhaps a sign of the times. I'm glad I went 20 years ago and saw it unspoilt. However, this isn't the only sight to get this treatment. The buddha itself is the same as ever. There are a lot of stairs to climb to get to the top and they can be quite crowded sometimes. So maybe not easy with young children. We went during a very hot period in Hong Kong and it was nice to feel a cooling breeze when walking round the buddha. I'm not sure I would go back again, I prefer to remember my first visit. However, if you have never been it's worth a visit."

The wait for the crystal car was almost as bad as the line for the regular one, because it is about a five to one ratio of regular cars to crystal ones.Even though the concierge at our hotel told us the crystal cars were air conditioned, that was not true. And on a steamy late July day, the sun shone in the windows from all sides, creating an oven. It was unbearable. And though called a crystal car, that not so, the only difference between them and the regular cars was the floor was glass. The ceiling was not, so you might want to reconsider your options before spending the extra bucks. The views approaching the Budda were great.Then you arrive at Ngong Ping and it is as if you step out of the cable car in a fake amusement park of a village, with every type of fast food joint and cheap souvenir shop. It was laughable.The Budda is still an awesome sight, and the steps are difficult, especially on a very hot summer day. Sadly the monastery was under construction and all that was visible was scafolding."

It sits peacefully above it all and can be viewed from far away as you approach, right up the long stairway (almost 300 steps I think) right at the foot of the statue - larger, way larger than what you'd expected. Known officially as Tian Tan, the statue is of the seated Buddha made of bronze. It faces the mainland.But the overall experience was bland a best. Yes, there's a nice little monastery next door, and a street full of eateries and souvenir shops, but we were kind of not blown away at all. The monastery is worth a visit, specially if you are in a peaceful contemplative mood, and you can quietly stand back and watch one of the services in progress \u2013 beautifully held together by a live soundtrack of monks chanting. That's worth it.We had taken the ferry from Pier 6 to the Mui Wo Ferry Pier on Lantau Island, and then Bus No 2 to the site. On the way back we decided to take the train (MTR) back instead \u2013 which was quite nice because you get to see the large super mall with all the 'outlet' stores. Hong Kong residents often make a trip to the mall (long MTR trip), but it was on our way. Do note that you could take the cable car from Tung Chung MTR, but we opted for the cheap and cheerful bus option.There is a ticket if you want to visit the museum at the top, and the fee covers a vegetarian meal at the temple cafeteria. We did not take this option. Tip: Do NOT go there on a weekend, when it is very crowded, and even transportation tickets are much more costlier.Lantau Island apparently has a lot of other places one could see, but we were tired and the Big Buddha experience of about an hour there wasn't really enough reward for the long journey to and from. But then as they say in zen, the journey, the Buddha viewing, is the reward."

We used a coach on the return trip and I would recommend this over a cab.I enjoyed my visit to the Big Budha. The views were spectacular. We could see clouds on adjacent peaks and at one stage become completely engulfed in one as it moved over the Big Budha. Where you get dropped off by coach/taxi is a small \"village\" comprising numerous shops, specialty shops, restaurants/cafes and food outlets. From here, there is a 5-10 minute walk to a set of steep stairs which lead to the Big Budha. The walk and stair climb are fine if you are relatively fit but may not be for the unfit/very young/ frail/elderly.You can walk up the stairs to the Big Budha for free, however, if you want to go inside and look at the museum you need to buy tickets at the bottom of the stairs. Tickets are cheap and include an icecream & water. I wouldn't visit twice but once was pleasant, relaxing and peaceful."

We were already on Lantau Island as we'd spent the morning at Hong Kong Disneyland (a morning was all my husband could stand), so we decided to go see the Big Buddha. A friend of ours who lives in Hong Kong offered to take us anywhere we wanted BUT the Big Buddha, as he'd seen it a million times and it was \"just a big statue\". So we made our way, not expecting too much.We bought the cable car tickets that entitled us to a glass floor, which was quite terrifying and I wish I realized just how high the cable car goes! And how long the ride is! If you're afraid of heights or small enclosed spaces, this is not for you (I closed my eyes a lot of the way). The views are stunning though! So, yes, it's a Big Buddha. Very big. There is a nearby monastery (the Po Lin monastery) and a little tourist village popped up below the statue, so you can walk through the shops and get some food. It seemed a little 'tourist trap' to us but everyone seemed to be enjoying a street performance. We wandered through the shops and up to the statue, but you have to purchase tickets to actually climb up the steps and go inside. We were exhausted (it was also summer and extremely hot/humid) so we just took some photos, waved at the Buddha, and headed back.Going there, you can have individual cars per group, but going back they cram you in together (with no AC) so you get to know everyone in the car! The ride seemed quicker going back.It's a bit of a journey to get there (isn't it all about the journey?) but it was a fun excursion; something different to do! If you haven't been, make sure to give it a try when you're in Hong Kong. If we spend more than a few days in HK on our next trip, we will probably go and actually make it to the top this time!"

Top tip - take the normal cable car up (its the same view on the way back after all!) and opt in for the glass bottomed on the way back. There's a shorter queue for both (people tend to glass bottom-it on the way up!) and we got our own to ourselves on the way back down!"

Thankfully the Chinese people in Hong Kong are generally very polite, so it was not altogether annoying. However, was this worth the wait? I have to say yes. Seeing the Buddha coming up close from the hills in the cablecart was just amazing. And especially going back, when the sun was setting, it was a beautiful sight. If I can make one very important recommendation: if there is a long queue, take the crystal cabin. It might not make a difference on the way up, but the line for the crystal cabins going down is way, way shorter. The difference between a crystal cabin and a normal cabin is the glass bottom. I actually thought that was kind of fun, but going down I was very content with my choice."

We found it much more enjoyable than expected as we've seen various Buddhas around Asia and thought it would be a same old kind of thing. Overall, the visit took about 3.5 hours including the wait time, cable car and a quick run up the Buddha staircase. We got there at about 2pm on a Saturday. The cable car was HK$150 round trip and took about 20 minutes. It was a pretty scenic ride, if you like that sort of thing. We are not great lovers of heights so it was more of a means to an end. Up in the Buddha village, it was quite commercial, with souvenir shops everywhere and even Starbucks. The Buddha itself Was neat. If you are fit enough to make it up the stairs, it's truly amazing to stand under the Buddha and grasp just how HUGE it is. For a \"cultural\" experience in HK, it's worth a visit."

After some investigation we chose the MRT to go Lantau Island from HK Island (you can also take the ferry to Discovery Bay, then take the bus there). The MRT lets you off in a little village with a shopping mall and the cable car is right there. We arrived early, about 15 minutes prior to opening (check to see what time it opens - 10AM I think). There was a very small cue, so we really had no wait. We chose the crystal floor cable car (a little extra but fun to see the ground as you take the 1/2 ride up to the village). Luckily it was a beautiful sunny day, so we could see everything! Once you arrive in the little village - it is very commercial with souvenir shops, follow the walkway through the arches to the temple which is worth the visit, then take the steps leading to Buddha (they were not hard to do at all). When you get up there the view is beautiful. There is a vegetarian restaurant up there and more souvenir shops. The nice thing about this attraction is that it can be done in 1/2 a day. So you can have lots of time to explore HK Island in the afternoon. Choose to take the bus/ferry back to HK."

The site has been commercialised into a type of theme park and their is a mock traditional village which is good. Plenty of food and refreshment venues available.you can take the glass bottomed cable cars at a higher cost but personally I dont think it is necessary as you get great views in the other cars.

The weather was pretty bad during our trip - very humid, foggy, and even raining - and that most definately contributed to the gloomy atmosphere. The climb to the top was not as bad as I expected and the view was amazing. The Big Buddha itself is truly impressive but the insight was so very touristy. the reason why this place is getting four instead of three stars is because of the lift to the temple. The lift is very high and goes over the island. It provides for an amazing view and is an experience of itself. All in all, I would say that if you have extra time, you should visit."

Once you get over the fourth (I think) section, you are surrounded 360 with beautiful mountains, out pops the Budda from the hill tops. And then it all seemed worth while. My only regret was we did not spend enough time there. We were rushed as had other commitments, definitely book half a day aside to look in the the lovely shops and soak up this magnificent Budda, energy and scenery. If there was only one thing I could do in HK this would most certainly be it . It beats the peak by miles, spacious and not such a tourist commercial trap.

This is an amazing journey as you have incredible views the entire time and it is very peaceful and serene. We went on Sunday morning, and the lines were not too bad around 10am. The \"village\" near the Buddha is touristy, but it's China, so if you are from the USA, even the touristy Chinese things are still interesting and different. We had a meal in one of the restaurants there, and it was pretty good. The steps to the top of the Buddha shouldn't bother anyone who is in even remotely decent shape, although many people aren't...There are also some great views of the surrounding mountains and sea from the Buddha.

The Big Buda is on the top of a mountain reachable by sky chairs, get the crystal one, it has transparent floor and you can have a total view of the island. Which is very beautiful. Or you can get the bus. When there, you can walk through all kinds of little stores and buy their souvenirs. I would just hold on till getting to the top because you can buy lots of Budas or amulets and help the temple. Then you are going to cross a place with all the Chinese zodiac warriors. Very nice. Finally the thousands of steps toward the big statue. And when you reach the top the view is incredible and if you believe in energy, get ready to recharge there. One of the most impressive places I have ever been. If you are in Hong Kong, don't miss it."

            "review": "Come in the Morning. The Big Buddha statue is quite impressive in itself, but this place is about much more than just the statue; When you climb up the stairs to the Buddha, you will be treated to a view almost impossible to see elsewhere in Hong Kong: green mountains in every direction, with small Chinese-style building protruding from the forests once in a while. It's hard to describe a more picturesque landscape.i recommend coming in the morning, because in the afternoon it will be practically impossible to get a picture near the Buddha (the sun will be directly against the camera). In the morning there might be similar problems with other views, but at least you will be able to stay for a few more hours if you want to. Make sure to visit the Po Lin Monastery and the Ngong Ping village downhill.The only downside is that getting to the Big Buddha can be quite expensive: the cable car is a tourist trap (although convenient), while the bus is more expensive than most other buses in Hong Kong, plus there are no free transfers, so you will have to pay for each fare as you get there (subway transfers, etc.) which makes the trip heavy on the wallet by Hong Kong standards. Still, the place is definitely worth spending a few hours in."

You got to choose the right time and weather to do this trip and preferably on a weekday to avoid the crowd. We were lucky that everything fell in place. Big Buddha looks magnificent irrespective of where you see it from. The service was good the place is kept tidy. This whole trip takes about 3-4 Hrs. There are many restaurants and souvenir shops. Once you reach the Big Buddha climbing the stairs you can have 360 degree panoramic view from the hill top and the view is fabulous. You need to buy ticket to see the artifacts kept under the Big Buddha. You could avoid that part to save time and money unless you have keen interest in them."

We also went to the Wisdom Path, just a little down the road from the monastery, and it was also well worth the extra effort.

Once you get there, the views are worth it!Located in Lantau Island, easy to get from a boat from Central Pier or go on the Hong Kong Island MTR line and get off at Tung Chung stop. You can either get the number 23 bus or take the Ngong Ping cable car up. The latter has a standard cabin or the glass bottom (Crystal) cabin - prices for the Crystal cabin are much more and personally don't feel it's worth it (maybe if you are take over the cabin with friends/family - seats up to 8 adults).The view by cable car is breathtaking - takes over 40mins and arrives at Ngong Ping Village (an artificial tourist village selling overpriced souvenirs). As well as the Big Buddha, go and visit Po Lin Monastery and don't forget to try out the delicious vegetarian food - especially the tofu with the sweet syrup.Note - go early as you'll avoid the tourist groups - it was getting very busy even when I arrived just after 10am.I'm certain there is wheelchair access / lift even to the top of the Buddha as I saw a group of elderly and disabled people all in wheelchairs so there must be a way up - worth checking before hand though."

We didn't stay long. The village at the cable station was well designed. I think a shaded sidewalk is welcome from the station along the way to the Buddha steps. For a major tourist spot, a nicer restroom should be considered."

At the top it was very misty and made the viewing less ideal. There is a few hundred metre walk from the cable car to the steps to the Big Buddha and is lined with shops and small restaurants.The walk to the top is a challenge but well worth it (its quite steep so even coming down isn't totally easy!). At the top you are amazed how large the Big Buddha is and I would imagine on a good day the view across the valleys below is great (not so good for us).Well worth the visit."

At 10am you have the place almost to yourselves but by noon it is packed. The nunnery is undergoing lots of renovations, so not much to see, but still worth seeing the buddha. Very similar to the feel at the Statue of the Redeemer in Rio. The steps are not for the faint of heart--lots of steep steps and in the heat and humidity it is quite a climb."

The ride takes 25 minutes and offers spectacular views, however it is unnerving if you are afraid of heights. There is a bus service that will take you and it takes 40 minutes each way. I found this out after we made the round trip on the cable car. LOL. My family really enjoyed the ride and making fun of me. I have to admit that the views are stunning. There are restaurants between the train station and the cable car that offer a wide variety of places to grab a quick meal. Once you arrive at the top of the mountain, there are some shops and restaurants there as well. There a 2 main attractions are the monastery and the Big Buddha. There are a lot of steps to climb to visit the Buddha but is definitely worth the climb. You are literally in the clouds. It is a tremendous view and should not be missed on any visit to Hong Kong. Our teenage kids really liked it and we enjoyed seeing the monks praying inside the base of the Big Buddha. "

Take either. Pls note there is separate queue for these- Cable ride is fantastic (never experienced it before, although Genting in MY comes closer to it) . It takes good 20-25 mins on the cable. - While you are on the cable car , look around you can see airport , Forest area and portion of sea as well- Do take care some warm clothes for small kids as it might get little cold at the top- We took ticket for temple ( which is at the base of Buddha Statue )- There is good veg restaurant and couple of shops ( Given a village Concept ) at the topThis is great place of anyone.

In previous years I did not visit as my kids were too small and I didn't fancy having to carry them all the way up to the top! So this year was the first time I had visited for many years (I went once before I had kids).We went by bus from Tung Chung as we didn't fancy the cable car (there have been many cases of the cable car stopping and people being suspended for hours and hours).It is lovely and calm here, and although there are still a lot of people you don't get the agro you do in the city. The kids loved racing up the steps (I was way behind them!), and we all had an ice cream from the shop at the shop whilst admiring the scenery. It's easy to forget that Hong Kong is actually lush and green when you are in amongst the tall buildings. You can go to the top level of the building (the base of the statue) via the inside staircase, but remember to be quiet as these upper levels are the memorials for a lot of people.Well worth a visit."

The secret is all about getting there early, and I mean real early. Here's how to get the most out of your Po Lin visit without the aggravation and heat of the usual trail:1) Catch the Mass Transit to Tung Chun. I recommend getting the first one of the day.2) Exit the MTR at gate B and walk about 200 metres to the bus stops (it's easy, just follow the crowd as most will be locals - you may be the only non local tourist at that time!) DO NOT DAWDLE as you don't want to be at the end of the bus queue as you may miss a seat3) Join the queue for the New Lantao Bus number 23. The schedule is easy to find online. I think I waited about 10 minutes for the first bus of the day at 7.154) Sit back and enjoy the ride. It will take about 45 minutes to the top. It's a winding road but very picturesque trip.5) Arrive up top about 8am, and then go exploring the mountain trails in the cool of the morning with just a few local tourists6) Buddha opens at 10am so be one of the first to go up and check it out7) Hop the cable car and return back down to the amazement of those in the mile long queue waiting to go to the top.8) Be back at your hotel sipping cocktails by midday!Option B is to join the endless cable car queue to go and then be on top of the mountain during the heat of the day with hordes of tourists. Now which way sounds more relaxing?"

Visited The Big Buddha while in Hongkong with my wife in July 2012.The Big Buddha Monastery is not only a beautiful place, but also a very special spiritual location for whoever is on a spiritual development path. It is also the resting place of many. The Buddha siting on top of this mountain was a sight but also to experience eating at a monastery and dining on vegetarian was a good experience.Once you arrive at the Tung Chung (MTR) station, you have two options to reach the Big Buddha. 1. Pay $125 HKD for a round trip cable car ride up to the top, which would be fun on a clear day. 2. Pay $17.20 HKD for a 30-40 minutes bus ride up to the top which can be quite thrilling on the narrow roads.Once you arrive, you can choose to climb up to the Giant Buddha or purchase a vegetarian meal at the monastery and enter the museum. We did both.The climb up is approximately more than 250 steps, i lost count halfway. The view from the top is really magnificent. There are 3 floors beneath the Buddha statue: The Hall of Universe, The Hall of Benevolent Merit, and The Hall of Remembrance. One of the most renowned features inside is a relic of Gautama Buddha, consisting of some of his alleged cremated remains. Only visitors who purchase an offering for the Buddha are allowed to see the relic, in order to leave the offering there. There is a huge carved bell inscribed with images of Buddhas in the show room. It was designed to ring every seven minutes, 108 times a day, symbolizing the release of 108 kinds of human vexations. In the Giant Buddha, we also saw our idol, Ms Anita Mui's tablet.For your information, if you are there, please do try the vegetarian meal, its really good."

I was very excited, which multiplied by 1,000 when I saw the statue. It was hard not to run up the steps. Once I was up at the base of the. Big Buddah my legs shook from excitement, I wasn't sure if it was the awe of this giant wonder or because I'd seen this on Amazing Race and thought I should run around looking for my clue!  The day we visited there was rain coming, we chose not to take the tram but went by bus.. As we approached Buddah there were low clouds, and he appeared thru the clouds as we climbed the steps. Very Mystical.. And very cool!The walk up really is not that bad. Take a Motrin in the morning, don't let that hold you back. The vegetarian lunch apwas wonderful. It was light and easy.  We got to see the shopping village, eat a vegetation lunch and take our time. On our way down, we were able to stop and tour the fishing village and catch another bus to the main entry of the park. We spent 2-3 hours walking the grounds and to the Big Buddah. In the shopping village you can buy some nicer gift items, see a movie about The. Buddah and we highly recommend visiting the Tea House Shop (by the building the tram p/up and drop/o is) they sell teas and servers, but they will also do a free tea demonstration at your table of you order tea. We ordered and got little pineapple cakes. Total cost was $12 USD.We spent 1.5 hours at the fishing village. Check out the cafe with all the cats walking around inside... Pretty funny!NOTE At the airport you can buy the express pass which allows you to ride the taxis, bus & subway system. And includes a rride back to the airport. Best deal. Don't get a taxi... Traffic sux you will pay a lot and move no where or be driven in circles till you say, Hey you just drove in a circle twice ya know!"

If you do nothing else out of city center, at least get out of town to the Big Buddha on Lantau Island. A local recommended headed out by bus and I found that both easy and efficient from the city (Google it) The steps once there are not for the faint but the statues along the path to them and the view up provide some great pictures plus you'll have plenty of company stopping along the way up to rest. (Take a photo when you and you can pretend that's the only reason you didn't sprint up! View from the top is awesome plus you can walk around inside as well to see interesting exhibits which doesnt take long so don't just walk around the outside. Take the cable car ride back down and pay the extra to get a Crystal Cabin Cars with glass floors for the real adventure view. End of the ride is in a village that is good for a water or rest room break but otherwise seemed to be modeled on the US theme park habit of dumping passengers into a big souvenier buying opportunity! Sure, there will be crowds on nice days and the shops at the end detract a little, but this truly is a once in a lifetime place to see..Don't miss it!"

The cable car ride is spectacular - Crystal Cabin Cars have glass floors, which for an additional cost enhance the experience - provided you do not suffer from vertigo! Passengers alight in a village which some people find interesting but is largely a \"shopping opportunity\" in my opinion, although there are places to eat if required. You need to be fairly fit to climb the steps up to the Buddha but this is not strictly necessary to enjoy the experience (although the views are spectacular!) The adjoining Po Lin Monastery is also beautiful.The nearby Wisdom Path is worth a look and for those feeling like a real challenge, this is an excellent starting point to climb Lantau Peak, the highest point on Lantau Island and Hong Kong's second highest peak!Highly recommended!"

At the base of the stairs, you will see a place where they sell you tickets for vegetarian lunch. If you are interested to touch the Big Buddha then a ticket for vegetarian lunch is the only way. Otherwise they will not allow you to climb right to the top, at par with the statue. You will only be allowed to climb up till the base of the statue.

Though we could not get a nice shot of the Big Buddha from the foot of the mountain, but the foggy and misty weather gives one a different kind of experience to it. A lady asked if we wanted to visit the museum inside the Big Buddha as there is a separate fee to it. We chose not to pay for the entrance fee to the museum.We went to the Heart Sutra, Po Lin Monastery, Big Buddha and the Ngoh Ping village and we spent around 3 hours."

There are 2 versions of the tram; 1 with glass all around including the bottom and one without.As you enter the tram there's a photographer that takes your photograph. You can purchase that photo as well as others once you get off of the tram up the mountain. The ride up the mountain is about 15 to 25 minutes. 30mins tops!There are number of shops, vendors & eats once you're up there.The Big Buddha is truly big! Be sure to wear flats as you have to climb steps. Not as bad as it sounds/looks once you stop to take pics :0) Also wear light clothing as it's very, very muggy and at times very windy! Just below the Big Buddha there are many other views and sites that you can take in."

It's a beautiful place and so picturesque, especially when it's nice outside. My advice: book tickets online the day before for the glass bottom gondola -- return trip only. To get there, take the ferry to Mui Wo from Central Pier; then a bus to the Buddha from Mui Wo. OR, you can take the MTR and gondola both ways. I prefer the first to get to see different views along the routes. Once there, try the vegetarian meal at the monastery and do yourself a favor and do the walk behind the Buddha to a very beautiful public art piece with lovely mountainous views. (I skip the commercial \"mall\" but you have to pass through it to get to the gondola. You might like it, though, especially if you like to shop for souvenirs.) Enjoy!"

If you have the option, consider taking the bus one way, and the cable car the other. While the cable car really is stunning, the bus ride is a fascinating look into the non-touristy part of Lantau Island. It takes about 50 minutes, but it's cheap as chips. A very nice little 'village' has popped up at the top of the mountain, around the cable car station. A few little shops, cafes, ice cream shop, etc. Surprisingly (to me anyway), prices are the same as the rest of HK, and have not been inflated for location. The Buddha itself is impressive, with lots of interesting photo opportunities. We were luckly enough to have 20 minutes of sunny, blue skies followed by an hour of clouds and drizzly rain and fog, so our photos are quite dramatic.Allow 2 hours for a quick visit, up to 4 hours at a more relaxed and through pace."

I think its the whole experience that counts towards it - taking the long gondola ride from Tung Chung and soaking up the scenery, walking the gong ping village (which of course has just become a commercial space) and then out towards the buddha itself. Absolutely you need to climb all the stairs up to the buddha, as well as up the buddha itself to take in the surroundings. Once you are finished up at the buddha, also be sure to stop in at the monastery next door for an extra culture dose. It's all about the views at the Big Buddha, so try to time your trip on a clear day."

Pre-book your cable ticket to avoid the long queues. Worth the extra few dollars. Our first trip we just paid at the gate and it took almost 2 hours in the queue to get there.Shops are a bit different. You will need to be fit to get up the steps to the Buddha, be prepared and wear good footwear.Not much for the very young to see, recommended for family with teens."

You can't see the line until you are in it . The other thing is to buy a one way cable ticket and then take the local bus from the town to Tai O the lovely fishing village 10 min by bus. From there you can take a bus back to the subway and you don't have to deal with all of the line up to take the cable car down. If you go to Tai Omake sure you find the bridge and explore that side too before taking a shirt boat ride to see the village."

We used the Crystal Cable Car from Tung Chung MTR & it was such a great decision. The cable car journey was spectacular & the walk until the Big Buddha was very beautiful. The Monastery was extremely surreal & beautiful. We also went uptil the Wisdom Path - a km or so ahead of Big Buddha base & it was such a incredible experience. Though we didnt understand what was written on the slabs on the Wisdom Path - Just being there was a great feeling. Plan to spend atleast half a day & you will be happy you did."

But after seeing the hiking trail snaking its way up the mountains, we came back to do the climb to the Big Buddha on foot.It was worth every step (about 10,000 of them) and is a no-nonsense hike straight up steep faces and across ridgelines. Most of the climbing on the hike is either stone steps or wooden stairs. There are a few steep parts which can be slick after the rain, but the hike is well marked and well maintained (signs pointing out where VERY steep parts are coming, or the occasional fatality has happened from river trekking). No fee for taking the hike or visiting the Buddha on foot, but good Karma points for making the donation to the monastery for the visit.The hardest part is finding the start of the hike and trailhead, but if you do the research, you can figure it out. Much of the hike follows the cable car towers and mellows out after the initial ascent. Gorgeous views, and it's worth it to take the extra steps up to the rescue helicopter landing pads for 360 views of the South China Sea, Buddha and surrounding areas.Total hiking time less than 2 hours from the trailhead start and we took the cable car back down to avoid the torrential downpours that were rolling through all week (mid-May 2014).This hike was the highlight of our Hong Kong trip and we highly recommend it to any outdoor enthusiasts planning to visit the Big Buddha. Have fun!"

Metro to Tung Chun from center is 17,50 HKD = 2,3 USD. The cable car is 150 HKD = 21 USD for standard and 235 HKD = 32 USD for crystal cabins (crystal cabins' bottom is also transparent) for a round trip. The cable ride takes 25-30 minutes and you are at the village of the monastery. There are stairs up to Buddha. Take the stairs very slowly since you will sweat a lot up to the hill. The statue is huge and interesting even if you are not so spiritual. Definitely worth to see."

Once at the top and walking thru the village you can contemplate your ascent up 296 steps to the very top of Big Buddha. This is the largest sitting Buddha in the world. Important to remember that it is more than a tourist attraction. It is a religious symbol and temple to the Buddhist and when thinking that way, It is a very emotional sight especially seeing the people praying and understanding its importance. If you make it to the top, inside is a memorial of the ashes of the deceased. It is a serene sight seeing the dedication, gifts and mementos loved ones leave for there family and friends resting there. There are some great Buddha statutes along the top and some great picture opportunities. The trip down was and will be much easier."

The stair workout was well worth it. The art work and artifacts inside were beautiful. I was particularly interested in the \"bone fragment\" shrine inside. Apparently Buddha was cremated and his ashes are inserted into every Buddha around the world by various monks. If you can see the ash then you are at peace, if not well. . . you have normal vision. lol! I highly recommend this attraction, along with sun glasses, an umbrella, and good walking shoes.

We took a blue taxi to and from the Big Buddha as the cable car lineup was huge, probably because we were there May 5, the day before Buddha's birthday. The Big Buddha is officially known as the Tian Tin Buddha. It is located on a mountain ridge in the midst of the well treed park which appears to serve as the watershed for the island reservoir. The Buddha has a very pleasing face and posture, and could assist one in meditating were in not for throngs of tourists snapping photos. The grounds are appealing and include an area of shops and another area with temples and a monastery. We enjoyed a wonderful (deluxe) set vegetarian meal for two in the VIP room at the monastery restaurant for 128 $HK each. There is no fee to enter the grounds of the park/monastery but one ought to make a donation in at least one of many boxes available. A pleasant way to spend half a day."

The cable car ride is great with fantastic views (A bit hazy) and the shops and stalls at the big buddha were good value for money. Definitely worth a look but be warned, the queues for the cable car can get quite long and we waited half an hour in line to catch our cable car. The lines were even longer when we came back down after lunch, so perhaps think about getting here early before the crowds. We had a nice meal at one of the eating places/restaurants (There were a few to choose from), wandered around and did some shopping for gifts for home. All round a nice couple of hours."

Thoroughly recommend a trip here, we took the cable car from Citygate to the Buddha, included in the trip was the cable car (the crystal one with the glass bottom), entry to the Big Buddha site a trip in a boat to see a fishing village and fish market and a bus ride back to Citygate .The trip in the glass bottom gondola was amazing, over the sky above Lantau up into the mountains offering great views of Hong Kong airport and the surrounding areas. We could see from the cable car that there was a walkway that went on for miles that took the same route as the cable car once ever the river. On arrival at the Buddha site there is a plaza with restaurants with some western type including subways and I think there was a Starbucks also. Included in our ticket was entry to an attraction that showed how one of the Buddhas started it included several animated scenes in different theatres and headphones in English were provided in with the ticket ( other languages were available ) . After visiting the attraction we walked towards the Buddhist temple and up towards the giant Buddha. There were many steps up to the Buddha and someone with mobility problems wouldn't manage the steps up to the Buddha. Once up the steps it is very tranquil and many people were worshiping the Buddha statue. We'll worth the money and would recommend a visit."

Since this was on one of the must do list we went to see the Big Buddha only post lunch, but I would suggest that you plan an entire day at least and visit the neighboring village that we missed. the Cable Car is a 5 mins walk from Tung Chung MTR. We bought the regular cable car ride tickets, although they had an option of 'crystal' cable car with a glass bottom. so if you want to splurge you can get that, else the normal one is as good and if you view from the side you do get the same effect. the cable car ride itself was awesome, offering great views of the airport and the approach through the forest, mountains till finally you can see the Big Buddha high up on the mountain. My 4 year old daughter thoroughly enjoyed the ride up and down. The last cable car is around 6pm so plan enough time if you ant to neighboring village ( sorry forgot the name) once you reach there the approach to the Big Buddha is stunning and so completely the opposite of the hustle and bustle of Hong Kong. Amongst the mountain with the Po Lin Monastery straight in front, the monks chants reverberating through the valley you can start your climb up. The climb is not very difficult and can easily to be done in a few minutes. do definitely halt and take in the site of The Buddhas serene eyes upon you as you climb. The view from atop is also stunning and we were lucky with the weather as the sun was hiding behind the clouds and we weren't drained by the heat. All in all a great and according to me one of the MUST do things on your list."

I wish I had done that. The queue for the cable car took 2 hours to the tickets office and another half an hour to the cable car !The comment from one of my teenage children after queueing for so long was that he hoped the Buddha was going to get up and dance after waiting that long!!But once in the cable car, we tended to forget about the wait. The view is very impressive as you glide first over the water and then up the hillsides and over the peaks, looking out toward the airport and off into the horizon. You can walk to the Buddha and full marks to those we saw treading the well maintained path beneath us doing just that. When you arrive and Ngong Ping, you are greeted by a lot of other tourists. We opted to go down to Tao O village first and walk up to the Buddha later.The stairs to the Buddha can be a bit tiring, but the view at the top is amazing. Well worth the effort. This was a good day out and we were glad we went. If I did the visit again though, I would defintely pre-book the cable car."

If you have the time and right shoes, there is a trail that goes up from the water side walkway all the way. It will probably take easily 3 hours or so, but unless you time the line right - so might the tram.That said, since my first visit in 1995, the Buddha has gain a lot of neighbors in the form of tourist restaurants and shops. The area is now pretty busy and is much less a retreat rather than the tranquil spot I visited back then (as the only person not working at the buddha visiting). That said, if you are in Hong Kong and want to get out of the bustle of the city centre - this (especially the walk if the weather and time allows) would be a pretty way to experience this place. BEWARE: the walk is very much a full on hike up into the Lantau mountains and is not accessible. It pretty much follows the path of the Tram so you know what you are in for..."

            "review": "Touristy but Nice. How to get there: We were staying in Kowloon so we first had to take the Star Ferry across to Hong Kong Island. From there, we took a ferry from Central Pier 6, which was right next to the Star Ferry terminal, to Lantau Island (Mui Wo). We then took bus number 2 from Silvermine Bay, which was right across from the ferry terminal. The bus took about 45 minutes to reach the Ngong Ping Plateau, which is where the Big Buddha is located. We took this route because we were advised that the scenery was spectacular on the drive. It was just ok though, and I'd probably find a quicker way to get there if I had to do it all over again. Big Buddha: We bought our tickets to see the Big Buddha before climbing up the stairs. We also bought our meal tickets for Po Lin Monastery at the same time. After the ticket booth, we climbed the 260 steps to reach the Big Buddha. A lot of people stop to rest midway as we did, so the climb was not so strenuous for us. When we reached the top, we were 2420 feet above sea level. The views were nice and there were plenty of picture opportunities. The Big Buddha is surrounded by other smaller statues, which are visible from the viewing platform. Wisdom Path: After we climbed back down from the Big Buddha, we turned right and followed the signs to the Wisdom Path, which are big wooden pillars displaying the Heart Sutra. The walk took about 15 minutes and we passed by bulls and a bit of wilderness before reaching the pillars. Once there, it may not appear so but the pillars are placed in the form of a figure eight to symbolize infinity. The view here was nice. My only issue was that the prayers on the pillars were written in Chinese and there were no translations for visitors anywhere nearby. Not understanding what the pillars say does detract from the overall experience, and a good tip would be to look up the translations before getting there. Po Lin Monastery: We made our way to Po Lin after tracing our steps back from the Wisdom Path. Lunch is served from 11:30 to 4:30 at the Monastery. Our meal ticket was for a set menu. If you did not buy a meal ticket before climbing to the Big Buddha, you have the option of buying one outside the Monastery. The food was vegetarian and, in our opinion, average. However, we loved the experience of dining in the Monastery. Our meal ticket also came with a snack stub, which we cashed at the adjacent snack station. It entitled us to two types of snacks and a drink. You can choose between sweet or savory and all the options are vegetarian. We had sago pudding and a slice of coconut cake. The term cake is misleading because it was more of a hardened jello block with chunks of fruit in it. After our delicious snacks, we climbed the steps of the nearby temple to see the three Buddha statues, representing the past, present, and future. Ngong Ping Village: Finally, we headed to the village to see the Walking with Buddha show and catch the skyrail back down. The Walking with Buddha show is an animated documentary of Buddha's path to enlightenment. I wasn't too impressed with the experience because the documentary was shown to us in two installments, and we had to change halls between viewings. If I had to do it all over again, I would skip this part. Tip: if you choose not to eat at the Monastery, you have a choice of restaurants in the village like Subway, a pizza joint, and the like. Finally, we headed to the skyrail terminal with tickets already in hand. We bought the tickets online believing that there would be a huge waiting line, but we were surprised that there was no queue at all. We bought standard cabin tickets online, and were able to upgrade them to the crystal cabin at the terminal after paying the difference. We loved the crystal cabin experience and being able to see the ground all through the 25 minute ride. We passed by the airport, the lush greenery of Lantau, and the South China Sea before being dropped close to Citygate outlet mall in Tung Chung. We shopped around the mall before heading back to our hotel by metro. The metro station was in the mall, and there were also other transportation options outside the mall, like buses and taxis. Overall experience: We enjoyed the Big Buddha and skyrail portions the most. This is the type of sight that you'd like to see once and move on. Some aspects of it were touristy and the village does have a bit of an amusement park feel. But, we were glad we got to experience it. We didn't make it to the nearby fishing village to see the pink dolphins. We figured that we may not actually get to see a pink dolphin and the bus ride was going to take too long. Regardless, you'll need at least half a day to see this sight, so plan accordingly."

The Buddha was impressive, cable car ride ok, however the whole thing was tainted by the incapable hands of operator staff that were greedy, lack coordination and customer service. We booked tickets for the crystal cable car online and were expecting less queuing time to get on the cable car. We arrived the next day early in the morning before the first cable car service. There was already a huge line with people waiting to buy tickets to get in. We showed one of the staff our online ticket, we were told to wait next to the long queue for priority boarding, but very reluctant to show us where we should go next. We then asked another staff, we were told to queue behind the long queue of people without tickets. There were no signs and directions of where people who already bought the tickets online should go. About 10 mins later, a different staff guided someone who had tickets to the priority area. We were feeling betrayed, and worked our way around to the priority area without any directions from the staff. It seems the staff have not been trained to give directions. A lot of them seemed to stand around and not providing help.When we got to the cable car, they took a photo of us. When we got to the top, the photo they printed was of low quality, quite faded and cost HKD100. I asked if we could buy the photo after we have seen the Buddha they said no. I bought the photo anyway thinking that was the only chance to get it. On the way down, they took another photo of us. The second photo turned out to be better and normal quality, not faded. We felt betrayed again, asked if we could swap the photos and they said no. We felt they intentionally make the second photo looks better so people pay for two photos. We didn't get the second photo eventually due to the bad impression we had of the staff.Lastly another point to mention was, when we got to the bottom of the stairs to the Buddha statue, a staff shouted to us \"meals or no meals?\". We didn't quite know what she meant by \"meals\". She later explained to get into the exhibition area under the Buddha statue costs HKD33 without meals, and costs additional for meals (which is an ice cream and a soft drink). She then insisted we could only go up 300 steps of the stairs for free. We went up to the top anyway without having to pay anything, and had a little peak at the inside the statue, which was mainly a gift shop. We felt the operator lacks customer service, tries to squeeze every cent they could out of your pocket."

When you reach the top of the mountain there is a quite commercial area leading along a wide avenue to the Bhuddist Temple where there is a huge vegetarian restaurant - not bad quality although some dishes were better than others - and the steps leading up to the Big Bhudda itself, apparently erected by the monks as a snub to secular mainland China.

Walk the approximately 286 steps up to the Buddha and the views are amazing. Buys some incense sticks and place them in the cauldrons. Visit the monastery.From the cable car you can see the airport and watch the planes landing."

Unfortunately the access to these are through a replica village that cheapens and dilutes the experience. You reach these 2 religious sites by walking through a sideshow of Starbucks, spruikers offering to do your makeup and have you star in your own video, screeching music and flat screen TV's selling quite what I'm not sure. Any chance of reverence is flattened by all of this and the endless souvenir sellers.The connecting cable car journey is good and quite exciting but then you can only exit through a maze of souvenir shops.So would I recommend? Not really. Why is it so hard to deliver a quiet and reflective experience in HK?"

We had to wait over 1 hour in a massive queue to buy the tickets (150 HKD for the return trip in a standard cable car, there are some with glass floors which are a bit more expensive) and that was midweek in April so I guess it gets even worse at peak times. Those who purchase tickets in advance go straight to the front so I would recommend looking into doing that. The cable car takes about 25 minutes and is quite spectacular. When you reach the top there are a number of souvenir shops etc. and it's then about a 10 minute walk to the foot of the 268 stairs leading up to the Big Buddha. Great views from the top."

You can either wander unescorted, or take a package that includes a veg meal at the top.

(I have friends who have queued for 2 hours just for cable car tickets!)The cable car up to the Buddha offers incredible views over the whole of Hong Kong. If you are scared of heights, this may not be for you, but I would strongly suggest you try it! Cable cars seat 8 people, so be prepared to share with strangers.Once at the top, the area is completely transformed for tourists, which is abit of a shame. But put aside and take in the scenery around the shops. At the foot of the Buddha there are ticket stalls. You do not need to buy a ticket to climb the stairs and see the Buddha, but if you wanted to pay for a lunch deal, buy before you go up, as it includes closer access to the Buddha and a drink at the top. There are thousands of stairs to the Buddha, but take your time because it is so worth it! At the top, it is easy to be obsessed with taking photos of the Buddha and other statues, but take time to look out at the views. Again, it is not peaceful as it was crammed with visitors, but still incredible. Also pop inside and there is a tapestry/painting of the story of Buddha, and lots of Buddhist plaques for the dead. Whilst here, visit the monastery. You can see Buddhist monks walking around, and look at the fantastic buildings and beautiful golden shrines and statues.There are eateries and lots of over-priced and tacky souvenir shops. We also popped into the 'authentic' Chinese tea shop and caf\u00e9. I would avoid this! It is completely over priced (we paid equivalent to \u00a316 for one pot of Jasmine tea) and they try to sell you everything from snacks with your tea, 'special' tea leaves and anything else!A great day out, definitely recommend!!"

We caught the MTR to Lantau Island then queued up for about 45 mins to purchase tickets for the cable car ride up to the Buddha (tip: pre-purchase your cable car tickets to avoid the queue). The ride up in the cable car was spectacular with great views of the surrounding areas including the airport. We were in the standard cabin but you can upgrade to the Crystal cabin which has a glass floor. When you arrive at the top, you need to walk through the customary array of shops to get to the base of the steps to climb up to the Buddha. There are approx. 260 steps to climb and there is plenty of viewing at the various levels. Great view once up the top. There are a number of shops in the village and prices seemed to be ok. Allow 1/2 day for your visit if travelling on public transport. A most enjoyable experience."

There are tour packages for around $70 US that takes you there by tour bus which includes a vegetarian lunch at the monestary there. We discovered the subway (MTR) runs there with a ticket cost of a few dollars; transferring once and following the mobs. We went on a sunday and the lines to buy the tickets were endless-but the wait was worth it. You have a choice of tickets-regular cable car or the crystal cars which cost a little more but have glass-see through floors. After getting the tickets, we found the lines for crystal cars were much shorter than the stand cable cars. They can put up to eight people in each car-ours had six and we had a great time on the 20 minute trip to the summit and great Buddha-with the see through floor below us. They took pictures of us when we got in the cars and we were shocked to find our pictures up at the top-put in a variety of beautiful formats which we readily puchased. This was great marketing. We did the 268 steps to the great Buddha and took great pictures. When we finally finished a great afternoon there-we were again faced with the ultra long lines again and faced at least an hour waiting in line. However, a watchfull attendent spottted our crystal ticket tags and ushered us ahead of the standard lines into the no wait crystal line-what a blessing. Go Crystal-and endjoy."

We opted to take the slow ferry from Central Pier 6 to enjoy the view of Victoria Harbour, Hong Kong Island and some of the outer islands. There is a fast ferry but sitting inside the enclosed cabin restricts the view. One can also take the MTR to Lantau and either a bus, taxi or cable car to the Buddha.From the ferry terminal on Lantau Island we took an exciting taxi ride up, down and over the rugged terrain to the Monestery and Big Buddha. We had the choice of having the taxi take us to the top via the service road but we decided to climb the approximate 267 steps to Big Buddha. It was well worth the effort because of the incredible view and the immense size of Big Buddha.At the base of the steps to Big Buddha we purchased a HK$33 pp ticket that gave us entry to the museum under Big Buddha and a snack of noodles with veggies and the choice of two vegetarian delicacies at the monastery concession. The museum was extremely worthwhile explaining the history of Buddism and for the interesting artwork. The \"snack\" turned out to be a tasty, satisfying meal - a surprise bonus. A portion of the proceeds from the ticket are dedicated to maintaining the monestary and Big Buddha so make sure to buy one.On the return to Central we took the bus to the Lantau ferry terminal and returned on the fast ferry.The total cost for two was approximately HK$300 - a true bargain."

It's about a 30minute ride to get to the Buddha. Shops are there, if you are wanting souvenirs save your money and get them from the markets cheaper. The steps to the top is tiring, plenty of people stopping on the way. No need to do a tour from your hotel, doing it as a self pace yourself works well and easy to do."

There are indeed 2 types of cable car to choose from and aside from price there's not much between them. We ended up going twice because the first time we went a sudden thunder storm hit and the cable cars were closed for safety reasons so consider the weather before you go. On our second visit it was a dry if foggy day and the queue for both cars was equally long. The view up to the Big Buddha is fantastic taking in the mountains and the airport but soon got lost in the fog as we climbed higher but the swirling fog gave it an almost mystical feel. Once at the top there's plenty to see and shops selling incense if you wish to pray. The Big Buddha is an impressive sight to see and well worth walking up the 100 odd steps to get a closer look. It's a very tranquil place to be with monks dotted about a spiritual feel that draws you in. Definitely worth a visit for a few hours calmness before rejoining the hectic pace of life in Hong Kong. Choose a sunny clear day to visit as the views are spectacular."

In April there were no queues for the cable car and unless you want a glass bottom cable car I would just get a standard one. The entrance price was HKD150 pp. That is for a standard car and to see the Buddha and village. The glass bottom car was HKD225 pp. When we went up it was foggy and quite surreal to not see anything....really captured our imagination. When we got up, the walk to the Buddha and monastery was straight through shops and stall, a clever marketing tool for tourist income. If you are travelling with less baled people be warned that there are quite a few hundred steps up to the Buddha. Once up there the fog cleared for us and we took home some exceptional shots. In the height of summer you may get glare from the sun behind the Buddha so on a day with not too much sun it was better for photos. Inside the Buddha the tourist shop stands donate all proceeds to the maintenance of the whole place so worth buying gifts I think inside. Plenty to see, do and shop. You need about 3 hours here."

We took the first minibus from the Regal Airport hotel c.9:45 and had no trouble finding our way to the Ngong Ping 360 Cable Car through the CityGate Mall (great wayfinding signage). The line-up for tickets and the cable car were fairly long but not too crazy - probably an hour or slightly less. The ride-up is nothing short of breathtaking - the ride is approximately 6 kms long, 25 minutes, the car takes 2 turns and there is a grand total of only 7 support towers translating into many high altitude grand dangles over valleys and rivers - the vistas of Lantau Island, the harbour and international airport are amazing. The Budda at the top is quite a marvel as are the grounds and more shopping if you have not filled your quota. This is an excellent 4-5 hour activity that you can fit in the morning if you have a flight in the evening - everything is quite close to the Airport and affordable. City Gate Mall has many good restaurants for lunch on the way back."

Well, folks, for someone who has been all over Asia, to and fro, another Buddha that is claimed to be the biggest seated, reclining, posing, standing, etc., Buddha cannot vary that much from the rest. That's no offense to anyone who prays to Buddha, to someone who is a devout Buddhist, nor to religious folks on pilgrimages, etc. For non-secular tourists and travelers, it is still worth the visit, for the scenery is lovely and the people watching there is entertaining (crowds of people of all nationalities were there)--and it is impressive in its size. The surrounding landscaping and ascending staircases were all well done, too. Additionally, the bus trip from the ferry terminal (for people arriving that way from HK) to the Big Buddha offers some unexpected beautiful sights along the way. However, I admit that I am also becoming a bit skeptical through the years about such sights. Are countries, like China in this example, creating such places for religious purposes (i.e., is it a holy place for some related reason) or are such locales sprouting up on purpose (i.e., tourist dollars)? The nearby village seemed brand new and more of a commercial outlet mall of sorts than anything traditional, and the temple complex, which is quite lovely, is still seemingly being constructed (the side of part of the complex wasn't even painted yet when I walked around back). Is the purpose of such a place to attract spenders, for they're bound to visit the restaurants, souvenir shops, and all sorts of vendors in the vicinity--or is there an authentic purpose on then making some cash? I'd hope it is the latter."

As far as I can tell, the crystal cabibs are identical to the normal-priced ones, however those with the more expensive tickets have a much much shorter queue to deal with, effectively jumping straight to the front of the crowd. If you're short on time, keep this in mind - it may be worth the extra just to shave up to a hour of waiting time off at each cable car terminal.The views from the cable car itself are pretty good, and along the way we saw several groups walking up the mountain - holy cow!! The ride on the cable car takes almost 1 hour - don't want to think about walking the same route ...Coming out from the upper terminus, you arrive at the ngong ping 360 village. Thete are some decent eating options here. Prices are a bit higher than downtown, as can be expected, but everything we ordered was delicious, and the free wifi was a bonus.Onto the big buddha itself. To get to the top of the hill involves climbing some 200-odd steps - not too difficult if you're of a reasonable level of fitness. On a clear day, the views from the top are fantastic. This was one of the highlights of our trip to hong kong, so highly recommended, & not to be missed !!"

Frankly, they're not worth it and we could have got onto an ordinary car very quickly. If you want to avoid queuing and additional questionable expense...... The bus journey back down was hairy. The driver was driving like a lunatic down steep hills and round tight bends.

The journey up was a bit crazy... as there were many bends. But coach up was definitely worth it especially as you gradually approach the big Buddha. Just outside, there are many stalls selling things from bracelets to hats which is quite cute. If you follow that way down, there is a street full of more shops and food stores. On your way up to the big Buddha there are many stores, selling food and things like windmills to praying things. There were different parts to pray in which was really beautiful. We went to eat the vegetarian meal, which you can buy different types of meals sets (or queue up for individual food). The queue to buy individual foods were very long, and all the seats were full up very quickly. However, buying a set meal was more stress free and quick. By buying the set meal, you can use that ticket to view a restricted area up where the big Buddha is. The big Buddha was impressive, especially being so up close to it. The downside to the visit would definitely have to be the it being over crowded, but this is really unavoidable. But overall, definitely a must!"

            "review": "A Magnificent Must-See Destination. Visiting the Tian Tan Buddha a.k.a. Big Buddha is a must-see for visitors to Hong Kong. Both a popular tourist destination as well as a sacred location for Buddhists, it's a place that provides people plenty of great photo taking opportunities while being exotic and impressive enough to brag about to your friends and family back home as you show them pictures of your trip. It truly is one of the great marvels of Asia and I do recommend you visit. As one of the largest Buddha sculptures in the world (at least the largest one I've ever seen), the sheer scale and grandness of it alone is sure to amaze you. Situated on a mountain where visitors must climb up 268 steps (shot climb, not as bad as I thought it would be) to reach to the \"lotus pad\" area that the Big Buddha sits on. Similar to the Statue of Liberty if you've ever been, there's not much at the top other than just plain ground that encircles the Big Buddha. They do have a few shops inside the lotus pad but nothing much. I don't think you can actually go inside the Buddha, most of the people just go there to take pictures on the outside. There are also some smaller Buddhist statues outside around the the base of the Big Buddha which you can also look and take pictures with. Within the surrounding areas of the Big Buddha (once you climb back down the 268 steps) there are some mini attractions that you can look at such as an area to burn incense and the neighboring Ngong Ping Village.There is no charge to go see the Big Buddha himself, but I did see a small counter at the bottom selling meal tickets - for buying food in the surrounding area I guess. To get there you have two main options: from the Tung Chung station you can either take a bus or the cable car there. We took the bus which was quite cheap compared to taking the cable car (the bus was around $17HKD I think while the basic cable car ran around $175HKD and the glass one over $200HKD per person). Visiting the Big Buddha takes at most around an hour if not less, but to get there might take a while depending on how crowded it is."

The Big Buddah sits on the top of the hill and is excitibg to look at when you are still far away. On the path to the top of the hill the landscape is changing several times and you see the Harbours, the islands , the airport and other hills around. after a while you get to see th hill with the Buddah on the top and the monestary. it sits there piceful and calm and you just feel good.the little village you path when you arrive bevore you get to the stairs to see th Buddha very clos is quite touristic, but there is one tea room that is worth visiting. when you order tea the ladies prepare the tea at your table the traditionsl way. this is worth seeing and worth tasting.Tipp: order the ticket for the cristsl cabin online. you can do it from hotel computer or smartphone and ask you hotel to get the tickets printed.

When you arrive the other end you walk through a mock village which is just expensive tourist shops but the monastery and Big Buddha are very intersting.

When we reached the first queue, our hearts sank, then we saw 'Ticket holders this way' we saved at least a 2 hour wait (and $20 US) by booking it online.We booked the cable car, Buddha walk, return bus tickets to the fishing village and the boat ride around the harbour. Our bonus was seeing the pink dolphins in the harbour. Our pre booked tickets took us straight to the front of the queues. We upgraded the cable car back to starting point because every one was taking the return trip at the same time, we would have had to wait over an hour and we had a plane to catch! For an extra $60 HK, we took the crystal cabins back down.The only downside, when booking it asks you your preferred start time, if you opt for after 1.45 pm - if you are doing the whole thing as we did - you wont have enough time to walk around the markets and shops before the last cable car going back. Walking up the steps and walking around the Buddha is worth the exercise."

Later 2-hours later the line was over 1-hour to wait for tickets. It was cloudy and overcast on the tram entry side, but when we got to the Buda it was clear...so ask at the counter for the visability before going up. We purchased the clear bottom car (liitle more than standard) and got right on both going and coming....as most people pay for the standard car. So think about it."

Take the MTR and then the cable car up to the top and from there walk up to the Buddha.Very restful place aside from the shops in the entrance plaza. On the upside you can get a coffee there.

It was a lovely day, clear skies...so we got to see the statue from afar and the views were fantastic!Once we reached the small village-like park, there were so many interesting little attractions and cafes and souvenir shops on the way to the statue. We were very short on time unfortunately so we couldn't see much. The gardens were very beautiful with numerous other interesting looking statues and people having picnics, it was a very peaceful ambiance. You need to climb several stairs to reach the base of the statue. The views again at the top were amazing and there's space to worship and more interesting statues and things to read. Beware of the long ques for the cable cars to get out especially at the end of the day."

Try to time it right and head down with the sunset; you won't regret it! The ride is a decent length too--not so fast that you wonder where your value went but not so long that you start getting antsy either. But make sure you get there early as the queues can be quite long (going up AND down). As others have said, Ngong Ping Village at the top is quite tourist-y. But really, what do you expect? There are quite a few nice gift shops at the top and some restaurants as well. There's even a Starbucks for those who love the comforts of home! But fear not, the culture is not hard to come by. Venture through the village to find the Buddhist Monastery. Even though it was under construciton when we went, it was still magnificent. You can pay for an all-vegetarian meal at the restaurant there as well. We tried it and while it wasn't horrible, I could have done without. Imagine your standard American-Chinese food dishes sans meat. It was all so greasy. Finally, the Big Buddha itself is a wonder to behold. Be prepared for a bit of a climb to the top though. There's not much to do but enjoy the scenery and have a look around, but I really enjoyed the experience. I think this is a good day trip for those looking to blend a bit of culture with comfort."

I arrived in HKG around 10 am and was free the whole day .Since during my last visit to Hong Kong ,I could not visit Buddha, I was determined to do so this time. There were two options with me . First to go to hotel straight and come back from hotel to Buddha later and second to proceed from the airport to Buddha straight , spend some time and proceed to hotel . I decided for latter? The best option for a senior is to buy a senior (elder) Octopus card at HKIA itself. Costs HKD 70 ( 50 refundable deposit plus 20 towards the fare ). I took bus S1 to Tung Chung station ( cost only 1.80 HKD ).Since it would have been difficult to cart my suitcase along all the way , I decided to use the left luggage bin at the mall opposite Tung Chung MTR station.Here I hate to admit that I had grossly underestimated the waiting time for getting tickets ( it is a pity that they do not have discount for overseas seniors , a local senior can get the return ticket for 105 as against full rerun fare of 150 ) , even on a working day ,for the cable car and the subsequent waiting time to get into the cable car.(close to 2 hours ).i wish I had done the booking on internet. Long waiting period hurt you two ways. You spend time unproductively waiting and getting tired in the Q. Plus the service charges for your left luggage are multiplying ( 20 HKD for 2 hours). There are two luggage storage locations , level 2 and level 3.All were full . Luckily , for me, as I was about to leave , a lady came and vacated a bin.She was also quite helpful to me in using this unattended storage bin.Ride up the cable car was fantastic. It was a clear day and I had a whale of time in clicking the photos,you may not be religiously inclined but it is still worth it to climb all the 250 odd steps and have a \"close\" view from all the sides and angles.Ride down the cable car was equally fascinating. Collected my bag after paying a hefty fee of HKD 60 , had some small eats in the mall and headed for Tung Chung MTR, just across the mall.Senior elder octopus card helped me reach from tung chung to Hong Kong station on TCL line for a mere HKD 2. At Hong Kong Station , most of the good hotels are sending the free shuttle. So essentially one can reach from HKIA TO your hotel in mere 3.80.My advice to fellow senior travellers would be to come to hotel straight , drop the luggage in your hotel for free and head back to Buddha.This way you spend some extra time in travel and additional 4 HKD but you would save on the luggage storage charges."

Otherwise you will queue a LONG time.2. Opt for an early slot. EARLY!!3. Go for a crystal cabin (glass floor)4. You can mostly ignore the retail village - not great value5. As well as BB, don't forget to go and see the temple and also the Wisdom Trail. 6. If you have time book (when doing so online) for the Lantau Island package. Cable Car, Bus and Boat. With this you get a ticket to change for a bus ticket which gives you Island-wide travel. Times are a little restricting and be careful not to miss the last bus back. 7. With (6) you get a free boat ride at the fishing village of Tai O. This is a wonderful place - very authentic, not very touristy, safe etc. Oh but very (dried) fishy!!! Fom the bus stop, walk through the market streets to the water. People will guide you to the boats, take your ticket and once full, the boat take you on a 30 minute trip - firstly to see the village and then out to sea at full speed!!! to try and spot Chinese pink dolphins. We loved this part of the day.Make sure you are done in time so that you don't get caught up in the queues for the return cable car ride but do plan for a good 3/4 of a day on Lantau.Great shopping centre at Tung Chung with good supermarket in basement."

As it would be too early for us to check in our hotel which was located at Tsim Sha Tsui, we decided to visit the Big Buddha at Lautau Island according to our plan. The Big Buddha is not far from the airport. From the bus stop outside the airport, we took bus no. 56 (or bus S1) to Tungchung station. We bought our Octopus cards at the airport and thus paid our bus fares using the octopus card. We browsed around City gate shopping mall at Tungchung for a while before taking bus no. 23 to the Big Buddha. The bus ride was cheap about 20HKD and the journey took about 40 mins but it gives us an appreciation of the scenery at Lautau Island. The cable station only open at 10 am and I do not want to waste my time waiting for the cable car. In fact, I noticed that the cable car station was just located opposite the Tungchung bus station where I took the bus no. 23. The driver did not drive recklessly and he actually waited patiently for a passenger who has gone to the toilet while the mother boarded the bus.The weather was bad - it was drizzling and foggy. My body was trembling when I alighted from the bus. We did not expect the weather to be so cold; it was 6 to 8 degrees and foggy. You hardly able to see the whereabouts of the temple or the Buddha when you alighted from the bus. It takes some time for our bodies to condition to the coldness. The lesson to learn is to wear enough clothings when you are in HK during the winter; the temperature can drop drastically especially when you up at a such height at the Big Buddha monastery. Remember also to bring rain clothes or umbrella. We did not expect it to rain though the weather forecast was cloudy. I could not even see the head of the Big Buddha initially but occasionally the fog clear and you must quickly take the opportunity to snap some shots before the fog covered the face of the Buddha again. The experience to visit Big Buddha in a freezing cold morning was a memorable experience but if you want to take nice clear photo it would not be advisable to come in foggy weather in winter."

So this review is a little bit belated. If you need directions to the buddha, or want to know more about the history and construction process, I would recommend checking out their informative website before going there http://www.plm.org.hkMy overall impression is that the amazing cable car ride leading to the Buddha is the best part of the trip, and the Big Buddha is nice to see too. I will write a separate review for the cable car under Ngong Ping Village, and I'll focus my review on the Buddha here. We went there on a Sunday around 1pm, my coworker drove us there and parked in the underground car-park in the outlet mall next to the cable car station. When we got there, the line was quite long, but it did move fairly quickly. The exit of the cable car station led directly into Ngong Ping Village, which is a theme village featuring restaurants and souvenir shops. From there, its a 3 minute walk to the base of the Buddha, and from the base, it's 268 steps to the Lotus Throne on which the Buddha sits. And yes the steps are pretty steep. I am in decent physical shape, and i did have take a short break halfway up the stairs to rest my legs and catch my breath.The lotus throne is the circular seat of the Big Buddha. Visitors can walk around the it and enjoy the view from there, but cannot go inside the Buddha itself. We went on a clear day, so the view of the surrounding island and the sea was very pretty. We spent about 30 minutes looking at the views and chatting, then we took the long walk down the stairs to get back to the cable car station. We didn't visit the Po Lin monastery and the surrounding gardens because we were exhausted, not only because of the stairs but also because of jet lag. All in all, we had a good time. I think the Big Buddha is worth a visit."

We came with great expectations, but because of the fog/mist, we didn't manage to see the whole buddha, even though we were just standing at the foot of the buddha. The fog is so thick during winter that you can barely see the head. However, the village is designed after ancient china architecture, which makes it an amazing experience when strolling through the village to get to the buddha. At least it wasn't a wasted trip."

Well worth the extra money to bypass the lineups. Trip us was scenic with the Buddha and Temple coming into view on a hazy day. At the top there is lots to see and do; they have balanced tourism with the religious aspects of the site. Travelled down to the stilt village and boat ride with \"boat jockey\" all was good and an opportunity to see a working fishing village. Climbed the steps to see the Buddha up close and then into the temples. Food at concessions was decent and service friendly. Using your 360 pass you can go the information booth in the central service area (across from Starbucks - sorry but apparently the Monks are quite pragmatic about these things) and get a tram reservation time slot so once again no wait at the top.PS take the steps 10 or 20 at a time then rest, you'll make it!!!"

We walked up to the base of the Statue, and the climb up the 3-tiers to the staute itself is through the inner central hall - to which, entry is restricted to those with vegetarian meal or snack coupons, so pick them up at the kiosk at the base of the steps before climbing. Also, access to the final base, right below the Lord's feet was denied, which was a disappointment! The Nunnery belwo is beautiful with relics, calligraphy and art depcting the Buddha in his various forms. Practicing monks live on site, and their chants give it an ethereal vibe. Also the riot of colours in the fresh flowers surrounding the buildings. Chrysanthemum, magnolia...magnificent. Also, delicious are the various vegetarian dumplings served in the dining area - against the coupons you bought. Stir-fried rice noodles. gooey and chewy sesame coated dumplings sweet black sesame-paste centred, others, with radish filling, some with coconut and sweet peanut paste. Try them all."

It invokes the feel of living in a peaceful time at least a few centuries ago.There's a specific spot in the middle of an encirclement that looks straight up to the Buddha where any speeches and voices creates a stunning echo. An amazing experience, and a phenomenon I didn't understand as the surrounding area is open air!One caution to take note though. You would notice signboards asking not to feed bull as it to prevent unintentional food poisoning to the bulls. But what I surprised me during my visit was an angry bull looking for trees to eat and got chased by a pack of dogs. Quite an amusing but dangerous situation with the bull on full charge with tourists eager to snap pictures of it charging rather than move away."

From the cable car ride up (about 20-25 mins), the walk through the small little town before reaching the walkway through the warrior statues, and even the 268 steps up to reach the Big Buddah. It was all worth it! We even went on a day when the weather wasn't so great, it was cold and foggy. So much so that even when we reached the Big Buddah we could barely see the face clearly. We would just wait to catch it at the right moment when the fog would get thinner and catch glimpses. Next time I would definitely try and go on a clear day but if your schedule doesn't permit it then just go like we did. The fog made the whole experience mystical. Since the weather was not favorable we decided to skip the Monestery, but if we go back we'll check it out for sure. We didn't pay the extra fee to go on the second floor of the Buddah and have lunch. Walking around the statue and taking pictures was perfect. Things I recommend or noticed:-Go on a clear day if possible. The whole experience would have been different because if we went on a clear day we would have seen the statue sitting on the hill when riding up on the cable car. Since the Buddah is so large, on a clear day we would have seen the whole statue.-Surprisingly when we went, the Crystal Cabin line was longer than the regular cable car line. We only waited less than 10 minutes. -Know that the cable cars have vents. Since it was cold, it was also chilly in the cabin. I can't imagine how it would be if we went on a hot day.-Use the restroom in the little town before making your way up to the Big Buddah. The bathrooms are definitely cleaner/modern in the town. I didn't see any restrooms at the top of the Big Buddah, there was a sign that said restroom but we didn't find it. Maybe it's only available to those who pay for the lunch. There was a restroom closer to the Buddah (at the bottom, past the entrance of the Buddah) it was not the greatest! -Fyi the steps go straight up (with some landings to rest), they are steeper than normal, the staircases are a little tight (about 5 ft. across), and the steps are not that wide. I definitely had to take my time coming down because of the size of the steps. Just make sure you have on a comfortable pair of shoes.Just take your time if you need to. All ages were making their way up the steps."

Did not have to queue for the cable car at all, maybe just 3-4 minutes wait. We took the standard cabin as not brave enough to try the crystal cabins with see through floors.....The cable car ride took abt 20 mins and we alight at Ngong Ping Village. It is a really quiant place and I like the souvenier shops and eateries around the Village. There is even a Starbucks up there and Subway! IA couple more eateries (mostly chinese food) are available. f you are not keen on such food, you can hold your hunger and try the vegetarian food served in the temple. How this works...we were a bit confused so thought of sharing our experience.After walking through the village, head towards the foot of the Big Buddha. Just follow the crowd and signage. At the foot of the Big Buddha, you can see some booths selling some kind of tickets. These are meal tickets to eat vegetarian food at the temple which is at the foot hills opposite the booths. A couple of different tickets are available. One with a full vegetarian set meal at the VIP restaurant (think it is HKD88 per ticket). I chose the cheap ticket which is only HKD33 (includes a vegetarian snack & entrance to the Big Buddha (inside the body of the Buddha). You need to walk up tmany steps to the Buddha so for those who can't handle steps, please don't try...it was quite taxing honestly. After the long climb up and down and taking scenic pictures up the Big Buddha, came back down the steps and headed towards the temple for our snacks. The snacks are quite substantial with 4 pieces of dim sum, a plate of fried mee hoon, and 2 bowls of \"tau fu fa\". Yummy!!!After the meal, took a slow walk back to the village and enjoyed the weather. It was super cold that day so with the strong winds, it was quite nice. We took the cable car back and headed to the Citygate shopping center. It is an outlet store for all the branded stuff. Worth while walking around. Highly recommended place to spend 1/2 a day maybe?"

The surroundings is quite breathtaking and the good stair climb up to the statue it self almost gives you a religious feeling no matter how atheistic you might be. And yeah, the buddha is really big!Nearby you'll find a temple, that sadly was closed for renovation when I visited in nov-2013, some restaurants and a small commercial village kind of thing, surely it's there because the throughput of turists at this location. Given the many tourists I thought the level of crowd was a little bit bellow what I've expected, could be the heavy skys on my visit.There is two ways of getting here, take the ropeway or boat + bus. I would think the later one to be a little bit cheaper but more time consuming. I chose that one anyway as I love going on ferries, had friends taking the ropeway and the have some great shots (there is as I understood both cars with glass botom and without, they opted for one with). But ferry and bus is super easy and everything is paid by the superb Octupus card, the public transportation card. Ferries leaves from the central pier."

For whatever reason it seemed to connect to me. I never realised once you get up there that there was so many options. If you get a chance get there in the first part of your visit rather than the last part.I am not a relgious person so the Bhudda was OK but not the sole reason for the trip.Shops may be a bit gimmicky and the town purpose built to trap you and part you from your HKD but then hey not going to sweat that part.I think the reason I was so swayed by this as an attraction was because its basically mother nature. All hills and scenery. Rather than plastic fantastic Ken and Barbie type stuff at Ocean world and Disney.I also had to admire the many people making the big walks down those crazy mountain stairs. Good on you people.I travelled as a 45 year old with wife and 4 year old daughter. We did the see through cable car and so if you are not afraid of drops do it.OK so I have some photos for you. Hopefully it will sway you into going.Oh yes and we went by taxi for \u00a324 instead of the metro so it was easy travelling."

On the way there we looked at the statues on either side of the walkway depicting all the Chinese New Year animal statues. There were many of the Chinese people burning candles, which I believe must be about remembering their loved ones, and also how they they fetch gifts, it is very moving to witness them. There are many steps to reach the Buddha, but I am afraid I am not well enough to do this, my son and his wife have been to the top and thoroughly recommend it. We had a lovely time there, and a very enjoyable day."

Having been to Hong Kong twice before but always staying with friends and doing the 'local' thing, I wanted to see one of the 'sights'. I searched trusty trip advisor top ten attractions and read about big buddha so off we went. We caught the MTR which was super clean and easy, a short walk from the station to the gondola. Unfortunately we had a really hazy day so didn't see much until we came over the final hill where this giant buddha sitting on top of the hill cuts quite an imposing figure. Our friends living in HK find the little village and monastery quite touristy but we enjoyed it. With such a unique thing to offer people, I don't expect them not to try and make a buck or two. We wandered through the little village and up the stairs. On a good day there's probably quite a lovely view from up there. For me even the chance to take some great photos with the worlds largest buddha was worth it. I personally find HK quite dirty and ugly. Its not a city I would come to visit, I've only ever been through here on my way to Europe and after 3 trips would probably not go back again. Most people go for the shopping but with a 7 and 10 yr old boy in tow, that was never going to happen. If you've only got a day or two in HK, I would recommend big buddha. Gondolas are always fun, you get some perspective of the city which is not easy to achieve there and you get to see something totally unique."

There is no cost to climb up to and walk around the Big Buddha. If you wanted to go inside the museum inside the Big Buddha then there is a cost.

The Big Buddha is definitely a peaceful place that attracts tourists from far and wide. Inside there is a beautiful memorial for people who have passed onto the next life. There is a village that you need to walk through on your way there... if you catch the cable cars, of course, and you can get a bite to eat or look through some spiritual reading material at the bookshop!

The ride on the cart is very relaxing- takes about 20 minutes - great for pictures! When you get to the top, the village where the big buddha is, is so quaint and beautiful! Lots of shops to keep you entertained. The big buddha itself is really amazing - so much detail!!!! You will encounter many spiritual buddhists praying to the big buddha - it was so energizing and peaceful! The monastery was under renovation so we didn't get to see everything but what we saw was great! You can get tickets for the vegetarian meal with the monks - the noon servong is not too packed!

There is an air of serenity about the Buddha.At the top of the main stairway, it is possible to climb more steps and get very close, or you can just wander around and admire the other statues or the views, which are awe-inspiring, and provide many photo opportunities.Of course, there are shops at the top, should you want to buy your own Buddha, jewellery or other trinkets.Overall, well worth a visit."

Having lived in Hong Kong for years, I went to the Big Buddha every year or so, and it never gets boring. the entire experience is unique. take the ferry from Central to the little seaside town of Mui Wo, and then take the bus upwards to the top of the mountain where the Buddha \"sits\". it's a nice few hours walking around the area, and of course you need to walk to the top of the Buddha. if you're not impressed by this, I don't know what will tickle your fancy. the only downsides are food and the nearby monastery. the food is really mediocre and it's not like you really have any memorable experiences with the monks - it's more interesting watching Chinese give their respects to their elders at the various places you do that scattered throughout the grounds. they added to the total experience with the addition of the little village which leads into the Nnong Ping 360 cable car which is worth the effort since you've climbed to the top of the mountain. It's a beautiful journey down the mountainside and logically lands at a mall which is much easier to get a cab ride back \"home\". On the cable cars, if you can afford it, get the premium, glass bottom option - it's shorter lines and adds much to the experience. Oh, by the way, have lunch in Mui Wo before you journey upwards - you'll thank me later. Either one of the Chinese restaurants or look for the Italian restaurant on the other side of the bus stop. all great options."

Arrived at the top and pass through several shops and restaurants and then on the Ngong Ping plaza and up the steps to the Big Buddha. It is big and has a walkway around for interesting views across Lantau Island.The Po Lin monastery is also at this location (undergoing refurbishment in January 2014 so not accessible while I was there). Built in 1993, this is a tourist destination with little historical value, it is very good, but full or various tours and trips. There is no charge for the walk up and around although you can go inside for a fee.You will need to be fit or take a lot of breaks walking up the steps."

Although when you first get off the cable car, you are inundated with a theme park like feel of shops and restaurants. If you want to eat, I suggest the Po Lin Monastery for a good vegetarian feed. They have 2 set menus - a General for HKD 88 and a Deluxe for HKD 128. The menu depends on the number of people in your group. If you buy your meal ticket at the bottom of the steps to the Buddha, you also get entrance to the museum in the Buddha's belly, and you can see the Relic. But it's not that great, you can't get up close and you can't walk around the 3rd level of the museum. However - if you are going to eat at the Po Lin restaurant, you might as well see the museum because the price is the same."

Besides the Peak, this could be one of the more popular tourist areas. Normally I don't recommend touristy areas, but this one is one that is worth doing. All the pictures you've seen in magazines or online make you intrigued to go. But it really doesn't do justice when you actually arrive. TIPS: - Purchase your cable car ticket online if possible. Will help you save an hour of just lining up to get a ticket.- Glass bottom cable car is cool, but the view from the regular car is just as amazing. - Try to go earlier than later. You'll avoid the long line up for the return cable car when the place closes in the afternoon.- Make sure you have time to hike up to the Wisdom Path.- If you are at the Big Buddha area until closing and there is a long line, go straight to the sales counter and upgrade your regular pass to the glass bottom one and you will save at least an hour of waiting. Worth the money in my opinion.Overall, I think this is a place that you have to see. It doesn't get the full 5 stars, only because I don't think I'd rush back to see it again. But I would go if family / friends wanted an escort up there.This is just my personal scale so you know where I'm coming from.1 - Never Again, Avoid at all costs2 - Poor experience. Look for alternatives3 - Decent. Has pros and cons. 4 - Good. Would Recommend.5 - Incredible - Makes me want to come back and do it again."

Ride in cable car is very exciting and one of the best in the world. View of airport, sea, hills and forest underneath is really nice. The Buddha is on top of a hill , and one has to climb many steps to reach him. The clouds around the Buddha were making us feel we are in heaven. The view from top of the hill is very nice. There is a museum beneath the Buddha statue. There is a artificial village created for tourists to shop, eat and enjoy, on the way to the Buddha. Some story shows also go on for whole day, which are very educative. This is a must see sight for everyone"

We arrived at Tung Chung MTR Station from Cyberport at 8.45am and while our prepaid online tickets stated 9.15am, they did not deny us the 9am (normal) cable car ride. We alighted the cable car within 5mins of queueing and passed through touristy Ngong Ping Village before finally arriving at the entrance of the Big Buddha (about 5 mins walk). Note that there is a ticket booth there but only if you want to purchase the tickets to see the relics/scriptures, \"walk with Buddha\" or the vegetarian meal (I believe you can taste better vegetarian foodfare in other places). Otherwise, proceed through to climb the stairs up to the giant statue. I won't say it is a tedious flight up, it was an effortless and a refreshing morning for a short climb. (At least they have handrails in place unlike some 3rd world countries' temples with steep stairs and no handrails). Unless you are physically challenged, you may want to reconsider your trip up. In my memory, I don't think there are any wheelchair ramps around and in general, HK doesn't seem like a wheelchair friendly place anyway e.g. hilly places like Wellington Street.You will arrive at the \"bottom\" of the Buddha if you did not purchase tickets to go up, still quite close for some photo opportunities. There are some statues holding different offerings surrounding the Big Buddha. The view from up there is quite scenic, the breeze is awesome. It was only 9+am and there were not many crowds. Thank goodness! We walked into \"under\" the Buddha and there are 2 souvenir vendors there. Walking in, I realize that the place is actually a columbarium! I am usually not a big fan of touristy souvenirs but I thought I'd buy some mementos. The vendor claimed every item has been blessed by the monks and the proceeds go to donation for the temple. I am not a believer, but hopefully, the gifts would work its wonder for the Buddhist recipients. Walking down the stairs, we proceeded to Po Lin Monastery, which unfortunately was under some construction work and closed to public. Only managed to take some shots of the lovely flowers on the outside grounds. The people who manage the place must be obsequious Buddhists because I noticed a sign that states no consumption of meat on the premises. Good to take note of and respect this if you bought some non-vegetarian food items from the shops outside and wish to sit around the garden to have a quick bite.If you have planned your Big Buddha itinerary with a trip to Tai O fishing village. Exit the monastery and walk back down to the bus terminal. You can take bus 21 there if I didn't recall wrongly, remember to utilize your Octopus card. We spent about 3 hours at Tai O (just sight seeing, had a cappuccino at a cat cafe and local snacks) before catching the 2.05pm bus 11 back to Tung Chung terminal. While its not tedious, there's a lot of walking involved and I ended up with blistered sore feet, I suggest you wear proper walking shoes (and sunblock) for this day trip."

The BB is huge, it sits on top of 200+ steps and is well worth the trek up for the amazing views! There are 3 floors inside of the buddha, the ground floor is free and the upper 2 floors have an entrance fee but I didn't go in (I have no idea how much it costs to go in). There is also the Po Lin Temple but it was closed for renovations. Lots of shops for tourists to eat, drink and buy gifts to take back home so don't worry about having to pack food for the trip, it's very well equipped for tourists passing through."

There is an \"authentic\" Chinese-style village experience (viz many tack souvenir shops), Starbucks - the authentic Dalai Lama approved version probably etc etc etc.The Buddha itself is absolutely amazing, well worth the journey, and well worth the completely knackering climb up a gazillion steps to reach it. Incidentally I'm not fit, but not bad... and the steps are HARD WORK, anybody who struggles physically will struggle plenty if they try... very steep and plentiful.The other good part of the visit is the journey itself. You get to take a cable car from HK Central (and take the Metro there, it costs about a quid from anywhere in the city) and a round trip costs HK$150 - about fifteen pounds. The ride takes about twenty minutes and is awesome (and a bit terrifying if you're not good with heights).....Finally, ignore all the eateries and fast food crap in the village. For seven pounds and twenty two pence you can have a Buddhist veggie meal - and there is loads for this money - at the nearby soon-to-be-finished monastery. I was about the only old person in the room, mostly my fellow diners were back packers... but we all got really good value.So, a really wonderful site, despite the blatant cash cow that it is... a pleasant journey with stunning views and a good plate of food.

We decided to do one way Cable Car from HK to Lantau and Return by Bus (Guess it was number 25). Doing Cable Car is worth, However there are two kind of cable car Service, Standard and Crystal and was very confused on which one to chose. I decided to go by Standard and find it not worth paying Crystal Car for the extra penny just to see under your feet. You can get a very nice side views of the Mountain, Sea and the Airport. It took approximately 15-20 mins to reach there.There is a 10 mins walk to Buddha temple from the Cable Car station and approximately 100+ Steps to Walk up. There are plenty for shops for Coffee, Snacks and other interesting souvenir.Going to Buddha is Free, However the Counter before going Upstairs are giving couple of packages including Visit to a Museum + Light Snacks for HKD 30 Per person. DO NOT BUY TICKETS for the Museum, Not worth unless you can read Century Old Chinese scriptures.We visited the Monastery and enjoyed the Snacks which was offered from the Coupon. It was worth a try and would recommend to try the snacks available next to Monastery.The Whole trip took approximately 3-4 hours including leisurely walking and commuting so plan your day accordingly."

Located in Lantau, Hong Kong\u2019s largest outlaying island, Tian Tan Buddha or Big Buddha, as it is popularly known, is the largest seating Buddha statue in the world. This 34feet tall massive structure seated on a mountain top next to Po Lin Monastery is not the only reason you should go there. Spectacular natural surroundings around the island and a thrilling cable car ride also adds to the overall experience. Getting there is easy. Take the MTR to Tung Chung station and exit from Exit-B and take a 2 min walk to the cable car terminal. A round trip cable car ride will cost HK$150 while there is also a cheaper option of taking a bus ride. I would, however, strongly recommend the cable car option. The journey begins as you buy your tickets and embark upon a thrilling 5.7km cable car ride to Lantau Island that lasts about 25 mins and takes you through mountain ranges and over South China Sea offering spectacular views on the way. Once on the top take a short walk to the base of the small mountain on which the Big Buddha is seated. From there you have to climb about 260 steep steps to reach the base of the statue which offers a spectacular 360 degree view of the lush green Lantau Island. Climb down and visit the Po Lin Monastery next to the statue for a calming experience. If you have time you may also visit Ngong Ping Village which is a few min walk. Apart from experiencing the Buddhist culture and traditions here, you shall also get to experience a multimedia attraction named \u201cWalking with Buddha\u201d which depicts life and time of Buddha. The whole trip will take about 5 hours including to and fro travel time from city centre and site seeing. Expect long queues at cable car terminal if travelling on weekends. Check the weather before going as poor visibility may play spoil sport on a foggy day."

There is also the wisdom path, which is a 15 min walk from the Big Buddha, where you'll see beautiful enormous wood monuments with messages in Chinese (wish they had a translation to it). The Po Lin temple has pretty neat architecture, but there is not much to learn since there is no explanation about the history of the temple or the place itself. The Ngong Pong village where the Buddha is sitting at is a nice place to walk around. Several stores are available for buying souvenirs.

I think if I ever come to Hong Kong again I won't go there for the second time, as the place is overcrowded with tourists and for that reason didn't seem very spiritual to me. But since this was my first time I deemed it absolutely necessary to visit this attraction. Despite huge queues to the cable cars, I was not disappointed and consider the place worth visiting at least once. Concerning the cable cars, the best way of course is to book a private cabin, which is very expensive, if you are alone or in a small company. Yet to cut a little bit the waiting time I would recommend to buy a return crystal cabin ticket, which is not significantly more expensive compared to standard, but the boarding queues are sure shorter."

You go, you see it, you take a picture next to it, and then you post it on Facebook. This suits many but I had wanted to learn about the history. The little I did learn seem to suggest that it was new, not ancient and thus took away from my enjoyment. Had I known it was new, I may have skipped it. The views were not as stunning as The Peak because most of the area is greenery."

You can take the cable car which offers beautiful panoramic views. Although the line can be quite long I thought the ticket takers were quite efficient. I understand you can pre-purchase tickets which likely saves a wait if you are pressed for time. Once you get to the location you can take a leisurely stroll through the village. Sure it is a little touristy but there are some nice \"local\" gifts to be found and a nice lunch. The Big Buddha itself is relatively new but still impressive. There a MANY steps to get to the actual entrance so skip the workout the night before. Depending on when you arrive you may be inundated with crowds. Kinda comes with the territory. I found this attraction appealed to be more for the views and change of scenery from Hong Kong as opposed to any historical significance. I myself had quite the harrowing experience \"getting to\" the Big Buddha and \"returning\" back to Hong Kong proper.... But it's not a typical experience and all ended well. I recommend this attraction !!!"

We took the Metro from Kowloon - easy to access and quick and luckily we got there very early (as it opened) - we had no queues but when we came out later - the queue was very long. We couldnt believe it - but it was Hong Kong Sevens weekend so that could explain why. The cable car ride is an experience in itself - over water and with views for miles. You are able to see the Buddha and really appreciate its size from the cable car. The historic element of the site is fascinating with very good explanations and the village shops are also worth a meander into. We climbed up the stairs and into the Buddha - it was definitely worth it - you need to give yourself time to read everything there is to see as there is a lot! We stopped for a light lunch which I wasnt that impressed with - quite average in my view but fine. We were a group of adults on the trip and it was one of my highlights - definitely recommended."

A walk through the Fishing village was pleasant and we got the best oyster in a cheese and garlic sauce, prepared in the shell there.....a better introduction to Street food for the picky eater. At the Fishing village again it is easy to just get a bus back to the starting point. Prepare for a long wait to get onto the cable car - GO EARLY"

On this tour you don't get to climb the steps but instead the tour bus takes you the very top where the Big Buddha is. You could try ask the guide if you want to climb the steps I suppose. Had about 20 mins to take photos of the Big Buddha once at the top. The tour included a vegetarian meal which I think most people enjoyed.

The Buddha on Lantau Island was built in 1993 and is probably one of Hong Kong's main tourist attractions for both tourists and locals alike. To reach the Buddha you can either take the Ngong Ping 360 cable car or the ferry from the mainland to the island. The Buddha is open from 9.00am-6.00pm daily, it is a must when in the city. However, be warned get here as early as possible as it gets very busy. I will not lie this place is very touristy, I came here 16 years ago and it was much more unspoilt and peaceful. Nowadays there are souvenir shops, hundreds of eateries and lots and lots of people. Still it is worth the visit. Climb the 268 steps to see the 34m high bronze Buddha which took an impressive twelve years to build. The Buddha faces north to look over the Chinese people and it attracts people throughout Asia. This is accessible to both families and older people, just take your time climbing the steps, wheelchair users may have to admire it from the bottom. Once you have climbed the steps and marvelled at the Buddha, enjoy the sweeping views over the mountains, Po Lin Monastery (which is currently closed till Dec 2014) and the South China Sea. Try and choose a clear day to visit, to really appreciate the vistas.Don't forget to explore the other attractions on the island before you head home, including The Po Lin Monastery (when re opened), there is a great vegetarian restaurant inside run by the local monks, also take a wander along Wisdom Path and drop by the traditional fishing village at Tai O.There is lots to do here, but firstly just take a moment to stop and appreciate the remarkable and impressive Buddha."

Always reserve your place on line as this saves a lot of time by cutting out the first queue. Everyone says the Crystals Cabins are not worth the extra money, but what we realised on this visit was that what it does is jump the queues. Even getting our reservations on line, we queued for over an hour to get on the cable cars. If you can spend a bit extra, it would be well worth getting the crystal cabin one way just to save the time. Return queues are never as bad. Well worth doing this even if only for the cable car ride - fantastic views on a clear day."

The queue for the cable car up was long.Once there, if you only want to see the Buddha then 60-90 minutes to tackle the steps and look at shops / get refreshments is all you need. We did not visit the monastery. There was an interesting mix of people including those praying at the statue, some for whom it seemed like part of an exercise circuit, and others buying ice creams at the shop built into the statue. It felt like a very commercial form of non-materialism, not that I'm complaining having visited the Starbucks.We took the crystal car with the transparent floor on the way down. No queue and the ride was the best part of the day from my perspective. It is a long way up and unfortunately the haze did detract slightly from the views. Still very worthwhile though.Bus up and cable car down was the way to go to beat the queues. If you are longing for some exercise then not only are the stairs useful, but there seemed to be a hiking trail beneath the cable car route.Tung Chung, where the bus and cable car depart and return, appears to also be the outlet mall centre for Hong Kong. If you plan better than I did you may be able to combine the spirituality of the Buddha and the materialism of the Mall into one day."

The cable ride to the Big Buddha was really nice (peaceful and great views of the mountains and ocean), but it does go slow (about 30 minutes) and it's really high up in the air (they don't tell you this), so may not be the best for those fearful of heights. Once you get off the cable, there's a little village (basically for tourists) where there are souvenir shops and restaurants to eat and hang out. Further towards Buddha, there are some stalls with local food as well. Once you get to the bottom of the stairs up to Buddha, you'll see that there's an option to pay for a \"meal+entrance into Buddha\" when you're up top at the temple. I would advise against purchasing this. We bought 1 ticket and regretted it. There's nothing to see inside Buddha and the food is tasteless. The Big Buddha is definitely a must see and worth the trip even just for the cable ride over (the views of Buddha from the cable are really majestic)."

At Tung Chung, we walked 4 minutes through an outdoor plaza to the NP360 Cable Car Terminal, which will take you across Tung Chung Bay to NP Village (where the Po Lin Monastery and Tian Tan Buddha are located).  The 1st cable cars depart Tung Chung at 9AM, at this time you will not have a line (we went on a week end). It is about a 25 minute ride, depending on the weather. Ngong Ping 360 Cable Car is a spectacular 5.7km bi-cable ropeway linking Tung Chung and Ngong Ping Village. The Crystal Cable Cars (glass bottom) fee is (HK$149 one-way/HK$213 r/t).The regular cable car fee is (HK$94 one-way/HK$ 135 r/t).A combo round trip (crystal- up & regular car-down) fee is HK$190.The Bus (#23) to NP Village is adjacent the NP 360 cable car terminal, for those who want to take this longer journey (about 70 minutes) to NP Village, or are very afraid of heights.The cable car and the bus fees can be paid for using an Octopus Card.There are about 268 steps which must be walked to reach the Buddha. It is FREE!!. At the bottom of the stairs, vendors sell tickets (combo tickets for the Buddha Museum & vegetarian restaurant or Cafe'). You do not need to purchase anything to see the Buddha or walk the stairs up to the top. Great views of the whole complex and out lying areas can be had from the top. Buddha & Po Lin Monastary hours are 10AM - 6PM.We ate a wonderful fresh seafood lunch at Tai O Fishing Village. Take Bus #21 from Ngong Ping Village Bus Terminal to Tai O (20 minutes ride/HK$7). Buses depart NP Village at 20 minutes after the hour. We also took a Pink Dolphin tour (HK$20 for two). We saw the dolphins!!"

The views from the Buddha were great though. You could see the mountains and the cable car terminal which was pretty cool. If this is your first time visiting a buddha statue at this scale, I guess it would be worth a visit. If you've seen one in Thailand or so, than this isn't really worth going up.

It is a vegetarian lunch near the cafeteria of Po Lin Monastery. They have normal lunch room and deluxe lunch room. The price difference is only 5-10 USD difference between them. The deluxe lunch room have better decor and that is what I recommend. What you can do is purchase the Big Buddha ticket/lunch ticket and then let the ticket booth know you want to go to lunch 1st before going back to the top of the BIg Buddha. I did that on my most recent visit and we went into the cafeteria by Po Lin Monastery and ate a wonderful 4 course vegetarian lunch (soup, rice, a couple of vegetarian dishes). Then on our way out we did the Big Buddha walk to view the Buddha and helped us digest/walk off the great lunch... More info : This attraction will take you around at least 3-3.5 hours after your reach the Tung Chung MTR.Most location in HK with MTR can get to Tung Chung MTR in 30-40 mins each way. (so you need to plan a good 4-5 hours ). Also there is a shopping outlet at the bottom near the Cable Car / Tung Chung MTR station ( where you can spend 1-2 hours shopping ) . They also have a large movie complex. So this attraction can last you a good full day if you want to go to all the other events around this attraction. The break down will be :1). Wait for cable car tickets and getting on the car will take anywhere from Crystal Car (glass bottom - 20 - 30 mins ) and standard car (30 mins to 40 mins). They do offer online ticket with appointment which I have not done, but can shorten your wait if you arrange it2) The cable car ride each wait is 20-25 mins . There is only a wait going up , and the wait down is only 5-10 mins.3) You need at least 30-40 mins for lunch4) You need a good 60-75 mins to see the big buddha and po lin monastery and take pictures5) On your way back on the cable car back to the MTR station, you can spend another 30 min at the Ngong Ping village."

My advice is to do the bus up and the cable car down. The bus trip takes about an hour on winding roads. You will see a lot of Lantau island by taking the bus. When you are tired after climbing the 200 steps to the big Buddha take the 20 minute cable car ride down. The little tourist town at the base of the temple is only good for a snack and toilets, unless you enjoy the touristy stuff."

To avoid the crowds we left early and took the MTR to Tung Chung Station Exit B and from there the 23 bus to the Po Lin Monastery. You can catch the 23 bus to the right of the stairs to the Ngong Ping Cable Car. (The cable car only begins running at 10:00 so you can get there earlier if you take the bus.) We enjoyed the bus ride and views enroute. We arrived at the Monastery shortly after it opens to the public at 10:00. It was great to be there without the crowds that I understand arrive later. We were able to walk up the 268 stairs to the Buddha without a crowd and even were able to take pictures without others getting into the frame."

I took the bus when I visited the Big Buddha as the Cable Car service was temporarily unavailable due to their annual maintenance. Nevertheless, it was still interesting as you would get to see the amazing coastal view as the bus passes by the side of the cliffs and there was a big lake too.Once you reached the base of the Big Buddha, you will be surrounded by the beautiful mountain scenery. The long flight of stairs might seems intimidating to walk up too but when you reach the top, you will think it is worth it. you could stop half way if your legs are tired, I have seen many other tourists did too, even me too as I was carrying my heavy tripod and backpack. At the top, take a moment to look around and feel the serenity and not forgetting the amazing Big Buddha!You can choose not to purchase the meal ticket at the base of the stairs leading to the Big Buddha. There is also stalls selling finger food and drinks on your way to the base of the base to the Big Buddha."

Leave the station and proceed to the cable car station. The cable car starts at 10AM and I believe the cost was about $150HKD for a roundtrip.First way is to take the roundtrip cable car up. If you arrive late, expect a 2-4 hour queue! No kidding.....the lines were endless.Second way is what we did.... arrived about 9AM, and took the bus that was next to the cable car station......bus #23, and cost was about $18 HKD per person. At this hour, the mountain was completely fogged in. Really didn't make sense to wait for the cable car to open. The bus is about a 30 min trip to the Buddha. The day we went, we were the first to enter at 10AM, and had stunning photo's with no one else in them! Also, the Buddha is free to enter.After, we wandered our way to the cable car office and payed $94 HKD for a one way trip down. Upon arrival at about 11:30, we were amazed at the massive queue waiting to go up! If you're on a tight schedule.....I certainly recommend getting there early!"

We were able to enjoy the amazing views with no loud noise either. I would highly suggest going to see Big Buddha, and doing it in the morning.Also, it is totally worth it to take the cable cars back down the mountain. We took a taxi up, which is much quicker than a bus, but figured we would take a cable car down. It was incredible! The views were stunning and it was an awesome way to see Lantau island. Its worth the cost. We didn't do the clear bottom car and had just as good of time."

Suggestions for visiting (via cable car) the Big Buddha:- If you are in Hong Kong for several days, check the weather forecast before buying tickets online.- 24 hours in advance, buy tickets online. - If you cannot buy tickets with your laptop, tablet or smartphone, ask your hotel\u2019s reception staff or concierge for assistance with purchasing tickets. - Book the crystal cabin cable car.- Go on a weekday.My husband and I visited the Big Buddha on a Friday in November. We purchased crystal cabin tickets for 11:15am and printed the confirmation at our hotel. We arrived at the cable car terminal at 10:30am and saw a long queue of people. Not knowing where we should go, we showed our confirmation to an employee. He pointed us in the right direction. We walked past everyone waiting to buy tickets. It must have taken those people two hours to reach the ticket booths. By 11:10am, we were in a crystal cabin cable car and on our way to the Big Buddha.I thought it was worth the extra money to ride the crystal cabin cable car. It was fun looking through the glass floor, seeing everything below. (The day I went, the wait for the crystal cabin was shorter than the regular cable car.) I loved the cable car ride. And it was so exciting to see my first glimpse of the Big Buddha from the sky!For me, the Big Buddha is a must-see in Hong Kong."

It took about 45 minutes to trawl (speed!) up the mountain to the top. It was a pretty nail biting experience but the views going up are mind blowing. To reach the Big Buddha you've got to climb around 400 steps but it's well worth it. The views from the top are absolutely breathtaking and it felt very peaceful, even amongst the thousands of tourists. Highly recommend."

You have two options to see the Big Buddha. One is to go on the Ngong Ping 360 cable which takes about 20 minutes to reach Ngong Ping village and the Big Buddha but if you have not prebought tickets and the line up is humungous you might want to opt to take bus 23 up. The bus ride is a bit longer but then you get to 'tour' part of the island. You can take the cable back down. We are not Buddhists but is was exciting to climb up to the Big Buddha. At the base of the Big Buddha you may be pressured to buy tickets for the vegetarian meal but there is no need to oblige if you are not decided. We did not buy the tickets and glad we decided so. Later one when we had come back down and strolled around we found a food stand close to the vegetarian restaurant where we could pick and choose what food we wanted to eat and enjoyed that instead."

This place big Buddha needs atleast 4 hours because come with a package called Air-Land-Sea.

The views of the surrounding countryside from the top were awesome and worth the climb.The monastery was shut for renovations whilst we were there (late November) which was a shame as it looked splendid under its wraps.There were side trips available but we were under time constraints so did not go to the fishing village etc.IMPORTANTI strongly advise that you arrive very early at the cable car ticket office as the queues are obscene and you will waste your whole day waiting to get up & down.

We headed back to the steep climb of stiars, but we bought a ticket for around 10/20 HKD to go into the BUddha and see the museum and have a snack in the Monastery. You don't have to do this, you can go up for free and just see the Buddha and the outside of the Museum, but then you wouldn't be able to climb to the top and emerge outside, right near Big Buddhas head which is a great shot for photographers.The climb up wasn't too strenious but pace yourself if you are not a regular walker or don't work out.Again because it was foggy we coudln't clearly make Buddha out until we got nearer the top, but it was absolutely breath taking and the sheer size and grandure of the Buddha is awe inspiring."

It is even more impressive as you come near and be amazed at its sheer size and beautiful golden colour. It was well worth the long bus journey from Tung Chung as the cable car was closed due to the typhoon. Large open areas with various food and gift shops. There are lots of stairs to climb up to the top. One can enjoy vegetarian lunch at the Po Lin monastery."

I had no idea what to expect as we traveled up that smooth, terrific cable car ride, and when I saw the Budda in the distance on the mountain, I was so impressed! The entire village up there is lovely from what I saw during my brief stay....I was more concerned about climbing up the stairs to see the Budda close up and it was definitely worth the climb!! The entire experience was very memorable and the views were spectacular!!"

Take time to look around the area too.The place is SERIOUSLY touristy though - especially the skyride and Ngong Ping village (not a village so much as a row of tourist shops that you are hearded through at the top of the cable car).I seriously advise getting the bus up and the cable car back. You'll save yourself hours of waiting time and get to see parts of the beautiful Lantau Island too. The bus is pretty cheap $9 ish I think. It takes about 45 minutes, but you feel a lot less sheep-like (being hearded around the place) and the views are good. We took the cable car down - the queue was soooo much shorter than at the bottom! You can make the wait even shorter by getting a crystal cab with a glass floor - you get fast tracked - we waited about 5 minutes (compared to the hour or so at the bottom and maybe 20 minutes if we hadn't paid extra at the top). The cable car is definitely worth doing for the experience, but do it from the top not the bottom!"

The stair climb to the Buddha isn't as bad as it sounds, and many people rest on the way up.If you want to go into the upper areas, then buy an offering or a museum pass downstairs before you climb - turning around and climbing down then climbing back up isn't a very attractive option after you get to the top!The views are really quite stunning."

We queued for 2 hours to get our tickets and thought we'd made it to the front then had to queue for another hour and a half an hour to get on the cable car. Obviously it is a popular attraction so I can totally understand why it was busy (also, it was a Tuesday so not even the weekend or anything). The cable car ride was a bit sketchy as it was so windy but there was some really beautiful views. My advice to anyone who wants to go is: buy tickets online in advance. You still have to queue to get on the cable car but at least you'd avoid queuing to get tickets. Also, get there early so you can spend a few hours exploring without feeling rushed. The last cable car is at 6 so we decided to get a bus back down to Tung Chung to avoid queuing again."

When we saw the queue for the cable car up to the Big Buddha, we were pleased we had chosen the bus (it was 1pm on a Monday). Look for bus number 23 at the bus station outside, it was a decent (single decker) bus and cost HK$17.20 for the 40 minute ride up the hill. The views on the way up are pretty impressive but the road is steep and winding, so if you suffer from travel sickness you might want to be prepared.The day we went it was very windy at the top - it was the after effects of Typhoon Haiyen. The Ngong Ping village was ok for a wander, one of those new Chinese style villages done out to look old! The walk up to the Buddha itself was fine, 259 steps I believe but with plenty of places to stop and have a rest if you need to.The top platform had the big Buddha itself surrounded by smaller Buddha statues, there were a lot of people there giving offerings. The small museum underneath the big Buddha was interesting, telling different stories of the origins of Buddhism.We then went to Po Lin monastery, but unfortunately it was under renovation and covered in scaffolding so we couldn't see the outside properly. Inside, the temple was lovely, lots of offerings and Chinese calligraphy hangings.On the way down we decided to get the cable car (HK$94), it ended up being a bit of a scary ride down as the winds were very strong. We were rewarded with amazing views of the Buddha, surrounding hills and the airport.Definitely worthwhile doing, when we went it wasn't too crowded at all and was a great experience."

Thus, I was so lucky to be on one of the first gondolas towards the Buddha.Once you get off the station, just follow the signs and you will anyways already see the Buddha from far away. Even though it was unfortunately raining that day, it was a great experience! Shortly after that I continued the way towards the \"Wisdom Path\" - due to the timing I happened to be there alone! What a magical experience! Lovely view into the next valley and standing in the middle of the clouds from time to time.From here you are also able to do great hikes! If I had known that i had brought better shows (really steep partly so hiking boots or sneakers with good grip are necessary).I went back around 12:30pm and there was no queue for the cable car back. When I reached the main station the queue was about 800m long. Being early out really pays off and gives you a much better (less crowded) experience!"

You may want to pre-book and just collect your tickets which will save you time.The airport is close by and if you are taking an evening flight back, a great way to end your trip to Hong Kong is a visit to the Big Bddha. You can check out of your hotel and leave your luggage at the storage facility before you ride the cable car. You will save the both time and money.The cable car ride is amongst the best that we've seen anywhere in Asia. You get great views of the island, airport, the ocean and the Big Buddha from the cable car. Once you get off the cable car, you enter the village which has a host of restaurants and shops with a wide variety of souvenirs to suit every budget.The Big Buddha is a short walk from the village and you pass through arches and statues of the 12 generals.

The cable ride costs 160 for a return ticket(202 for the glass floor- and no, they don't take the octopus card...) which is a 15 min ride( really nice but the glass is so dirty so pics turned really blurry). You get to the peak and you see the huge Buddha on the mountain - breathtaking !Then you have tons of shops(weird ) selling stuff ( actually not expensive).

Equally impressive is the bell inside and the relic (remains) of Buddha himself. No photos inside to be respectful. It was a pretty humbling experience overall and well worth a visit. Definitely a \"must do\" attraction in Hong Kong."

This is definitely worth a visit, we joined a tour of Lantau Island which included a coach tour around the island, a visit to a fishing village called Tai O, tour of the Buddha and lunch at the Monastery and cable car to the coach park for the journey back to Hong Kong Island. While I would definitely re-visit the monastery I'm not sure I'd bother with the other attractions. Instead would take the Metro and cable car to the top instead. The Buddha is huge and we could see it from some of the roads as we drove around the island - it seems to float above the trees. The site itself is interesting with explanations of how the Buddha was built and paintings etc.. It wasn't too busy when we visited even thought it was a Saturday. The views from the top could have been amazing but it was quite cloudy when we were there. Similarly on the cable car down you can see the Airport and watch the planes landing and taking off, again a bit hazy. The vegetarian lunch was basic but seemed freshly prepared. It included sweet corn soup, rice, vegetables and some sweet dough balls & pancake type puddings. There was plenty of it too. All in all I would definitely recommend it"

It's totally worth going purely for the gondola ride up and the buddha himself is so impressive. First and foremost: go as soooonnn as it opens. I can't stress that enough. We arrived right away (we took the MTR - so easy) on a Sunday morning for 9am and there was zero line - it was practically empty. Got our tickets for the gondola, 1 glass bottom on the way up and 1 regular for the way down. I definitely recommend getting at least 1 of the rides with the glass bottom. The gondola is SO HIGH so it's an unreal view looking down at the water from the gondola. The ride is incredible. So much to see, you have a birds eye view of the airport, and you can watch all the crazy people who chose to hike to the top hah. It's about a 30ish min ride and again, definitely worth the cost to do it. You get off and have to walk through a disneyland type village full of shops, 7/11s, and random restaurants before you even get to the staircase to the buddha. My husband had to grab some cheap sunglasses because he forgot his so if you also need something like this, get PAST the village and you'll see some tented shops on the left which are way cheaper. You climb a heap of stairs which was fine, but we are both in shape (they are pretty steap), and arrive at the base of the massive buddha. It's really breath taking. I'm soooo happy we were there before the tour buses arrived, because you wouldn't be able to enjoy it as much with hundreds of people swarming all around you. We practically had the place to ourselves. We didn't buy a ticket to go all the way inside, just walked around the outside and that was fine for us (no fee to just walk around, you really only pay for the gondola) - you get the idea of it. After that we cruised over to the monastery, but again just walked around outside as we didn't want to be disrespectful and that was fine. We watched people lighting incense and praying before walking in. After that we decide it was time to go and took the gondola back (we were the only people on the way down) and already noticed the people going up had packed cabins! We got off the cable car and the lines were already out of control - it couldn't have been much later then 11am by the time we left. Overall, this was a very impressive thing to see and the gondola ride was amazing - such an experience. I definitely recommend making this trip while you're in Hong Kong, but go early!!"

You have to take a bus to get back to the train station. The hike follows the path of the cable car and is quite strenuous since it only goes up and down the hills. Quite a beautiful hike if the weather is not to hot. The day I did it with friends it was the coldest day I can remember in Hong Kong with the highs in the mid 70'sF."

On walking to the giant Buddha enjoyed the view from various angles and even loved the climb up the stairs. Was mesmerised by the swarm of large dragonflies half way up. Felt humbled to see people at prayer within the Buddha. Paid to go up the inside and see the beautiful circular wall painting and all other artefacts. The view from the top again was amazing. 360 degrees over Lantau Island and looking onto Po Lin Monastery and surrounds. Again overwhelmingly breath taking and beautiful. Chose to have the vegetarian lunch at the restaurant at the monastery. I'm really glad I did this even though to be honest I didn't like the food. I wanted to experience as much as possible and was amused when I was seated and found myself looking at a variety of bowls and was unsure which was for what. It reminded me of the cutlery confusion in the west. Enjoyed browsing the shops at a the village and did purchase lots of souvenirs. Found that I had been there for hours but my time had passed quickly and I enjoyed every incense filled moment of it. Came away from the village by bus and took the ferry to Hong Kong Island to enjoy seeing another route. A quick trip on the fabulous Star Ferry and I was back in Kowloon. All in all a fabulous day at a place I have long wanted to visit and enjoyed every minute of it. I have great memories of a great day."

Despite going early there was already a line even when we arrived 40 minutes prior to opening. There are options to go via a glass bottom cable car which does cost extra. If you do opt for this option, you may wait a little longer than those who chose the standard cable cars. So perhaps take the standard up and the glass bottom back (you do have that option also). The Big Buddha itself is quite impressive, but we found it disappointing to see all the commercial stores including the likes of Starbucks and Subway located up at the base of the Buddha. There are some stores that sold some traditional asian treats so that was great."

The 'village' is in fact the usual food outlets e.g. Starbucks, subway etc, some souvenir shops and an outdoor stage where a bare chested guy was doing some juggling and making balloon shapes. Not exactly the spiritual context we were expecting. I do wonder what the monks make of this tourist nonsense literally on the doorstep of their place of worship. Unfortunately, the Po LIn monastery is being renovated and was covered in scaffolding and plastic sheeting so another disappointment. The Buddha itself is impressive and there are more nice views from the top but as we then had another hour plus to queue for the cable car back down we just felt that it wasn't worth it when there are so many other things to see and do in and around HK.

The vegetarian lunch at the monastery wasn't very good, but maybe the deluxe lunch is. It's also quite expensive at $10 USD for Hong Kong, but I suppose it's worth it to support the monastery. Ngong Ping village however is very commercial and forgettable if it were not so tacky. They have a wishing shrine bodhi tree that is plastic! Nice way to spend a few hours."

So I took the \"Ngong Ping 360\" cable car to see the Big Buddha. The little \"village\" itself near the Buddha isn't anything to write home about.. its just a small collection of shops and restaurants. The shops seemed to be slightly higher priced than similar tourist shops in Hong Kong, but not terribly so. I really enjoyed visiting the Buddha statue itself - it is big, impressive, and worth the visit in my opinion.Some people seem to be negative about the Big Buddha because it is a \"touristy\" destination, but in my opinion it's a sight worth seeing. And while you're there, light some incense and then have some lunch. Plenty of worse ways to spend your time!"

There are 2 options; the regular one which is 230 and the other which the floor is made of glass for a better view and that one is around 310. In my opinion the regular one is good enough because is has an excellent clear 360 window.Up there in the Buddha there a Tea shop that I loved... Also some restaurants and souvenirs stores."

We joined a 360 tour which, although it cost a bit extra, it allowed us to go to the front of the long line. You can take either a normal or a glass bottomed \u201ccrystal\u2019 cable car but be aware - it is extremely high up there and the ride lasts 25 minutes. You can walk through the tourist village (full of tourist shops-some of which have free wifi) to the base of the Buddha. We counted over 270 steps up the hill to his feet. If you pay an entrance you can go inside but the outside has some interesting carvings and the view is impressive. Apparently this Buddha faces to Beijing which is the opposite way to most Buddha\u2019s. I suggest you add a walk over to the temple and past the Chinese zodiac warriors as part of your visit. The tour we did also included a bus ride to a local fishing village which was ' fishy' experience ' with stalls of dried fish and a madcap ride in a boat that suddenly became a scary ride out to spot 'pink' dolphins-which we did see but I was not impressed with the boat driving skills. It was obviously a tourist spot but memorable for the houses on stilts."

The best part is going up to see the buddha and walking around. The monastery was closed now due to reconstruction and they said it will be closed for about a year. Overall a nice visit.

The cable car queue is long so it's better to purchase ticket online two days in advance to beat the queue. Choose crystal cabin if you're ok with see-thru glass bottom in the cable car. The cable car takes about 25 minutes to reach the top. There are restaurants (Starbucks too) and souvenir shops right outside the station. Walk about 800m to the bottom of Big Buddha. Here you mount the steps to the foot of Big Buddha. Nice view from the base of Big Buddha. When you return to the bottom via cable car, take bus route S1 to airport.

A few were closed though and if you are thinking of doing the cable car trip at the same time then check its open, we turned up and it was down for maintenance.Back to the Big Buddha, pay for your ticket at the bottom, enter on the right, exit from the left, the ticket gives you a bottle of water and an ice cream when you reach the top, you will need the water !The anticipation of getting to the top was better than the arrival, unless you are a Buddist I am sure, however the Big Buddha was created in 1992, for some reason I expected it to be a lot older.It is quiet a sight from below looking up.The view is great from the top and gives you a full 360 view.The steps do take some time, we stopped at every level and drank, I guess we are not fit and used to the weather."

If you are not staying on Lantau Is then take the MTR to Tung Chung station and then either the cable car, taxi or bus. The cable car at Tung Chung was closed for maintenance when we visited so we took the No. 23 bus from the nearby bus terminal. If you take the bus go early especially on a weekend as the queues can become quite long. The drive is quite pleasant passing over the mountains along the coastline and then a winding climb back up into the mountains again. The Big Buddha statue is quite dramatic and while there are over 200 steps to climb to reach the top the view of surrounding mountains and the sea is quite lovely. When we visited the monastery was covered in scaffolding so we couldn't see much apart from the courtyard. We did however go on a short walk along the Wisdom Trail which runs from the base of the Big Buddha and ends at the base of Lantau Peak. There you see on a small slope facing the peak an area with 38 wooden columns with calligraphic inscriptions of the Heart Sutra on them positioned in the shape of an infinity symbol. It is a striking image and its location amongst the greenery and the mountains makes it a place for quiet contemplation if only for a few moments. Allow 20 minutes or so round trip for the walk. From the Big Buddha we took a bus from the terminal at the tourist village near the cable car stop to Tai O fishing village. An interesting short excursion. From the village you can take a 30 minute boat ride through parts of the village and see the small houses on stilts and the bridges that connect the 2 banks. On our trip we were fortunate enough to see some white dolphins in the open water just outside the breakwater which creates a safe harbour for the village. There is a bus that returns directly to Tung Chung bus terminal. Allow say 6 hours for all these activities."

Took the MTR to Tung Chung station. The Citygate outlet shopping mall is right next to the station. Took MTR exit B and followed the sign and crowd to the Cable car station. It was a Sunday of a long weekend and China's Golden Week holiday - the queue for the cable car was long. Took almost an hour. The cable car ride took about 20mins but was comfortable and relaxing. Upon reaching Ngong Peng 360 Village, staff would be showing you the photos they have took of you in the cable car. They must have very good eye sight to spot the on coming guests. Ngong Peng Village is very clean and very touristy. Several souvenir shops around here. At least there's no touting or haggling. Followed the sign towards the Big Buddha.The climb up the stairs literally take your breath away. Remember to stretch or you'd end up with stiff muscles the next day. It would had been a nice quiet place, with views over the top of rolling hills, if it wasn't for the crowd and loud giggling groups of foreigners. One would have thought to observe the serenity and peace in a religious place. I guess it had became too touristy. Most Caucasian visitors were respectful and enjoying the scenery. Only a bunch of really loud and joyful expats who were more keen on taking group pictures than to enjoy the moment. Probably should avoid coming on a Sunday when most of the expats are off duty.I made my way to the Path of Wisdom in hope to get some peace and quiet. After about 15-20mins stroll under the hot sun, I came upon another group of loud folks. This time from another continent. Resting their tired legs in the middle of the \"Path\", talking on top of their voices, and had no regard to others in the vicinity. According to the brochure, one would be able to walk quietly on the \"Path\", to reflect on the Buddhist teachings. It was too painful to endure the din to walk any further let alone gain wisdom.Walked back to Ngong Peng Village bus terminal to catch bus no. 11 to see Tai O fishing village. The bus runs on a schedule and it was displayed at the bus stop. Bus fare is about HKD 14 on a weekend. Long queue again."

I followed the trail of garbage from the stalls to the bottom of the stairs to the Big Buddha. Walking up the stairs I had to dodge hundreds of people taking \"selfies\" like the Big Buddha was a Disneyland attraction or something. Once I reached the Big Buddha I again followed the trail of garbage around the terrace, observed people deliberately trying to destroy statues by throwing coins at them (despite the signs begging people not to toss coins), and tried not to photobomb the tourists taking group \"selfies\".Walking back to the bus depot I noticed the fake \"village\" created to take money from visitors exiting the gondola. It was a gross demonstration of consumerism and \"religious fashion.\" The only real experience I had there was when some cows wandered through the village on their way home for the night. They stopped and checked to see if anyone had treats, then continued on their way. So, if you like cows, go to the Big Buddha. Otherwise, go to a small neighbourhood temple for a more authentic experience."

Once arrived on the plateau, you can visit the small village and have a coffee or a meal while you admire the view of Buddha, climb up to the statue - which is not easy as there are a few hundred steps - visit Po-Lin Monastery and not to miss a short but memorable trip by bus to Tai O fishing village which I enjoyed the most of the whole day.Try to have good walking shoes, a photo camera and if possible a binocular.A windy weather should be avoid for the cable car transportation."

It was a lot more expensive than the regular car and therefore no wait. Hey, we were not going to line up at 35+C heat!Buddha was ok. A lot of steps to walk up to see it which made it hard for older folks. Food in the restaurant was mediocre. The shopping strip outside was totally commercialized, nothing peaceful and serene about it."

            "review": "Must See!. Second time to see the Big Buddha, this time with the whole family.Firstly, try to avoid weekends and holidays, and preferably book on line.We chose the Land and Sea package with a standard cable car, ie not the Crystal car with the see-through floor.Try to go earlier than later, as there are a few things to do and see, and it Is generally quieter and less of a wait then.The 360 Cable Car Station is easily found, signposted and very close to the Tung Chung MTR station and Citygate shopping mall.Warning: the cable car ride does carry you quite high over the water and hills, so you need a bit of a head for heights. The ride takes about 25 minutes, and will give you amazing views and many great photo opportunities.Once at the top, the Ngong Ping village is great for food, drinks and souvenirs. The steps leading to the Buddha are a short walk away, as is the Po Lin Monastery, the Ngong Ping Piazza and the bus terminus.You need to be a little walking fit, as the walk up to the Buddha takes it's' toll in the heat/ humidity,but again gives you very rewarding sights and photographic opportunities. Like any excursion out in Hong Kong, have plenty of water with you.With our Land and Sea package we had unlimited bus service and used this to get to Tai O fishing village and the boat ride the package includes. The village is in stark contrast to flash and glitz of downtown Hong Kong. It is dirty, run down and odorous! Still an experience non the less.The boat ride provided some perspective into the village way of life as you glide along a sea channel that is quite scattered with rubbish, and we see into the everyday life of the village and it's people.We were then taken further out to sea to see the white Dolphins. It was quite industrial out there, with large tankers, container ships and cranes all close by, but we did get a glimpse of the famed White Dolphins, although my photography skills let me down, and Three times I only managed to snap the end of their splash after they had submerged out of sight!The ride took about 30 minutes.We had a hot wait of over 45 minutes for the next bus to Ngong Ping, and weren't inspired to venture anywhere else in the village.Back to the top, and we got the cable car back to Tung Chung."

I wondered if it was Disneyland that was the big attraction, then feared it was the Big Buddha. But of course, I should have guessed - it was Tung Chung with all its factory shopping outlets. The Cable Car up to the Big Buddha was great - not worth getting the \"Crystal Cabin\", in my opinion. The BB himself is worth the climb, as much for the views as anything else. And, as with everything in HK, if you can pick a clear day it's much better. We couldn't, but it was still worthwhile. As for time, and how long it takes, I reckon we left Kowloon around 9, and we were back around 1215, without feeling as though we'd rushed it."

It gave a good impression of the beautiful surroundings of the Buddha statue and seeing the statue from the cart was also a nice experience. Before visiting the Buddha I walked around a bit, looked at the statues of the twelve generals and the area surrounding the temple. If you want to see the Buddha upclose you'll have to walk 200 stairs towards the humongous statue, sometimes you might even see a monk crawling up the stairs. Even tough the Buddha was recently built (1993) and the whole attraction is quite touristic, I enjoyed the experience and missing it in would have felt like not seeing the leaning Tower of Pisa while being there."

The main area is a huge tourist trap, with many souvenir stands but nothing that would steer me away.The climb up to the Buddha itself was a lengthy set of stairs, about 200, with plenty of room to rest along the way up, if needed. The views from the top are great, with the ability look in all directions. I would highly recommend an early arrival. Once the bus groups start to arrive, it gets very busy and there is limited room. I arrive as soon as access to the Buddha opened and that allowed me to get some great pictures and move about easily.There are a couple of ways to get to the Buddha, including taxi and cable car. I took the glass-bottomed cable car and found the ride excellent. Tremendous views in all directions, including through the bottom of the car.

There are a lot of souvenir shops and restaurants in a small complex on the approach to the Buddha. I didn't have time to stop, but many of them looked very good quality. Be sure to visit the monastery across from the Buddha. There is a lot of remodeling or repair work going on right now, but the lower level is open and worshipers leave offerings and have their fortunes told by shaking a bamboo stick out of a cup. There is also an excellent vegetarian restaurant and cafe on the grounds - to the left of the main monastery building as you come into the complex."

I didn't book in advance and there was plenty of space. I bought a single fare because I wanted to take the Cable car and MTR back. When we arrived in Mui Wo on Lantau there was not much signage to Po Lin Monastery or the Big Buddha so I just asked around. It was 45 mins before the next bus so I chatted to a couple with a young child and we took a taxi for the 40min journey which was only about 50HK$. Getting there early is a definite advantage because you are ahead of all the tours. There were only a few people at the top which was great. I went into the small Museum at the top (underneath the 32m high Buddha) and while there is not that much to see it is definitely worth reading the history of how the magnificent Bronze Statue was built with considerations for withstanding Typhoons and how to erect the 230 tons of thick bronze panels. After Lunch at the Monastery to strolled through the very touristy village on the way to the cable car. There are 2 types of ticket with the 'Crystal' tickets being more expensive - they have a glass floor so you can see down as well as out. The Cable ride is very spectacular because you get good views of the Buddha as you depart and then magnificent views of the airport from high up on the mountain as you descend to the MTR Shopping complex at Tung Chung Station. I was amazed at the queues at the station for the Cable car. It was definitely a good idea to go via the ferry and return by Cable car."

Obviously the cable cars were managed properly with each cabin's capacity arranged by the staffs.The ride itself was about half an hour. Yes, pretty long I must say. But it was scenic enough to not get boring. It would serve you good if you are in one cabin with polite people, since the ride could be really peaceful and calm overlooking the vast landscape.We had quite a nice walk through Ngong Ping village on the way to the Buddha. They have various shops selling quite a range of local products. Restaurants were also enough to get by. The stairs climb to the Buddha, though considerably high, was pleasant. It's amazing how the Buddha can be so huge as you get nearer.All in all, not a bad experience. Just for the Buddha, I guess."

We walked from our hotel at the Harbour Grand Kowloon, to Hung Hom station easy walk approx 10 minutes.We found it easy to catch the train we changed trains at Nam Cheomg and arrived at Tung Chung station which is right next to the cable car.Our total wait was 10 minutes that included buying our cable car ticket. We bought the chrystal ticket for the glass bottom cable car this appears to be quicker as not as many people purchase this ticket.The trip on the cable car seats approx 6 to 8 people and takes 20 minutes to get to the top.Extremely scenic ride on the last leg ensure to look down as thre are several water falls and yes it is a long way down.You will notice the athletic people below doing the 10 k hike up all the steep steps a good few hours in that trek.Plenty of shops , we had kebabs which really were terrific.236 steps up to see Buddha himself all in all a good half a day out."

Access is easy by MTR to Tung Chung station, then a short walk.At the other end of the cable car, you'll need to walk through the theme park / shops / tourist-rip-off places, which seem to be everywhere. But it's easy enough to ignore all that. Walk through, and climb the steps. On a hot day like we had you'll be able to get an ice-cream at the top.Although there is no fee to climb the steps or walk around at the top, we gave the Monks a donation - it seemed a reasonable thing to do."

Be warned there are a lot of steps up there, hard going in the heat. If you buy a ticker you get a free bottle of water and ice lolly at the top :) its a lovely site and interesting to see the ancient manuscripts and statues. at the Big Buddha there is a themed village (shopping area as well, selling pretty trinkets etc, and many restaurants etc). You can then catch the cable car which is situated right at this site. we paid extra for the glass bottom cable car, it was more interesting and far less of a queue! it takes you past the airport to a much more developed part of the island (the contrast is noticeable) , where you can pick up the MTR. we found it worth using both the ferry and the cable car, as the contrast in different parts of the island, plus getting to travel across the island, was well worth it."

Told by the attendant after we had queued for 20 minutes to reach that attendant that the cable car was not operating. As we were in the middle of the queue, decided to tough it out. We were to travel to the top by bus. But the bus ran to the normal schedule ignoring the fact that the passenger numbers were at least doubled. After being in the queue for more than 1.5 hours, we finally reached the head of the queue to be told that we had to pay cash and that we had to have the correct money as the driver gave no change. The bus trip was almost an hour - virtually circumnavigated the whole island. Took one look at the number of steps so decided to see the Buddha from the bottom. The sight was impressive. Had a look around the monastery - although much was under construction. Told we had to go to the Village to catch the bus back. Yes, it was hot. Yes, another queue. First two buses - around 30 minute intervals - were quickly filled. Tried for a taxi but the price was HK $150. Miraculously a third bus arrived off schedule - maybe someone told the bus company that the cable car was not running and there were more than 50 waiting for each bus. Concensus was that the trip was a waste of more than 6 hours."

Once at the top you will have fantastic views and the Buddha itself is incredible. go over on a glass floored cabin worth the extra cost.

Bring an umbrella if you can, cause no shade when walking towards the buddha.

If you've spent any time in China, you'll have seen enough Buddha's already, but this one is definitely the most impressive. Perched high in the hills on Lantau Island, the Buddha is good to see... but the views from the top are great.Getting to the site can be done by road or cable car - we went for the cable car as the views on the way are impressive (even if the price is almost as steep as the mountain).Prepare for 'tourist central' at the top cable car station... 'the original chopstick house' and 'real Chinese treasures' -style shops are everywhere... but power past these to the monastery site. The veggie food there is better than the tourist-focused fare lining the route to the monastery. I'd recommend going for the cafe/snack option as it's super cheap and arguably better than the restaurant food."

The big Buddha was amazing though and the lunch there was beautiful even though it was all vege. Our tour guide drove us nuts, her name was Kimmie, she never shut up the whole trip. Not everyone needs to know every tree, or what food she likes, and that she is on the hunt for a husband, really? Most of the gift stores and markets were shut due to the cable car maintenance.

There were no kung fu shows that day on the stage due to the intermittent rain we had but the shops were great - especially the HK Love shop. Some really adorable panda items - like an airplane pillow panda, passport holder, numerous other items hard to resist that I didn't see anywhere else but here. Unless you want to wait in line for literally hours, buy the most expensive chairlift ticket up to the village. It's just not worth waiting in line for the small difference in price of the tickets. some people took a bus up. I didn't check out that option. When you get to the village there is a climb to the Buddha - but it's fairly easy. It's NOT worth paying for the extra ticket to go inside this Buddha museum. Certainly not as awe-inspiring as the Leshan Giant Buddha, but very worth while seeing and a nice break from the massive crowds in Hong Kong. There will be people here but if you're not here during a Chinese holiday, there seemed to be plenty of room to move around freely and get good pictures. The Po Lin Monastery was closed when we were there but they let you know that ahead of time if you look on the website. you could still walk around the grounds."

It's quite impressive from a distance but you really get a sense of size and workmanship when you et up close. There is a museum inside the Buddha but no photography is allowed. It's not an attraction for the infirm as there are 270 odd steps from the bottom to the top. Organised tours can take you up the road to the rear of the statue which would be a better option for those that don't wish to do the climb. The Po Lin Monastery at the base of the Buddha was closed for renovation but there is a nice avenue lined with statues representing the 12 Divine Generals and their significance in the Chinese Zodiac.

Even on a sweltering day, being so high up meant a reprieve from the heat, and a chance to catch our breath and simply take in the amazing scene. The cable car seems to go on and on, but in a good way. We couldn't believe that such a thing had been built. And in many parts, the fact we couldn't see more than 20 metres ahead due to the fog, only added to the experience. The Buddha itself is impressive, but not overly so. Be prepared for the steps, around 280 of them from memory, and that is from the base. There is a Starbucks in the general vicinity, and other eateries as well as the expected souvenir shops. Do venture inside the Buddha; the tributes to departed are quite lovely."

There are a lot of good quality souvenir shops. We bought some souvenirs and the lady gave us a free voucher for a photo. They clicked 5/6 pictures and then demanded HK$560. When we refused to pay, they came down to $100. for 1 photo. and said buy at least 1. We ended buying 1 but some tourist refused to buy any and just collected their free picture and walked away. guess we should have done the same.We did not climb up to the Buddha.

I went on my own when my family was traveling and enjoyed it so much I returned two weeks later when they had returned. As previous posts mentioned, go as early as possible. My first visit I arrived at noon and waited for nearly two hours before boarding the lift. The second time we arrived at 10am and waited less than 15 minutes. I recommend reserving tickets in advance (lesson learned from first visit and horrendous waits) and suggest booking the Air/Land/Sea tickets. They are not much more and it includes the bus to Tai O and a short boat excursion to view the fishing village. Both times I visited I made sure to visit the Honeymoon Desert store - a cool/sweet enjoyment for a hot day :) I could do without the Crystal bottom lifts - I have done it both ways and after the initial \"cool\" factor of looking at the scenery down below, the rides were essentially the same except the wait for crystal lifts seems to be longer."

If you are not afraid of heights or have vertigo, I strongly recommend taking the crystal cabin.From the cable terminal, its a short walk to the Big Buddha, but there are quite a few steps to be climbed - but its not difficult. Take your time to enjoy the view while climbing up.From atop the steps, the view is sheer paradise - clouds, mountains, sun, ocean, trees. Though I would have preferred the place to be quiter, it was still beautiful & serene.The monestry was closed when I had visited, but the temple next to it has a very serene atmosphere.The entire experience was beautiful beyond words can describe - a Must visit for anyone who travels to Hong Kong!!!"

Heard many good reviews for this attraction on Lantau Island.The island is literally 20 minutes via metro or 25 by taxi or bus via Kowloon.Either choice will direct you to the cable car site, which takes you to the Big Buddha over hill and vale for a 15 minute ride.What the guide books don't tell you is that there is a very long queue to get on here - normally over an hour, we experienced a 2 hour wait when we arrived on Monday.We therefore spoke to a local and they recommended the No.23 bus which can be found 100 meters from the stairs to the queue - no signs at all giving this option (?).We took the bus (30HK$ each) and found ourselves at the Big Buddha 30 minutes later.Saving ourselves and our children a long time in the sun and waiting in a queue.The Buddha itself sits on a hill 800 meters from the bus stop, via 240 steps!Before you start climbing, you are expected to pay for entry INSIDE the Buddha, don't bother here as it is a big let down. You can see everything from outside anyway and all the views and photo opportunities you will ever need. Save your money.Views are fantastic.However, the Buddha isn't old at all (estimate 20 years - yes, really!) - it's very modern inside and you then begin to question why you are really there.There are some horrendous shops and tourist traps here, which make the area really crusty and frankly poor.When you walk back down to the choice of return bus or cable car, go for the cable car as the trip back is very scenic. Don't choose the Crystal car option (149HK$), go for the 94HK$ car as this is just as good - it's just a way of getting you to part with more cash.Really disappointing visit and I would recommend you visit other attractions in Hong Kong such as the authentic Sik Sik Yuen Wong Tai Sin Temple, which is really fantastic.If you do go to the Big Buddha - don't take the cable car up - go by bus, then take the cable car back down."

I love this area but it is a very odd combination of tourists and everything that comes with them (including a Starbucks, etc.), a couple of Buddhist Monasteries and, of course, the Big Buddha.The area is surrounded by some of the most beautiful scenery and there are various animals (mostly cows and dogs) wandering around peacefully. The Buddha, itself, is at the top of a very long and steep staircase that may be prohibitive for some visitors. Once there, however, the views are amazing and it's interesting to walk inside the Buddha and view the memorials inside it.An option with the price of admission, which helps fund the Po Lin Monastery, is to have a vegetarian lunch at the Monastery caf\u00e9. I'm not much of a vegetarian, but the food was delicious and was served \"home style\" with serving plates on the centre of the table.Well worth a visit if you're in Hong Kong!"

After a long bus ride (note - UK size coaches but with 2 seats one side of the aisle and 3 the other; obviously for smaller locals), it was a good job I took photos on leaving the bus because then the mists came down. On the plus side, at least my husband climbed to the top despite vertigo, because he could see nothing in the mist. The buddha is impressive, and the other statues; the museum in his belly has some interesting things, so is worth a visit.The entry to the Big Buddha and museum has the option of a vegetarian meal in the monastary - this is an incredibly cheap option, and the amount of food served is staggering - we felt embarrassed leaving so much."

The trains have illuminated maps, which are very helpful. At Lantau, we caught the Nping Gong 360, a cable car that travels across the Bay up the Mountain to the Buddha. There are fantastic views. On arrival at the Terminus, there are a number of restaurants, cafes where we had refreshments. There is a 300/400 metre walk to the base of the steps leading up to the Buddha. En route it is very photogenic. There are about 300 steps to the Buddha, which is the largest sitting Buddha in the world. There are spectacular views in a very relaxing atmosphere. At the base of the steps there is a Temple worth a visit. The Buddha is a must do in Hong Kong.

A good couple of hours can fly by just wandering around getting some lovely photos. Would suggest an early morning start to avoid queues at the cable cars and the midday heat whilst at the top of the Buddha. During the winter months, you can easily make it a full day out by taking a walk back down to town - there are easy and harder routes to take, you will need comfortable shoes for either type of walk and dont forget your water! Again there are some spectacularly breath taking views to be seen and on one of the walks you can pass through the monks gardens/allotments which feels very spiritual."

Although clearly done to attract and amuse tourists it was a marvelously skilled performance.Avoid: The vegetarian meal ticket provides you with a low quality meal and gives you entrance to the smallest and least articled museum in Hong Kong. Certainly not worth your money. Strongly suggest you opt out."

Tour short tracked us in (massive)cable car line so worth it just for that. Big Buddha is great, nice views and statues, monastery worth a look, (fishing village pretty slummy & not picturesque), only had 1/2 hour at each place but it was enough as their is not a lot to see. Would have liked a bit of time at cable car end stop near BB, as their were some interesting shops and cafe's. Glad we decided to take tour rather than get ourselves round, as \"sights\" on Lantau island are a bit far apart, we'd have spent all day getting or waiting for trains, busses & ferries and it wouldn't have been worth it."

It took us an hour to get to the ticket booth, then over half an hour to get into a standard gondola. The ones with the glass floor took even longer. Once on the go the view was spectacular.At the top there was plenty to see and do, just make sure you're prepared for all the stairs to get up to the Big Buddha. Speaking with other people a bus trip to the top appears to be the way to go, but then return by the gondola. The bur ride I believe took an hour, but didn't involve the long wait for tickets."

Sunday 30 March Was visiting with DW, DS(16), DD (13) & DD (10)We caught the MTR to Central and then to Tung Chung on Lantau Island to catch the cable car to see the Big Buddha statue. Overall the set up was well organised. We paid for a glass bottomed cable car. It was a long and spectacular journey over Tung Chung Bay and from the cable car you could see a number of people trekking through the forest to get to the Monastery. It looked to be a very good and challanging walk.At the top of the mountain the village had a number of different shops and stalls and it was all much more commercialised then when DW and myself had last visited some 19 years ago.We climbed the steps and had a good view of the Giant Buddha. Overall it was very impressive. Unfortunately the fog meant that once again we did not have the spectacular views over the mountains and Islands that we had hoped for.We walked down the steps (again, much easier than climbing up!), had some Subway sandwiches and caught the cable car back down the mountain. We waved to all the other cars coming up the mountain to see how many people waved back. At one time DD 10 hid, as she believed that the people in the other cable cars were only waving to her. I proved this to be false when I waved at people by myself, although the others replied this was just because I looked like a simpleton and people probably felt sorry for me."

We were there just near opening time so we didn't really have an issue with queues ( it was also a Monday morning) however once we got back to the beginning, just after lunch time, the queues were massive. So we were lucky.The Buddha itself was amazing. It is worth the climb to the top as the views from the other side of Lantau Island were spectacular. It definitely looks like an area worth exploring. We were lucky and seemed to get a range of weather from misty to clear blue skies and once we got back to the city it was raining. So it's worth checking weather conditions on Lantau Island before you go as it may not be the same as in the city. Even if you have a 6 hour or so stopover in Hong Kong, Id say you could consider this trip as its very close to the airport. The only issue would be queues at the cable cars. A possibility may be to investigate a taxi or a driver as another way to get there. Much nicer option than a shopping mall."

We had a couple of excellent tips on going to the Big Buddha that paid off in spades.Firstly, take a hat or an umbrella, it can get very hot and there is a lot of reflected heat off the stonework and footpaths.Secondly, there are two ways of getting up to Nhing PO; the cable car and the bus. The lines for the cable car at Tung Chung can be massive. Take the bus up about HKD$17 on weekdays and you can use your octopus card. Weekends are slightly dearer. Catch the cable car down. There is less of a clamour to get down in the car. We had 4 people in ours while the cars that passed us coming up had 8 or 10 people in them. Also, if you can stretch the extra $20 or so, get a crystal car. These have see through floors and the view is spectacular. If you are taking the bus (especially if you have small kids) make sure that you are not the last people on the bus as you will be standing and the road is quite windy. There are lots of buses so don't panic if you need to let one go to get on first on the next one.Before you head up the stairs, go to the small kiosk to the bottom right of the stairs and buy your entry ticket into the Buddha. This will also entitle you to a free ice cream and a bottle of water.All in all we had an awesome day at the Big Buddha. Highly recommended!"

The Big Buddha, known as Tian Tan Buddha, is technically in Hong Kong (on Lantau Island where the airport is located) but it's about a 2 hour trip from Hong Kong Island where I was staying. I took the train for about an hour and then a bus for about an hour before reaching my destination. It's pretty much a full day affair so leave yourself enough time, but it's certainly worth the time and effort. Once you're there, you have a choice of taking a cable car or bus to the top of the mountain. I waited on line for the cable car until I saw how high up the cable car was and since I get dizzy on the cable car on Disneyland, I got out of line and took the bus instead. Once there, you climb 240 steps to the top and can walk around different levels of the Buddha. There is also a working monastery there called Po Lin Monastery where you can have a vegetarian lunch. The large bronze statue is called Big Buddha for a reason-it's 112 feet (34 meters) high and weighs 250 metric tons. It's actually a statue of Buddha Amoghasiddhi and symbolizes the harmonious relationship between man and nature. It's a pretty impressive sight and definitely worth the trip!"

We decided to take Bus 23 back to the subway instead of taking the cable car back. The bus ride was 25 minutes but gave us a chance to see more of Lantana Island/beaches. Buddha was amazing--the view from the top is pretty."

The glass bottom gondola adds very little to the experience, but if you're curious, it's worth a try. The ride is very pleasant. You get nice views of the surrounding area and the airport. The second time I went, the area was foggy. It was so foggy that we couldn't see anything but white. It was a cool experience. Once at the top, there is a little \"town\" of souvenir shops, restaurants, starbucks, and a buddhist monastery. The public bathrooms are clean. There is also a theater that plays a for-kids show and an outdoor stage where they have a martial arts show (Bruce Lee vs Shaolin Monks, also for kids). The buddhist monastary had a vegetarian restaurant. It had a very cheap preset meal. I wasn't impressed and wouldn't eat there if I went again. The big buddha was nice to see and photograph. There is a souvenir shop and a snacks bar underneath the statue. To go up the stairs to see the base of the statue is free, but to go underneath you have to buy tickets at the bottom of the steps. Overall, it was a nice attraction. I recommend going if you have the time."

We got lucky and had a beautiful clear blue sky so it made the cable car journey much nicer. Lots of lush greenery, saw some small waterfalls along the way, and local fishermen down below in the shallow waters. The biggest suggestion I could make is to book your tickets online for the cable cars. I didn't realize you could, and waited about an hour and a half on a hot day. If you pre-book, you walk right up to a separate line, bypassing everyone else who are in line to get tickets. Also, don't expect to have your own car to yourself, unless you get a VIP car for a few hundred bux, but not worth it. They fill the cars with around 8 people, but on our way back, there weren't too many in line and they let us have one with just two of us. We did pay a little more for the clear covered bottom, which was pretty cool. When you arrive, you feel like you are in a small quaint village. Various shops and places to grab a bite on your way back. Why carry extra things up all those stairs?!? Which by the way wasn't near as bad as I thought it would be. But small children or the elderly may encounter some difficulty. Definitely was worth a day of it."

The Buddha symbolizes man's eternal quest for inner peace and when enlightenment happens, it is a profound experience. The main temple can be reached by climbing a big staircase or by cable-car. Either way, the moment you reach the top, you are bound to get awe struck as you see the Buddha sitting in a posture that displays the ecstasy of enlightenment. All around the statue are smaller statues of other celestial beings and his preachers. And, as you look around, you sense the piousness that permeates this place. A great pilgrimage !"

It was well worth the experience and seems like a Hong Kong visit \"must do\". The excellent subway gets you to Tung Chung, a small community just past Disneyland. Then you have a choice of hiking, bus/taxi, or cable car to get to the small community nestled up in the mountains. The last part of the trek is a large staircase up to the Buddha. There are three floors inside the building supporting the statue, including an elaborate relic shrine/display with a small crystal holder containing a miniscule amount of cremated remains (for a small fee you can visit this inner sanctum and you also get ice cream).I took the cable car as I was not prepared for a several hour hike in the hot humid conditions. The trail looked like it would be a fun physical challenge under cooler conditions; the cable car traced most of it directly overhead, over a combination of elaborate boardwalks, endless steps, rocky paths, and neat looking dips into and through the vegetation (see the pictures). The cable car was a bit of a white knuckler as a typhoon was moving in and cars were blowing around in the strong wind gusts especially towards the top of the mountain; seemed like the car in front of us was angled at nearly 30 degrees with some of the gusts but apparently this is a well constructed system. I chose the crystal car option which lets you look down straight down through the clear floor. The views are spectacular including a bird's eye view of the whole airport, the shipping lanes, and the approaching Buddha as you reach the highest elevation. The small settlement at the end of the cable car line has numerous restaurant offerings, tourist shops, a Starbucks, and even a martial arts demonstration/show.The Buddha was very impressive but the tourist hoopla seemed to detract from what should be a serene and spiritual experience. It felt more like a visit to the top of any large monument with panoramic views."

My only concern was the fact that parents with kids will have difficulty to climb. Wheather was good. Breezy and cool despite the summer season. Food shops were abundant. Yes. They have Indian shop with Vege food. And Chinese shop with beef noodles and pork dishes. The big Buddha has an entrance inside. Which u have to pay prior climbing up. So if u want to see what's inside you pay before u climb. There some replica of some Buddha statue and a huge bell. No photography inside. So don't bother going inside. Many people didn't. Keep the coupon of entry to redeem bottles of water and ice cream outside. Felt like I was on the Peak when I reached the 200 plus stairs. Worth the climb. But I might skip this if I can again."

Those physically fit can climb up to the top of the Buddha and can get a fantastic view. There is also a cobblestone path with souvenir shops which gives a feeling of being in a European city, a feel that one cannot get in Hong Kong city. Weather permitting it is a great trip to the Buddha. The cable cars with the crystal( glass) floor will give you spectacular views of the forests beneath. If its a rainy day, there may not be much that you can see. If its too hot, you will be too exhausted to appreciate the size and effort that has gone into the construction of the Buddha. Try and pick a day with some clouds, not much sun and no rain and it will be a scenic and serene trip."

The views in the distance is a wonderful experience, but when you get close you just have to say a prayer and say thank you. Its a very peaceful and calming environment to be in.There are 250 steps to get even closer to the Buddha, but unfortunate we couldnt manage anymore exploring because we had a baby and 4 year old and we wouldnt of managed those stairs.There are different ways to get to see the Buddha, there is a bus, tram and Cable Car.

If you wish to see the Big Buddha's exhibit and go to the highest point in the Buddha, you can purchase the vegetarian meal. The meal voucher gives you access to view the exhibits in the Big Buddha and climb up to the highest point. Looking down from the Buddha gives you a bird's eye view of Lantau Island.

Spent a good hour here walking up the steps to the Buddha and taking in a great view of the surrounding mountains. It really was breath taking. After visiting the nunnery next to the statue, we walked through the tourist trap of shopping, eating district on our way to the cable car. You will know when you enter the tourist area when you see the cable cars from different countries. Didn't find any interesting food here, but the cable car ride on the way back gave another great look and close to the MTR station. In the cable car you get a great aerial view of HK International airport and the surrounding areas. I wouldn't pay extra for the clear floor since the view from the side of the cable car is just as good, only worthwhile to cut the queue since the line is usually shorter."

We went on the cableway to visit the Big Buddha and although it was a very overcast day it added another dimension to the ride as we went in and out of the clouds and the Big Buddha suddenly appeared out of the mist. The climb up to the Buddha is a great experience that one shares with an array of excited foreigners and locals. We ate at the Monastery but although the food was great the venue was under reconstruction which rather detracted from the experience. This was my second visit with the first one being on a sunny day and I must say I really enjoyed both experiences. This is an amazing place to visit and to my mind the best of what Hong Kong has to offer."

There was a little confusion at the cable car because the first ticket counter you come to is a tour company selling all inclusive tours which we did not want. So if you want to do your own thing, ignore this desk and go up the escalators where you can buy a one way or return ticket. The trip is quite amazing even though I was not it my comfort zone. When you get to the top whatever you do, do not, and I repeat, do not buy water in the village. Walk another 2 mins outside towards the Buddah and buy your drink at the shops there for half the price, Water prices in the village are a rip off to say the least.After our visit we then caught the No. 21 bus down to Tai O fishing village and then from there, using our Octopus Card, caught the No. 1 bus to the ferry terminal where we caught the ferry back to Hong Kong Island. A very easy and inexpensive day. Visit the very helpful ladies at the Tourist Bureau on Kowloon and they will map out the day for you."

You can climb up to the Big Buddha via paved steps. You get to appreciate its size up close and also enjoy the vast space in the area for some excellent views. Walk to the Wisdom Path nearby, just 15 minutes walk via a trail, and you'll get to see some great views. Also try the vegetarian meals or simply some vegetarian snack at the deli behind the nearby temple. If you like the soft tofu with sweet ginger sauce, there is a stall to the left, near the arch along the stretch of park to the Big Buddha. You'll see the arch as you exit Ngong Ping Village and go towards the Big Buddha. They also sell some of the local street food."

Taking the Cable Car to Big Buddha feels like you are embarking on a journey to Jurassic Park, but first, you need to know how to get there.First, ask your hotel to call the Cable Car to make sure it's operating. Bad weather will prevent them from running the Cable Car. Take the Red Line to Lai King Station. Exit at Lai King Station and hop on the Orange Line all the way to Tung Chung Station. It's a cheap ride and takes all but 30-40 minutes. From the Tung Chung Station exit the building and follow signs past the bus stop to the Cable Car. If you are afraid of heights, the Cable Car will not be your cup of tea. Choose between the glass bottom cable car or standard. We enjoyed the glassed bottom car, but payed a bit more for the ride.You can also take a bus to Big Buddha. The bus will take you right up to the statue, and I believe there is a ramp that you can walk right up to him. This would be a better option for those who might struggle with taking a few hundred steps up to the base of Buddha.Before you even reach the top you will be able to see Big Buddha in the distance. It is a spectacular sight. When you arrive from the Cable Car, you will walk through a tiny village that has souvenir shops and restaurants. Go through the town, pass under the large arches and follow the path to Buddha. If you take the steps to Buddha, enter on the right. You can purchase a meal ticket, but you don't have to. We didn't, and we just walked around people and up the steps. Once you have seen Buddha, take a right at the base of the steps and follow the road sign to the Path of Enlightenment (I believe that was what it was called) or Path of Wisdom. It feels like a longer walk that it actually is, but it is beautiful. There you will see large wood pillars carved with Chinese text. It is beautiful and a bit magical, especially when there is fog in the air. When I was there at the end of May, the monastery was closed for repairs. Not sure when it will be open to the public again. Also, avoid petting the dogs. There are lots of them."

Note that the \"typical\" village at the arrival station of the cable car has absolutely nothing typical. It is brand new and has several restaurants such as Starbucks, Pizzas and Kebabs, Subway. There are also souvenirs shops. Then do not expect any authenticity...How to go there:Very easy! Take the MRT to Tung Chung. Then you can take the cable car from Tung Chung but there are long queues and it is not that cheap. Make it cheap? you can take the bus in front of the cable car station (well indicated). It takes more time but costs only 17HKD one way. The bus arrives at the same place than the cable car.On the way back, I walked back to Tung Chung under the cable car line. The trail is in very good condition and has impressive views on the islands. It's plenty of trees and flowers. The trail took me around 1h30-2h. Note there are many steps and then it is not for unfit people... The beginning of the trail is just behind the cable car arrival station. In the small village at the cable car station, there is an information center that provides very accurate information on trails in the area. Do not hesitate to ask them.Note that you can also take the ferry from Honk Kong and then the bus.. This is a less touristic route but haven't tried it. I've heard its very nice as well."

We stayed 4 hours and saw everything, including an excellent rope skipping performance. The return trip on the cable car is about an hour with queuing extra, so allow plenty of time.We went on a misty day which had fine breaks once at the Buddha. The queues for the cable car were long, and we waited about 25 minutes in the middle of the morning. We bought the extras package - silly idea as one of the events wasn't on that day and the other was included in the price of admission to the Big Buddha museum.The crystal cable car was a good experience though there was muck and grim over lots of the cabin windows. I didn't get one photo without a window splotch in it. The view to the track below through the glass floor was excellent. Superb views for the entire cable car trip of the bush and even the A380 planes taking off from the airport. Amazing.The walk up to the big Buddha is well worth the effort, and the museum inside the Buddha (entry fee) was interesting even though it was very compact and the lack of English made exhibits difficult to understand.The Po Lin Monastery's vegetarian restaurant is overrated. We had the Deluxe meal but it was served almost cold, and wasn't as flavorsome as you'd expect from the ingredients. The little outside cafe was much better and good value.The Po Lin Monastery was interesting though the area is undergoing renovations. There's a lot of incense being burned which can get overpowering in places.Overall, a great experience and a most interesting attraction."

The cable car journey takes approximately 15 minutes and is very breath taking... offers excellent views and multiple types of scenery. We got the more expensive 'crystal car' option which has a glass bottom - Its worth it for the ride up, and you can get a normal cab on the way down. One slight disappointment of the area is the extremely commercialized village which rests at the top of the cable car journey before you get to the Big Buddha... I understand it helps fund the area, but it is a bit out of place for the monastery.The Big Buddha itself is incredible, and definitely worth the easy journey (the subway system is excellent and easy to use). The day we went it was misty on the top of the mountain which really added an enchanting feel to the whole place... from below you could see the silhouette of the statue, and the mists would occasionally part to reveal the entire thing - really magical.This is an easy half day tour that costs very little and is very much worth it. I'd say this is one attraction you cannot miss."

To reach the Big Buddha you need to take a cable car which is for about 25 minutes and it is well worth the experience from Tung Chung to reach Ngong Ping. One can easily spend half a day through this very picturesque part of Lantau Island as you go up to the Big Buddha from Tung Chung. En route, you get an amazing view of the island, of the ocean, the airport and as you ascend towards Ngong Ping, you can see the Big Buddha which is very iconic and worth a visit in this region. I would say if you have just a day in Lantau, a visit to Big Buddha is a must even if you were to skip Disneyland, it is well worth a visit"

I've reviewed the Big Buddha as part of my review of Lantau Island, but I'll post a brief reprise of it here.The Big Buddha is the largest statue of Buddha in the world, it's massive and very impressive, it also sits atop a hill making it more so.The statue is at Po Lin Monastery, itself very impressive, but undergoing substantial renovations while we were there. Other than the footpath through the Hong Kong National Park whick snakes its way across Lantau Island up to Po Lin, we considered two ways of getting to and from the Big Buddha. Skyrail, the Swiss-built, longest cable car in the world with the aptly named 'monster pylon' takes about 25 minutes from Tung Chung MRT right up to Po Lin. The views over the mountainous national park and out over stunning coastal scenery towards the South China Sea are worth every penny of the fare.We queued for about 15 minutes for the cable car, but judging from the queuing areas, wait times at busy periods would get much, much longer.The cars are extremely clean, each one being cleaned before passengers get in.Those who are frightened by regulation cable cars may find this one even more so as it soars up over the waterway between the airport on Chek Lap Kok island and Lantau Island.The other option we considered was bus from Po Lin down to the coast at Mui Wo and then by ferry back to Hong Kong, directly or via Cheung Chau Island. A possible route for anyone not able to take the cable car."

Inside the temple, you'll find wall paintings depicting the life of the Buddha, and a souvenir shop for charms.The views at the top are majestic and worth the climb (if you're not there for religious purposes)."

It is a nice half hour drive around the island and I can thoroughly recommend it for a fraction of the price of the cable cars.Big Buddha can be seen from far away and once off the bus there is a nice walk to the base. There are no lifts, escalators or cars going up. If you want to see Big Buddha from here then you need to start climbing! I counted around 250 steps to the top stopping now and then to see the view and get my breath. I was surprised that there were no charges for entry apart from finally reaching Big Buddha. Entry is of course optional, but having climbed all this way I had to see inside. The charge was very modest and exchangeable for a bottle of water and ice cream so no so bad after all. The scenery particularly back down the steps to the bottom is breathtaking.Having descended, I spent some time walking around the area and there are some nice wooded walks."

The rail system is so good in Hong Kong that you will have no trouble getting out to Tung Chung where you can catch a chair lift or take a bus, both are wonderful experiences. As a regular visitor to HK (Family live there) I always make time to visit this wonderful attraction and enjoy both modes of getting there. The chairlift is about 7 kms long and takes you over mountain tops and gives wonderful views of the mainland, the airport and the wonderful inlets that make up the structure of Hong Kong. The bus trip is more colourful (and a tenth of the price) but takes about an hour each way and would only take it if you have time to spare. Once you get there you need to be fit to climb to the top of the Buddha statue as it is a fairly hefty climb. The whole area though is like a carnival with wonderful authentic chinese restaurants or the usual fast-food outlets that the kids will enjoy. Nothing is cheap including souveniers or food and can be a bit Disneyland as one reviewer has pointed out. But! this is a great day out and you can tie it in with a visit to the Tung Chung shopping centre which is the best ''Outlet'' shopping centre in the whole of Hong Kong and all the major brands are there (Reebok, Riverland, Louis Vuiton etc etc) at half the price. This day is a great day out for adults and kids alike. There is so much to do in HK but if you have the time try and include this day on your itinerary, yopu won't be disappointed."

Whether you travel from Central to Lantau Is. by ferry, bus, or MTR, at Tung Chung you transfer to another local Lantau bus (40min ride) or, board the cable car (30 min ride) to reach the attraction. Views on the way are equally spectacular to those from the top. Please keep in mind the weather; clouds, rain (mist) can accumulate quickly to block the view so if you have freedom of choice, go on a very clear day. In either case, though, the Buddha is majestic, whether shrouded in sunlight or mist, seated 280 steps high! Also note the wait for the cable car and/or bus from Tung Chung can be up lengthy (up to 1 hour) so to be relaxed and enjoy the surroundings, it is best to allot a half day for this excursion."

Take the subway to Tung Chung and then board a spectacular cable car ride. From the Hong Kong metro station to Tung Chung is 30 minutes and about another 30 minutes on the cable car. The cable car is a short walk across a plaza from the station. On a reasonably clear day, it's truly breathtaking with the mountains and the sea to look at. One amazing feature is that you'll be practically floating above Hong Kong airport for a thrilling show of planes taking off and landing. Below you can see streams and small waterfalls, and all sorts of shipping out at sea. The cable cars are enclosed and seat about 8 comfortably. For an additional fee you can choose a glass-bottom car for an extra thrill. The Big Buddha itself is a fairly recent addition to Hong Kong siteseeing. It, too, is beautiful, surrounded by beautiful views of the mountains and the sea."

If there is a chance of fog, don't plan on getting postcard shots of the Buddha, as the fog comes in and covers most of the mountains. That said, it is still worth a half day trip to see it, as it is the worlds largest seated Buddha.Unless you get there early, be prepared for a 'monumental' (no- pun intended) wait of perhaps a few hours for the cable car up. If it is foggy, don't waste your money on the cable car and instead take the bus (no. 23) up to the mountain. it runs frequently, only costs $HK 17.40 (exact change only) and takes about 40 mins? to get up the hill. But you do get to see more of the countryside (beachside) and your view wont be spoilt by the fog. (Then just catch the cable car back down :-)I'd also suggest getting some take away buns, chicken pies etc. from one of the bakeries at the MTR as a cheaper snack than on offer up at the Big BuddhaEntrance to the Buddha is free (dont get put off by the ladies selling meal tickets), and then its just up the hundreds of stairs (straight out of a kung-fu movie) up to the top.What is more worth the effort is the walk (15 mins or so) to the Wisdom Path (past the dodgy looking old tea plantation cafe)."

The weather was perfect which is a must for this trip. We caught the MTR from Jordan Station, where you can purchase a ticket right through to Tung Chung (change trains at Central). From there it is a short stroll to the cable car to Ngong Ping, a small village where the Big Buddha is located. We had to queue to buy tickets but it only took about 20 to get to the gondolas. We chose to spend a bit extra and take the Crystal Cabin, a gondola with a glass bottom. The cable car trip is about 20 mins and takes you over the mountain range. We found ourselves looking down over jumbos landing at the airport. Breathtaking views. The Buddha is well worth the visit but the Monestary buildings were being renovated so not much to see. The whole area is very picturesque and really worth a visit. Plenty of food available in the village and quite a few souvenir shops. A very pretty place and well worth the trip, even just for the cable car ride. The Big Buddha and Monestary are free. There are a lot of steps to get to the actual base of the Buddha but it only requires normal fitness level to get there. I noticed a lot of older people stopping for a rest on the way up."

I wanted to see this attraction for years, I had huge expectations before going there and once arrived it really was such a great experience.To get to the top of the Big Buddha is not so simple, is a grueling journey that sometimes lasts for hours.Proceeding step by step, first of all, the first step is to reach with the yellow Metro line to the last stop and Tung Chung terminal station, hence leaving the station just walk for a few hundreds of metres through the commercial area of CityGate to lie in front of the station Cable Car; This is the a starting point where cable cars reach the area near the temple, here are exhausting queues, there is a queue to buy a ticket and then the queue to get on the Cable Car between one and the other queue in a normal day can wait even 2 hours.I personally have purchased a ticket with a private tourist guide for a cost of approximately \u20ac 30 per person, this allows you to skip all the queues and have fast tracks gaining precious time.The journey on those cable car takes approximately 20 minutes, into these cabins by 6 people suspended in some spots even at 30-40 metres height, a truly fascinating journey and it is even more striking if you pay to have the car with the transparent crystal floor.To reach this place a bit lost there is another alternative to the Cable Cars is the hiking route through a long path that connects the city to the area of the Big Buddha. Once arrived at the station around the Big Buddha area there is a long avenue that leads up to the statue's stairway, this avenue is very beautiful, full of bars, coffee shops and souvenirs shops.Once near the staircase the atmosphere and calm that hovers here transmits serenity. The staircase is challenging, 250 steps, there is no other way to reach the top unless you climb stairs. Once climbed at the top the spectacle is assured, the statue up close is beautiful and a lot bigger than I expected, resting on top of a ridge where you can turn around 360 degrees all around the huge statue. Even the landscape is breathtaking valleys, couldn't stop taking photos.There is also a chance to get inside the statue but on one condition, dining in one of the restaurants near the Temple gets a ticket that entitles the entrance inside the statue. I've got inside but it is strictly forbidden to take pictures being a sacred place, and frankly visiting inside it I have not seen anything at all just a small museum with a ladder, some signs written in Chinese and nothing more, in my opinion not even worth it. I think the whole visit at most lasts for 2 or 3 hours after which you can return to the Cable Car, these close at 6 pm so it's very important not to be late ...Of course for the Cable Car you have to redo the long queue and this implies a further loss of time. It's such exciting experience and I hope with my review could be useful to prepare everyone to enjoy this wonderful architectural work."

The main reason for this is that the lineup of visitors trying to come BACK is huge, and the Crystal Cable Car service was super fast.

The crystal cabin is not really worth the extra cash because all you get is a glass bottom and there is not too much to look up (we upgraded on the way home to skip the line).The little village is fairly priced considering it is a tourist area and the walk up the stairs of the Big Buddha is not too long (it could be if you were under the weather or unfit, but just take your time)."

We did our own trip to visit the Big Buddha, we caught the ferry (HKD28.50) to Lantau Island then had a meander around the village before we got a taxi to the big Buddah, the taxi cost HKD150, the taxi took approximately 30 minutes where we saw some nice villages and the scenery was good, you could ask the taxi driver to stop to take photos if you wish.We walked up the 400 steps to the big Buddha and paid HKD30 to walk inside and see the museum, that was difficult as there was very little English for us to read, but this tick also gave us a \"snack\" at the monastery caf\u00e9, this consisted of a big plate of noodles, tea/coffee and two sweet treats, that was worth the ticket in itself. The view from the top was worth the trip in itself. We caught the cable car back down to the bottom at a cost of HKD94 that was also worth the ride down, the cable cars are very stable, my husband is always wary of heights and safety, he found it an enjoyable trip. We caught the MTR back to Kowloon at a cost of HKD17. So for a total cost for the two of us HKD489 or HKD245 each it was a good day out and we could do it at our pace. In total we took about 4.5 hours for the trip and that was a leisurely pace."

On peak seasons, I suggest to go with bus and to come back with cable car.- The location is near airport, so you can check out from hotel and store your baggage in the Tung Chung cable car station with HKD 50 if you intend to take flight after the visit."

Don't be lazy come up the stairs. There are also many mini stores with bargain deals on souvenirs. I bought beautiful hand made fan for like 2 dollars. Nice place to start experiencing Hong Kong with. It is on the same island with the airport. Beware of the weather. When I was there there was a really bad fog which made observing Buddha a bit worse then it could've been. Still very beautiful."

It took us the whole day to visit the Big Buddha, since we took the metro from HK Central to the cable car, and had to wait in line for what seemed like 2 hours. I enjoyed the cable car ride, although I don't think the Crystal Cabin is worth the extra money - I hardly looked at the floor during the trip - I was mainly looking out of the windows. The walk p to the Buddha is beautiful, there are lovely gift shops. You see the Giant Buddha right away - a warming presence which will make you feel an aura of peace. I will definitely come back to Landau again when I am in Hong Kong."

It started to rain heavily while we were at the top. We sheltered in the gallery inside the Buddha and we bought plastic macs from one of the shops. After donning them we walked back down the steps to the temple which is beautiful. The veggie snacks are really good so go for them rather than the lunch which is tasteless.

Lesson One: Slightly overcast weather in HK does not mean it is all clear on Lantau Island. After making the 30-40 minute MTR subway ride from Central, only then did we see the notice as we exited the station ... cable car closed for bad weather. I'm aure it would have been a magical trip, but the 40 miniute bus ride (No. 23) up the mountain is entertaining it itself ... and Big Buddah is truly an impressive sight.. Like so many things in Hong Kong, it is the scale that makes it worth the visit ... all 250 tons of it. Do the 260 stair walk up to the Buddah, it's not as hard as it looks, to get the real scale. We opted in for the monestary vegitarian lunch which was disappointing - but at bout the same price HK120 you would pay for a set lunch at a mid to upscale place in the city, you are better off grabbing a snack from the cafe.We also hopped on the bus to Tai O, a very real and working fishing village with the houses on stilts ... it's a ten minute bus ride from the monestary, just hope on the 11 bus. Finally think about taking the ferry back to Central from Mui Wo. Hope oin the No. 1 bus and enjoy the viewduring the 45 minute ride to the ferry teminal. The bus makes tons of stops and people watching as the passengers come aboard is interesting. All in all a fun trip and not difficult at all on public transit."

If you have 4+ hours to spend in Hong Kong, I highly recommend a ride up the aerial tramway to see the Giant Buddha and surrounding area of Lantau Island. First, you can save money by taking the bus from HKG to the base station. I think the bus number is S6. Catch it near the taxi stand. Plus, enjoy the double-decker bus!I do suggest you spring for the glass-bottom cable car. The view and experience are wonderful.Once on top, have a look around. There are plenty of sights, restaurants, and shops. While the whole place is trying to suck money out of your wallet, none of the vendors were pushy or annoying. We chose to walk down the mountain. It really takes 3+ hours to walk down. Even though the path is paved and has stairs (thousands of them), the walk is treacherous. Plan ahead to avoid an expensive helicopter ride down!Any experience on the mountain will create lasting memories. Highly recommended! Choose your own adventure!"

Before arriving to the monument we watched a short show of dancing dragons in the small plaza celebrating the Chinese New Year. The ascent of the steps to the Big Buddha was pleasant also because we could observe the kind of vegetation that is neither tropical nor alpine, giving to the landscape a characteristic atmosphere. The only problem we had was the very long queue at the departure of the cable car, perhaps because of the holidays.In any case it would be better to buy the tickets on line. A part of this the experience was absolutely recommendable."

There are a few options to reach the Big Buddha and since we were in Kowloon, we took the MTR train to Tung Chung Station and walked across to the Ngong Ping 360 cable car ride. The cable car ends at Ngong Ping Village and the Big Buddha and Po Lin monastery are nearby the village.As we were approaching the entrance of the cable car, we were offered discount tickets by a vendor who was equipped with a smartphone that could accept credit cards. We were a little unsure if we would be scammed, but went ahead (the credit card bill later showed that a Paypal transaction had taken place). The discount was for foreign tourists but we found shortly that he had sold us vouchers, not tickets. We still needed to exchange the vouchers for tickets at the counter, so we did not save any time and still had to queue up. We had to show our passports to exchange the vouchers for tickets. If you are making the trip, you might as well just go ahead and queue and ignore these vendors.We were at the cable car station at 10am on a Friday and the queue was rather long. There were no special queues for disabled, so I had almost an hour to stand in line. The cable car comes in two varieties, the regular and glass bottomed. The glass bottomed ride costs more and we did not go for it, as I have slight acrophobia. It is very easy to get on the cable car, as the floor of the cable car is level with the boarding platform and it does not move very fast during boarding. The ride itself is rather spectacular, changing angles three times as it crosses over a bay and hills. The initial climb provides a grand view of the airport. Ngong Ping village, at the end of the cable car ride, is a couple of rows of tourist type stores, selling souvenirs, shoes, t-shirts, trinkets and the like. The prices here are much higher than in town tourist areas, for example, Temple Street. There is a multimedia show called \"Walking with Buddha\", which we did not attend. A short walk from Ngong Ping Village is the Big Buddha itself. Named the Tian Tan Buddha, it has the right hand raised with the palm facing forward, which is the abhaya mudra, literally \"fearless gesture\". This is my personal favourite Buddha image pose which has the meaning of protection, reassurance and blessing. The Buddha image is 34 metres tall and can be reached via a staircase of 268 steps. As this was too much for me to walk up, my spouse undertook the journey for both of us.After visiting the Big Buddha, we walked over to Po Lin monastery through a square filled with statues depicting Buddhist deities. We had vegetarian lunch at the restaurant which was not particularly spectacular despite the price. There are actually many food choices besides the vegetarian restaurant and you can try these as other options.We then took the cable car back and stopped at Citygate Outlets, which is a full of discounted branded outlets, such as Nike, New Balance, Coach, Kate Spade and lots more. Typical discounts here run from 30% to 50%.It was in our plan to visit Big Buddha and then Citygate and it worked great as we were laden with shopping at Citygate. From our starting point, at the MTR at 9 am, we were at Big Buddha by 11am, lunch in Po Lin by 12.30pm, in Citygate by 3 pm and shopped till 5 pm before taking the MTR back to Kowloon. It was great way to spend a day in Hong Kong."

Beware though if you choose to climb the nearly 300 steps to the Buddha. It can knock the wind out of you. Be prepared if you must ascend these steps in the heat and humidity of summer. I found the cable car ride and the short walk through ngong ping village and the monastery quite interesting too. The souvenir shopping is not so bad either. Don't bother booking a tour. It is so simple to get there yourself. Take the MTR from wherever you are and get off at an interchange that will get you on the Tung Chung line. Board that train and get down at the last station--Tung Chung. Its connected to the fabulous Citygate outlet mall where Brand name goods go for up to 80% off even on off-sale seasons! Walk across the plaza to a pair of escalators to the cable cars. The 25 minute cable car trip is a shorter and more comfortable option than a bus ride to the top. Book your cable car tickets online. The line for pre-ordered tickets is always shorter than on-the spot purchasing. Round trip on a standard cabin is HKD135. The crystal cabin is awesome especially for nature lovers because you get a good view of the sea and mountain terrain. It will cost HKD213. Choose the mix option if you'd like to save a few bucks---take a crystal cabin to ascend and a standard going down for HKD190. You will appreciate the difference of the crystal cabin experience!"

One of my favorite days out during my trip to Hong Kong....take metro to Tung Chung Station and you want Exit B....I took the Ngong Ping Cable Car, it takes about 20 minutes but the views are awesome, I paid the extra for the diamond cable car which has the glass bottom floor so you can see right through, it's worth it in my oinion. Once you reach the top, you can stroll through the little village of shops before reaching the Steps to the Big Buddha which is a pretty amazing sight. Climb to the top for even more amazing views and photo oppotunities. At the bottom there is Po Lin Monastery and about a 10 minute lovely peaceful walk following the trail you will reach Wisdom Path which I particularly liked. It's a very dramatic sight to see, again with awesome views and for those you who are keen walkers, there is a walking trail which you can do if you have a few hours. It was very peaceful at Wisdom Path, definitely worth seeing. I had a full day here so I also went to Tai O Fishing Village, you can take bus number 21 from the bus station which is near the Big Buddha. Tai O is a small fishing Village with stilt houses, for 20$HK you can take the 20minute boat ride to see the stilt houses and Pink Dolphins.....although we didn't see any dolphins it's still worth the 20$HK. You can walk the whole island, it's only small but very quaint and traditional, definitely worth the trip if you have time. I visited the Old Police Station which is now a beautiful hotel which is open for you to look around and I also enjoyed lunch there with a view to kill. If you are there around sunset you will get some beautiful Photos from the harbour.To get back you can either take the number 21 bus back the way you came or the bus number 11 to the pier at Tung Chung for a one hour ferry ride back to Central, I took the ferry, it was a nice alternative."

Had we known that in advance, we probably wouldn't have gone or found another time. That said, after we got through the line, it was a lot of fun. The tram ride is quite lengthy and does go over a lot of water so if you are fearful of heights, you definitely want to avoid this. The view from the tram was amazing! And seeing the Big Buddha on top of the mountain as the tram ride comes to a close is really cool. It was very fun to walk up the stairs with all the other tourists to see the Buddha (a lot of stairs!) as everyone was enjoying the view and helping each other to take photos. The view from the top is great, and the Buddha is truly impressive in person. If you shoot with an SLR/DLSR, pack a fisheye lens for some fun photos of the Buddha up close. We had a great time wandering around - and the monastery close by is definitely worth visiting."

But the trip itself is really worth it as per my opinion. The cable car tour is really impressive and when suddenly the Buddha appears behind the mountains, it is really amazing.

I'm really glad we went. We took the ordinary ferry. We had planned to go straight to the Buddha, but there was no bus waiting. Instead of waiting 1 1/2 hours, we took the bus to Ta O, a wonderful little town. We just walked around and saw homes on stilts, homes of tin, a market, temple, etc. then we took the bus from there to the Buddha. Yes, the roads were curvy, but not hair raising as someone had written. The Buddha is an extremely impressive sight. For those scared of heights, the walk up is not difficult. There are many places to rest and a railing the entire way. Don't miss going to the top. There are beautiful distance iews along with being so close to the Buddha. We did eat at the monastery dining room. I was disappointed having expected monks to be serving. They didn't look like monks to us. I was ok with the simple meal. I especially liked the tofu with peas and corn. Because of my fear of heights, we returned on the bus, which was coming, so we missed the shops. We returned on the fast ferry by mistake. I definitely preferred the slow ones."

While you can hike to the big Buddha, the normal approach is via tram car (which leaves from near an MTR subway stop), then heads over water, makes a turn, heads up a mountain and partway down before going back up another part to the start of a walking path, then follow a walking path to the stairs below the statue, up the stairs and to the Buddha.I note that TripAdvisor rates this as 1-2 hours. I don't think that's enough time for most people to take the tram up, walk to the base of the stairs, climb the stairs to the Buddha, and then reverse the whole thing. 2.5 -3.0 hours is more like it.I found the tram ride to be one of the more interesting tram rides I've taken, both because there's so much variety, and because it's so long over such steep and varied terrain. And of course, if you do the hike instead, it's probably 6-8 miles and quite steep, with lots of elevation gain and loss (more than 1000 meters)?There were 5 of us, and we all enjoyed it."

Maybe it was just me being stupid, but I didn't realise it was quite so much of a tourist trap as it was. It was built quite recently, so not much history to it. The cable car was ok, gives you a great view of the airport and some greenery but not much else. Dim sum was horrible (that might be because we didn't like what we chose). It was lovely to walk around the monastery that was up there as well, but I wish we had chosen to see something else."

We felt Ngong Ping village, which you have to walk through to get to the Buddha, doesn't fit and is too modern and commercial. The walk up the many steps to the Buddha is all part of the visit and well worth it.

Just a short walk from the Ngong Ping village and cable car station you will find the Big Buddha and the Po Lin Monastery which at the present time is under wraps having some renovation work done. While you can pay a fee in the village for a multimedia \"Walking with Buddha\" attraction, you are also able to walk up to the top of the hill for nothing (all 268 steps !).To get inside the base of the Buddha and upstairs you will need to pay $30. To be honest aside from the free bottle of water and an ice cream that you get after the visit, it's not really worth it unless you're really keen to get inside. Note that you cannot take pictures inside the base of the Buddha, and the Buddha relic is not very visible either.The views from the top of the hill are splendid on a good day - I was lucky - but it was getting a bit murky on the ride back down in the cable car. I can imagine there are days when you can't see much at all.From the bottom of the steps to the Buddha it is a few hundred yards to the monastery where there are a few more souvenir shops. There are also several food sellers on the avenue leading up to the plaza at the base of the stairway."

Big Buddha is astonishing but equally so are the lovely buddhistic statues that surround the Buddha all in wonderful ritualistic poises.

If the queue is too long take the option of a tour. Not expensive and you will be taken to the ticket office and on to the cable car in no time. Our tour included a side trip to Tai O and a boat ride through the fishing village. Great fun."

It's an easy train ride from Kowloon to Tung Chung. The signs to Ngong Ping cable car are well sign posted but be prepared for very long queues. You will get pressured to buy tickets which include cable car, bus and other transport options. The confusing thing is when you buy a package you then have to queue further up to actually purchase the cable car tickets. We bought a Crystal ticket (clear bottom cable car) which seats eight people. The views from the cable car are breathtaking. If you have any heights issues you may feel unnerved looking down through your feet at the mountains below. You often see glimpses of the Buddha as you get closer - magnificent!When you get to the top there is a little village where you can buy souvenirs, food, cold drinks, etc. There are more stalls to see on the way to the Buddha - the crowds can be daunting as everyone starts to climb the many, many steps to the Buddha. You will be rewarded with breathtaking views. The Buddha is stunning! The temple is a short walk away where you will find carved dragons, elaborate gold statues and a myriad of flower and incense offerings. A memorable day's visit!"

You feel you are obliged to buy a package including a boat trip or some other inducement.

From there, we spent just enough time in the huge shopping mall to grab a snack and then immediately bought our cable car ticket heading straight in the mountains where the \"biggest sitting Buddha in the world\" sat waiting for us.The weather conditions were not optimal: on the way up, the highest parts of Lantau Island were hidden in fog. We could catch a glimpse of the Big Buddha through the mist. (On the way down however, we had the impression to levitate through clouds thousands of meters over the ground!) Before we were at the feet of the Buddha himself, who was also veiled in mist which gave it an eerie look, we quickly marched through the upper cable train station. This totally artificial village looks like a theme park with its many boutiques and snack bars. Once there, we also spent some time in the Monastery where the sent of incense is very strong. You can buy some yourself and stick in one of the many receptacles provided there.This short trip after three days spent in Hong Kong was a very welcome brake from its very lively atmosphere and heavy trafic."

With the Skyway you have two options: you can take the regular cars or the Crystal cars. Those have a glass bottom and the effect is really neat. It's an expensive upgrade though and we opted to do it only on the return journey. That turned out to be a good choice because with fewer people in the car, the view was better. However, even with the glass bottom we found ourselves looking out the sides more often. If I had to make the choice again, I would skip it. The Skyway lets you out in the Ngong Ping Village. This is a commercial place they have built to deal with all the tourists. As soon as you get off the Skyway, they want to sell you photos they took when you got on. The Village has numerous places to eat and bathroom facilities. After walking through the Village, you come to the Po Lin Monastery which is worth seeing. They also have a place to eat here. However, if you plan to buy the ticket to enter the Big Buddha museum, then they give you a meal ticket that is good in this cafeteria. They gave us about 5 times the food we could eat, so I'd plan on going to the museum and then eating lunch here. Finally it's time to hike the 256 steps up to the Big Buddha. At least we didn't feel we had to stop and kiss each step as we saw a couple of ladies doing. I will way that the Buddha is BIG! The museum is interesting and you should see it if you've gotten this far. All in all a very good day trip and worth seeing."

I had my 3 year old daughter with me, and my husband had our baby in a sling, so he was behind me further back in the line. After my 3 year old and I were in the line for about 15 minutes, she needed to go to the toilet, so I told the staff and they let us go up the top to the toilets. After, I thought the decent thing to do would be go back down to the end of the line as I couldn't see my husband with the baby, and thought I would catch up with him further up in the line. Another 20 minutes later, the staff handed out pamphlets explaining the packages for tickets for when you reach the top. They asked me how many people, I said me, my daughter, my husband and baby who were further up in the line- they immediately ushered me out the line \"because you have a baby\" and said for me to go find him. So I walked through the line, got to the top, couldn't see him, he had walked back in another area to wait for me to get to the top, so we were kinda stuck, and approached the counter- only to be yelled at for \"pushing in\" and sent back to the end of the line for a 3rd time. Couldn't believe it, I was nearly in tears and ready to leave before we even started. While my husband waited with the kids up top, I lined up again, asked about packages and how many people again- and then was told \"you go to the start of the line because you have a baby\"- - - told him to bugger off and I would keep my place in the line while the others waited for me. The staff member went up, spoke to my husband, then came back and literally dragged me to the front of the line, we were sold some package and they gave us a big discount which made up slightly for the wait and misdirection. We had a crystal clear cabin (nothing is too expensive in Hong Kong, so was probably worthy of the extra cost), although we did forget to look through the floor! As soon as we got to the top we were ushered onto a bus to drive down to tai-o fishing village, definitely worth the trip (and to include in the package), as if you're only likely to be in Hong Kong once in your life- you might as well see all of it). We went on the boat ride to see the pink dolphins (none there), generals rock, and wandered through the village for our free half hour. Lots of eye opening markets etc. bus took us back to the top, and was good to have the tour guide on the bus who explained a it more about the Buddha, fishing village, and ngong ping specifically being made for tourism (so I can expect that others might be weirded out by references to Disney style shops near a Buddha and monastery)- however the Buddha itself was built as a tourist attraction, facing north instead of south, to appease those who funded it in the first place. We left the guided tour when the bus got back to the top- as with kids we couldn't keep up the Pace, and hadn't had lunch by 1.45pm. We still made it to the Buddha and monastery, even our 3 year old climbed the steps. It was worth it in the end, though as a westerner, I enjoyed the fishing village inclusion more than the Buddha- keeping in mind that I didn't participate in the guided tour part for the Buddha and monastery, so probably missed out on some eye openers there. Excellent western food place right at the entrance to the village- I can't remember it's name but it had pizza too. Easy to get there on mtr. With children- I probably wouldn't allow just 1-2 hours, as by time you line up, get up there, find food, deal with kids, (plus see the Buddha/monastery- AND if you do the fishing village), our day started at 9.40am and we arrived back at 4pm. I thought we would be home for the afternoon but didn't happen."

Its easy to get to on the MTR, take the Tung Chung line to Tung Chung (end stop) in Lantau and walk straight out of the station towards to cable car lift. We arrived about 1530 hrs and didnt have to queue and had a cable car to ourselves the whole way up. The return cable car cost 160 HKD (approx 14GBP), and takes a good 20-30 mins each way. Make sure you have a head for heights!! Fantastic views and incredibly beautiful Buddha. You need quite a while at the top (2 hours minimum), and make sure you go inside the Buddha and up to the top. There are also some stalls which sell nice gifts etc, I shopped at these rather than the shops, not only were they much much cheaper, they sold nicer stuff that the shops that you walk past when you come out of the cable car. When coming down, the last cable comes down at 1800 hrs, and its very busy at that time of day. The cable cars have vents in, so when you go down its quite drafty on your back, so best to have a jacket with you to stop from getting cold. By far the best attraction in Hong Kong, and very green. If you have all day and are very fit, you can walk it there and back. But it looked like a really long path and you wouldn't want to be that far up when it starts getting dark.We used the MTR a lot whilst in Hong Kong, it is by far the quickest and cheapest travel option."

My advise there is a big que (almost take 1.5 hour) for cablecar. take bus, reach top and use cable car while you return . Bus trip also provide to see the island in general. It takes 30 minutes. when you reach buddha, you have to step, but it is worthful. there also temples on the top, I recommned to see, choose a sunny day to go there. there are two kinds of cablecar, standard (95H$/person)and the other one which has transparent floor, (more expensive) if you have vertigo second one is not recommended."

Once there, there is no charge to see the Buddha itself, although there are ticket booths which charge entrance to a museum(which i do not recommend if you are not into the spiritual stuff and dont understand chinese) with a free drink and ice cream included. I also recommend that you bring your own drinks because it is a long walk to the top to see the buddha. All in all, its a good way to kill time and do some sightseeing."

At the ticket box it was not clear as to what you got for your money or what was available. They do push the Crystal Cabins but in our opinion you really don't need to spend the extra money. We got the standard cabin ticket with the kids monkey show and the Buddha show. We had to wait about 15min to get on the cable car but the line moved quickly. Great views from the cable car. We walked thru the village and heaed for Buddha. When you go to go up the stairs you are then asked if you want to do a small museum at the top. We chose not to. We then headed up the 200 odd steps. Great views from the top the statue is amazing. We then headed across to the monastery. It is very much for the tourist. But worth the visit. We had lunch in the village it was great and cheap. Had a wonderful day well worth the visit. They do take card to purchase tickets for the cable car."

The queue to go back by cable car was 1.5 hours so we took the local bus (number 33?) and were back in 30 mins at the MTR.

We'd expected a fair amount of organisation and facilities for visitors, but this? More like a little extra bit of Disneyland - a Buddhist theme park. The original monastery and great Buddha - lovely, very striking place. Peaceful and beautiful, albeit the tea-room now has a 'VIP Room' and the toilets are, ahem, basic. The new paved avenue, colossal stone gateways, shops shops shops SHOPS, Starbucks, pizza parlour, Subway shop, more shops, masses and swarms of tourists, the Walking With Buddha 'experience', cable car bringing more relentless swarms of chattering tourists - ghastly. What should be a place of calm, retreating from the huge pressure of tourism has been reduced to a 'must-see' stop on the tourist lists for Hong Kong. I wonder if the belittling of the religious aspect is a deliberate act, given the Chinese government's dislike of all forms of religion. If the monastery was getting the revenue from all this tat, well maybe it'd just about be acceptable. However, I very much doubt it."

When travelling to countries, I would assume one would like to experience and witness said country's culture and traditions and this tourist destination is one which could do this. The Big Buddha may not seem fascinating from afar but when hiking up those countless steps of stairs and seeing it upfront, you really get a sense of satisfaction and awe. Although the Big Buddha was fascinating, we must admit at the end of day, it's a statue and seeing it wasn't all that fun. What made the Big Buddha fun for me was the cable car which led to the island the Big Buddha was on. There is a standard cable car (which is cheaper) and a 360 crystal cable car which has a glass bottom to create a more thrilling experience. Although it was enjoyable, the 360 cable car wasn't much of a thrill as it was a rather long and slow moving journey (approximately half an hour) and the height the cable car was at wasn't that impressive either. But about 8-10 people are allocated per car and you can meet and talk to all sorts of people which is quite fun if you're social. What I think could have been improved about the cable car is making the windows barred so fresh air can be let in as the cable car was totally encased in glass, you could not feel the wind of hear any external sounds.Anyway, moving on from the cable cars, the path down to the Big Buddha was also a lengthy but enjoyable one. There are many souvenir shops and you can purchase the pictures they take of you (and your companions) when you first enter the cable car, however, these photos are such a rip off I would not recommend buying it (2 photos, a key ring and a snow dome for $500HKD). Going there during Christmas they would give you a free photo but the rest had to be payed. Christmas also meant that you could take pictures with cute snowmen mascots. If you got tired of souvenir shopping you could go and have food at the various cafes and restaurants located there. From cakes to street food is available (must I say the curry fish balls were delicious)Also there were many statues and decorative structures (?) which you could take pictures of and with. Finally when reaching the Big Buddha you may eat at a vegetarian restaurant to relate more with the Buddhist religion.There was also a boating experience where you went out to go whale watching and apparently, I've been told, it's one of the most beautiful places in Hong Kong. Overall the experience was quite enjoyable and took a long time (prepare at least a day - typically morning to afternoon). However, if you're not too into taking pictures and just looking at things rather than doing things you may find this journey boring as there aren't many activities you can do like in amusement parks."

There is a temple also on the top (just below the lotus seat of Buddha) but it has timings and closes by evening 5PM so be there in time.The monastery in front of Buddha statue is also good and first thing anyone notice there is giant incense sticks. One can purchase those giant sticks from the shops outside the monastery temple.The shows available there (Buddha story etc) are normal animation.

My wife and I wanted to do the trip using the ferry, busses and the cable car, and I can say it was really a great outing and a lot cheaper than going on an organised trip.Our day started at the ferry terminal at central. We caught the ferry to Landau island or Mui Wo (Chinese name). I think it was ferry terminal 6 but not sure. The Ferry left at 10:00 a.m. and I think leaves every half hour. the cost was very reasonable and we used our Octopus card which is a must when travelling in Hong Kong. The ferry ride was one hour long and you get off the ferry and there is a bus terminus in front of you. Find the bus to Tai O fishing village. Just look at teh signs at the various busses, or just ask We managed to get the 11:00 a.m. bus. the busses are semi luxury and again you can use your Octopus card. The trip takes about 45 mins to get to the fishing village.Once there, there are signs everywhere, just wonder around and take advantage of the photo opportunities of the various types of sea food on sale. Once we were finished, I think we caugt the 12:00 o'clock bus to the Big Buddah. Again there is a big bus terminus outside the village and just ask someone or see the signs. Also the bus was semi luxury and we used our octopus card. The trip to the Big Buddah is only about 15 minutes and you get dropped at the terminus. As you get off the bus turn right and head up the big walk way under the arch and eventually you will come to the stairs leading up to the Buddah on the right. There is a great view from the top of the stairs and you can go inside the base. Once we were finished we were following the signs to the Tea Garden which was recommended by one of the travellers, but the tea garden has been shut down, so dont waste your time walking up the long path. Go back towards the bus terminus and then head into the area with all the shopping and restaurants. At the end of that area you will find the cable car station, which was very busy and had a very long queue. the trip is a bit pricey for a one way trip, but well worth it. you dont need a crystal cabin, just a normal one is great.The views going down the cable car ride are fantastic and the trip was well worth it.The cable car ride finishes a short walk away from MTR station which we caught back to our hotel. It was agreat day."

You see the statue for a long time before you arrive, it is hard to realise quite how huge this is. Take the time to go to the top, the views are amazing, and then have a walk around the small souvenier shopping village afterwards. Ove 100 feet tall, the Buddha is beautiful, as are the other statues around its base, then return via a boat, going throught the islands around Hong Kong as the sun sets, a great day out. Was the biggest Buddha in the world till about 5 years ago.Cons: 250 (ish) steps to climb up to the statue, there is a ramp for wheelchairs, but it apparently takes about half an hour to walk - but well worth the effort!"

There is a very cheap way to visit this attraction by using public transport. First we took the metro to Tung Chung, from there using bus no. 23 to the monastery which takes about 45 minutes. During this trip you travelling through the whole island with some nice views. It is also quite cheap, around 35 HKD for a return ticket. First you arrive at a new tourist village where you find restaurants, shops and so on. The monastery itself was not so overwhelming, but getting up the stairs to the Buddha and enjoying the views from there makes the trip worth to do it. It is also recommended to visit also Tai-O village, for us this was unfortunetely not possible due to time."

There is actually a piece of Buddha's finger bone inside a reliquary in the middle of the statue; I recommend that you pay extra to get inside and see it. besides, they give you a complimentary ice cream and water for doing so (at least, that was the deal when we were there.) If you didn't know before, this is the world's tallest seated outdoor bronze buddha, and it was only built about 20 years ago. But it's already absolutely historic. For the adventurous, I recommend hiking to the buddha and then taking the cable car back. I also recommend eating at the vegetarian restaurant run by the monastery next to the buddha. You could spend all day there enjoying just the buddha and the temple and the restaurant and the little shopping area. A totally amazing experience and a must-do item on the list of potential Hong Kong wonders."

I would say its very 'sterile'. If you preferred a more authentic monastery like those ones in china then i wouldn't suggest you to go. The entire site is free except that you have to take the cable car to the monastery from central Hongkong.  Tip 2: do make sure you try the ginger soy beancurd dessert and corn-on-cob on the way to the big buddha. If you are a westerner, you will be charged at higher price because that's what i witnessed myself when i bought a bowl of soy dessert from the lady boss. She was selling me a cup of corn for 16 hk dollar and when i walked away, two westerners came and she charged them 25hk dollar. Make sure you check the price with the locals around you before you buy anything from the sellers. Tip 3: A lot of tourists thought that they can actually walk inside the shell of the bronze Buddha, its impossible so don't be silly. Tip 4: you can pay an entry fee and check out the buddhist manuscripts which we did but it was a complete waste of money. We didnt understand what everything meant. Tip 5: plan your day early and complete this site by mid-day and move on to the fishing village called Tai-O. There is a bus station at the monastery where you can catch a bus to Tai-O. It is a village that looks like Venice with no cars on the road.  This village sells dried seafood and it has a very distinctive stinky fishy smell. Therefore if you are not into fishy stinky smell, please do not go. But nevertheless, you can see the everyday life of a local fisherman in Tai-O. They also have nice like quaint cafes around the village for you to enjoy a rest. If you think my reviews have been helpful to you, please click 'Yes' for 'Was this review helpful?'"

Things have changed. We waited 2 hours to board the cable car (that's another review tho..) and were dumped into a faux-local village that was just a tourist trap. After negotiating our way through this we came to the Buddha and monastery. The vegetarian lunch is quite good (get the deluxe) but it was somewhat glutinous in texture. I remember the original one as being more simple and tasty. A quick look around the monastery and then it\u2019s back down the mountain.The view from the cable car is excellent but if you only have enough time to make it to one island then go to Lamma. It\u2019s more authentic."

It is such a peaceful and beautiful place and you can avoid all of the tourist-trap stalls etc and just enjoy the peacefulness and the incredible structure that is the Big Buddha. Highly recommended."

            "review": "A fun day but skip the vegetarian lunch. Visiting the Big Buddha was a fun diversion for a half day but there are a few pointers that will be useful if you go. We arrived at 10 am and walked right onto a cable car. On our return around 1 pm, the line snaked around the building and looked like visitors were waiting for 1 1/2 to 2 hours to catch a cable car. So, if you go, get there early. There is no reason to waste so much time when you can avoid the crowds by simply arriving in the morning. The cars with a clear bottom are heavily promoted, but there is no reason to pay for one. We went on the clear bottom car and took the solid bottom on the return, but the experience is the exact same with either option. You look out the windows at the scenery, not down at your feet, so a clear or solid floor makes no difference - really. Plus, their are 5 or so solid floor cards for each clear floor car, so the lines for clear can actually be longer. Trust me and don't fall for the hype. When you arrive, there is a little faux village with a couple of restaurants, including a Subway. You then pass into the area with the Buddha. As you head to the stairs to climb to the top, they will try to get you to buy a ticket for the vegetarian lunch. It includes access to the top floors of the little museum under the Buddha. There are two lunch menus, one being the deluxe. Trust me again and skip this mess of a lunch. First off, you aren't eating at some exotic location. Instead, it is a large, sterile room that looks like a giant cafeteria. If you spring for the deluxe option, it's just as plain but you get an table cloth. We went with the deluxe and the food was really nasty and very high calorie. The menu starts with gooey hot and sour soup that is so thick with corn starch that it has the consistency of motor oil. You then get a plate of fried egg rolls that contain only cabbage. They are greasy and tasteless and beg for some duck sauce or hot mustard (not an option). The other dishes include some stir fried veggies, which were actually decent and a plate of mushroom caps over some bok choi. The mushrooms had a disagreeable goo poured on top of them. Dessert was a plate of lemon curd stuff that was neither sweet nor had any taste. If you are looking for a napkin, forget it -- I guess you are supposed to wipe your hands on your pants. Some reviewers seemed to like this mess, but i cannot imagine how. Wait and eat in the village.With the lunch you do get access to the museum, but it was not that interesting. It only had a few documents to see and taking photos is prohibited. If you are still on the fence, walk over to the lunch room first and look in the window, The sad, sterile room will be enough to convince you to order Subway instead."

            "review": "Impressive Monument, but those cable car queues!!. I started this trip on a Friday morning by taking the MTR to Tung Chung station and then joining the queue for the Ngong Ping 360 cable car. I started queuing at about 10.30, I got on the cable car around 12.45, judging by the length of the queue after I joined I would guess people who started queuing at 11.30 probably waited at least 3 hours. There must be ways of avoiding this as there did seem to be a fast track system for some people, if you're planning to go I would seriously suggest you check their website for prebooking options. However, once you are through this hell the rest of the trip is pretty good fun.The cable car is very impressive with huge spans across open water and from hilltop to hilltop. It takes about 25 minutes(Great views of the airport) so that tells you how long it is. Once you get off at the top there is a short walk to get the the foot of the Big Buddha statue. This walk is heavily commercialised with many eating places and souvenir shops. Some of these shops actually sell some nice items but do you really go up the mountain to buy your souvenirs?Once you reach the steps to the Buddha the only real option is to climb up, take your time there are a lot of steps. The statue is very impressive both from afar and close up.Once you have seen the Buddha the other thing you might want to do is try the vegetarian restaurant at the monestry. This is quite an interesting experience if not an amazing culinary delight. There is a set menu so you get what they are serving which is uncomplicated vegetable dishes and tea. Once you've done that you take the cablecar back down, a nice trip but I wouldn't stand in that queue again."

We had an evening flight out of Hong Kong and of course hotels need you to check out early, so we did what any sensible person would do - we checked our baggage at the Airport Express, which we found we could do 12 hours in advance of our flight, and took the train to the airport early. Right under the tracks between T1 and T2 is the S1 bus stop. The S1 runs every 10 minutes or so, serving the outlying airport offices, and takes about 30 minutes \"round the houses\" to the mall adjacent to the Ngong Ping cable car. After your trip up the mountain, take the same bus back - you are already checked in, so straight through security and you are home free!For those business types who love to travel with excessive hand baggage and fill all the lockers up for the rest of us, there is a handy left luggage about 5 minutes from the bus stop, for about US$1.50/hour per bag.We took the crystal car (glass floor) to the top and back down - the line-ups were slightly shorter, but they do stop the cars for wheelchair access.There are other means of access, by ferry from Hong Kong, and other interesting sites on the Island, as detailed in the web link provided, but for our purposes and timing the cable car worked well.Established in 1970, the feature is younger than me, and so apart from the great scenic views held little attraction, although I will go back again to explore the other means of access, gardens, walks and features at some time in the future.One of the \"must do\" things in Hong Kong, but not especially special."

If you buy the vegetarian meal tickets at the base of the Big Buddha before climbing the steps, it entitles you to enter the interior of the Big Buddha for a tour of the exhibits.There were different categories of the vegetarian meal - we opted for the snacks (HKD 28 per person) and it was certainly quite delicious.All in all, well worth a visit."

If you buy the crystal cabin ticket when you go up, then you have priority in line coming back down, so you get to bypass most of the wait - IMHO it's worth the $5 extra in cost to save the time - I wish someone had told me that when I bought my ticket at the bottom. Anyway, the views from the tram are Incredible with great photo opps. Probably a little scary for anyone who has fear of heights, but for anyone else it's a must do. I could have done without the rows and rows of souvenir shops at the top of the tram - and the long wait to come back down was a bother - I will definitely buy the \"Crystal\" pass next time."

You can combine your visit with a gentle walk around the area. It's called Ngong Ping Family walk. It takes you about 45 mnts. Then you can visit the temple. From here. jump into taxi and go to Tai O. Hop on to a boat and go to Heritage Hotel for lunch. Then walk back to the bus station through the fisherman market. It is an experience."

Will they complain about the climb up the stairs?We took the cable car from Ngong Ping, which is so convenient. (we did ferry ten years ago, and it was a painful 2hours). As the cable car prods along, kids' anticipation were heightened when they see the airport and Buddha in the distant.The Buddha statue looks even more magnificent upfront.Kids rush up the stairs faster than the adults. They wanted to see the view from the top.As the wind sweeps the fog in and out of the moutain, sometimes hiding the Buddha, it was an awesome experience.Do not leave Lantau without first experiencing Ngong Ping village.There are a lot of desert and souvenir shops. Lantau island always experience Rain and Fog, would recommend you to bring along umbrella."

We waited until a fine day (problem was so did 1000's of others) so we got real good views from the top. After climbing up to the Buddha, seen the view and take your photos and stuck your nose up at the few over prices shops, have a look at the Po Lin Monastory and maybe take the Vegitarian meal that is on offer (looked good, be we didn't try). By the side is a snack bar offering cooked noodles and chinese pastries/rolls etc. We tried a few of these and were happy with our selection. A short walk to the \"Wisdom path\", although there was a lack of information about the exscriptions on the posts, the walk was good (more views). About 1-2 hours at the top is probably a good time to spend, but you will need a lot more if you are thinking about taking the cable car as the queus can be horriffic. The view of the Buddha from the cable car, means that you should take it one way or the other."

The statue is really big but at the same time has been detailed out to a great extent. The walk is easy with 280 steps and if you are in moderate shape, it should not be a problem. We did not visit the museum inside since most of the time in the past for some other attractions; the experience is not that great. The sheer magnanimity of the statue makes you wonder how this would have been achieved at such a hilly terrain. Getting the material to build it itself would have been a difficult task. A word of caution: it might get very windy there based weather that day. It would be good to go prepared."

A massive commercial outlet with no authenticity and tourism at its worst with dreadful piped music to boot. Get through that as quickly as possible and the Buddha is impressive and worth seeing The weather cleared briefly to give us glimpses of what the views could be on a spectacular day. The temple nearby was interesting and will be lovely should the ubiquitous building work around it ever be finished! We did not try the vegetarian restaurant attached. We then embarked on the return cable car trip. By now the weather had closed on and the wind picked up so it was slightly hair raising. We were then left suspended and stationary for some 10-12 minutes due to some technical problem. All in all not great but possibly an infrequent occurrence . They did let us know with audio updates and after disembarking we were given hot water drinks(!) and cheese crackers for our troubles. The Buddha is worth the trip but only take the cable car on a good weather day. If it's cloudy and windy take the bus"

If you are interpreted in seeing the old traditional chinese way of living, away from the big city life, it is well worth a visit. After returning from Tai O, the tour guide walked us around the gardens and the grounds of all the temples situated around the Big Buddha, and was very knowledgable. That, though is where the tour ends, and there is no talk up and around the Buddha and no walk and talk down to wisdom path. The steps up to the Buddha are not as bad as you think and I can't understand why people would want to take a bus up to it. Once up there the views, again are fantastic.

Definitely do the trails if you are physically capable, but the glass floor gondola, aka 360, is well worth it too. The queue is long so expect to wait. There is a shorter trail once you are up there behind the Buddha and takes you to another feature of going there. The temple is well worth a look there as well.There is a fee for the 360 and if you visit inside the Buddha."

The cable car ride to Lantau Island which takes about 25 minutes is a very nice experience with breathtaking views of the mountains and the airport. the fleet of stairs to reach the top of the Big buddha is about 100 to 150 but it is worth reaching the top. The monastery below is also worth a visit."

Choose a Crystal Car - for return journey too as the queue will be shorter on the way back! Dress to expect it to be at least 10 degrees cooler at the summit - the shops do a roaring trade on sweat shirts and rainproofs as people do not expect it to be so cold! The big Buddha is a short walk from the village - then quite a few steep steps - but well worth it! We used the underground to get there - very very easy to use!

Once you see the Big Buddha from a distance or up close, it's truly an amazing sight. My advise to tourists though, please, on the 300 step staircase, be kind to fellow tourists and keep to the side if you're going to abruptly stop every few seconds for a breather or to take a photo. In no time, you'll really annoy the person behind you."

Walked to the Ngong Ping 360 Cable car station (2 min walk). Cable costs HK$125 each, for a round trip. Caution as a man was trying to sell cable car tickets for HK$100 each, just as you exit the train. His tix looked nothing like the tix we bought at the cable car station. So not sure if it was genuine or a scam. Buying a tix for the cable car took a while as at each counter they were trying to convince people to buy a package deal. (Cable car, boat trip & fishing village). We chose to go on a normal cable car (crystal cabin costs a bit more), but no thanks. Normal car was enough excitement for us. Impressed as no clunk clunk as you go over the towers. So smooth. Its a lovely scenic ride on the cable car. You can see the airport from above. Lots of natural bush land below you. Then you get your 1st site of the Big Buddha. When you reach the end, you walk through a souvenir shop and they have made up the photo they took of you as you got onto the cable car. We opted for the photo of us on a keyring. Other options available. You don\u2019t have to buy, if you don\u2019t want, but they do hassle you a bit to buy. Lots of souvenir shops line the path to the Big Buddha, and a few restaurants. They even had a subway food outlet there. Opted not to walk the 200+ plus steps up to the Buddha. The view was great from the bottom. Walked around to the monestary. Back to the cable car for the trip back to Ngong Ping village. Wanted to go to the City Gate brand outlets mall which is near the Cable Car Station. This place is shoppers heaven for brand named goods at cheap cheap prices."

But i suggest you take a star ferry over to the island, then a bus to Ton sai to see a fishing village, another bus up to the big buddah then a chair lift back down the 5.5 km to the metro station back to the mainland or Hong kong island. If you have the money take a crystal cabin chairlift as we bypassed all the queue going down too. The sight of the big buddah is awe inspiring and worth visiting but like most areas just around the corner is shops and resteraunts to take your cash.deffinately one to have on a 3 day or more visit though"

It gives a breathtaking view of mountains, forests, South China sea, airport and Big Buddha statue. We could also see the very long trekking path to the statue, and my guess is that it would easily be 2-3 hours of uphill trek, if not more. There is so much to do here to easily spend one entire day just admiring the statue, monastery and villages around. There are options upon reaching the cable car terminal to walk around the Ngong Ping village, monastery, Tai O fishing village, Wisdom path, a nature park in Ngong Ping and the market. You could also have lunch in the monastery, which we did and absolutely loved the simple and bland, but very nice food. We had to queue for the cable car for an hour and a half, but it is definitely worth the wait. And the waiting time can be shortened if you book your tickets online. The wisdom path is extremely beautiful with 38 timber columns that contain inscriptions of the Buddhist Heart-sutra."

It's 'a small world' multiplied...at least Disney has a bit of style...be prepared for all of the shops to be blasting the ngong ping 360 song, over and over....and over....and over. How the staff can work there without becoming psychopathic axe wielding nutcases I do not know. The. Instant tourist village is vacuous. Do not expect spirituality here. There may be a monastery, there may be a spectacular Buddha...and it is incredible in size and location. But enlightenment, it is not. There was not a jot of anything other than blatant tourism about this...I felt quite sorry for the real Buddhist visitors...not that there are many.

As suggested by several others I took the ferry from Central ferry pier no. 6 to Mui Wo and from there I took the no. 2 bus towards the Po Lin Monastery. It was super easy and the ride is just fantastic as it takes you past several small islands and the bus ride takes you through rural villages and brilliant scenes. Both ferry and bus tickets are cash only transactions. Took about an hour to get to the base of the buddha.The Tian Tan Buddha itself is pretty enjoyable. The steps weren't a problem for me, but I did find several people needing to take a break every so often. There are plenty of shops around to buy water, gatorade, ice cream etc. I paid the HKD 70 for the museum entrance and the vegetarian lunch. The museum was a little disappointing as there is very little in terms of descriptions of the artifacts. The lunch was very healthy and good, I did like the main hall of the Po Lin monastery the best.I took the cable car on the way back to Hong Kong. It is just a fantastic experience (about HKD 130) and presents great views of planes taking off from Hong Kong airport and the skyscrapers below as well. Going over the lush vegetation and then the water is pretty cool. took about 30 minutes to get back to the base.Overall a good experience. Must do at least once. Probably won't do it again though."

You can begin to see the Big Buddha rising up in the distance as you get to the top of the cable car ride. There is a monastery and a temple up there and a pure vegetarian restaurant, as well as some touristy shops and some other restaurants on the way up to the Buddha. If you buy a ticket for a vegetarian meal before you go up the stairs to the Big Buddha, it also gives you entry into a museum underneath the Buddha. The Buddha is stunning, and the views from the top of the surrounding mountains are absolutely beautiful. It does take a while to get there from Central Hong Kong - you can take the MTR or a ferry, and also be aware that the line for the cable cars can be quite long, but it's well worth the wait."

Plodding up all 270 steps to the Buddha was worth it to see the scale of the statue close up, and visit the exhibition inside. The views from the summit are spectacular too. I found the shopping village nearby jarred a little, rather too many Disney-esque buildings and overpriced souvenirs.

To get to the Ngong Ping village we decided to take the 25 minute cable car, it was entertaining and you can get cars with glass floors which enhance the views - OF THE GROUND - way below!!! We were so high up that aircraft could be sen taking off from nearby Hong Kong International which were below our height in the cable car.Once at the village there is a good mix of shops and snack bars so you refresh yourself and the Giant Buddha is easily accessible up 280 steps!!! There are a great many things to see in this world and this is one of them. Done forget to ponder on how they took all the material up there for building this magnificent idol.There are lots of photo opportunities and plenty of gift shops for those important reminders.The ride back down in the cable car was made even more exhilerating because of the cross winds but the views are spectacular, both in the car and at the village and the Giant Buddha."

Whilst this used to be the fun and easy way it is now a nightmare with 1 1/2 to 2 hour queues at the cable car. The best way to do this, a little longer, but certainly more enjoyable is to do the trip from the other end as it were. Simply take a ferry to Mui Wo on Lantau from Central, the number 6 ferry. Easy as jumping on a train, though you might want to check the timetable all on the web. Waiting for you at the arrival plaza is a bus to Nong Ping where the big Buddha is. The bus terminal is the furthest to the left. You will need cash or an Octopus card - around HK$18. It is a 30 mins journey through spectacular countryside. After doing the Buddha just jump on the cable car (near where the bus dropped you!) in the reverse direction, go to Tung Chung and MTR back to your hotel. The real pleasure is seeing the huge queues at the Tung Chung end trying to get on that cable car and knowing you just walked on at the other end. Make sure you only buy a one way ticket!! BTW the factory outlets at Tung Chung are a con job. Don't waste your time."

You can take either the normal car or the premium one. The only difference is that the premium one has a glass bottom. You could try this at least one way.They close the cable car for some weeks every year; if you are visiting during those time you can take a bus.You can see Hong Kongers trekking up and down. You can try this - but be warned that this is a very strenuous trek and not meant for children and the unfit. If you have time, and you are reasonably healthy, you can try this. A relatively easy option would be to do the trek from Nong Ping to Tung Chung than the other way round. Once you reach the top, there is the big buddha statue and a monastery. I enjoyed the ride more that the destination. You can half a day here. If you reach Tung Chung around noon for the onward journey, you can reach back by around 6 or 7 in the evening."

It should be on top 10.The Big Buddha, beautifully situated on the hill. As soon as you are arriving Lantau Island via cable car, you will be welcomed by the magnificient Big Buddha.The cable car service from Tung Chung (nearest MTR is TUNG CHUNG MTR) takes around 30 minutes. Along the way, you get the bird-eye view of one of Asia's busiest airport, Hong Kong Chek Lap Kok International Airport (think about it, how often do you get the bird eye view of an airport apart from the aircraft, eventhough sometimes when the plane moves too fast, you hardly see anything and not to mention when you are not seated window seat). Also, you can get to see the different face of Hong Kong, where here you see a lot of greens, mountains and natural sites. The Big Buddha is within walking distance from the cable car station. It takes around 10-15 minute walk from the station to the base of the Buddha statue. There's a buddhist temple facing the big buddha, where a lot of buddhist will offer prayers. There's also vegetarian restaurant right next to the temple, where simple yet delicious vegetarian foods can be purchased and enjoyed.Walking up the stairs to reach the Buddha. There are total of 250 steps. It is worth the climb, because the top offers you another bird eye view of Lantau Island. Also, it is a sacred place, you will feel the calm, warmth and bless by the Buddhism belief and practice. It is away from the busy city of Hong Kong, a peaceful and beautiful area.How to get there:Take MTR to Tung Chung station. Walking distance to the cable station. Take the cable car to Lantau Island, which is around 30 min journey.When to get there:As mentioned, Lantau Island has more to offer than just the magnificient Big Buddha, you can spend whole day there to explore the rural area of Hong Kong. Reach the cable car station as early as possible, because crowd starts to build up from 9 onwards. The waiting time to board the cable car can be as long as 1 to 2 hrs. I have waited for 1.5 hrs! So, to avoid the crowd, you may want to be there early and jump the queue! There are a lot of tour operators and packages available, you can approach any of the guides there for more information if you need land transporation to other attractions on the island. Temple and the Big Buddha are free of charge, no entrance fee. But, if you want to visit the buddhism museum underneath the buddha, you need to pay for a small fee. Nothing special in the museum, but you will get to see the Buddha Relic in the museum, quite worth it!"

Many stairs to climb to get to Buddah, and if you are not in good shape, I recommend that you not climb them. Long line to take cable car back. My recommendations: make your reservations for the cable car online and avoid all the long lines.

However, luckily all the tacky stuff is near the cable car exit and we just walked past on our way to see the Buddha and Po Lin monastry. General concensus amongst people we spoke to would be to buy just the cable car return rather than any of the add on packages.The Buddha is mighty impressive, both from a distance and up close. Great photo opportunities. The monastry is also interesting. At the entrance to the Buddha steps we bought a ticket for $HK28 (\u00a32.30) each which gave us entry to the museum at the base of the Buddha and a snack and a drink at the monastry.

We decided to visit this attraction on our own but signed up for the tour offer, which takes you to Tai O fishing village as part of the package and is well worth doing!

That said, the organisation is pretty slick and everthing ticks along quite smoothly. We took the courtesy bus from the Marriott Skycity Hotel to Tung Chung, and purchased our tour deal with our Sky Lift ticket - I was a bit apprehensive about getting a 'crystal car' (glass bottom cable car) but bit the bullet and was so glad I did as the experience is fantastic!! The views from the Sky Lift are outstanding! Our tour guide (?Victor) was absolutely brilliant and made the tour extremely enjoyable (short coach ride to Tai O [village on stilts], walk around, some time on your own, and then back to the buddha/monastery complex for a guided walk/tour). Having said not to go on a public holiday, I also have to say that this probably the best time to go to see the real customs and traditions in practice! The walk up to the Buddha is massive (steps) but is well worth it if you can manage it, and small shops to buy a well-earned drink or ice cream are at the top! You will probably be asked to take several group/couple photos for other people ... but you can ask them to do the same for you and makes it quite a sociable event too!Tai O fishing village is an experience not to miss as it really does show you a different side of Hong Kong if you have only experienced the hussle and bussle of the city and ample photo opportunities. I think you can also get to Tai O from the ferry at Tung Chung, but beware of the final ferry departure time! Also, buses from Tung Chung will take you to Tai O and Po Lin Monastery (Big Buddha).As will all places in Hong Kong, there are many souvenier shops, places to buy food and drink, and washroom facilities!I think you might be able to book your tickets in advance on the internet. Buying a ticket for the crystal car will give you front-of-queue priority!"

However you can also take a cable car to go up to the top, which is also a very nice journey. Please be aware that cable cars are not air conditioned. If you go up there by cable cars during hotter months, you will regret, because people really smell in hot and humid months in Hong Kong. Once you are up there it is like paradise. There is a many very well organised village with numerous of shops and restaurants. After passing through the village you get to the monastery. The big Buddha is on your right hand side, however if you really want to get closer , you need to climb about 200 steps up! I did it twice over the years and it is certainly worth doing so. There is fantastic view on top when you get there. For those who donn't want to climb, you can go to the temple on the left hand side. They have a very big restaurant serving vegetarian food, however in Chinese style. Tasty and interesting for tourists to experience vegetarian food in Chinese cuisine. If you are not too tired after visiting, you may take a bus to go down to a village for seafood. This village is famous for seafood and for floating houses standing on stilts. Take bus number 10 to go there and it is only a 15 minute ride. This can take you a whole day and you can go around the whole island to experience it. Certainly worth doing it while you are in Hong Kong."

Explore the village and venture up to the Buddha, then buy a ticket and take the cable car down... You will probably miss most of the crowds and still have lots of time to explore other parts of HK. Just beware if pollution levels are high, you won't see much on the cable car ride. And dress warm in the winter as the cars are not heated and it can be very breezy at the top.

We found the queue for NPing cable car/tram too long (on a Saturday noon) so we took the bus #23 instead. Be expected to have a meandering 40 mins journey though..The approx 1/2hr hike up the 200+ steps to the world's tallest outdoor bronze Buddha is manageable if one pause to take photos and admire the wonderful elevated view of the surroundings. Once atop we followed the natural ritual of circling the platform (the lotus) where the Buddha sits. We found some very interesting souvenirs here too. We were lucky to have clear sky so good photo taking from this vantage point was a breeze.Upon descending we also dropped by the NPing Cultural Village nearby. Surely worth a visit as there are many interesting shops around + Starbucks.! Good to take a break after the tiring journey.It is definitely advisable to start early in the morning and be prepared to spend min 3/4 of a day for the itinerary, especially if one intends to go shopping at the CityGate Outlet Mall on your way back."

The world\u2019s largest Budda seems to be a big attraction for tourists and Mainland Chinese yet not very popular with the locals from my conversations.The easiest way to get out to the Budda is via the MTR subway. It is about a 40 minutes journey, so get comfortable (adjacent to the airport). A taxi would run about $40 USD. Once you arrive, you can walk to the gondola which is about $15 and takes 20+ minutes to the base area of the Budda. The gondola ride is scenic as you realize much of the New Territories is actually lush jungle foliage. (There is a public bus option which is much less cost).Once you arrive at the base area which is a tourist oriented shopping area of stores and Starbucks, 7/11 and Subway. My suggestion, pass through it, you will have time to browse on the returnFrom the base area, you must walk another 10 minutes to the Budda and then it is approx. 150 steps to the statue. It is crowded with many tour groups. While it is an impressive, the trek is exhausting if warm and humid. No real place for shade or relaxation or contemplation. Be sure to make time to visit the Temples in the area and consider the vegetarian meal option which is a bargain. Back at the MTR station is a major outlet mall development. Be forewarned, on weekends many Hong Kong and Mainland Chinese descend on this mall for the shopping experience. While presented as an outlet mall and offering many impressive brands, prices were in my opinion still quite high and not a bargain for western shoppers. "

The view from the top was superb and I was able to see lots of butterflies and dragon flies flitting around several of the trees. The scenery was amazing and the Buddha impressive.I wish there had been some explanations of the various statutes surrounding the Buddha. Information plaques would have been nice for someone like me who doesn't know much about the religion.After the climb our group had lunch in the restaurant prepared by the monks with items grown on their land. It was a completely vegetarian meal served family style. I never knew that tofu could taste so good! We had tea, rice, tofu folded and fried and served with a sweet, lemony sauce, mushroom soup, steamed carrots, bok choy and squash, and a most delicious spring roll. I could have eaten 10 of the spring rolls, they were so good! No one left the table hungry.We then toured the temples and heard the monks do a chant. Again, I wish there had been some sort of information plaques to explain what we were seeing.Fair warning: be sure to have TP if you visit.

            "review": "Very impressive!. My friend and I recently visited Hong Kong and on our first day we got the Ngong Ping Skyrail over to Lantau Island to see the huge bronze seated Buddha. The cable car is an experience in itself, highly recommended. You travel 5.7km across Tung Chung Bay (great views of HK International Airport) to Lantau Island, and over hilly tree-covered parkland to the small tourist village of Ngong Ping. It is very commercial but charmingly so and well-maintained. There is a variety of shops selling promotional items of good quality, also cheaper stalls, plus a picturesque tea house and a variety of food outlets, incl Starbucks. It is a short walk from the village to the gateway entrance that leads to the Buddha statue and also the Po Lin Monastery. The day we visited, it was very warm and there were a lot of visitors, it is a popular tourist attraction for locals and foreigners. Sunscreen, hat, sunglasses, comfortable shoes and light clothing are essential if you are visiting in warmer months as you do a lot of walking. A light backpack is also useful for purchases. The gateway entrance and warrior statue promenade is a great photo opp. It is then a short walk to the many stone steps leading up to the base of the huge bronze Buddha statue, which looms over everything and is easily spotted in the distance as you approach Ngong Ping village by cable car. You need to be moderately fit to climb the steps to the Buddha, or else be prepared for numerous stops to rest as you ascend! It is worth the climb as once you reach the statue's base, you have great views of everything below. It does get busy though with so many people visiting this attraction, it is near impossible to take a photo without other people appearing in it! Admittance to both Ngong Ping Village and the Big Buddha are free, once you have paid to travel over by cable car. According to my HK Lonely Planet book, this attraction is open 10am-5.30pm and I would recommend getting there early rather than later to avoid queues and crowds. I would allow a full day as you have to travel by train to the cable car terminus at Tung Chung, queue for a cable car, then travel 5.7km by cable car to Ngong Ping Village. Allow 30-60 mins to wander the village, a further 1-2hrs to visit the Big Buddha and Po Lin Monastery (incl vegetarian restaurants), a second look through the village on your way back (food/drinks/souvenirs), before returning by cable car, then train."

I didn't catch the cable car up to the Budda, I caught the 23 bus from the station outside the railway, it was so cheap and a much better way of getting up to the Budda, the bus ride took about 30 mins and all the locals were using the service. It's a bit touristy around the Budda area, with loads of shops selling souvenirs, but Big Budda is very impressive on top of the hill overlooking the whole place, definitely worth a visit."

Make sure you reserve cablecar tickets on the web, it will save you a long line for purchasing the tickets. The travel by the cablecar is wondeful and one gets a panoramic view of the airport, the seea and the mountains. In order to reach the Buddha you walk for about ten minutes from the station and then climb quite a few steps to the feet of the Budhha. The climb to the balcony is worth it. Already from below and from the area of the monastery the Buddha is impressive, but the view from the balcony of the surrounding area is magnificent. On the balcony, under the Buddha statue there is a small museum allegedely containing a relic (a tooth, which you can't see) of Buddha. If you want to go in you need a ticket which you buy with a ticket for lunch for two at the bottom of the stairs, so don't forget to do that before you begin the climb. Lunch is at the monastery restaurant, it is a basic vegeterian lunch, nothing to write home about. Take the nice and easy Wisdom walk to the stella with Chinese wisdom quotations. The stella are arranged in the mathematical symbol of infinity. If you have the time, don't take the cablecar ride back. Rather take bus number 21 to the village of Tai O, an authentic fishermen village where people still live in houses built on stilts. You may also take a boat tour there to see dolphins. Then take bus number 11 back to Tung Chung and the metro. The ride is about an hour and you get to see part of Lantau island."

I was staying in Kowloon - stayed at W Hotel on Austin Rd & at Sheraton on Nathan Rd ( both amazing stays ) and it was VERY simple to get to big Buddha from either. From Sheraton on Nathan Rd I took the MTR from TST to Tung Chung Station. I wish other cities in the world would set up their public transport the way Hong Kong does. It is just so clean, easy to understand, and well planned out. It didn't take long to arrive. I think I started my journey around 9 - 10am after a nice breakfast and ended up back at my hotel by early afternoon. A great morning / half day trip! Weather was nice. Jeans & t-shirt, slightly overcast.Once I got off the MTR, I walked thru some basic but nice shopping / eating / touristy areas and found the Crystal Cabin Ride. All directions and signs are very easy to follow to get here once off the tram.I paid a tiny bit extra and got the cabin / cable ride that has a see thru bottom. I am so glad that I took the cable ride. The short trip to see Buddha was just beautiful. You glide over hills and pathways - a nice change from the high rise buildings in HK. I was solo so I was paired with a few locals who didn't speak English but that made my journey all the more fun and we took some funny pics. ( Can't remember price of the ride but it wasnt too bad - and once there, Buddha etc is free )Once arriving at our stop, I noticed there is a little town to walk thru before actually reaching Big Buddha. Slightly touristy but not annoying. Very calm area. Im sure this are could get crowded but when I was there - it was very pleasant and calm. I stopped at a couple of the little shops and picked up some hand made bracelets for my friends. The sales people were very sweet and not pushy at all. I stopped at StarBucks for a sandwhich and ended up sitting next to monk enjoying his coffee . He let me take a picture - it was great :) Modern world & old world meet in one photo.There is a walk thru presentation ( similar to something you might see at Universal Studios ) that explained the life of Buddha. I usually dont like stuff like this but I figured - why not do it all since I am here and it is free. I actually learned a lot in ten minutes and continued my walk down the path to see Buddha.There are lots of steps to walk up to actually reach Buddha up close but not ridiculous. Not sure that there is any alternative way to get there. BEAUTIFUL views looking down once you get there! ( See my pics . ) When I walked down I explored the temples surrounding Buddha and the lovely little lotus pond, etc. This place is not \" all that \" but is a nice, simple extra thing to do while in HK. Where else in the world can you get this close to such a huge Buddha? It wont take up much of your day and is well worth the photo ops. Next time I visit HK I will probably not go here again because it is one of those \"been there done that\" places but first timers should def go. There is not too much walking - just the right amount. I hear there are people that hike the hills ( instead of taking the crystal cabin ride ) and that there are other ways to reach the area but this is just the way that I did it.Feel free to ask me any questions about my journey. I LOVE HK and can't wait to be there again. I'd love to help anyone else plan their journey to this lovely place."

It's a hike up to it, but once you get there, it's a great place to take pictures or just sit and be still. have lunch in the monestary afterwards. The area around the monestary is disappointingly touristy. (theres a Starbucks and a subway!) but the tea shop right outside the gondola is great! The gondola was kinda cool, but if the line is long, you may as well take the bus and save money and time. (bus is right outside gondola entrance.) i splurged and did the crystal cabin, which was kinda neat, but if youre on a budget, save your money for something else. it gets crowded on weekend afternoons, and Sunday's are supposed to be the busiest day, but I got to the gondola at 10am on a Sunday, and lines were very short. It was pretty crowded as I was leaving around 1pm. A half day is plenty to see it. And it's HOT. Bring sunscreen, a hat, and water."

We took the fastest (and maybe cheapest) way - MTR (subway) - cost $22 HKD one way per traveller. Had to transfer to another line to Tung Ching stop but took about 30 mins or so. Taking a taxi or bus will probably take longer depending on traffic. Got out of the train station and walk to where you can take a tram to the Big Buddha (have several different packages ranging from a simple tram ride to tram ride plus several 'attractions' like puppet show for the kids, movie on Big Buddhas and such. We took the cheapest (tram ride without a glass floor) - can take the tram with with glass floor but more expensive and a longer wait (only 1 tram with glass floor compared to 3 normal tram). Takes about 25 mins to get the final stop - very high and scenic along the way!Got to the end and ends up walking thru the gift shop - walk thru the 'town/village' of several gift shops, fast food like Subway and Starbucks! The Big Buddha is about 10-15 walk from the tram stop! You have several flights of stairs to get to the Big Buddha - very impressive! There are monastaries of other buddhas inside -very beautiful. Overall - a nice visit but was slightly turnoff by the touristy feeling of the place."

If you get away from the main parts (eg by following the so-called \"Path of Wisdom\") you will find quiet and serenity, as you would hope for at a Buddhist site, with only a 10-15 minute walk. Vegetarian cafe at the monastery is excellent value. There's a bunch of tourist shops but some are actually decent quality with reasonable prices, so worth being selective."

Well, this visit on a weekday was just so unexpected as a HK experience.First we took the fast ferry across HK harbor to Lantau island - 40 minutes, cost about HK $30 (there is a regular ferry as well, they alternate, and the regular ferry is slower, but also cheaper). Out of peak hour, pretty quiet.Then a terrific public bus trip from the ferry up the hill - under HK$10 for 40 minutes of spectacular scenery, windy roads, little villages, and on a week day the bus was not remotely busy. Once at the village, the Big Buddha complex is 5 minutes stroll away. Good plaza at the bottom. For some reason, cows strolling around. Nice walk up the hill, fabulous views at the top, along with quite a breeze which was nice in steamy summer HK. Then there was the Buddha itself (free unless you want to go inside the actual statue and/or take the vegetarian lunch option) big as advertised and seated on a lotus flower, looking very relaxed, and some other nice statues. Lots of people around, but not crazy by any means. Ice-creams, drinks and food all easily purchased underneath BB and well priced.The small cutesy tourist village next door is actually really nice. We then took the 5.7km gondola ride down to the MTR (train system) - more wow! views, including a lot of plane spotting from above as HK airport is right next door. Glass floor cabin optional extra. We stuck to the regular one ($HK 86 one-way) which was just fine. Then back to HK Central on the MTR - around another HK $10. It did get crowded at Admiralty station, but that was only one stop from where we got off.If it had been cooler, there were heaps of walks along side the gondola ride which looked great as well, just not in high summer.Overall, a non stressy, non crowded, inexpensive 1/2 day trip with awesome views of lush green quiet Hong Kong."

The views from the cable pods is spectacular and an experience in itself. The precinct where the Big Buddha is located is an easy walk, but be rpepared for a couple of hundred steps to reach the top of the peak that the Buddha is built on. The effort is worth it and the view and experience of standing amongst the peaceful and devout Buddhists is a great experience.It will KO a full day, so don't plan anything else and be prepared to flop exhausted onto your bed when you get home!The public toilets there are pretty foul!"

For easier access, I pick the Ngong Ping 360 cable car to arrive there. It has been expanded quite a lot since last time before the cable car is there.On arrival is a strip mall full of shops on both sides. You will first come to the area for ice cream, coffee and light snacks, then comes with all the arts and crafts. Some specialties include the Crystal glass glare statue and vase, a form of glass mixed with different minerals to have different colors; Chinese chopsticks; Chinese lady gown; Chinese snacks and many others. There is a photo shop with fake backgrounds from the computer that you can take many different postures including beating drums. If you buy a photo (~HKD100) when you first landed, then this shop will give out a free photo with others that you can buy.After passing the strip is the long path with both sides of the path standing with cement statue. One path will lead you to the Big Buddha and the other to a dining restaurant. The restaurant has the vegetarian set menu. We choose the premium lunch (HKD110pp) that includes lots of dishes. There are two to 300 steps that you have to climb in order to arrive the foot of the Big Buddha. Once you are there, you can walk into the base. There is a fee to enter the upper levels that exhibit lots of paintings, scripts, royal artifacts and about the history of the Big Buddha. Luckily there is air conditioning here after the hot sunny walk outside.On the way back, don\u2019t forget to try out the smooth bean curd dessert. There are many stores that offer it. It is served either in hot or cold.We don\u2019t have time to go to the path filled with wooden panels that on them have all the Buddhist scripts mingled with all the trees around. I imagine you can feel more Buddhist atmosphere here. Something left behind for next visit."

All went swimmingly well until after paying the ticket price as once through the counters, we joined the queue for the glass bottom cars! It wasn't too bad - approx. 30mins, so I can't imagine the waiting time for the standard cabs as the queue outside before the turnstiles was 100m long. Once aboard the kids had a fab time looking down and around during the trip. The highlight for them was the show performed by the kung-fu performers. We then ate in the chinese restaurant and had a good meal \u2013 value for money. The other restaurants were really just fast food and average quality from the look of what they produced. Walk to see the Buddha is easy providing you aren\u2019t suffering from a heart condition, as there are lots of steep steps to take you to the top. The view on the day we were there was hazy, but I can imagine it would be fabulous on the days the pollution is low."

If you are really energetic you can walk the 3-4km it is to get to the top, but the climb certainly did not look easy to me lots of stairs along the way. You can choose to have a glass bottom cable car carriage at an extra cost if you want, to be honest that queue was much smaller than the ordinary one, but get there early before 10am as the tour buses arrive and it get really busy. Easy to catch the train out there, look for the line that goes to disney and you are heading in the right direction."

Reaching the cable car terminal at Tung chung is easy as you can take an MRT from Kowloon or Hong Kong island.The view on the ride is amazing as it takes you up the mountain. The other alternative is to go by bus to Big Buddha statue, which would take considerably longer. If you want to see more of the fishing villages, you can buy a one way cable car ticket and then return by bus.As I said, the view is amazing on this cable car. The Big Buddha statue at Ngong Ping itself is pretty impressive, and you need to climb 250 steep stairs to reach to the top. While I was there, there was a secondary attraction on one of the steps - in the form of a giant centepede.If you arrive early enough, you can get a paid vegetarian meal at the restaurant there, which is so rare in Hong Kong.We didn't visit the monastry, but there is a tourist village before the Big Buddha if you want to buy souvenirs and stuffOverall, its pretty amazing how desolate this island can be even though its so close to Hong Kong island with all its skyscrapers. However, Tung chung near the airport is quite urban - I am talking about the remainder of the island."

The view from the top is amazing and there are many things to do up there aswell like visit the temple where we had a delicious vegetarian lunch and visit Ngong Ping village (probably the least interesting thing up there). If you head past the buddha there are some tracks that lead you into the bush/mountains, we only went a small part of the way as the rest of the track had steep climbs up mountains.

The Tian Tan Buddha towere over Ngong Ping Village where you arrive from the Cable car which is an experience in itself. A half hour trip up the mountain with spectacular views, but be prepared for a long wait to board a car. Two tips to reduce the wait. Either take a Crystal car which has the advantage of a see through floor, but is more expensive. There are fewer takers for this so your queue is shorter meaning less wait. The alternative is to take the bus to the top, and to take the cable car back down after your visit. There are free Shaolin warrior shows at 12 Noon in Ngong Ping that are worth seeing, and a phalanx of refreshment and souvenir shops on your way to the Buddha, which is worth the multi step climb. There is also a major temple on near the village and Giant Buddha."

First we went to the website at 240 pm and signed up for the email newsletter, and therefore got sent the 10% off coupon. We printed off 2 of them. Then we took the MTR to the peak line. Not very expensive. It was Saturday when we did this. We got to the cable car , (marked very clearly on the mtr map) at about 5pm. Didn't really think about the time when we bought our round trip ticket. With the coupon , we bought 2 roundtrip tickets. (hold onto your ticket...) for 155 hk. We got a crystal cabin on the way up, and normal on the way back. My friend liked the crystal cabin, but I wasn't sure it was worth it. You are given the choice of when you have a crystal cabin, on the way up, or the way back. We chose the way up and were glad we did, because it was packed on the way bac (10 people ) versus when we went up (5 people).We got up to the peak at 545pm and didn't really think about the fact that the LAST tram up was scheduled for 630. We quickly walked up to the Big Buddha and back. We did see people being turned away from the final approach up the steps. We sneaked in because people were still leaving, we did get some dirty looks from the guard. We got back to the tram about 615pm. There was a long line of people leaving, I don't know if there was a 630pm last cable car, because it didn't seem like there was enough cars for people in the line.Things I wish somebody had told me?1. They don't care if you bring food or drink up2. Get there a little earlier (not too much earlier, maybe 30 more minutes... it was nice being last)3. There were shaolin monks and stuff we didn't get to see, because we got there so late... really make sure you plan your event timing if you want to see ALL the shows. We might not have paid for the shaolin monks, because it was extra and not included, but it would be nice to have decided not to go versus... oh it's too late.Well worth the price. There is a St Honore bakery , and a 7/11 right at the bottom of the cable car ride, so you don't have to buy over priced food up top. Just have a ride and enjoy!"

My teenagers were thrilled with the novelty of the glass bottom ride. Long lines when we got there around 1130am. Didnt get on the cable car till around 2pm. Because we got the package that included a boat excursion from Tai O and had to catch the bus to get there from Ngong Ping, it was quite a big rush when we were told to get back to the cable car station by 6pm for our trip down (worked out ok though). Made it up to the top. ..some 280 steps to get close to the Big Buddha. Beautiful big buddha she is closeup! Worth the hike up. Not too difficult. One note re: how to beat the line for tickets. Book online at least ONE Day before (doesn't work on the same day of booking) and get the attention of the attendants when you arrive at the cable car terminus. Do not wait in line. They will let you thru to pick up your tickets. However you will still have to line up for the cable car. The line for the tickets was longer of the two when we were there."

We took the bus from the terminal as some of our group were a little too faint hearted to take the cable car and as they pointed out later in the day, the cable car became stuck in one spot for over an hour. You need to make sure your energy levels are up to the climb to the top, but very worthwhile as the views are amazing. WIll go back next time I visit Hong Kong it was such an peaceful place especially after the hustle and bustle of the shopping districts."

Getting there on the MRT was a piece of cake from Mong Kok station to Tung Chung despite needing to change lines it is really easy for English speaking people; simple touch screens but just be sure you have cash or coins as some machines are specific.Apparently you can prebook your tickets on line for the cable car- I'd recommend that you do as the 40-60 minute wait in the heat is almost too much to bear. You'll need to tell them when you get there. Look for a staff member as you need to jump the queue to pick up your tickets from the countersWe opted for the crystal cabin (clear floors) up and back but you have a choice of one either way or the normal floors both ways which was cheaper it cost us for three adults $750 hong kong dollars. The cabins hold about 8 people if it's quiet you maybe lucky to get one on your own.The views are fantastic, the trip takes about 20 minutes. Be sure and have your camera charged and ready to go as the photo opportunities are many.The walk up to the buddha took about ten minutes and then you hit the stairs. OMG on a hot day it can be a killer. You can go inside but you can't take photos Just before you get to the stairs they try to sell you tickets to the restaurant up the top - not sure what that was all about as they couldn't clearly explain to us and got a bit frustrated so we just left that. Not sure if the food was for us or the buddah but there seems to be an area you can only access at the very top if you have the meal ticketsAgain great photo opportunities with the buddah and surroundsThe \"village\" at the top provides plenty of shopping and dining alternatives but do take some water with you you'll need it!They take photos of you as you come and go with the cable car these cost about $100 HKG but there are extras like snow globes etc that can increase your price if you're interested.Glad we did it a lot of fun and great memories If you are so inclined you can walk over to the shopping centre near the Novotel it will take five minutes it's just next to the train station it's a bit like a DFO with some very high end stores on the top levels"

If you're fit, the climb up the stairs is really easy -- you just spend most of your energy walking around people who run up, puff out and stop for 10 minutes -- but once you're at the top, the view is amazing. She is also surrounded by other statues that are just as intricate in detail. Around the Buddha, there are lots of temples to see and general activities, shops, food stalls and other things to do."

We chose to go up via the cable car and chose a Crystal Cabin (glass bottom cable car), which in the end was a waste of time and money, only every 3rd cable car is a Crystal Cabin, so we ended up waiting for ages to get onto a car, and the line was HUGE. Ngong Ping Village is at the top of the cable car, it is touristy, expensive and over the top. There is a Bodi Wishing Shrine which is apparently where Siddhartha mediated attaining enlightenment and becoming Buddha.... well, it definitely was not this tree, because it is plastic a tourist trap to say the least. The Big Buddha its self is quite beautiful and the climb up the 200+ steps is worth it, the view of the mountains is fantastic. The Big Buddha is quite new (opened in 1993), so if you are hoping for an ancient relic, don't get your hopes up. I was torn by the Big Buddha, it is quite beautiful, but at the same time it is so touristy that it took away from the beauty of the statue and the scenery. It is probably worth a visit if you have a spare day in Hong Kong."

You can buy a ticket with or without lunch at the monastery. The lunch is excellent but there are plenty of other vegetarian eating options if you choose not to go to the monastery. The view are amazing from the top and despite the crowds it still manages to be a spiritual experience. Back at ground level take a leisurely walk round the whole site including the monastery. We ended our visit by taking the cable car to Tuen Chung which cost around \u00a38 each but was a fabulous experience. There were easy transport links back to HK and we opted for the MTR - a great day out."

Once you reach the top, the Buddha statue is awe-inspiring, even though one has to climb 288 steep steps. The meticulously handcrafted in Nanjing workshop sits serenely at the top blessing one and all. We found the monastery canteen vegetarian food to be OK."

Fare was around HKD 170 / 180 one way which seemed reasonable for a good 45 min drive. We noticed that it was possible to use the octupus card too.Our children enjoyed the trip, some stunning views over the sea even when travelling by bus, they were amazed by the sheer size of the statue and \"how chinese everything was\" and we were pleasantly surprised that a frozen lollipop for the kiddos did not cost an arm and a leg as it is often the case in tourist locations (HKD 300 for 5 icea creams/froen lollipops). We ate at the food court in the outlet shopping mall upon out return to Tung Chung which was a great find. Very huge choice of chinese and japanese food outlets, all of which were well prized and came in huge portions."

The Budda was slightly covered in mist but we managed to get a few good picture when the wind blew the mist away. There are a number of shops and places to eat. You could spend a good day visiting and relaxing. We noticed on the way up in the cable car that there was a path leading up into the mountains (If I recall correctly this was the walk of enlightenment) which you could follow instead of going up by cable car or coach! Im not sure how long this walk would take (possibly a good few hours) but it would certainly be an adventure. This is something we would definitely think about doing if we visit again.

Let me start by saying that it's worth visiting the Big Buddha but just remember that it was only built in the 80's, so the majority of people visiting this site are actually older than the statue itself.I arrived like most do via the cable car, which spits you out in to what can only be called a Disneyland-esque village, full of giftshops and chain restaurants - some will really enjoy this, others won't. From there you head down an avenue of statues to the bottom of the Buddha - it's free to climb up (although they'll try to sell you stuff at the bottom). There's a small museum inside with a few displays about how the Buddha was built here - I didn't buy the meal ticket but others seem to rate this highly. Goes without saying that it's quite hot in summer and there's little shade, so take an umbrella or hat if you do go, along with some water - the steps are well maintained and there's room for you to rest so just take your time. Have heard from others than the mist around the statue can mean you can stand under it and not be able to see it, so try and pick your day wisely if you can."

We were fine with that as we wanted to arrive early since it was Saturday. We just divided the cost between the 4 of us. Ended up being about $10 USD each.I actually dont remember the cost of the cable car. You have the option to take the traditional or all glass car. The glass car cost a little more. We took the escalator up, walked to the window to purchase tickets, and got in line to board. There were two in front of us for the glass car. There was about 50 in line for the regular cars. Everything moves very quickly. As you board, your picture is taken.The cable car ride is about 25 minutes. It is wonderful with stunning views. As you get hire and curve across the mountains, the buddha suddently comes into view. Very nice! When you arrive at the top, there is a group of folks waiting to sell you your picture. yep, the one they took when you first entered the cable car. They work fast. We spent about an hour at the top and headed back down.To return, we took the train back. It was very easy. The cost for us to Mongkok was $12 HKD and took about 25 minutes.

You start of by taking a ride on a cable car for over twenty minutes just to get to the statue. The statue itself is at the top of hill and you have to walk up over two hundred and fifty stairs, but it is well worth it. I went there with my fianc\u00e9 and my good friend, although my fianc\u00e9 had been there several times before all three of us thoroughly enjoyed the attraction. When you get to the top you'll be amazed at how large the bronze statue actually is (34 metres, or something like that), plus you'll be able to see all the other smaller statues that surround the Big Buddha. I would have to say that if you visit Hong Kong and you don't pay the Big Buddha monument a visit you'll miss out on one of the best sites Hong Kong has to offer."

Take Exit B and you'll see Citygate Outlets shopping mall. Then walk to the bus station. Total commuting time by MTR was \u00b1 40 minutes.We then queued (\u00b1 20 minutes) for bus no 23. Decent bus and it is always full with tourists. The cable car did not operate when we were there (March 2012). I was informed that it had to be stopped temporarily since since the last accident in January 2012. The bus went all the way to where the Big Buddha is. It was \u00b1 50 minutes ride.It's always a good feeling visiting religious sites. As soon as we arrived at the bus stop, we could see the Big Buddha. It is nice to walk in the surrounding park which is also Po Lin Monastery. Climbing up to where the Big Buddha seated is recommended. There are perhaps 150 steps or more? But it's worth to try, I stopped once or twice, to rest & to take pics! Great views from the top. Those who can't stand the wind, and also depending on the weather/season, I'd suggest them to bring sweater/pashmina in case the wind blows, especially when we're at the top.There is no admission fee. At the entrance, we were happy to take the offer to puchase a meal coupon for snack (ice cream & mineral water).We also checked surrounding area. There are beautiful temples and people is praying there. There is a vegetarian restaurant too.If you have time, after taking the bus #23 back to Citygate Outlets shopping mall, spend time to walk around the mall. It's full of factory outlets of famous brands with special price."

The toilets were horrendous - just pits in the ground. The return bus trip was a ride from hell and we actually prayed for a safe return. Thankfully we could take the train directly to Tung Chung, which used to be a sleepy fishing village but is now very commercial with a very large discount shopping mall and food hall. We chose to take the cable car directly to the site. There was a very long queue, however there was a sign that indicated about a 1 hour wait so we waited. Well, apparently tour groups take precedence and were constantly let into the queue and so 1 hour stretched out to 3 hrs. We arrived at the site about 2pm. The cable car ride was great especially as the floor was see through. Once off the cable car we had to make our way througha large tourist trap with dinky shops, souvenirs and westernised fun park rides all decked out to look like China 100s of years ago. Finally made it to gate and then the long climb up to the statue. This was great although very crowded. At this point I must point out that the toilets have improved out of sight. We took the cable car back down - had about a 20min wait for it. By this time it was about 3:30pm and the cable cars coming up were half empty. All a matter of timing."

There are lots of ways to access Lantau Island, but to get fantastic views of the Buddha on the way in (and to appreciate how enormous it actually is) catch the Ngong Ping 360 Cable Car.The gift shops at the bottom of the hill are reasonably priced for gift shops, however they have some different things to what I could find elsewhere. Worth a look if you want to take home something a bit different and more \"traditionally chinese\" than some of the other things you can find around Hong Kong. There are also some great photo opportunities at the bottom of the hill, particularly the old monastery which is absolutely gorgeous and vibrantly coloured (bit of a walk though).I don't know if it is just a coincidence but despite the hoards of tourists this place has a surprisingly Zen feel about it. I was content to just sit on a bench at the bottom of the buddha for a while and soak up the atmosphere.At the bottom of the steps make sure you buy a ticket to get into the buddha at the top, it comes with an ice cream and drink when you get there. Trust me you will want that ice cream when you reach the top! It is free to climb the steps, but if you want to go inside the buddha and see the museum they have set up you need to purchase the ticket, and it seemed to us that you need to purchase it at the bottom. It was only a couple of $HK and worth it just for the drink, although we did enjoy the museum as well.The buddha itself is just breathtaking. It is the world's largest seated buddha, and until you see it yourself you cannot fathom how big it is. Although once you're about half way up the stairs you start to appreciate it. Take it slow, although it is very crowded no one is pushy, I was nursing an ankle injury and I never felt rushed or in any danger of falling. There are plenty of hand rails. Stop at various points to just take some beautiful photos that remind you that so close to the Metropolis of Hong Kong is a lovely place that reminds you that you are in China."

The buddha is impressive, as I though it would be. You get to a big plaza, where you can see the buddha from down the stairs. We bought the HK$25 ticket, which let us go inside the buddha and get an icecream at the top of the stairs.. ofcourse this icecream was the big appeal in the hot weather... :) We went up the stairs and got to the buddha, it is really magic (not crowded at all) You also get to see a marvelous view of Lantau Island. When I say, got more than I expected is because I didn't know what I would find around. When you get back down, you should visit the monastery. Where you can light up incense, and enter the temple.  Then go into the little \"town\" where there are some great souvenir shops and restaurants, (there is a Starbucks and a Subway and a few Chinese restaurants)You can go back to town in the cable car, which is a Most do... specially if you take the crystal cabin.

As the Ngong Ping 360 cable car was closed, we really didn't have a choice, anyway! The first thing I noticed was the heavy fog. Once that cleared, I could see the Big Buddha in the distance. Although entrance to the Buddha is free, we had to buy a snack or meal coupon which was redeemable at the cafe or restaurant in Po Lin Monastary. Unless you're really hungry, the snack will suffice! It's then up the many stairs to the Buddha. It looked other-worldly in the fog, and just as majestic when the fog cleared. I had heard about the \"feral cows\" on Lantau Island, but doubted that I'd see any. Well, there were a few as we headed back to the parking lot. Overall, a great excursion out to Lantau Island."

The lines and wait for the cable cars was about an hour so the lady said for us to take a bus there and cable cars back. I am so glad we did it this way. We got to see more of the land and oceans side. It was very interesting, the bus was air conditioned and the driver drove fast. It took about 35 minutes to get there. Once there was lots to do.

I took the bus from the airport to the Tung Chung Bus Terminus, and from the bus station there is a bus that goes directly to the Giant Buddha. The buses were nice, similar to the city buses in Canada. It is a little cheaper if you buy the day pass. I decided not to because I did not want to wait in a line, I just payed when I got on the bus.The bus drops you off in front of the monastery. You have to pay a few Hong Kong dollars to purchase a ticket to go inside the Buddha statue, a free meal and drink is included in the ticket price. There as a lot of stairs (260) to go up to the Buddha, so it is best to travel light. There are many fascinating statues around the Buddha of generals and women offering incense, and food to the Buddha.Once you enter the inside of the Buddha statue, you are not allowed to take pictures. There is a giant bell inside, some old paintings, and other stuff on display. The center piece of the display, the reason why the statue was build was for the sacred bone relic. The bone relic is a piece of bone that was taken from Buddha's body after he died, it was donate by Sri Lanka. The bone relic looks like a small white object about the size of a tooth.I when there in March 2012. The weather was cool, and foggy. It was nice weather for traveling, but not for taking pictures.

Ummm - riding to the Buddha over the forest in Willie Wonka's glass elevator or a bus ride winding thru the hills. Boooo! Well the bus ride wasn't that bad. When we got to Ngong Ping, the fog was so bad that we couldn't see five feet in front of us. Which I kind of loved - it gave it that other-worldly, Shangri-la vibe. It just got worse and luckily, there was a sandwich-board sign with an arrow saying \"Giant Buddha.\"You then pay a nominal fee that includes lunch (which we skipped) and you can climb the 280 stairs and see the reliquary inside. So about halfway up, it occurred to me that the Buddha statue is supposed to be visible from miles away - we were a few feet from it but couldn't see a thing. Suddenly the fog shifted a little and there was the giant figure, looming above us. SO AMAZING. I think the fog really added to the whole experience, but I would love to go back and see it via the glass bucket and maybe some clear skies. Either way. Oh and we bought lots of souvenirs at the top and I'm really glad we did! Really cool stuff and the prices weren't bad. We decided we literally saw as much as was possible to see, and decided to rush through the mall you have to pass thru to get to the taxi stand. Taking a cab back instead of the bus was a good call. Got us back to the train station in half the time, so we could get ourselves over to the New Territories and see the 10,000 Buddhas (to kind of make up for not really seeing one giant one)."

The worst transport experience in Hong Kong because every other mode of transport in Hong Kong is so good with trains and ferries etc every 5-10 minutes etc. The road journey was interesting with a winding narrow road taking you up into the hills to the Buddha. Where the bus stops is a bit \u201ctouristy\u201d with naff souvenirs etc. Despite the hard sell on the lunch for $65 we luckily avoided this as it looked like crap (fried spring rolls, mushrooms and rice). Others have reported it to be the worst meal they had in Hong Kong.We did however buy the ticket inside the Buddha (including an ice cream and a mineral water for $25 each) as I figured i might need some refreshment when i got to the top! After trekking up the 200 steps (panting heavily from my overweight) I enjoyed the fantastic view and a very calming stroll through the building. Couldn't understand much as it was all in Chinese but a nice cultural experience - very peaceful. Got some great photos of Buddha and the surrounding countryside.We went to check out Tai O fishing village by bus but it was another 35 minute wait for the bus and since it was hot we couldn\u2019t be bothered so we jumped on the next bus to Mui Wo. This is a pretty little fishing village with a couple of nice restaurants perched on the hillside. We had a late lunch (about 3.30pm) of chicken cashew nuts, sliced beef and vegetables, fried rice, pork and vegetables etc for $90 each which was much nicer than the \"Vegetarian Lunch\" offered at the Po Lin monastery for $65. From Mui Wo we took the fast ferry back to Central for $28 getting off at the IFC centre. Overall a great day trip which only cost us about HK$200 each."

We went to the Big Buddha after reading about it on wikitravel and seeing great reviews on TripAdvisor... however, I really found it to be underwhelming. I have seen a number of Buddha's in China and Southeast Asia and was kind of disappointed with this one, to be completely honest. I have to mention that when we went, the cable car was not operational - a lot of the reviews we saw about the Big Buddha talked about how the cable car ride was amazing. If the cable cars are running when you visit Lantau Island, then maybe it is a worth a visit. If you want to see a REALLY big buddha with lots of history, go visit the one at Leshan in Sichuan province :) the gold-mounted buddha on Emeishan in Sichuan is also spectacular.To get to the Big Buddha: take the HK MTR to Tung Chung Station. From here, you can take the No. 23 bus to the attraction. I think that a day pass is about 35 HKD - you can use this all day and take any of the buses, including the one to Tai O."

You can even see the airport. The wait for the cable car was about 40 mins and we vistited about 1pm. You get a glimpse of the Buddha as the cable car proceeds closer. The walk from the cable car to the climb to the Buddha is about 10 mins. The stairs are quite steep but so worth the climb. Please make sure you take water with you and wear sunscreen as there is very little shade. You can walk all around the Buddha and it is huge and I mean huge. The views are again breath taking. It's amazing how they built it. We found it very spiritual and you will be so glad you made the effort."

One can climb up the stairs and go into the chamber where the relics of Buddha are kept and take in the peaceful vibes. It is very quiet inside but outside the chamber it is very touristy. There is plenty of interesting Chinese trinkets available in the shops around. The most memorable part of my trip was the vegetarian meal at the monastery. That was the tastiest and most satiating meal I have had. The temples in the monastery are very colourful and beautifully decorated."

Your pictures will pictures speak for themselves so I'll cut straight to the tips.Get an Octopus card - so very easy to use everywhere including the bus.Currently (second week of Februaruy) no cable car from Tung Chung at the end of the orange (Tung Chung) line so we took exit B and made straight for the bus depot then across kitty corner (about 10 o clock and outside )to bus 21 very clearly marked and helpful people and a queue to guide you. This takes you on a winding trip to the village for the Big Buddha (the bus 23 takes 15 minutes to Tai o fishing village on stilts if interested). Please note those were the numbers at the time of my visit so they are a guide only. If you pay the small fee to go up inside the Buddha (currently about \u00a32.50 in UK currency) you get a ticket for a lunch of noodles, two desserts and a drink - not gourmet but a blessing from Buddha if you're on a budget. Plenty of shrines for worship and photo opportunities too - a pretty spectacular and impressive place even with large numbers of tourists."

Certainly worth to spend an afternoon there. Better still is to stay until sunset. A combination of Buddha, temple, mountains and sunset, sounds terrific for photo fans. Do try the vegetarian food provided by the temple. When you walk around the temple, do take the care of not to walk too deep inside, although you will not see any signages to stop you. Last time I went, I wondered around within the temple and garden, with very few signages. Suddenly I found myself in front of small houses like dormintory, and a lady ( a student nun I think) standing in front of the house. I sensed that I should go back, but not sure of the way. So I asked the lady the way out. She gave me a surprising answer, looks a bit angry : Go where you come from. Wow!!! While I turned around and went back, I met some hikers and brought me all the way to the main entrance. So, a very kind walk-by hiker and an angry unhelpful nun."

However, don't let this put you off because you can easily get there by bus. Just go to the Tung Chung shopping centre/bottom of the cable car and take bus no. 23. It's $17.50 each way and you'll need cash and correct change but there is a little desk there giving change so you have the correct money to pay on board. The bus journey is great, with fantastic scenery. The 'village' at the top is a tourist spot but not as garish as expected. It wasn't busy the day we went - a Tuesday lunchtime. Go up the Buddha first so you get your snack ticket (we did this the wrong way around, it's $25 I think) , then look at the monastery and restaurant/ cafe(we preferred the snacks rather than the main meals). We also walked around the Wisdom Path which has lovely carvings of the Heart Sutra and great views of the surrounding countryside. It's great to come up here and see the greenery and tranquility compared to the usual hectic image of Hong Kong. We will definitely go up here on another visit to experience the cable car and also do some hiking as there are trails up there plus to visit Tai-O fishing village which is on the island too."

Instead of lining up with the hoards of people waiting for the Ngong Ping 360 cable car which opens at 10.00am, get there early & catch the bus (no. 11 i think, but there are people there to assist) to the Big Buddha. This bus ride takes you to the Big Buddha via other side of the island takes no longer than the cable car ride with some great photo ops. You get there before the crowds and make sure you buy the ticket for Big Buddha museum and snack. This ticket cost HK46 for two and snack was plate of vege noodles each, 4 dim sum and drink each. There is a more expensive lunch ticket which is apparently also very good. Once you've done the site seeing, walk through Ngong Ping village and catch cable car down to Teung Chung. There was no wait at cable car down as the crowds were coming the other way. Once back down, there was a wait of approx. 1 to 1.5 hours to get on the cable car.

There are plenty of people praying and the smell of incense and birdsong fill the air. Here and there monks go about their daily wanderings. It's a pretty nice place to just be and watch the life go by, and if you're up there between 12 and 4pm you can partake in the vegetarian lunch prepared by the monks. The only downside are the lineups for the cable car. On the way back, the line upas were almost 3 hours long! A bit of advice which we stumbled upon by accident - buy the Crystal Car roundtrip ticket for the cable car on the way up - it is a bit more expensive, but it gets you into a much shorter line up, especially on the way back. Because we had the Crystal Car tickets, our line up was only 1 hour long instead of 3!Some photos of our visit to Big Buddha here: http://lenamitranic.smugmug.com/Travel/Hong-Kong/20951232_6P2GNm"

It is the best soya bean curd that I have ever tasted. And it is cheap too. For westerners who are unfamiliar with the Chinese culture, there are souvenirs that are being sold at that mock village. They make wonderful gifts, however are pricey and are meant specially for tourist.

This really is a modern day equivalent to the seven wonders of the ancient world.I took the MTR to Tung Chung station (about 30-40 minutes from Hong Kong island), and then took the cable car (cost of the round trip, 115 HK$). The cable car ride itself includes some great views of the area, and took about 20 minutes one way. I visited late morning on a Saturday and there was a fairly long line up to purchase tickets. It seemed to go reasonably quickly however, and there was hardly any line up for the cable car on the way back; my timing on that trip was fortunate I guess. When I returned to the MTR area, there were large numbers of people still leaving for the statue. I can only recommend visitors start out early on their day so that they don't have to rush things when they finally get to the Buddha statue itself. This is the kind of tourist destination that should not be rushed! The crowds might also be a bit smaller on a weekday, but since I was in Hong Kong for only four days, I had little choice in the matter (I got to see Victoria Peak on a less crowded Thursday in exchange). The Big Buddha area includes a touristy village of souvenir shops and restaurants, which led to an impressive Chinese style gate and promenade. This walkway features statues of 12 Generals, each of which represents a different year in the Chinese astrological cycle.The Big Buddha statue is amazing, and the walk up those 268 odd steps is well worth the effort. The Lotus platform surrounding the statue includes statues of six Devas offering various gifts. These are intriguing sites in their own right, although obviously dwarfed by the main statue.Although it was fairly smoggy on the day I visited, the view of the island itself from the statue was also impressive. I thoroughly enjoyed my trip here, and heartily recommend this site to all tourists."

It is quite strenguous to walk the 200+ steps up to the statue, and then further both outside for a better view and inside if you pay and visit the small museum of art and artefacts, including a relic from the Buddha. And there is no place to shade from the sun. So make sure one gets up to the Big Buddha early before it becomes too hot. Ngong Ping 360 cable car is busy even on weekdays, so make a reservation at their website and collect tickets using their fast track channel to reduce queuing and waiting. I do not recommend the alternative bus trip - it is cramped, the trip rough, and a few fellow travellors became travel-sick. This is a religious site where ancestors are commomerated in a Buddhist beliefs, so dress and behave respectfully and do not consume meat or meaty snacks in the Monastry and at the Big Buddha."

It takes a long time to get out to Tung Chung from Central and the lines for the cable car were well in excess of an hour and a half. Do yourself a favor, take the No. 23 bus to the top and then take the cable car down. Spend the extra HKD30 to ride in the Crystal Gondola as the lines are much shorter and it is really cool to look down through the floor to the ground. The views from the gondola were great and that part of the trip was a fun. The bus ride up is excruciatingly slow although there are some good views to see, particularly on the south side of the island. While the Buddha statue itself was impressive and the view from the top was also impressive, the temples were just ok - nowhere near the league of some of the world class temples in other parts of Asia. The grounds were also quite dirty. Took the Tea Garden trail to see what that was like and it was most unspectacular and very ramshackle looking. Also ran into a pack of dogs (fortunately friendly) which was a bit disconcerting. On the way back to the cable car, walked through Ngong Ping village, which was nothing more than a channel to capture shoppers from the cable car entrance/exit to the Buddha. Complete with cheap tourist stores and a Starbucks and a Subway, this really was a turn off."

We took the MTR to Tung Chung and followed the signs. We didn't book tickets beforehand, so we had to wait for it and OMG... Haha, it took us 1 and a half hours to get our tickets, so book your tickets beforehand!!!We decided to take the crystal cable car to go up the mountain and go back down with the regular one. Hahaha, it's a bit more economic that way and you would have experienced it both ways :) I think it's less than 169 HK dollar, since that is the price for a round trip with the crystal car. So yeah...Shared the cable car with two other small groups and they would stop the car at sudden points to allow you to take pictures of the scenery. It was a bit cloudy and rainy, so that was a bit of a bummer, but it had its charm as well. The Crystal floor is a definite must try! It was so cool!!! The architecture style of the buildings up there are really nice and it somehow makes you feel as if you're walking in this ancient Chinese village. A lot of souvenirs available, but they are so trying to rip you off. But if your wallet doesn't mind it, go crazy I'd say.The Buddha statue is absolutely breathtaking and it's a bit of a hike, but nothing that young or healthy people can't handle haha :d Once again, ladies, PLEASE don't wear heels to this place AND PLEASE don't wear any lacy, flowy OR skimpy dresses. It's a high place and the wind is not gonna be your ally regarding your attire. And do I have to mention the word \" STAIRS\" once again? I have seen tons of these ladies having a hard time going up the stairs or either coming down. For those who are also interested in Tai-O ( the fishermen's village), there are buses leaving from Ngong Ping, so you can definitely fix a ride if you have enough time to do so.So in summary:1) book tickets beforehand2) wear comfortable foot wear3) Don't overspend on souvenirs there. You can get them cheaper in the Ladies Market anyways :)Enjoy and take lots of pictures!"

Located on Lan Tau island, you need to take the MTR all the way to Tung Chung Station (here's a tip - from Tung Chung Station, you can easily hop on a bus to get to the airport WITHOUT any fuss....the buses are regular and the trip takes about 20 minutes. You save quite a lot of money if you're not in a rush to the airport to catch your flight. Be warned that HK Airport is such a maze and the HK folks aren't very fluent English speakers so it could be quite crazy navigating the airport if that is your first time there.)You need to buy tickets to get on the cable car rides in order to get to the Big Buddha. The cable car ride is worth the money because you see amazing views of the airport as well as Lan Tau island. The cable car folks will ask if you want the Crystal Cabin which is just another way of asking you if you want a glass floor for your cable car. (Crystal Cabins cost a bit more). I'd say forget about the glass floors. You'd be too happy with the rest of the views to bother with the views down below (not exactly exciting for those who fear heights!).The cable car ride takes about 30 minutes and it is great. From afar you will see the Big Buddha. He seems to loom ahead, but as you reach the final station, you realize he is not that huge. Anyway, you still have some way to walk so enjoy the views. Go during spring as it is cooler but it is also a hit and miss - you may get fog so the view when you get to the Big Buddha isn't that fantastic.You can spend the whole afternoon just gawking and taking photos. The steps leading up aren't taxing at all. You can have a vegetarian meal at the temple too."

Also, on the return, it was about another hour wait. There is a bus, which is about an hour ride, but you don't get the amazing view of the South China Sea from the cable car.

Although I must admit that my husband didn\u2019t find it quite as exciting or interesting. As a resident of HK I\u2019m well experienced at HK crowds therefore like everywhere in HK, I suggest to go early (especially to tourist attractions). Also I suggest to do a round trip: ferry from Central to Mui Wo, bus to the Big Buddha then cable cars to Tung Chung and train back as this will enable one to see different parts of Hong Kong there and back. You may wish to stop at the Kowloon MTR on the way back for something to eat and/or shopping. During summer months, take a hat, sunscreen and water. Ensure you have good shoes on as there are steps to climb. Although the Big Buddha is free, like every tourist place items sold in the area are expensive therefore you may want to take some snacks with you.Enjoy!"

The Big Buddha is a separate attraction that is next to the monestary. Whether or not you adhere to buddhist principles and practices, this is a stunning monument and landmark. On this trip, we opted to leave Hong Kong early and take the metro to the last stop on Lantau Island. We then boarded the 23 bus to the monestary. I think that the metro cost 19 HKD and the bus cost 17 HKD. The bus ride can be rather long and winding. We reached the monestary about 45 minutes before the Big Buddha opened so we wandered around for a bit.At 10 am when the Buddha opened, we purchased our ticket (23 HKD). The admission ticket includes a bottle of water and ice cream. We climbed to the top of the stairs to take in the statue and the surrounding views. On our way down, we exchanged our ticket for the premium ice cream bar. It was just starting to get really hot. So what could be better than a little ice cream with the Buddha?!?!We opted to take the gondola back down. At 11 am there is no waiting for the return trip. We were able to get the first crystal car and we were the only riders.Lovely way to start the day!"

Being in the Crystal Cabin, rather than regular cars allowed us to wait for a much shorter time because not nearly as many people spent the extra few dollars for the glass floor. There was virtually no wait on the way down, and we got our own private car too!The Buddha is quite large, and it appears larger because it sits by itself. There are statues around it at the top of the steps, and there are the 12 animal statues on the path toward the steps, so there are lots of personalized picture-taking opportunities.We brought lunch with us and ate it before walking the steps up to the Buddha. There are also restaurants there. A local friend told me to not eat the vegetarian lunch that you can buy tickets for at the base of the steps to the Buddha. There were lots of people there because it was a nice day, but it wasn't as crowded as many attractions in China can be; perhaps because it was Easter Weekend. I highly recommend that you buy tickets through your hotel before coming because it saves LOTS of time standing in line -- you get the \"short\" line if you've already paid. Also, it appeared that going in the afternoon might actually afford you a shorter line because all the tour groups seem to go there in the morning.I've seen several Big Buddhas, and this one is unique because it's not enclosed in a building. It's definitely worth seeing if the visibility is good, and the clouds are not too low."

The sight of the giant Buddha as you walk the 286 steps is breath-taking. There is a small fee to enter the museum directly under the Buddha, but this fee is well worth it, just to see the relic of Gautama Buddha, consisting some of his alleged cremated remains. The attached monastery is bigger than at first glance, and having a wander around we found some lovely quiet places to pay our respects to the Buddhavistas. The stalls selling souvenirs here are rather overpriced."

We chose the Glass Bottom Cable Car and it WAS AMAZING! It is quite a long ride (around 30-40 min) with views of the city and the sea and the mountains. it is an amazing sight! The landscape and walk up to the Buddha is beautiful as well. Once you finally get to the Buddha however, you find out that there are 268 stair-steps that you must climb to the top. Since I am not a worshipper of Buddha, I did not make all the stairs to the top but thoroughly enjoyed the incredible Asian cultural experience!! We did the whole thing in about 3 hours... so plan a slightly longer lay-over in Hong Kong and take this little excursion."

The Big Budha is located on top of a hill, to reach which, cable cars have to be taken. And believe you me, they ARE one of the best engineering marvels of the world. The cable goes from the Lantau island, which is near the HongKong airport, crosses the ocean, over 3 or 4 mountains and then reaches the main destination. You can see the forest , waterfall and even the walking path in the forest that was used by monks to walk all the way to the Buddha (phew) , from your cable car ( specially if you take the one with glass floor called crystal cabin). Its a sight that just has to be experinced. You can see the Buddha from a mountain or 2 ahead, and you wont be able to take your eys off him. Once we reached there, we had to walk for about a kilometer ( but you just wont feel tired, as the whole path has tiny artificial villages selling wonderful things) and them climb up the steep stairs (can take some air out of you !!).

You then walk a few hundred meters to the cable car station and buy tickets. We got the crystal box car (slighlty more), but with a glass bottom, it was probably more interesting than the standard box cars. After a pretty spectacular ride over what seemed like several miles over very hilly terrain, you arrive at the town(?)/monastary(?)/tourist site(?) where you can buy snacks, water, souvenirs, etc. You then follow the path to the hill where the Buddha sits. It is about 250 steps up to the Buddha and you can pay what was about $23 HK to go inside the Buddha and get a \"free\" water and ice cream at the top. I'd say, go for it since it's not an easy trek up the stairs, and you want to minmize your excess weight. Inside the buddha, there are some pictures and historically significant writings (all in chinese - so I didn't find it too interesting), a Buddhist relic, and souvenirs."

It's manageable. Just take your time. At the foot of the steps, you can choose to buy a vegetarian meal coupons for 60HKD per person, which includes a pass to go into the little museum inside the Buddha itself. (tips: Nothing amazing about the musuem, just some artifacts and paintings, and most of the translation is in chinese.) After making your rounds, and taking pictures of the view from the Big Buddha, you can proceed to have the vegetarian meal if you bought the coupons earlier. (tips: the meal was great. Generous proportion. All vegetarian. Worth it)We walked through the Ngong Ping village towards the cable car station to make our way down. You can get hold of souvenirs and such here. It was around 1pm, and there was no queue. (tips: one way cable car ride cost around 75HKD. Two way is cheaper, around 110HKD.) The ride down took around 25mins, and we didn't regret it. Beautiful view of Lantau island, the airport and mountaineous area around it. Reccommended.Tips: Plan your trip early to avoid the crowd. Crowds come in around midday. The place is open at 10am. If you're taking the bus up, be at the bus station by 9am. Don't miss the cable car ride, be it one way or return trip. Try the vegetarian meal.

Very easy and cheap. There are three options for cable car - standard, crystal, and private. We opted for the Crystal 360 and it was definitely the right choice. For very little more money, you get to go straight to the front of the line, passing endless miles of Chinese tourists waiting in the standard line. We were there during holiday week, so the standard price was at holiday rates, while the Crystal rates were still the same - they don't have holiday rates. So, we ended up actually paying less than the standard ones, and got not only a glass-bottom car, but we got to pass up all the huge lines and go right to the front! The private is expensive, and our car ended up being private anyway, so not worth it for that.You go on the cable car for quite a while, getting mostly views of mountains and the airport. At the end of the ride, they take your photo and sell it to you for 88 HKG. There is a small village with some restaurants and shops, a walking with Buddha attraction that we skipped because we had seen so much Buddha story lately in China, and a Monkey attraction that is for kids. You have to walk for about 10 minutes to get a straight on view of the Giant Buddha - and he truly is Giant. Definitely the biggest Buddha we've ever seen. Then you can walk up 100 steps to go up to his foot and get a view of the mountains. If you pay a little more, you can go up a little higher for a little better view, but we didn't do that - it was enough. It was really hot.All told, including transport, this trip probably took us about 4 hours. No need for a guide, if you want to learn about Buddha, you can do the Walking with Buddha attraction or visit the Monastery nearby (we didn't see the Monastery because we'd been to so many lately - it was enough for us to see the Buddha). All in all, while this wasn't a super spectacular attraction, it was very enjoyable and nice to see Lantau Island, where there are no skyscrapers, only jungle for the most part. Something different and a nice short escape from the Metropolis of Hong Kong. Photographers take note that we were there at 1:00 PM or so, and the sun was directly behind and/or above the Buddha, so our photos were all overexposed - if you have a solar filter, bring it. Otherwise, try to plan your trip earlier in the day or later in the day so the sun isn't so right overhead."

            "review": "Great place, get there early!. I left my hotel (JW Marriott in Central) at 7:00am on a Sunday, took the ferry from Central terminal 6 (took MTR to Hong Kong station and then walked to the pier), about 45 min ride. Got in a cab on the other side, since the buses were not very regular at that hour. I was the only one there when I got to the statue and the Monastery - it was beautiful at that time in the morning, hazy and cool. Cab ride was about 30 minutes, cost HKD135.The statue steps are not open till 10:00am, but there is lot to walk around to... I went to the Wisdom Path - very impressive - and then continued on to hike the side of the mountain. Gave up after about 1 hour since I ran out of water, but this seems to be a must do next time, atleast for me! Make sure you have good shoes, its a tricky and hard climb.The status is impressive, and the views from the walk to the side of the mountain by Wisdom Path give you a good feel for the size.I had the vegetarian meal at the monastery, delicious, and the ticket allowed me to get to the museum inside the Buddha.... the murals were impressive.I am back in my room, after another cab and ferry ride at 2:30pm... and did not feel rushed!"

            "review": "Worth the time and the effort. I took the 360 cable car across the island to visit the Big Buddha. You don't realize how tall 35 metres is, until you come up against this statue. You can appreciate it from below, but be brave and take the stairs to the top to really enjoy this site. Currently work being done on the site, but doesn't diminish from the beauty of the attraction."

Wow - I think that sums up the Budda itself.\nThe monestry nearby is nice too, you have to buy a ticket for a vegetarian meal there if you want to see the top tier of the Budda, that's why I bought the meal ticket but the meal turned out to be great (and I'm no vegetarian!)."

            "review": "What a wonderful day!. The next day took us out to Lantau Island, near the airport where the tallest outdoor Buddha (Tian Tan Buddha) in China sits on a hill. As much as we enjoyed the destination, it was a day to enjoy the journey. After another trip on the MTR (to the Tung Chung station, exit B), we connected to the Ngong Ping 360 cable car (less than 5 min walk from the station). 25 minutes of soaring over the mountains (which were lined with hiking trails) in a glass bottom cable car were awesome! The views were great. Take a look at the pamphlet they hand you when you buy tickets \u2013 it gives you an idea of what you are seeing from many of the points along the ride such as Tung Chung Bay, the HK Airport, Lantau North County Park, and Ngong Ping Village, as well as the Buddha. Make sure the windows in your car are open, as that will provide better \u201cair-conditioning\u201d. We explored the village, and after hiking the 250+ steps up to the Buddha, we enjoyed a wonderfully authentic Chinese lunch at Ngong Ping Garden Restaurant. Why is it that German beer (Carlsburg) is cheaper in Hong Kong than Chinese beer? It turned out to be a great place to people watch. Staff was friendly and made good menu suggestions \u2013 although the menu has lots of photos to help as well. We spent about $250HK (~$32 US) for 2 entrees, 2 beers and 2 sodas including service charge and tip. They also brought a traditional hot tea after the meal. You can visit the museum inside the base of the Buddha for the cost of a \u201cmeal ticket\u201d. For $23 HK/person, you get to enter the museum (which has AC), explore a bit, and then a drink and ice cream are included. Not a must, but on a hot day, it\u2019s a nice break after the hike up. Also, this was the only place in Hong Kong that we pulled out our bug spray. There were lots of buzzing things in the area around the Buddha and some of them did bite! Afterward, we took the cable car back and enjoyed the views once again --- this time we had the car all to ourselves! It seems you have a much better chance of not being in a car with many other people in the Crystal Cabins. There are a couple of points where they photograph you in the cable car cabins. Photos can be purchased as prints, files emailed or other souvenirs purchased. We were a little disappointed with the print quality of the photo, but it\u2019s fun nonetheless \u2013 next time I\u2019d consider getting the file email. There are a couple of additional options in the tickets, but we didn\u2019t add those. Shops in the village are a little expensive, but on par with the other tourist locations in Hong Kong. There\u2019s also a 7-11 for drinks / snacks, and the western restrooms were clean. Roundtrip tickets for the Crystal Cabin (the one with the glass bottom) were $157HK / person vs. $96 HK for the regular one. About every 5th car has the glass bottom, so you might have to wait about 10 minutes for the next one. Cable cars start running at 10 AM and are fairly busy (they fill the cars with 8-10 people when busy) for a while after they first open. Coming back, everyone is at their own pace, so much less crowded, but that would depend on the time of day you leave. To us, it was worth taking both ways --- the tide went out while we were on the island. Going back at low tide, you could see the locals gathering seafood below you."

            "review": "Mystic Fog. We went to the Big Budhha last March 7, 2009 coming from Kowloon Island, which was pretty easy since Hong Kong must be offering the most convenient transportation options you can find in the world. Anyway, we got on the MTR all the way to Lantau Island (From TST station to Lantau is about 16HK$ I think - with a short stopover at Hong Kong Station). We land at Lantau Station and immediately notice some drizzling. It was fine and all, and I was a bit happy about it to be honest because already some fog was forming on the ground. We head towards the nearby mall to buy some gloves (I was wearing very light clothing) because my hands were freezing. Anyway, we took the cable car to Ngong Ping Island instead of the Bus (the bus is considerably cheaper) but we wanted the whole experience. The sign cautioned cable car passengers that vision will be compromised due to the fog.. IT WAS. I hardly saw anything.. and my clothes were a damp by the time we land in Ngong Ping because the cable car has open slits at the seat area. Anyway, Ngong Ping Village was amazingly surreal.. maybe the fog helped with that a bit, like being inside the Silent Hill movie but not horror. I really didn't see everything because my vision was limited to about 10km ahead of me. We headed straight to the Big Buddha, following a trail and climbed the 100+ steps up to the Buddha. It was exhausting.. and we had to stop a couple of times and up until we were almost at the top that we saw that fantastic mystical big buddha all covered in fog. It would have been even more fantastic if the sun was shining and everything was clear. Nonetheless, it was still amazing and it was picture-wise, quite mystical. On top, you could hear the monks at the Po Lin Monastery chanting.. seeing only the tops of pine trees covered with fog, looking up at the big buddha was a very spiritual and fantastic experience. Will come back for sure to see it in the sunshine!"

We also did the monkey theatre and walking with the buddha while up in the village. The village itself is full of shops of course, but all very nice and cute. A must see while in Hong Kong."

            "review": "A must see in Hong Kong. Worlds biggest BuddhaDo visit the world's largest outdoor bronze statue of Buddha on Lantua Island, Ngong Ping, it was a great trip out of the city. Avoid the weekends, which are apparently chaotic. Take the MTR Tung Chung Line to Tung Chung Station (Hong Kong Station to Tung Chung Station 1 Hr)Three ways to get up to the mountain top.1. Walk 3 \u2013 4 hours on concrete path. A major hike, with 3 false hill tops. Not for the faint hearted.2. Take No. 23 Bus (Not sure how often it leaves- but it was waiting as we got off the tube (train/tram). The bus takes a bone shaking ride along hair pin bends, where we had three near crashes with oncoming traffic. Cost $16 HK. It was a real experience and we saw other sides of the island (including the prison and dam). At least take it one way (best up).3. Sky Train - Cost $68HK one way. A very scenic cable car, which takes you up the mountain, above the airport, to the mock Chinese village, with genuine western prices! Walk up through the village to the Big Buddha.The long steps up to the Big Buddha are free. Some elderly and obese tourists struggled. However purchase a coupon for entry into the 3 levels exhibition hall beneath the Big Buddha Go inside the Buddha and see 2 religious relics for about $30 (but you do get an ice-cream and bottle of water and a free tour of the candy store). The visit to the Big Buddha left impressionable memories for our children 6&8. It\u2019s an amazing view and must see in Hong Kong. The Po Lin Monastery next door was worth a quick visit.If you need to save money, wait to eat until you get back down to the shopping mall at the cable car base. Very western style eateries are there, if that\u2019s your fancy."

            "review": "A great side trip. If you've got the time, or more correctly, make the time, to go to the Tian Tan Buddha in Lantua Island. The largest seated outdoor seated bronze Buddha takes 260 steps so ascend but is worth it. It's a commanding view of the island from there. The Ngong Ping Village nearby leading to the Buddha is also a beautiful place to be in. There's lots of restaurants and shops to keep you busy. The Po Lin Monastery is nearby if you're interested to have a look at Buddhism. Adding to the calming experience of Tian Tan is the ways to go. The quickest is via the Ngong Ping 360 Cable car. It takes you through different stages that offers great view of the water, hills and even the Lantau trail that some people choose to take. Another option is to take the bus which also offers breathtaking scenery. if you've got loads of time, taking a different route is best to experience both."
